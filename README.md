# An Investigation of Hallucination in LLM-Based Recommender Systems

The steps to reproduce the experiments are as follows:

## Prerequisites

1. Install required libraries with the following commands:
```
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
pip install openai
pip install transformers
```
2. Put your OpenAI API key into an `openai_api` file in the root directory.

## Data Preprocessing

First, download reviews and metadata of "All_Beauty" and "Movies_and_TV" categories 
from the Amazon Dataset at https://amazon-reviews-2023.github.io/. 
Place the downloaded files in the `data` directory:
```
data/
    All_Beauty.jsonl
    meta_All_Beauty.jsonl
    
    Movies_and_TV.jsonl
    meta_Movies_and_TV.jsonl
```

Run the following command to preprocess the data:

```bash
python preprocess.py
```

This command will produce the following files. For your convenience, we already ran the preprocessing step and 
provided the processed files in the `data` directory.

```
data/
    All_Beauty_processed.jsonl
    meta_All_Beauty_processed.jsonl
    All_Beauty_test_users.txt

    Movies_and_TV_processed.jsonl
    meta_Movies_and_TV_processed.jsonl
    Movies_and_TV_test_users.txt
```

## Profile Creation
To generate user profiles in the directory structure shown below, run `python generate_profile.py`

This step produces profiles in the following directories. For your convenience, we already ran the profile creation step and provided the profiles in the `profiles` directory.
```
profiles/
    beauty/
        iterative/
            user_{id}.json
            ...
        preference_negative/
            ...
        preference_positive/
            ...
        vanilla/
            ...
        vanilla_structured/ 
            ...
    movies/
        iterative/
            ...
        preference_negative/
            ...
        preference_positive/
            ...
        vanilla/
            ...
        vanilla_structured/ 
            ...
```

## Preliminary Experiments on Profile Types
We provide a preliminary experiment comparing aggregate and individual hallucinations in the iterative scheme. To run this analysis on the existing profiles, use `python iterative_type1_hallucination_analysis.py`
This script evaluates how the iterative profile scheme performs at each interaction step (comparing each stepâ€™s profile against user data). The input and output file structures are assumed to be the same as the profile directories illustrated above.
## Type 1 Hallucination Measurement
To compute Type 1 hallucination metrics (ROUGE, BLEU, METEOR, BERTScore, etc.) on each generated profile, run `python type1_hallucination.py`

This step produces measures in the following directories. For your convenience, we already ran the measurement creation step and provided the measurements in the `type_1_eval` directory.
```
type_1_eval/
    beauty/
        iterative/
            metrics.csv
        preference_negative/
            metrics.csv
        preference_positive/
            metrics.csv
        vanilla/
            metrics.csv
        vanilla_structured/
            metrics.csv
    movies/
        iterative/
            metrics.csv
        preference_negative/
            metrics.csv
        preference_positive/
            metrics.csv
        vanilla/
            metrics.csv
        vanilla_structured/
            metrics.csv
```
Here each `metrics.csv` file contains the following fields: 
```
rouge1_f,rouge2_f,rougeL_f,meteor,bleu1,bleu2,bleu3,bleu4,bertscore_precision,bertscore_recall,bertscore_f1,user_id,num_interactions
```

## Recommendation Generation

Run the following command to generate recommendations across all
datasets and profile types:

```bash
cd src
python automate_recommend.py
```

However, we recommend against running `automate_recommend.py` as there might be problems with OpenAI API rate limits if your account is not in a higher tier. An alternative is to
generate recommendations for a specific dataset, profile type, and subset
with the following command:

```bash
cd src
# example: python recommend.py All_Beauty iterative 1
python recommend.py dataset profile_type subset
```
Here `dataset` is either `All_Beauty` or `Movies_and_TV`, `profile_type` is one of `iterative`, `preference_negative`, `preference_positive`, `vanilla`, or `vanilla_structured`, and `subset` is from 1 to 10.

This command will produce the following files. 
For your convenience, we already ran the recommendation generation step 
and provided the recommendations in the `recommendations` directory.

```
recommendations/
    beauty/
        iterative/
            user_{id}.json
            ...
        preference_negative/
            ...
        preference_positive/
            ...
        vanilla/
            ...
        vanilla_structured/ 
            ...
    movies/
        iterative/
            ...
        preference_negative/
            ...
        preference_positive/
            ...
        vanilla/
            ...
        vanilla_structured/ 
            ...
```
Here each `user_{id}.json` file contains the following fields:
```
{
    "candidate": ...
    "binary_pos": ...
    "binary_neg": ...
}
```

## Type 2 Hallucination Measurement

Run the following command to measure type 2 hallucination across all
datasets and profile types:

```bash
cd src
python automate_evaluate_2.py
```

However, we recommend against running `automate_evaluate_2.py` as there might be problems with OpenAI API rate limits if your account is not in a higher tier or if you have limited cuda memory. An alternative is to generate recommendations for a specific dataset, profile type, and subset with the following command:

```bash
cd src
# example: python evaluate_2.py All_Beauty iterative 1
python evaluate_2.py dataset profile_type subset
```

This step produces measures in the following directories. For your convenience, we already ran the measurement step and provided the measurements in the `type_2_eval` directory.
```
type_2_eval/
    beauty/
        iterative/
            metrics.csv
        preference_negative/
            metrics.csv
        preference_positive/
            metrics.csv
        vanilla/
            metrics.csv
        vanilla_structured/
            metrics.csv
    movies/
        iterative/
            metrics.csv
        preference_negative/
            metrics.csv
        preference_positive/
            metrics.csv
        vanilla/
            metrics.csv
        vanilla_structured/
            metrics.csv
```
Here each `metrics.csv` file contains the following fields: 
```
user_id, true_positive,true_negative,accuracy,bertscore_precision,bertscore_recall,bertscore_f1,hit_rate_at_1,hit_rate_at_5,hit_rate_at_10,ndcg_at_1,ndcg_at_5,ndcg_at_10,consistency,nepc
```


## Correlation Measurement

To produce correlation measures, run the following command:

```bash
cd src
python compute_correlation.py
```

For your convenience, we already computed everything and provided the results in the `correlation` directory.

```
correlation/
    beauty/
        iterative/
            type_1_recommendation.csv
            type_1_type_2.csv
            type_2_recommendation.csv
        preference_negative/
            ...
        preference_positive/
            ...
        vanilla/
            ...
        vanilla_structured/
            ...
    movies/
        iterative/
            ...
        preference_negative/
            ...
        preference_positive/
            ...
        vanilla/
            ...
        vanilla_structured/
            ...
```
Here 
- `type_1_recommendation.csv` contains the correlation between type 1 hallucination measures and recommendation quality measures.
- `type_1_type_2.csv` contains the correlation between type 1 hallucination measures and type 2 hallucination measures.
- `type_2_recommendation.csv` contains the correlation between type 2 hallucination measures and recommendation quality measures.
