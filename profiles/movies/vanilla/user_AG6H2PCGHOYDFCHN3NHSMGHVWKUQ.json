You definitely need the DVD.  What this does  is it tones up the muscles in the face and neck. Just like your abs or arms have muscles that can get saggy, so does your face, so this helps tone up the facial muscles, it can help get rid of the saggy chin and help lift the eyes and the corners of the mouth. This comes with 2 DVD's as well as an audio cd.  the 1st DVD that you start with goes into great detail about each exercise to make sure that you are doing them properly after you do that several times and you learn how to do the exercises the right way then you move onto the 2nd DVD which is the same thing but much shorter, it doesn't have all of the instruction, you just quickly move through the exercises and only takes about 15 minutes.  The audio cd is just the audio version of the 2nd dvd so that you can listen to it on the go and do your exercises in the car. So this is a great way to multitask and keep your face in shape. lol\nReview Title: this really works!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2015/04/08\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['David Dobkin'], 'Producers': ['Susan Downey', 'David Dobkin', 'David Gambino'], 'Starring': ['Robert Downey Jr.', 'Robert Duvall', 'Vera Farmiga'], 'Studio': ['Warner Bros.']}\nReview Text: great movie\nReview Title: Five Stars\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2015/06/09\nAverage Rating: 2.9\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['---'], 'Producers': ['John H.

This comes with 2 DVD's as well as an audio cd.  the 1st DVD that you start with goes into great detail about each exercise to make sure that you are doing them properly after you do that several times and you learn how to do the exercises the right way then you move onto the 2nd DVD which is the same thing but much shorter, it doesn't have all of the instruction, you just quickly move through the exercises and only takes about 15 minutes.  The audio cd is just the audio version of the 2nd dvd so that you can listen to it on the go and do your exercises in the car.
