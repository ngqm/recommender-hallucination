With drugs, torture, and constant profanity also in the mix (who knew the ancient Romans dropped so many F-bombs?), this is definitely not a program for the young and impressionable. Nor is it one that's big on nuance; almost without exception, Batiatus and his ilk are depicted as frivolous, depraved, and conniving, while the gladiators and slaves are lowly but noble (not to mention as gloriously muscled and sweaty as your average Chippendales dancer).

Forced into slavery. Reborn as a Gladiator. The classic tale of the Republic\u2019s most infamous rebel comes alive in the graphic and visceral new series,', 'Spartacus: Blood and Sand', '. Torn from his homeland and the woman he loves, Spartacus is condemned to the brutal world of the arena where blood and death are primetime entertainment. But not all battles are fought upon the sands. Treachery, corruption, and the allure of sensual pleasures will constantly test Spartacus. To survive, he must become more than a man. More than a gladiator. He must become a legend.', 'Amazon.com', 'The \"sword and sandals\" genre isn\\'t exactly known for its subtlety and restraint, but even by those standards,', 'Spartacus: Blood and Sand', 'is deliriously, delightfully over the top. Viewers familiar with the 1960 film starring Kirk Douglas and directed by Stanley Kubrick, the best-known version of the Spartacus tale, will recognize the basic outline of the story: a Thracian warrior with a beautiful, loving wife is betrayed by his Roman \"allies\" and forced into slavery, whereupon he distinguishes himself as a gladiator nonpareil and, after enduring countless indignities, leads his brethren and others in a rebellion against their oppressors. But there\\'s a lot more', 'Caligula', 'than Kubrick in the 13 first-season episodes (each a bit less than an hour long) of this Starz television series, which stars Andy Whitfield in the title role and also features Lucy Lawless (', 'Xena: Warrior Princess', \") as the wicked wife of Spartacus's owner. The fight scenes are highly stylized (the entire production seems to have taken a cue from the surreal, painterly look of\", '300', \") but extraordinarily brutal, featuring multiple dismemberments and decapitations amidst seas of slow-motion, CGI-generated blood; a gladiatorial battle in episode 5 pitting Spartacus and his rival-turned-ally Crixus (Manu Bennett) against a monster named Theokoles is definitely not for the squeamish, but that's only one of many such scenes. There's also ample sex and nudity, as the couplings involving various studly gladiators and lustful Roman noblewomen are like salacious combat between Chippendales dancers and Victoria's Secret models. Meanwhile, the personal relationships are the stuff of soap operas, with the Romans in particular depicted as relentlessly decadent, duplicitous, and power-hungry.\", 'If this all sounds outrageously entertaining, it is, though perhaps not for everyone. And although the future of the show (which was executive produced by', 'Spider-Man', 'director Sam Raimi) is in doubt due to Whitfield\\'s ongoing battle with cancer, we\\'ll always have this season to revel in.

It is there that gladiators hone their skills as they prepare for glory and/or death in the arena under the evil eye of Quintus Batiatus (John Hannah), whom', 'Blood and Sand', 'viewers will recognize as the principal villain of that series.

With drugs, torture, and constant profanity also in the mix (who knew the ancient Romans dropped so many F-bombs?), this is definitely not a program for the young and impressionable. Nor is it one that's big on nuance; almost without exception, Batiatus and his ilk are depicted as frivolous, depraved, and conniving, while the gladiators and slaves are lowly but noble (not to mention as gloriously muscled and sweaty as your average Chippendales dancer).

Forced into slavery. Reborn as a Gladiator. The classic tale of the Republic\u2019s most infamous rebel comes alive in the graphic and visceral new series,', 'Spartacus: Blood and Sand', '. Torn from his homeland and the woman he loves, Spartacus is condemned to the brutal world of the arena where blood and death are primetime entertainment. But not all battles are fought upon the sands. Treachery, corruption, and the allure of sensual pleasures will constantly test Spartacus. To survive, he must become more than a man. More than a gladiator. He must become a legend.', 'Amazon.com', 'The \"sword and sandals\" genre isn\\'t exactly known for its subtlety and restraint, but even by those standards,', 'Spartacus: Blood and Sand', 'is deliriously, delightfully over the top. Viewers familiar with the 1960 film starring Kirk Douglas and directed by Stanley Kubrick, the best-known version of the Spartacus tale, will recognize the basic outline of the story: a Thracian warrior with a beautiful, loving wife is betrayed by his Roman \"allies\" and forced into slavery, whereupon he distinguishes himself as a gladiator nonpareil and, after enduring countless indignities, leads his brethren and others in a rebellion against their oppressors. But there\\'s a lot more', 'Caligula', 'than Kubrick in the 13 first-season episodes (each a bit less than an hour long) of this Starz television series, which stars Andy Whitfield in the title role and also features Lucy Lawless (', 'Xena: Warrior Princess', \") as the wicked wife of Spartacus's owner. The fight scenes are highly stylized (the entire production seems to have taken a cue from the surreal, painterly look of\", '300', \") but extraordinarily brutal, featuring multiple dismemberments and decapitations amidst seas of slow-motion, CGI-generated blood; a gladiatorial battle in episode 5 pitting Spartacus and his rival-turned-ally Crixus (Manu Bennett) against a monster named Theokoles is definitely not for the squeamish, but that's only one of many such scenes. There's also ample sex and nudity, as the couplings involving various studly gladiators and lustful Roman noblewomen are like salacious combat between Chippendales dancers and Victoria's Secret models. Meanwhile, the personal relationships are the stuff of soap operas, with the Romans in particular depicted as relentlessly decadent, duplicitous, and power-hungry.\", 'If this all sounds outrageously entertaining, it is, though perhaps not for everyone. And although the future of the show (which was executive produced by', 'Spider-Man', 'director Sam Raimi) is in doubt due to Whitfield\\'s ongoing battle with cancer, we\\'ll always have this season to revel in.

Loyalties will be tested, lives shattered, and battles waged in this thrilling prequel to', 'Spartacus: Blood and Sand', '.', 'Amazon.com', 'The title is misleading--there is no Spartacus to be found here--but little matter, as', 'Gods of the Arena', 'is a prime example of making lemonade from lemons. Faced with the unavailability of Andy Whitfield, star of', 'Spartacus: Blood and Sand', ', due to a recurrence of cancer, the folks at Starz chose to go ahead without him and create a prequel, a resourceful way of buying some time until a new Spartacus could be found while employing several actors already under contract. The focus throughout these six episodes is on the house of Batiatus. It is there that gladiators hone their skills as they prepare for glory and/or death in the arena under the evil eye of Quintus Batiatus (John Hannah), whom', 'Blood and Sand', 'viewers will recognize as the principal villain of that series. The younger Batiatus, already blindly ambitious, wants to make his mark in the gladiator biz, aided by his sexy, scheming wife, Lucretia (Lucy Lawless), and her licentious friend Gaia (Jaime Murray)--and they have just the warrior to do it with in Gannicus (Dustin Clare), a preening stud described by one show exec as \"Han Solo meets Achilles.\" There are, of course, numerous obstacles, ranging from Batiatus\\'s own father to various rival gladiatorial operations. But really, who cares about plotting when a show has as much sex and violence, usually directly juxtaposed, as this one? True to the', 'Blood and Sand', \"precedent, every episode offers a steady parade of gratuitous, risibly over-the-top beheadings and other mayhem, much of it lovingly shot in slow motion, along with ample nudity (some of it full-frontal) and sex (all of it soft-core). With drugs, torture, and constant profanity also in the mix (who knew the ancient Romans dropped so many F-bombs?), this is definitely not a program for the young and impressionable. Nor is it one that's big on nuance; almost without exception, Batiatus and his ilk are depicted as frivolous, depraved, and conniving, while the gladiators and slaves are lowly but noble (not to mention as gloriously muscled and sweaty as your average Chippendales dancer). But this isn't a documentary--it's entertainment, and on that level,\", 'Gods of the Arena', 'totally works.', '--Sam Graham']\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Sam Raimi, Peter Mensah, Robert Tapert, Steven S.

Forced into slavery. Reborn as a Gladiator. The classic tale of the Republic\u2019s most infamous rebel comes alive in the graphic and visceral new series,', 'Spartacus: Blood and Sand', '. Torn from his homeland and the woman he loves, Spartacus is condemned to the brutal world of the arena where blood and death are primetime entertainment. But not all battles are fought upon the sands. Treachery, corruption, and the allure of sensual pleasures will constantly test Spartacus. To survive, he must become more than a man. More than a gladiator. He must become a legend.', 'Amazon.com', 'The \"sword and sandals\" genre isn\\'t exactly known for its subtlety and restraint, but even by those standards,', 'Spartacus: Blood and Sand', 'is deliriously, delightfully over the top. Viewers familiar with the 1960 film starring Kirk Douglas and directed by Stanley Kubrick, the best-known version of the Spartacus tale, will recognize the basic outline of the story: a Thracian warrior with a beautiful, loving wife is betrayed by his Roman \"allies\" and forced into slavery, whereupon he distinguishes himself as a gladiator nonpareil and, after enduring countless indignities, leads his brethren and others in a rebellion against their oppressors. But there\\'s a lot more', 'Caligula', 'than Kubrick in the 13 first-season episodes (each a bit less than an hour long) of this Starz television series, which stars Andy Whitfield in the title role and also features Lucy Lawless (', 'Xena: Warrior Princess', \") as the wicked wife of Spartacus's owner. The fight scenes are highly stylized (the entire production seems to have taken a cue from the surreal, painterly look of\", '300', \") but extraordinarily brutal, featuring multiple dismemberments and decapitations amidst seas of slow-motion, CGI-generated blood; a gladiatorial battle in episode 5 pitting Spartacus and his rival-turned-ally Crixus (Manu Bennett) against a monster named Theokoles is definitely not for the squeamish, but that's only one of many such scenes. There's also ample sex and nudity, as the couplings involving various studly gladiators and lustful Roman noblewomen are like salacious combat between Chippendales dancers and Victoria's Secret models. Meanwhile, the personal relationships are the stuff of soap operas, with the Romans in particular depicted as relentlessly decadent, duplicitous, and power-hungry.\", 'If this all sounds outrageously entertaining, it is, though perhaps not for everyone. And although the future of the show (which was executive produced by', 'Spider-Man', 'director Sam Raimi) is in doubt due to Whitfield\\'s ongoing battle with cancer, we\\'ll always have this season to revel in.
