From drug runners to dambreakers to demented businessmen, there's no one who can hide from the Airwolf team's high-tech gadgetry and fighting power.

Vincent, then 40 years old, was still a year or two away from ruining his career with substance abuse problems, but his work here is hardly of Emmy-winning caliber; indeed, it's a lazy performance pretty much devoid of emotional resonance. Borgnine, on the other hand, is always reliable, but even the former Oscar winner (in 1955, for\", 'Marty', \") can't overcome\", 'Airwolf', \"'s procession of cardboard characters (especially the villains) and credulity-challenging scripts, which find our heroes traveling to a Laotian prison camp, battling nuclear terrorists in California, rescuing the president of a South American banana republic, investigating a religious cult, fending off jungle cats kept on a Texas hunting ranch, and saving a country singer from the nefarious machinations of her manager-husband, among other silliness. In fairness, creator-executive producer Donald Bellisario (who also brought us\", 'Magnum, P.I.', ',', 'Quantum Leap', ', and', 'JAG', ') and his team make an effort to inject a human element; there\\'s an episode in which Dominic is arrested for murdering his faithless wife, and a couple that find the guilt-ridden Hawke searching for his brother, Saint John (pronounced \"Sinjin\"), who was presumed lost during the Vietnam War when Stringfellow left him in the jungle. What\\'s more, considering its relatively ancient pedigree, technology-wise, the effects work isn\\'t bad, and there are some cool moments when the Airwolf helicopter does what it does best (i.e., blow stuff up).', \"It's unlikely that anyone will fondly look back at\", 'Airwolf', \"as one of television's finest moments. That doesn't mean that this five-disc set containing all 22 episodes from the series' second season (1984-85) won't find an audience eager to re-live the adventures of a super high-tech helicopter and the renegade flyboy who pilots it (heck, even\", 'Knight Rider', \", featuring David Hasselhoff and his talking car, has its adherents).
