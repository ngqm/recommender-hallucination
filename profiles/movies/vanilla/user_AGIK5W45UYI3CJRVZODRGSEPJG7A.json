Michael Douglas and Val Kilmer star in this tense, terrific and true adventure set in 1896 East Africa. There, two lions on man-eating rampage have shut down the construction of a railway. The beasts hunt together, showing no fear of man or fire. What's more, they're killing for sport rather than for food-and they have an almost supernatural knack for knowing what traps await them. Big-game hunter Remington (Douglas) and construction engineer Patterson (Kilmer) set out to stop these unstoppable monsters. But, in this astonishing tale of man against beast, the hunters become the hunted.\", 'Amazon.com', \"Val Kilmer stars as Lt. Col. John Patterson, a 19th-century Irish engineer drafted by Britain's railroad bosses to build a trestle bridge over an African river, thus expanding the empire a tiny bit more.

But morale sinks when a pair of unstoppable big cats devour more men and destroy the project. Along comes an Ahab-like, expatriate American hunter (Michael Douglas) to help Patterson face the almost preternatural powers of the two killers.

Sally Field - in an Emmy Award winning and career-turning performance - portrays Sybil, a woman suffering from multiple personality disorder who develops over 16 distinct personalities in order to cope and escape haunting memories of her harrowing childhood. Joanne Woodward plays the understanding and compassionate psychiatrist that helps Sybil confront her horrific past and eliminate her demons.', ']]>', 'Amazon.com', 'The word \"landmark\" is fairly used in the case of', 'Sybil', \": this 1976 TV movie brought new frankness to television, it raised the quality bar for the made-for-television movie, and it utterly changed the career of a future Oscar-winning actress. The film was based on the bestselling nonfiction book about a multiple-personality patient and her exhaustive therapy. It opens with a brilliant series of scenes that suggest how a young woman named Sybil (Sally Field) experiences unexplained blackouts, which brings her to the attention of a psychiatrist, Dr. Wilbur (Joanne Woodward). The film unfolds around the searching therapy sessions, laced with flashbacks to Sybil's toxic childhood. There's also a tentative romance between the lonely Sybil and a manchild (Brad Davis) who lives across the alley. Most notably, of course, there are the appearances of Sybil's alternate personalities, who express her strangled emotional life. Stewart Stern's sensitive script seems to flow organically from one scene to the next, and director Daniel Petrie frequently allows the camera to observe the acting acrobatics in long, challenging takes.\", 'Woodward, who won an Oscar for playing a multiple-personality patient in', 'The Three Faces of Eve', ', is all nurturing warmth as the steadfast doctor. But really this film was a sober coming-out party for Sally Field, who astonished viewers at the time by erasing all memories of', 'Gidget', 'and', 'The Flying Nun', \", the bubblegum roles she'd mostly been known for. Field's work is anguished but non-actor-y, and despite the character's hidden personalities, she seems as clear as day in her performance. The production won four Emmys, not surprisingly including nods for Field, Stern, and Outstanding Special (Drama).\", 'The 187-minute movie takes up one disc; the second disc has informative featurettes about the making of the film.', 'Examining Sybil', \"is an absorbing hour-long documentary with comments from Field and Woodward, as well as executive producer Peter Dunne. It is dominated by the spellbinding storytelling of Stewart Stern, who developed the screenplay by spending time with the real Dr. Wilbur and listening to tapes of her sessions with Sybil. His tale of Sally Field's unlikely audition triumph is a small movie in itself.\", 'The Paintings of Sybil', 'presents a generous selection of paintings by the real Sybil (who became a professor of art), along with recollections by one of her friends. Something listed on the DVD cover as \"Sybil Therapy Session\" is misleadingly titled, suggesting some kind of actual footage or transcript of the real Sybil and her treatment; in fact, it\\'s Stewart Stern describing the harrowing process of listening to the doctor\\'s tapes.

Sally Field - in an Emmy Award winning and career-turning performance - portrays Sybil, a woman suffering from multiple personality disorder who develops over 16 distinct personalities in order to cope and escape haunting memories of her harrowing childhood. Joanne Woodward plays the understanding and compassionate psychiatrist that helps Sybil confront her horrific past and eliminate her demons.', ']]>', 'Amazon.com', 'The word \"landmark\" is fairly used in the case of', 'Sybil', \": this 1976 TV movie brought new frankness to television, it raised the quality bar for the made-for-television movie, and it utterly changed the career of a future Oscar-winning actress. The film was based on the bestselling nonfiction book about a multiple-personality patient and her exhaustive therapy. It opens with a brilliant series of scenes that suggest how a young woman named Sybil (Sally Field) experiences unexplained blackouts, which brings her to the attention of a psychiatrist, Dr. Wilbur (Joanne Woodward). The film unfolds around the searching therapy sessions, laced with flashbacks to Sybil's toxic childhood. There's also a tentative romance between the lonely Sybil and a manchild (Brad Davis) who lives across the alley. Most notably, of course, there are the appearances of Sybil's alternate personalities, who express her strangled emotional life. Stewart Stern's sensitive script seems to flow organically from one scene to the next, and director Daniel Petrie frequently allows the camera to observe the acting acrobatics in long, challenging takes.\", 'Woodward, who won an Oscar for playing a multiple-personality patient in', 'The Three Faces of Eve', ', is all nurturing warmth as the steadfast doctor. But really this film was a sober coming-out party for Sally Field, who astonished viewers at the time by erasing all memories of', 'Gidget', 'and', 'The Flying Nun', \", the bubblegum roles she'd mostly been known for. Field's work is anguished but non-actor-y, and despite the character's hidden personalities, she seems as clear as day in her performance. The production won four Emmys, not surprisingly including nods for Field, Stern, and Outstanding Special (Drama).\", 'The 187-minute movie takes up one disc; the second disc has informative featurettes about the making of the film.', 'Examining Sybil', \"is an absorbing hour-long documentary with comments from Field and Woodward, as well as executive producer Peter Dunne.

His tale of Sally Field's unlikely audition triumph is a small movie in itself.\", 'The Paintings of Sybil', 'presents a generous selection of paintings by the real Sybil (who became a professor of art), along with recollections by one of her friends. Something listed on the DVD cover as \"Sybil Therapy Session\" is misleadingly titled, suggesting some kind of actual footage or transcript of the real Sybil and her treatment; in fact, it\\'s Stewart Stern describing the harrowing process of listening to the doctor\\'s tapes.

It turns out that Aunt Opal is far from your average aunt; she's actually pretty cool and she's full of surprises that, when mixed with Judy's natural passion for adventure and action, might just yield some very unexpected results.

Sally Field - in an Emmy Award winning and career-turning performance - portrays Sybil, a woman suffering from multiple personality disorder who develops over 16 distinct personalities in order to cope and escape haunting memories of her harrowing childhood. Joanne Woodward plays the understanding and compassionate psychiatrist that helps Sybil confront her horrific past and eliminate her demons.', ']]>', 'Amazon.com', 'The word \"landmark\" is fairly used in the case of', 'Sybil', \": this 1976 TV movie brought new frankness to television, it raised the quality bar for the made-for-television movie, and it utterly changed the career of a future Oscar-winning actress. The film was based on the bestselling nonfiction book about a multiple-personality patient and her exhaustive therapy. It opens with a brilliant series of scenes that suggest how a young woman named Sybil (Sally Field) experiences unexplained blackouts, which brings her to the attention of a psychiatrist, Dr. Wilbur (Joanne Woodward). The film unfolds around the searching therapy sessions, laced with flashbacks to Sybil's toxic childhood. There's also a tentative romance between the lonely Sybil and a manchild (Brad Davis) who lives across the alley. Most notably, of course, there are the appearances of Sybil's alternate personalities, who express her strangled emotional life. Stewart Stern's sensitive script seems to flow organically from one scene to the next, and director Daniel Petrie frequently allows the camera to observe the acting acrobatics in long, challenging takes.\", 'Woodward, who won an Oscar for playing a multiple-personality patient in', 'The Three Faces of Eve', ', is all nurturing warmth as the steadfast doctor. But really this film was a sober coming-out party for Sally Field, who astonished viewers at the time by erasing all memories of', 'Gidget', 'and', 'The Flying Nun', \", the bubblegum roles she'd mostly been known for. Field's work is anguished but non-actor-y, and despite the character's hidden personalities, she seems as clear as day in her performance. The production won four Emmys, not surprisingly including nods for Field, Stern, and Outstanding Special (Drama).\", 'The 187-minute movie takes up one disc; the second disc has informative featurettes about the making of the film.', 'Examining Sybil', \"is an absorbing hour-long documentary with comments from Field and Woodward, as well as executive producer Peter Dunne. It is dominated by the spellbinding storytelling of Stewart Stern, who developed the screenplay by spending time with the real Dr. Wilbur and listening to tapes of her sessions with Sybil. His tale of Sally Field's unlikely audition triumph is a small movie in itself.\", 'The Paintings of Sybil', 'presents a generous selection of paintings by the real Sybil (who became a professor of art), along with recollections by one of her friends. Something listed on the DVD cover as \"Sybil Therapy Session\" is misleadingly titled, suggesting some kind of actual footage or transcript of the real Sybil and her treatment; in fact, it\\'s Stewart Stern describing the harrowing process of listening to the doctor\\'s tapes.

Feisty, fearless Judy Moody is looking forward to the most super-duper, double-rare summer vacation ever. The trouble is, her parents are called out of town and her BFFs are going away with their own families. That leaves Judy trapped at home with her pesky brother Stink under the watchful eye of Aunt Opal (Heather Graham). But with a little playful planning - and a lot of imagination - Judy turns a snoresville summer into the way-not-boring adventure of a lifetime!', 'Amazon.com', 'Based on the Judy Moody books by Megan McDonald,', 'Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer', \"is about a third-grade girl with big ideas for an exciting summer full of dares, scares, and thrills with her three best friends. Judy's carefully crafted plans for a summer-long thrill contest are quickly dashed when she discovers that two of her friends, Rocky and Amy, are going away for the summer, and she'll be left at home with second-best friend Frank Pearl and her brother Stink. Things get even worse when her parents inform her that they're headed to California and are leaving her and Stink under the care of their Aunt Opal, whom Judy's never even met. It turns out that Aunt Opal is far from your average aunt; she's actually pretty cool and she's full of surprises that, when mixed with Judy's natural passion for adventure and action, might just yield some very unexpected results. The film does a good job of preserving the feel and attitude of the Judy Moody character with her frequent flights of fancy, but its brief segments of animation, presumably intended to mirror the cartoonish illustrations that pepper the books, seem somewhat abrupt and awkward. Kids ages 7 to 10 will find laughs and adventure in this 91-minute film, but it's definitely not aimed at older kids or adults, who will find it simply adequate.\", '--Tami Horiuchi']\nAverage Rating: 4.6\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Kids & Family', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Color, Dolby, Dubbed, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Jordana Beatty, Heather Graham, John Schultz', 'Language': 'English', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 31 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.85:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG (Parental Guidance Suggested)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.6 x 5.4 x 7.5 inches; 2.72 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'FOXS2281293DVD', 'Director': 'John Schultz', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Color, Dolby, Dubbed, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Run time': '1 hour and 31 minutes', 'Release date': 'October 11, 2011', 'Actors': 'Heather Graham, Jordana Beatty', 'Dubbed': 'French', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish', 'Studio': 'Relativity Media', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: My granddaughter loves these books and reads them faster than we can buy them.\nReview Title: Great books\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2016/09/17\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Michael Smith', 'Anton Cropper', 'Christopher Misiano', 'Kevin Bray', 'Roger Kumble', 'Silver Tree', 'John Scott', 'Cherie Nowlan', 'Gabriel Macht', 'Patrick J.
