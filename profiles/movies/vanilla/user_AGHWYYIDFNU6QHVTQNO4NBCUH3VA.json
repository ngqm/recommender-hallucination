Centering around a tight-knit group of lesbians in Los Angeles, this drama was far removed from its working-class male counterpart in both style and content. While the men of', 'QAF', 'enjoyed a fabulous if melodramatic life on the middle-class streets of Pittsburgh, the women of', 'The L Word', 'lived it up in sunny California, with gorgeous houses, glamorous careers, and sexy wardrobes. Ironically, though,', 'The L Word', 'adhered more to the everyday drama of ensemble shows like', 'thirtysomething', 'than the soap opera antics of', 'QAF', ', and the results were surprisingly heartfelt and effective, appropriately stylish but never over the top. There was plenty of room for titillation, but creator Ilene Chaiken fashioned from the start a show centered on characters and not just sex, aiming for the heart rather than... well, other places.', 'The L Word', \"focused primarily on committed couple Bette (Jennifer Beals) and Tina (Laurel Holloman), a former power-career duo who've decided to have a baby; however, artificial insemination and the changing dynamics of their relationship throw their previously happy existence off-kilter. Within their orbit are spunky journalist Alice (Leisha Hailey), sultry hairdresser Shane (Katherine Moenning), closeted pro tennis player Dana (Erin Daniels), and espresso bar owner Marina (Karina Lombard) who, in the show's most polarizing storyline, bedded the seemingly straight Jenny (Mia Kirschner) and shook up her heterosexual world. Jenny's am-I-straight-or-not? kvetching frustrated both her fianc\u00e9 (Eric Mabius) and many viewers, who were alternately irritated and intrigued by her inability to decide one way or the other. But Jenny's weakness was part of\", 'The L Word', \"'s strength: in exploring many sides of many issues, both domestic and political, it never came up with an easy answer for any of them, making the show all that more fascinating--and compulsively watchable.\", '--Mark Englehart', 'Season Two', \"Once a series has broken new ground, where does it go from there? Showtime's\", 'The L Word', \", concerning the relationships of a community of lesbian Los Angelenos, turned heads with its smart, funny writing and fully realized characters. Season Two offers more of the same, with some notable guest stars and experiments in narrative and music. This season, Jenny (Mia Kirshner) fully embraces her sexuality as her ex-husband/roomie (Eric Mabius) departs and voyeuristic documentary filmmaker Mark (Eric Lively) and womanchaser Shane (Katherine Moennig) move in. Shane and Jenny struggle good-heartedly over the affections of new character Carmen (Sarah Shahi), who isn't given much to do plot-wise apart from occasionally spinning records and serving as one corner of the love triangle. Bette (Jennifer Beals) and Tina (Laurel Holloman) start the season on the rocks due to Bette's infidelity; the introduction of the one-dimensionally nasty Helena Peabody (Rachel Shelley) causes further friction between Bette and Tina while playing havoc with Bette's curatorial career. Meanwhile, Dana (Erin Daniels) and Alice (Leisha Hailey) go from being best friends to being a whole lot more, providing some of the most touching scenes of the season. Kit (Pam Grier) takes on The Planet, the seeming center of LA's lesbian universe, converting it into a nightclub where, conveniently, guest-starring bands can play.\", \"Strong points of the season include Bette and Kit confronting the death of their father (the superb Ossie Davis) and Shane's new job as a gopher for a high-powered Hollywood producer (the equally superb Camryn Manheim). Less strong are the distracting, neo-expressionistic passages meant to be glimpses into Jenny's creative mind and the interminable use of the series' theme song--re-interpreted in a number of genres--to the point of distraction. Mark's voyeurism, which crosses all sorts of boundaries as he installs hidden cameras around the house, is a brilliant way to challenge male viewers who may tune in just to TiVo their way to the sex scenes. That said, the arc of that particular story grows increasingly far-fetched as Mark somehow avoids criminal prosecution and instead endures the horrible fate of having Jenny refuse his offer of coffee and a muffin. Despite its flaws,\", 'The L Word', 'is a show that deserves to be cheered on, not for its politics, but for the skillful way it conveys complex human entanglements with sensitivity.', '--Ryan Boudinot', 'Season Three', \"The third season of Showtime's\", 'The L Word', \"is all about transitions. The season opens with Alice Pieszecki (Leisha Hailey) coping with her between-seasons break-up with Dana Fairbanks (Erin Daniels), who is herself headed for an even heavier series of transitions. Kit Porter (Pam Grier) both falls in love with a younger man and discovers she is going through menopause. Shane (Katherine Moennig), who spent much of the first two seasons of the show hopping from bed to bed, finds herself more or less committed to Latina deejay Carmen (Sarah Shahi). And the second season's resident villain, Helena Peabody (Rachel Shelley), becomes embroiled in a sexual harassment case that leaves her ultimately looking like the victim. As with previous seasons,\", 'The L Word', \"gets all hot and bothered with various seductions filmed to sometimes jarring music on the soundtrack, but it's the day-to-day foibles and celebrations of Los Angeles's lesbian community that keep the show interesting. Newcomer Moira/Max (Daniela Sea) begins the process of gender reassignment, making for some curious situations with potential employers. Bette (Jennifer Beals) and Tina (Laurel Holloman) begin to drift apart when Tina lands a big movie studio job and starts feeling attracted to men, leading to a custody battle over their baby daughter. Where\", 'The L Word', 'starts getting preachy and obvious is in the opening flashback sequences. When these vignettes refer to current characters of the show, they make sense; when they depict situations meant to underline how queer identity has evolved over the years, they seem politically overloaded.', 'The L Word', \"works intelligently through its characters' concerns without having to resort to such direct appeals for tolerance. Its strength isn't in making lesbian culture appear more mainstream, but in making us care and identify with these women's struggles, regardless of our sexual orientation.\", '--Ryan Boudinot', 'Season Four', 'If the third season was marked by transitions,', 'The L Word', \"'s fourth concerns growing up--or trying to, at any rate. Shane (Katherine Moennig) becomes her brother Shay's guardian, Bette (Jennifer Beals) and Tina (Laurel Holloman) stop fighting over their daughter Angelica, and Bette's new boss, Phyllis (a very game Cybill Shepherd), decides it's time to embrace her true nature. So, after 25 years of marriage (Bruce Davison plays her husband), Chancellor Kroll comes out of the closet--and sets her sights on Alice (Leisha Hailey). For all the inclusiveness, Max (Daniela Sea), still remains on the margins. Dumped by Jenny (Mia Kirshner) the year before, Max continues to share her apartment while acclimating to life as a man.\", \"For those who felt season three was too dark, four offers a welcome corrective. There's still plenty of angst--Jenny's memoir meets with a few negative notices (Heather Matarazzo's journalist pens the harshest critique) and Helena (Rachel Shelley) learns to live without Mommy's money--but there are plenty of moving moments to compensate (most revolving around Shane and Shay). New additions also arrive to shake things up, like Marlee Matlin as an artist who helps Bette to broaden her horizons, Kristanna Loken as a single mother with a yen for Shane, and Rose Rollins as an Iraq War veteran with whom Alice has a tryst (leading to a well intentioned, if heavy-handed message about how even liberals should support the troops). As in seasons past, the directorial line-up impresses as much as the acting talent, and includes Oscar winner Marleen Gorris (\", \"Antonia's Line\", ') and playwright Mois\u00e9s Kaufman (', 'The Laramie Project', '). Since creator Ilene Chaiken makes most special features, like deleted scenes, available online, this set offers few extras, other than biographies, a photo gallery, and episodes of', 'The Tudors', 'and', 'Californication', '.', '--Kathleen C. Fennessy', 'Season Five', 'In a clever move, the producers of', 'The L Word', 'use season five to revisit the origins of their own creation. After Jenny (Mia Kirshner) sets out to direct the silver-screen edition of her novel,', 'Lez Girls', ', she enters a parallel world populated by actors playing thinly-veiled versions of the central cast (in a typical Jenny move, she sleeps with the star who portrays \"Jesse\"). This post-modern plotline brings newcomers up to speed, while offering early-adapters new perspectives on the past. Naturally, the shoot doesn\\'t go smoothly. When the increasingly self-absorbed Jenny hires adoring fan Adele (', 'ER', \"'s Malaya Rivera Drew) as her assistant, events take on\", 'All About Eve', 'overtones. Since Jenny is turning her life into a movie, it only makes sense for the two to bleed into each other. In other developments, Tina (Laurel Holloman) and Bette (Jennifer Beals) consider reconciliation, Helena (Rachel Shelley) does time in prison, Alice (Leisha Hailey) takes her penchant for gossip too far, Tasha (Rose Rollins) fights to stay in the military, and Shane (Katherine Moennig), a dead ringer for Warren Beatty in', 'Shampoo', \", rejoins the ranks of the single, only to fall for straight girl Molly (Cybill Shepherd's daughter, Clementine Ford).\", 'In a more melodramatic, but equally entertaining move, Dawn Denbo (Elizabeth Keener), proprietor of new hotspot SheBar makes life hell for the Planet, but Kit (Pam Grier) and her loyal clientele refuse to go down without a fight--even if they don\\'t offer \"Lesbian Turkish Oil Wrestling.\" Aside from the fact that Max (Daniela Sea) continues to get short shrift,', 'The L Word', \"'s fifth year proves the show has more than a little lusty and gutsy life left in it, and was renewed for a sixth season.

Led by the wise Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon), a crack investigator with no qualms about bending the rules to find his answers, the team takes on cases involving terrorism, murder, espionage, and international arms smuggling. Gibbs is aided by homicide detective Anthony Dinozzo (Michael Weatherly), forensic scientist Abby Sciuto (Pauley Perrette), medical examiner Dr. Donald \"Ducky\" Mallard (Davi McCallum), computer expert Timothy McGee (Sean Murray), and department head Jennifer Shepard (Lauren Holly). This collection presents the series fifth season, including a shocking season finale that is sure to shake up the unit.

Audio: 5.1 Surround Stereo English Running Time: 835 minutes.', 'Amazon.com', 'Describing season four of', 'NCIS', 'as \"the season of secrets,\" executive producer Shane Brennan suggests that season five (offered here with 18 episodes, including a two-part finale, on five discs) is \"the season of answers.\" For the most part, that\\'s true--but at season\\'s end, loyal viewers are likely to be thrown for a loop by the death of a major character and a startling set of changes bound to have a profound effect on the show\\'s future. Picking up where the previous year left off, this new batch jumps right in with a continuation of Special Agent Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon) and company\\'s pursuit of notorious international arms dealer La Grenouille (\"The Frog,\" played by Armand Assante), whom NCIS director Jenny Shepard (Lauren Holly) is particularly keen on taking down--a quest that\\'s complicated by the fact that the bad guy is a CIA asset, and by Agent Anthony DiNozzo\\'s (Michael Weatherly) love affair with La Grenouille\\'s daughter. That storyline, barely touched on thereafter, is resolved in the 14th episode, \"Internal Affairs.\" Meanwhile, the NCIS crew is distracted by an array of other cases, most of them involving murder. Of particular interest are several episodes related to Iraq and the War on Terror: a Naval officer of Syrian descent who\\'s suspected of being an Al Qaeda mole is murdered seconds after Gibbs talks him out of jumping off a building ledge; a Marine who\\'s having a violent bout of post-traumatic stress after returning from the Mideast turns out to be far worse off than that; Medical Examiner Donald \"Ducky\" Mallard (David McCallum) refuses to conduct an autopsy because of the deceased\\'s Muslim beliefs.', \"There's no doubt that\", 'NCIS', \"is slick, entertaining prime-time television in every respect: writing, acting, production values, music, and so on. Still, one's appreciation of the show largely depends on the characters' likeability, and that's very much a matter of taste. Gibbs may be a chick magnet, with four former wives and a past relationship with Shepard to prove it, but he's also a taciturn fellow with horrible social skills. DiNozzo's funny and insouciant, but his smugness and incessant razzing of computer nerd Timothy McGee (Sean Murray) soon becomes tiresome, while Shepard is steely and simply unlikeable (the most appealing characters are arguably McCallum's Mallard and Pauley Perrette's mouthy Abby Sciuto, the goth-like forensic expert).

Unfortunately, lead investigator Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon) has retired to Mexico. But since Harmon is the star of the show, Gibbs returns to the United States to help out his colleague. While most of his former team is happy, Tony DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly) has mixed feelings (During Gibbs' absence, DiNozzo became the de facto head of the team, and going back to being Gibbs' underling doesn't sit well with the usually easygoing special agent.).

And while other cast members may come and go, his presence makes even some of the weaker storylines forgivable. In general, this season--which originally aired from 2006 to 2007--is full of well-developed plot lines that drive each episode along at a good pace. But there are some subplots that are trite: When agent Timothy McGee (Sean Murray) reveals that that book he's writing is based on his co-workers, it's not much of a reveal. Also, the serial-killer storyline in this season overstays its welcome by at least one episode. As NCIS director Jennifer Shepard, Lauren Holly makes a sometimes unlikable character come to life, especially when Shepard's motives are questionable. As the show's name suggests, the majority of crimes featured revolve around military personnel, but some of the show's best moments occur when they touch of the personal relationships between the characters.

Nathan Fillion plays Rick Castle, a bestselling author of pulpy crime novels who\\'s called in to assist the New York police when a serial killer begins committing copycat murders based on situations in his books. Castle helps crack the case, then decides to kill off his longtime character and create a new one, named \"Nikki Heat,\" and research her by shadowing Det. Kate Beckett (Stana Katic). Much to her irritation, he pulls strings with the mayor\\'s office to embed himself in the department, and helps her solve a wide range of whodunits, including a woman drowned in a bath tub full of motor oil, another frozen and suspended at a construction site, and a corpse stuck in a clothes dryer. To alleviate the grim proceedings, Fillion is in his element as the wisecracking Castle, while adding another ray of sunshine is Castle\\'s impossibly likeable teenage daughter, Alexis (Molly Quinn), who lives with Castle and his mom (Susan Sullivan), a former Broadway star. Castle\\'s circle of poker buddies includes veteran TV writer-producer Stephen J. Cannell and author James Patterson playing themselves. Like many (or most) he-and-she cop shows, there\\'s an element of \"Will they or won\\'t they\u2026?\", but the beautiful Katic keeps Castle at bay by radiating cool. Clearly she\\'s a woman who wants to separate herself from her emotionally draining and predominantly male job, so it makes it all the more enjoyable when she momentarily steps out of that mode, such as an impromptu appearance at his book signing.

Showtime's\", 'The L Word', \", concerning the relationships of a community of lesbian Los Angelenos, turned heads with its smart, funny writing and fully realized characters. Season Two offers more of the same, with some notable guest stars and experiments in narrative and music.

Meanwhile, Dana (Erin Daniels) and Alice (Leisha Hailey) go from being best friends to being a whole lot more, providing some of the most touching scenes of the season.

Mark's voyeurism, which crosses all sorts of boundaries as he installs hidden cameras around the house, is a brilliant way to challenge male viewers who may tune in just to TiVo their way to the sex scenes. That said, the arc of that particular story grows increasingly far-fetched as Mark somehow avoids criminal prosecution and instead endures the horrible fate of having Jenny refuse his offer of coffee and a muffin.

Shane (Katherine Moennig), who spent much of the first two seasons of the show hopping from bed to bed, finds herself more or less committed to Latina deejay Carmen (Sarah Shahi).

As with previous seasons,\", 'The L Word', \"gets all hot and bothered with various seductions filmed to sometimes jarring music on the soundtrack, but it's the day-to-day foibles and celebrations of Los Angeles's lesbian community that keep the show interesting.

Picking up where the previous year left off, this new batch jumps right in with a continuation of Special Agent Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon) and company\\'s pursuit of notorious international arms dealer La Grenouille (\"The Frog,\" played by Armand Assante), whom NCIS director Jenny Shepard (Lauren Holly) is particularly keen on taking down--a quest that\\'s complicated by the fact that the bad guy is a CIA asset, and by Agent Anthony DiNozzo\\'s (Michael Weatherly) love affair with La Grenouille\\'s daughter. That storyline, barely touched on thereafter, is resolved in the 14th episode, \"Internal Affairs.\" Meanwhile, the NCIS crew is distracted by an array of other cases, most of them involving murder. Of particular interest are several episodes related to Iraq and the War on Terror: a Naval officer of Syrian descent who\\'s suspected of being an Al Qaeda mole is murdered seconds after Gibbs talks him out of jumping off a building ledge; a Marine who\\'s having a violent bout of post-traumatic stress after returning from the Mideast turns out to be far worse off than that; Medical Examiner Donald \"Ducky\" Mallard (David McCallum) refuses to conduct an autopsy because of the deceased\\'s Muslim beliefs.', \"There's no doubt that\", 'NCIS', \"is slick, entertaining prime-time television in every respect: writing, acting, production values, music, and so on. Still, one's appreciation of the show largely depends on the characters' likeability, and that's very much a matter of taste. Gibbs may be a chick magnet, with four former wives and a past relationship with Shepard to prove it, but he's also a taciturn fellow with horrible social skills. DiNozzo's funny and insouciant, but his smugness and incessant razzing of computer nerd Timothy McGee (Sean Murray) soon becomes tiresome, while Shepard is steely and simply unlikeable (the most appealing characters are arguably McCallum's Mallard and Pauley Perrette's mouthy Abby Sciuto, the goth-like forensic expert).

As NCIS director Jennifer Shepard, Lauren Holly makes a sometimes unlikable character come to life, especially when Shepard's motives are questionable. As the show's name suggests, the majority of crimes featured revolve around military personnel, but some of the show's best moments occur when they touch of the personal relationships between the characters. All 24 episodes are included in this six-disc box set, which also includes commentaries, a Q&A session with cast members answer fans' questions, and a surprisingly interesting look at the props used on the show.\", '--Jae-Ha Kim']\n{'Genre': 'Action & Adventure/Television, Television', 'Format': 'Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, Subtitled', 'Contributor': 'Mark Harmon', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1), English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround), Unqualified (DTS ES 6.1)', 'Number Of Discs': '6', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'Unrated (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.96 x 5.49 x 7.72 inches; 10.88 Ounces', 'Item model number': '12266', 'Media Format': 'Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, Subtitled', 'Run time': '17 hours and 33 minutes', 'Release date': 'October 23, 2007', 'Actors': 'Mark Harmon', 'Studio': 'Paramount', 'Number of discs': '6'}\nAny NCIS fan will enjoy watching these dvds all over again.

Loaded with provocative banter and a talented cast \"too appealing to resist,\" says Glenn Garvin of the Miami Herald, CASTLE: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON is can\\'t-miss entertainment. Rick Castle is a world-famous crime novelist whose stories come to life when a copycat killer follows his literary blueprint. Enlisted to help the NYPD stay a step ahead of the murderer, Castle realizes working with the police can also supply him with a slew of ideas for his next book. The relationship gets a little more complicated -- and a whole lot more fun -- when he is paired with the attractive Detective Beckett, who doesn\\'t appreciate Castle\\'s unorthodox style. Experience every witty, suspense-filled moment of the original series in this 3-disc DVD collection. Packed with never-before-seen bonus features, including a behind-the-scenes peek at the cast, this addictive series is a killer on DVD!', 'Amazon.com', 'One of the best shows to emerge midway through the 2008-2009 TV season,', 'Castle', 'has a cast and a sense of humor that set it apart from the normal police procedural. Nathan Fillion plays Rick Castle, a bestselling author of pulpy crime novels who\\'s called in to assist the New York police when a serial killer begins committing copycat murders based on situations in his books. Castle helps crack the case, then decides to kill off his longtime character and create a new one, named \"Nikki Heat,\" and research her by shadowing Det. Kate Beckett (Stana Katic). Much to her irritation, he pulls strings with the mayor\\'s office to embed himself in the department, and helps her solve a wide range of whodunits, including a woman drowned in a bath tub full of motor oil, another frozen and suspended at a construction site, and a corpse stuck in a clothes dryer. To alleviate the grim proceedings, Fillion is in his element as the wisecracking Castle, while adding another ray of sunshine is Castle\\'s impossibly likeable teenage daughter, Alexis (Molly Quinn), who lives with Castle and his mom (Susan Sullivan), a former Broadway star. Castle\\'s circle of poker buddies includes veteran TV writer-producer Stephen J. Cannell and author James Patterson playing themselves. Like many (or most) he-and-she cop shows, there\\'s an element of \"Will they or won\\'t they\u2026?\", but the beautiful Katic keeps Castle at bay by radiating cool. Clearly she\\'s a woman who wants to separate herself from her emotionally draining and predominantly male job, so it makes it all the more enjoyable when she momentarily steps out of that mode, such as an impromptu appearance at his book signing. Much to the relief of Fillion fans who feared their man was a show killer after the aborted runs of such shows as', 'Firefly', 'and', 'Drive', ',', 'Castle', 'was renewed for a second, full season.', '--David Horiuchi']\n{'Genre': 'Drama', 'Format': 'Box set, NTSC, Multiple Formats, Color, Subtitled', 'Contributor': 'Molly C.

Centering around a tight-knit group of lesbians in Los Angeles, this drama was far removed from its working-class male counterpart in both style and content. While the men of', 'QAF', 'enjoyed a fabulous if melodramatic life on the middle-class streets of Pittsburgh, the women of', 'The L Word', 'lived it up in sunny California, with gorgeous houses, glamorous careers, and sexy wardrobes. Ironically, though,', 'The L Word', 'adhered more to the everyday drama of ensemble shows like', 'thirtysomething', 'than the soap opera antics of', 'QAF', ', and the results were surprisingly heartfelt and effective, appropriately stylish but never over the top. There was plenty of room for titillation, but creator Ilene Chaiken fashioned from the start a show centered on characters and not just sex, aiming for the heart rather than... well, other places.', 'The L Word', \"focused primarily on committed couple Bette (Jennifer Beals) and Tina (Laurel Holloman), a former power-career duo who've decided to have a baby; however, artificial insemination and the changing dynamics of their relationship throw their previously happy existence off-kilter. Within their orbit are spunky journalist Alice (Leisha Hailey), sultry hairdresser Shane (Katherine Moenning), closeted pro tennis player Dana (Erin Daniels), and espresso bar owner Marina (Karina Lombard) who, in the show's most polarizing storyline, bedded the seemingly straight Jenny (Mia Kirschner) and shook up her heterosexual world. Jenny's am-I-straight-or-not? kvetching frustrated both her fianc\u00e9 (Eric Mabius) and many viewers, who were alternately irritated and intrigued by her inability to decide one way or the other. But Jenny's weakness was part of\", 'The L Word', \"'s strength: in exploring many sides of many issues, both domestic and political, it never came up with an easy answer for any of them, making the show all that more fascinating--and compulsively watchable.\", '--Mark Englehart', 'Season Two', \"Once a series has broken new ground, where does it go from there? Showtime's\", 'The L Word', \", concerning the relationships of a community of lesbian Los Angelenos, turned heads with its smart, funny writing and fully realized characters. Season Two offers more of the same, with some notable guest stars and experiments in narrative and music. This season, Jenny (Mia Kirshner) fully embraces her sexuality as her ex-husband/roomie (Eric Mabius) departs and voyeuristic documentary filmmaker Mark (Eric Lively) and womanchaser Shane (Katherine Moennig) move in. Shane and Jenny struggle good-heartedly over the affections of new character Carmen (Sarah Shahi), who isn't given much to do plot-wise apart from occasionally spinning records and serving as one corner of the love triangle. Bette (Jennifer Beals) and Tina (Laurel Holloman) start the season on the rocks due to Bette's infidelity; the introduction of the one-dimensionally nasty Helena Peabody (Rachel Shelley) causes further friction between Bette and Tina while playing havoc with Bette's curatorial career. Meanwhile, Dana (Erin Daniels) and Alice (Leisha Hailey) go from being best friends to being a whole lot more, providing some of the most touching scenes of the season. Kit (Pam Grier) takes on The Planet, the seeming center of LA's lesbian universe, converting it into a nightclub where, conveniently, guest-starring bands can play.\", \"Strong points of the season include Bette and Kit confronting the death of their father (the superb Ossie Davis) and Shane's new job as a gopher for a high-powered Hollywood producer (the equally superb Camryn Manheim). Less strong are the distracting, neo-expressionistic passages meant to be glimpses into Jenny's creative mind and the interminable use of the series' theme song--re-interpreted in a number of genres--to the point of distraction. Mark's voyeurism, which crosses all sorts of boundaries as he installs hidden cameras around the house, is a brilliant way to challenge male viewers who may tune in just to TiVo their way to the sex scenes. That said, the arc of that particular story grows increasingly far-fetched as Mark somehow avoids criminal prosecution and instead endures the horrible fate of having Jenny refuse his offer of coffee and a muffin. Despite its flaws,\", 'The L Word', 'is a show that deserves to be cheered on, not for its politics, but for the skillful way it conveys complex human entanglements with sensitivity.', '--Ryan Boudinot', 'Season Three', \"The third season of Showtime's\", 'The L Word', \"is all about transitions. The season opens with Alice Pieszecki (Leisha Hailey) coping with her between-seasons break-up with Dana Fairbanks (Erin Daniels), who is herself headed for an even heavier series of transitions. Kit Porter (Pam Grier) both falls in love with a younger man and discovers she is going through menopause. Shane (Katherine Moennig), who spent much of the first two seasons of the show hopping from bed to bed, finds herself more or less committed to Latina deejay Carmen (Sarah Shahi). And the second season's resident villain, Helena Peabody (Rachel Shelley), becomes embroiled in a sexual harassment case that leaves her ultimately looking like the victim. As with previous seasons,\", 'The L Word', \"gets all hot and bothered with various seductions filmed to sometimes jarring music on the soundtrack, but it's the day-to-day foibles and celebrations of Los Angeles's lesbian community that keep the show interesting. Newcomer Moira/Max (Daniela Sea) begins the process of gender reassignment, making for some curious situations with potential employers. Bette (Jennifer Beals) and Tina (Laurel Holloman) begin to drift apart when Tina lands a big movie studio job and starts feeling attracted to men, leading to a custody battle over their baby daughter. Where\", 'The L Word', 'starts getting preachy and obvious is in the opening flashback sequences. When these vignettes refer to current characters of the show, they make sense; when they depict situations meant to underline how queer identity has evolved over the years, they seem politically overloaded.', 'The L Word', \"works intelligently through its characters' concerns without having to resort to such direct appeals for tolerance. Its strength isn't in making lesbian culture appear more mainstream, but in making us care and identify with these women's struggles, regardless of our sexual orientation.\", '--Ryan Boudinot', 'Season Four', 'If the third season was marked by transitions,', 'The L Word', \"'s fourth concerns growing up--or trying to, at any rate. Shane (Katherine Moennig) becomes her brother Shay's guardian, Bette (Jennifer Beals) and Tina (Laurel Holloman) stop fighting over their daughter Angelica, and Bette's new boss, Phyllis (a very game Cybill Shepherd), decides it's time to embrace her true nature. So, after 25 years of marriage (Bruce Davison plays her husband), Chancellor Kroll comes out of the closet--and sets her sights on Alice (Leisha Hailey). For all the inclusiveness, Max (Daniela Sea), still remains on the margins. Dumped by Jenny (Mia Kirshner) the year before, Max continues to share her apartment while acclimating to life as a man.\", \"For those who felt season three was too dark, four offers a welcome corrective. There's still plenty of angst--Jenny's memoir meets with a few negative notices (Heather Matarazzo's journalist pens the harshest critique) and Helena (Rachel Shelley) learns to live without Mommy's money--but there are plenty of moving moments to compensate (most revolving around Shane and Shay). New additions also arrive to shake things up, like Marlee Matlin as an artist who helps Bette to broaden her horizons, Kristanna Loken as a single mother with a yen for Shane, and Rose Rollins as an Iraq War veteran with whom Alice has a tryst (leading to a well intentioned, if heavy-handed message about how even liberals should support the troops). As in seasons past, the directorial line-up impresses as much as the acting talent, and includes Oscar winner Marleen Gorris (\", \"Antonia's Line\", ') and playwright Mois\u00e9s Kaufman (', 'The Laramie Project', '). Since creator Ilene Chaiken makes most special features, like deleted scenes, available online, this set offers few extras, other than biographies, a photo gallery, and episodes of', 'The Tudors', 'and', 'Californication', '.', '--Kathleen C. Fennessy', 'Season Five', 'In a clever move, the producers of', 'The L Word', 'use season five to revisit the origins of their own creation. After Jenny (Mia Kirshner) sets out to direct the silver-screen edition of her novel,', 'Lez Girls', ', she enters a parallel world populated by actors playing thinly-veiled versions of the central cast (in a typical Jenny move, she sleeps with the star who portrays \"Jesse\"). This post-modern plotline brings newcomers up to speed, while offering early-adapters new perspectives on the past. Naturally, the shoot doesn\\'t go smoothly. When the increasingly self-absorbed Jenny hires adoring fan Adele (', 'ER', \"'s Malaya Rivera Drew) as her assistant, events take on\", 'All About Eve', 'overtones. Since Jenny is turning her life into a movie, it only makes sense for the two to bleed into each other. In other developments, Tina (Laurel Holloman) and Bette (Jennifer Beals) consider reconciliation, Helena (Rachel Shelley) does time in prison, Alice (Leisha Hailey) takes her penchant for gossip too far, Tasha (Rose Rollins) fights to stay in the military, and Shane (Katherine Moennig), a dead ringer for Warren Beatty in', 'Shampoo', \", rejoins the ranks of the single, only to fall for straight girl Molly (Cybill Shepherd's daughter, Clementine Ford).\", 'In a more melodramatic, but equally entertaining move, Dawn Denbo (Elizabeth Keener), proprietor of new hotspot SheBar makes life hell for the Planet, but Kit (Pam Grier) and her loyal clientele refuse to go down without a fight--even if they don\\'t offer \"Lesbian Turkish Oil Wrestling.\" Aside from the fact that Max (Daniela Sea) continues to get short shrift,', 'The L Word', \"'s fifth year proves the show has more than a little lusty and gutsy life left in it, and was renewed for a sixth season.

FBI special agent Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz) and forensic anthropologist Dr. Temperance \"Bones\" Brennan (Emily Deschanel) have a complicated relationship that gets stronger over time. The writers have done an admirable job in throwing viewers a few bones to hint at what could be for the pair and this is no more evident than in the season premiere, where Booth is given the OK to return to work and Bones returns from a soul-searching trip to Guatemala. And in the 100th episode (\"The Parts in the Sum of the Whole\"), which Boreanaz directed, the series goes back in time six years to when Booth first met Bones. And it\\'s clear that the two were attracted to each other then, sharing an admiration of solving a case efficiently and correctly. Who knew that decayed bodies could be such a turn-on? There\\'s a lot going on this season, and some of the episodes do fall short. The case revolving around witchcraft doesn\\'t ring true and the quest to ID body parts found in a shark isn\\'t up to par by', 'Bones', 'standards. But overall, the season is a winner.

Picking up where the previous year left off, this new batch jumps right in with a continuation of Special Agent Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon) and company\\'s pursuit of notorious international arms dealer La Grenouille (\"The Frog,\" played by Armand Assante), whom NCIS director Jenny Shepard (Lauren Holly) is particularly keen on taking down--a quest that\\'s complicated by the fact that the bad guy is a CIA asset, and by Agent Anthony DiNozzo\\'s (Michael Weatherly) love affair with La Grenouille\\'s daughter. That storyline, barely touched on thereafter, is resolved in the 14th episode, \"Internal Affairs.\" Meanwhile, the NCIS crew is distracted by an array of other cases, most of them involving murder. Of particular interest are several episodes related to Iraq and the War on Terror: a Naval officer of Syrian descent who\\'s suspected of being an Al Qaeda mole is murdered seconds after Gibbs talks him out of jumping off a building ledge; a Marine who\\'s having a violent bout of post-traumatic stress after returning from the Mideast turns out to be far worse off than that; Medical Examiner Donald \"Ducky\" Mallard (David McCallum) refuses to conduct an autopsy because of the deceased\\'s Muslim beliefs.', \"There's no doubt that\", 'NCIS', \"is slick, entertaining prime-time television in every respect: writing, acting, production values, music, and so on. Still, one's appreciation of the show largely depends on the characters' likeability, and that's very much a matter of taste. Gibbs may be a chick magnet, with four former wives and a past relationship with Shepard to prove it, but he's also a taciturn fellow with horrible social skills. DiNozzo's funny and insouciant, but his smugness and incessant razzing of computer nerd Timothy McGee (Sean Murray) soon becomes tiresome, while Shepard is steely and simply unlikeable (the most appealing characters are arguably McCallum's Mallard and Pauley Perrette's mouthy Abby Sciuto, the goth-like forensic expert).

Also, the serial-killer storyline in this season overstays its welcome by at least one episode.

I like to play them before the season begings to refresh on all the details and twists as well as just to watch on days when TV just won't do it. If you like the TV show and need to catch up they are great. And, if you are like me, and want to introduce others to the series, the dvds make that happen. These will be a set to keep for years to come\nReview Title: Great series\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Castle: Season 1\nReview Date: 2013/09/29\nStore: Nathan Fillion  (Actor),     Stana Katic  (Actor)    Rated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Drama\nProduct Description: ['Product Description', 'Get on the beat with a new hit drama. Loaded with provocative banter and a talented cast \"too appealing to resist,\" says Glenn Garvin of the Miami Herald, CASTLE: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON is can\\'t-miss entertainment. Rick Castle is a world-famous crime novelist whose stories come to life when a copycat killer follows his literary blueprint. Enlisted to help the NYPD stay a step ahead of the murderer, Castle realizes working with the police can also supply him with a slew of ideas for his next book. The relationship gets a little more complicated -- and a whole lot more fun -- when he is paired with the attractive Detective Beckett, who doesn\\'t appreciate Castle\\'s unorthodox style. Experience every witty, suspense-filled moment of the original series in this 3-disc DVD collection. Packed with never-before-seen bonus features, including a behind-the-scenes peek at the cast, this addictive series is a killer on DVD!', 'Amazon.com', 'One of the best shows to emerge midway through the 2008-2009 TV season,', 'Castle', 'has a cast and a sense of humor that set it apart from the normal police procedural. Nathan Fillion plays Rick Castle, a bestselling author of pulpy crime novels who\\'s called in to assist the New York police when a serial killer begins committing copycat murders based on situations in his books. Castle helps crack the case, then decides to kill off his longtime character and create a new one, named \"Nikki Heat,\" and research her by shadowing Det. Kate Beckett (Stana Katic). Much to her irritation, he pulls strings with the mayor\\'s office to embed himself in the department, and helps her solve a wide range of whodunits, including a woman drowned in a bath tub full of motor oil, another frozen and suspended at a construction site, and a corpse stuck in a clothes dryer. To alleviate the grim proceedings, Fillion is in his element as the wisecracking Castle, while adding another ray of sunshine is Castle\\'s impossibly likeable teenage daughter, Alexis (Molly Quinn), who lives with Castle and his mom (Susan Sullivan), a former Broadway star. Castle\\'s circle of poker buddies includes veteran TV writer-producer Stephen J. Cannell and author James Patterson playing themselves. Like many (or most) he-and-she cop shows, there\\'s an element of \"Will they or won\\'t they\u2026?\", but the beautiful Katic keeps Castle at bay by radiating cool. Clearly she\\'s a woman who wants to separate herself from her emotionally draining and predominantly male job, so it makes it all the more enjoyable when she momentarily steps out of that mode, such as an impromptu appearance at his book signing. Much to the relief of Fillion fans who feared their man was a show killer after the aborted runs of such shows as', 'Firefly', 'and', 'Drive', ',', 'Castle', 'was renewed for a second, full season.', '--David Horiuchi']\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Drama', 'Format': 'Box set, NTSC, Multiple Formats, Color, Subtitled', 'Contributor': 'Molly C.

Unlike Bones or Rozzali and Isles, this is a softer TV series and one that lets you build a relationship as the weeks (or dvds) are viewed. BTW, can't say that for the books. Maybe if the books had the same character names as the TV show they may read better. But I was not a fan of book one.\nReview Title: Great TV Series\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Logan\nReview Date: 2017/07/05\nStore: Hugh Jackman  (Actor),     Patrick Stewart  (Actor),     James Mangold  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: Blu-ray\nCategories: Movies & TV, Blu-ray, Movies\nProduct Description: [\"It's the year 2029, and much of the world's mutant population has succumbed to a genocidal, man-made virus.
