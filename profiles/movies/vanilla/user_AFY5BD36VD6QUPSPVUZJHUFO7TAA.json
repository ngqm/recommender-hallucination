I very much enjoy the Original Series, the Next Generation, and Deep Space Nine. I even enjoy reading the novels. However, the Star Trek universe began to sour for me with the arrival of Captain Janeway and the Vulcan who wouldn't stop frowning. I stopped watching Voyager at all in the later seasons and even chose to ignore the series finale entirely. So I had high hopes when Enterprise came out. Those hopes soon tanked, though, starting with the opening credits. Years later, I decided to give this series a second try, seeing as I enjoy most of the other series so much. I came to like the song used for the opening credits in the first two seasons. However, with the exception of a couple of characters, I found most of the people in this cast either thoroughly unlikable or barely developed. Captain Archer struck me as uppity and self-righteous in most episodes in the first couple of seasons, so much so that I sometimes couldn't bear to watch an episode all the way to the end. Then, especially starting in Season 3, he was always angry; he even spoke gruffly to his cute little dog, Porthos, for cryin' out loud. Hoshi Sato seems to me like a whiny brat who has no business on a starship. Poor Mayweather had little or no substance to him at all. Several episodes seemed to have no point, like &#34;Shuttlepod One&#34; and &#34;Two Days and Two Nights&#34; in Season 1. And for anyone concerned with continuity in the Star Trek universe, this series dashes all that to pieces, complete with an appearance by the Ferengi in Season 1 and one by the Borg in Season 2.<br /><br />Variations of Star Trek were on the small screen for fourteen years straight before this series came along and killed the TV franchise dead. It's that bad. I'm convinced it only survived four seasons because of Trekkies who would support any and all things Trek, regardless of the quality (or lack thereof). I hope Enterprise isn't the end of Star Trek on the small screen, but I hope just as fervently that Enterprise's show runners--Berman and Braga--aren't allowed anywhere near the next one.\nReview Title: The Series that Killed Star Trek on the Small Screen\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2015/11/09\nAverage Rating: 4.0\nProduct Details: {'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Reinhard Klooss'], 'Producers': ['Reinhard Klooss', 'Robert Kulzer', 'Martin Moszkowicz', 'Bernhard Thur'], 'Starring': ['Kellan Lutz', 'Spencer Locke', 'Jaime Ray Newman'], 'Studio': ['Lionsgate']}\nReview Text: The animation was pretty good, and so was the story--right up until the end. A very unsatisfactory conclusion that defies logic. I liked that Tarzan communicated mostly by grunting and that the animals didn't talk. If I could, I would give it 2.5 stars, but it's either 3 or 2 stars, and I didn't completely dislike it, so 3 stars it is.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br />Tarzan's vocabulary seemed to make quite a leap when he was reintroduced to other people. The bad guy's assistant was a walking cliche. Even though there is a narrator for most of the movie, any explanation of how the meteorite changed the plants an animals within its realm of influence is glossed over. There is also little rhyme or reason to the disturbances caused by interfering with the meteorite. If the bad guy sent an entire army of people into the heart of the jungle who were presumably killed near the conclusion of the story, why would Jane assume she and Tarzan would now be left in peace? All those people had to have loved ones who would want a search and rescue mission launched, meaning even more people would come to their little piece of paradise. And Jane's father with his piece of rock just happened to escape the catastrophe unscathed in order to do--what exactly?\nReview Title: Pretty Good Animation and Characterization, Spoiled by Gaps in Logic\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Ferris Bueller's Day Off\nReview Date: 2016/04/12\nCategories: Comedy, Joyous, Outlandish, Playful\nProduct Description: ['A high schooler is determined to have a day off from school.']\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['John Hughes'], 'Producers': ['John Hughes'], 'Starring': ['Matthew Broderick', 'Alan Ruck', 'Mia Sara']}\nReview Text: When I was a kid, I loved this movie.

Matt Smith charms from the very beginning, though, starting with his demands of various food items from a young Amelia Pond. Looking back, I'd have to say that Donna Noble is my favorite companion for the simple reason that she was just that--a companion--never once flirting with the Doctor. Also, for someone who thought very little of herself, Donna was pretty smart. Amy gets on my nerves a lot in Series Five, repeatedly taking stupid risks that turn out all right only because she's a character on a TV show. Having Rory around somehow improves things. I'm glad he joins the adventures full time in the sixth series. I also think Steve Moffat and his team made great improvements on the show's score/soundtrack. I had been watching nuWho from the beginning, but never wanted to own a piece of music from the show until Series 5, with the debut of &#34;I Am the Doctor&#34; (&#34;Onwards&#34; is a much shorter form of this piece).<br /><br />Geronimo!!\nReview Title: Bravo, Matt Smith\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2016/05/06\nAverage Rating: 4.9\nProduct Details: {'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Graeme Harper', 'Euros Lyn', 'Jamie Magnus Stone', 'Douglas Mackinnon', 'Rachel Talalay', 'James Strong', 'Charlie Palmer', 'James Hawes', 'Joe Ahearne', 'Toby Haynes'], 'Starring': ['David Tennant', 'Catherine Tate', 'Freema Agyeman'], 'Studio': ['BBC America']}\nReview Text: Donna Noble is, by far, my favorite companion of all the nuWho companions simply because she wanted to see all of time and space with the Doctor, not make out or sleep with him. Catherine Tate, imo, captures a great range of emotion during her run; I think I laughed the most while Donna accompanied the Doctor. But she did grief and indignation very well too. My only complaint, though, is the way Donna is set up to be this all-important figure throughout the multiverse. As far as I know, this is the first time one of the companions is given such a role, and it sets an annoying precedent that is repeated with Clara Oswald. Why can't companions just be ordinary people banging around space and time with the Doctor? Why must they be pivotal to the survival of the universe or the survival of the Doctor? On the whole, I enjoyed the Doctor Donna, and I hope we see more companions like her in attitude in the future.\nReview Title: Tennant and Tate Make a Great Team\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: The Martian\nReview Date: 2016/06/03\nCategories: Science Fiction, Drama, Anxious, Biting\nProduct Description: ['From legendary director Ridley Scott (Alien, Prometheus) comes a gripping tale of human strength and the will to survive, starring Matt Damon as an astronaut stranded on Mars.']\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Ridley Scott'], 'Producers': ['Simon Kinberg', 'Ridley Scott', 'Michael Schaeffer', 'Aditya Sood', 'Mark Huffam'], 'Starring': ['Matt Damon', 'Jessica Chastain', 'Kristen Wiig']}\nReview Text: A review on one site calls this flick &#34;Human Ingenuity: The Movie.&#34; Meh. I think &#34;Cast Away&#34; did that much better. I did not read the book on which this movie was based or read any reviews (critical or otherwise) before I watched &#34;The Martian&#34;. All I had seen was the trailer, and all I knew was that people seemed to love it and praise it to high heaven. So I eagerly anticipated enjoying the movie myself. Man, was this a letdown!<br /><br />Thin or nonexistent characterizations, too many superfluous characters (many of them flat), too much talking, too much switching between sets of characters. I think Jeff Daniels must have gotten botox injections before his scenes, because his face barely moved the entire movie. At one point two characters spend at least a minute debating the tone in which Matt Damon's character had written something along the lines of &#34;Are you kidding me?&#34; I'm serious. That conversation actually took place in the movie.<br /><br />Character A: 'Do you think he meant, &#34;Are you kidding me?&#34; Or was it more like &#34;Are you kidding me?!&#34;'<br />Character B: 'I think it was the first one.'<br /><br />I'm not watching this scene as I type this, so I can't be totally sure that's what they said, but it's close. And it didn't end there! They continued to discuss the possible tone of the message! Are YOU kidding me, movie? Stop wasting my time! This asinine conversation does NOT qualify as humor! The movie bored me and had zero emotional punch. I agree with others who have mentioned how predictable this was, too. That means zero tension, zero suspense, which translates to zero enjoyment. It was pretty, with mostly good SFX; that's IT. I might have found the movie more fascinating if the tagline (and outcome) had been &#34;Left to Die&#34; instead of &#34;Bring Him Home&#34; and the movie was about the recovery of Watney's body and cheery, yet resolute video logs (I dislike the non-word &#34;vlogs&#34;) and not the rescue of Watney himself. I didn't even like the guy.<br /><br />If you find profanity distasteful like I do, you'll be annoyed early and often. You get two f-bombs within the first half hour or so of the movie and more f-bombs are implied later. For me, this did nothing to make Matt Damon's character either sympathetic or heroic. On the back end of the movie, you get a gratuitous, yet creepy CGI visual of Matt Damon's naked back and backside as he walks away from a shower. I'm pretty sure I would have been able to tell that the character had lost a lot of weight without seeing &#34;him&#34; naked. And by &#34;him&#34;, I mean the CGI body they pasted onto the Matt Damon's head. It looked weird and slimy, probably because of the unnatural way it moved. Yuck.<br /><br />I feel I wasted my time and money on this movie. Maybe I can spare someone else.\nReview Title: \"Cast Away\" Covered This Theme Much, Much Better\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2016/06/03\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Peyton Reed'], 'Producers': ['Kevin Feige'], 'Starring': ['Paul Rudd', 'Michael Douglas', 'Evangeline Lilly']}\nReview Text: Maybe because this movie focused more on character development and less on fireworks and maybe because of the humor threaded throughout, I very much enjoyed this movie.

Can you guess what? Have you ever wondered how Inspector Lewis and Detective Hathaway met, or wanted to see their first case together? I did. I came back to Season 1 a second time to see if I missed that episode, but it seemed from the listing that &#34;Whom the Gods Would Destroy&#34; was their first outing as the follow-up team to Morse and Lewis. Imagine my surprise to discover that there is a pilot episode (or movie), called &#34;Reputation&#34;. Granted, it aired two years before Season 1, but Amazon Prime Video gives no indication that it even exists. It isn't even possible to rent or buy this first movie in which, yes, you actually get to see Lewis and Hathaway meet and work their first case together.

I grew up reading Spider-Man comics, and as far as I am concerned, Spider-Man 2 from Sam Raimi remains the best film depiction that exists.<br /><br />****SPOILERS FOLLOW***<br />I found this movie to be aggressively stupid, from the best friend (who, despite being a nerd, has apparently never read a comic book or seen a superhero movie and encourages Peter to tell everyone he is Spider-Man to win cool points with classmates) to the AI housed in his fancy suit (telling him to kiss the girl he likes right after he has saved her, while she is surrounded by people). The AI even tells Peter that she would want to be with him if she were a person. What?!<br /><br />I have no intention of ever paying to watch another Spider-Man film in this vein again--sorry, Tom Holland, but no, and no to Marisa Tomei, and no to Happy Hogan and Tony messing with Peter's head or ignoring him instead of helping him out.

This is a fun and colorful ride that gets richer with repeat viewings, which give you a chance to catch facial expressions or even musical cues that you might well miss if you only watch it once.

I don't think there's another series in the MCU with quite the same feel to it, although it seems like Thor: Ragnorok is leaning toward the same flavor--fun and colorful. I rented GotG Vol. 2 and liked it so much that I bought it.

Truly, though, this movie has absolutely nothing beyond the visuals to recommend it. I won't say it was a waste of my time, because I was curious, and thanks to my Amazon Prime membership, I got to satisfy my curiosity without having to pay for it directly. I don't regret watching the movie and I don't hate it--as I have passionately hated some other movies, like ID: Resurgence and Suicide Squad--but I wouldn't recommend this one for either rental or purchase. If you haven't seen it before and you decide to pay for it, I believe you will be sorely disappointed.<br /><br />I chalk the ultimate failure of this movie up to the writing. There is no tension, no suspense, and no heart to this film. You need someone to root for, someone in whom to invest, and neither of the main characters gave me that opportunity. They are thinly sketched, with about as much weight and substance as paper dolls; and they're not particularly likable paper dolls either. Partially for that reason they have no chemistry, although Valerian repeatedly professes his need (not even love, really) for what's-her-face and proposes marriage to her and the audience is meant to root for them to get together. I never felt the main characters (or anyone else, for that matter) were in any real danger; the film had zero stakes, and all of that makes for a very, very boring movie. I'm not sure why Rihanna was even in this movie; her character is literally a throwaway. She performed an extended burlesque routine that does next to nothing for the story, helped Valerian out a little, and then was swept off the screen like a pile of dust. You could put this movie on a screen in a waiting room and leave the sound off, and that's about all it's worth. I'm so glad I didn't buy a ticket for this sad waste of beautiful imagery and imagination.\nReview Title: Move Along.

I came back to Amazon and ordered this DVD again, not realizing it was the exact same DVD I ordered before. The second time, it was on sale for something like $5, and I thought, 'What a great deal! I'll give away the DVD I already have and keep this one with the digital copy code!' The second DVD arrived, and like the first one I already had in my collection, THERE WAS NO DIGITAL COPY INCLUDED. I sent the second DVD back. Now I see a &#34;Lost World: Jurassic Park&#34; DVD with Digital Copy Included on offer, but I am really hesitant to even go through with the purchase, as I think I will end up exactly where I started with my two Jurassic Park discs--a DVD, but no digital copy code provided.\nReview Title: Rating for DVD Advertised as Including a Digital Copy\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2019/06/21\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Michael Gracey'], 'Producers': ['Laurence Mark', 'Peter Chernin', 'Jenno Topping'], 'Starring': ['Michelle Williams', 'Hugh Jackman', 'Zac Efron'], 'Studio': ['20th Century Fox']}\nReview Text: I have enjoyed Hugh Jackman's acting ever since I first saw him in X-Men. When I learned that he was a song and dance man, I was even more impressed with him. He also seems like a stand-up guy in general. He must have been very passionate about this project to have worked so hard and so tirelessly on it for so long. The very first scene pulled me right in, and the film is full of color and catchy songs for sure. To quote the character Phillip Carlyle, \"Really, it's something.\"<br /><br />So why only 2 stars? Because Jackman's passion didn't translate to the screen, in my opinion. For me, this movie was like a confection for which they forgot to add the filling. They laid it on thick with the spectacle; and there's plenty of the popular \"stand up to the establishment\" chest-thumping from more than one character, but I didn't feel any true emotional payoff at any point.<br /><br />I'll gladly watch musicals like The Sound of Music, Fiddler on the Roof (with their long runtimes), and The King and I over and over again, start to finish. But I've only been replaying a few of The Greatest Showman's scenes, and they're all musical numbers. Once the catchy tunes are out of my head, I'll probably forget about this movie altogether\u2014because there\u2019s really nothing to it.<br /><br />Knowing what I know about the making of this film, I would hardly call it a cold and shameless money grab. But I do feel it has no heart. All the computer generated animals that appeared seemed to highlight the point: \"Move along, folks. Nothing to see here.\"\nReview Title: Humbug\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

However, with the exception of a couple of characters, I found most of the people in this cast either thoroughly unlikable or barely developed. Captain Archer struck me as uppity and self-righteous in most episodes in the first couple of seasons, so much so that I sometimes couldn't bear to watch an episode all the way to the end. Then, especially starting in Season 3, he was always angry; he even spoke gruffly to his cute little dog, Porthos, for cryin' out loud. Hoshi Sato seems to me like a whiny brat who has no business on a starship. Poor Mayweather had little or no substance to him at all. Several episodes seemed to have no point, like &#34;Shuttlepod One&#34; and &#34;Two Days and Two Nights&#34; in Season 1. And for anyone concerned with continuity in the Star Trek universe, this series dashes all that to pieces, complete with an appearance by the Ferengi in Season 1 and one by the Borg in Season 2.<br /><br />Variations of Star Trek were on the small screen for fourteen years straight before this series came along and killed the TV franchise dead. It's that bad. I'm convinced it only survived four seasons because of Trekkies who would support any and all things Trek, regardless of the quality (or lack thereof). I hope Enterprise isn't the end of Star Trek on the small screen, but I hope just as fervently that Enterprise's show runners--Berman and Braga--aren't allowed anywhere near the next one.\nThe Series that Killed Star Trek on the Small Screen\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Reinhard Klooss'], 'Producers': ['Reinhard Klooss', 'Robert Kulzer', 'Martin Moszkowicz', 'Bernhard Thur'], 'Starring': ['Kellan Lutz', 'Spencer Locke', 'Jaime Ray Newman'], 'Studio': ['Lionsgate']}\nThe animation was pretty good, and so was the story--right up until the end. A very unsatisfactory conclusion that defies logic. I liked that Tarzan communicated mostly by grunting and that the animals didn't talk. If I could, I would give it 2.5 stars, but it's either 3 or 2 stars, and I didn't completely dislike it, so 3 stars it is.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br />Tarzan's vocabulary seemed to make quite a leap when he was reintroduced to other people. The bad guy's assistant was a walking cliche. Even though there is a narrator for most of the movie, any explanation of how the meteorite changed the plants an animals within its realm of influence is glossed over. There is also little rhyme or reason to the disturbances caused by interfering with the meteorite. If the bad guy sent an entire army of people into the heart of the jungle who were presumably killed near the conclusion of the story, why would Jane assume she and Tarzan would now be left in peace? All those people had to have loved ones who would want a search and rescue mission launched, meaning even more people would come to their little piece of paradise. And Jane's father with his piece of rock just happened to escape the catastrophe unscathed in order to do--what exactly?\nPretty Good Animation and Characterization, Spoiled by Gaps in Logic\nFerris Bueller's Day Off\nComedy, Joyous, Outlandish, Playful\n['A high schooler is determined to have a day off from school.']\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['John Hughes'], 'Producers': ['John Hughes'], 'Starring': ['Matthew Broderick', 'Alan Ruck', 'Mia Sara']}\nWhen I was a kid, I loved this movie.

Matt Smith charms from the very beginning, though, starting with his demands of various food items from a young Amelia Pond. Looking back, I'd have to say that Donna Noble is my favorite companion for the simple reason that she was just that--a companion--never once flirting with the Doctor. Also, for someone who thought very little of herself, Donna was pretty smart. Amy gets on my nerves a lot in Series Five, repeatedly taking stupid risks that turn out all right only because she's a character on a TV show. Having Rory around somehow improves things. I'm glad he joins the adventures full time in the sixth series. I also think Steve Moffat and his team made great improvements on the show's score/soundtrack. I had been watching nuWho from the beginning, but never wanted to own a piece of music from the show until Series 5, with the debut of &#34;I Am the Doctor&#34; (&#34;Onwards&#34; is a much shorter form of this piece).<br /><br />Geronimo!!\nBravo, Matt Smith\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Graeme Harper', 'Euros Lyn', 'Jamie Magnus Stone', 'Douglas Mackinnon', 'Rachel Talalay', 'James Strong', 'Charlie Palmer', 'James Hawes', 'Joe Ahearne', 'Toby Haynes'], 'Starring': ['David Tennant', 'Catherine Tate', 'Freema Agyeman'], 'Studio': ['BBC America']}\nDonna Noble is, by far, my favorite companion of all the nuWho companions simply because she wanted to see all of time and space with the Doctor, not make out or sleep with him. Catherine Tate, imo, captures a great range of emotion during her run; I think I laughed the most while Donna accompanied the Doctor. But she did grief and indignation very well too. My only complaint, though, is the way Donna is set up to be this all-important figure throughout the multiverse. As far as I know, this is the first time one of the companions is given such a role, and it sets an annoying precedent that is repeated with Clara Oswald. Why can't companions just be ordinary people banging around space and time with the Doctor? Why must they be pivotal to the survival of the universe or the survival of the Doctor? On the whole, I enjoyed the Doctor Donna, and I hope we see more companions like her in attitude in the future.\nTennant and Tate Make a Great Team\nThe Martian\nScience Fiction, Drama, Anxious, Biting\n['From legendary director Ridley Scott (Alien, Prometheus) comes a gripping tale of human strength and the will to survive, starring Matt Damon as an astronaut stranded on Mars.']\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Ridley Scott'], 'Producers': ['Simon Kinberg', 'Ridley Scott', 'Michael Schaeffer', 'Aditya Sood', 'Mark Huffam'], 'Starring': ['Matt Damon', 'Jessica Chastain', 'Kristen Wiig']}\nA review on one site calls this flick &#34;Human Ingenuity: The Movie.&#34; Meh. I think &#34;Cast Away&#34; did that much better. I did not read the book on which this movie was based or read any reviews (critical or otherwise) before I watched &#34;The Martian&#34;. All I had seen was the trailer, and all I knew was that people seemed to love it and praise it to high heaven. So I eagerly anticipated enjoying the movie myself. Man, was this a letdown!<br /><br />Thin or nonexistent characterizations, too many superfluous characters (many of them flat), too much talking, too much switching between sets of characters. I think Jeff Daniels must have gotten botox injections before his scenes, because his face barely moved the entire movie. At one point two characters spend at least a minute debating the tone in which Matt Damon's character had written something along the lines of &#34;Are you kidding me?&#34; I'm serious. That conversation actually took place in the movie.<br /><br />Character A: 'Do you think he meant, &#34;Are you kidding me?&#34; Or was it more like &#34;Are you kidding me?!&#34;'<br />Character B: 'I think it was the first one.'<br /><br />I'm not watching this scene as I type this, so I can't be totally sure that's what they said, but it's close. And it didn't end there! They continued to discuss the possible tone of the message! Are YOU kidding me, movie? Stop wasting my time! This asinine conversation does NOT qualify as humor! The movie bored me and had zero emotional punch. I agree with others who have mentioned how predictable this was, too. That means zero tension, zero suspense, which translates to zero enjoyment. It was pretty, with mostly good SFX; that's IT. I might have found the movie more fascinating if the tagline (and outcome) had been &#34;Left to Die&#34; instead of &#34;Bring Him Home&#34; and the movie was about the recovery of Watney's body and cheery, yet resolute video logs (I dislike the non-word &#34;vlogs&#34;) and not the rescue of Watney himself. I didn't even like the guy.<br /><br />If you find profanity distasteful like I do, you'll be annoyed early and often. You get two f-bombs within the first half hour or so of the movie and more f-bombs are implied later. For me, this did nothing to make Matt Damon's character either sympathetic or heroic. On the back end of the movie, you get a gratuitous, yet creepy CGI visual of Matt Damon's naked back and backside as he walks away from a shower. I'm pretty sure I would have been able to tell that the character had lost a lot of weight without seeing &#34;him&#34; naked. And by &#34;him&#34;, I mean the CGI body they pasted onto the Matt Damon's head. It looked weird and slimy, probably because of the unnatural way it moved. Yuck.<br /><br />I feel I wasted my time and money on this movie. Maybe I can spare someone else.\n\"Cast Away\" Covered This Theme Much, Much Better\n{'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Peyton Reed'], 'Producers': ['Kevin Feige'], 'Starring': ['Paul Rudd', 'Michael Douglas', 'Evangeline Lilly']}\nMaybe because this movie focused more on character development and less on fireworks and maybe because of the humor threaded throughout, I very much enjoyed this movie. I can only echo what others have said, which is that this movie is lots of fun. Marvel movies in general tend to be laced with humor, but this movie is funnier than all of them, I think.

Imagine my surprise to discover that there is a pilot episode (or movie), called &#34;Reputation&#34;. Granted, it aired two years before Season 1, but Amazon Prime Video gives no indication that it even exists. It isn't even possible to rent or buy this first movie in which, yes, you actually get to see Lewis and Hathaway meet and work their first case together.

Truly, though, this movie has absolutely nothing beyond the visuals to recommend it. I won't say it was a waste of my time, because I was curious, and thanks to my Amazon Prime membership, I got to satisfy my curiosity without having to pay for it directly. I don't regret watching the movie and I don't hate it--as I have passionately hated some other movies, like ID: Resurgence and Suicide Squad--but I wouldn't recommend this one for either rental or purchase. If you haven't seen it before and you decide to pay for it, I believe you will be sorely disappointed.<br /><br />I chalk the ultimate failure of this movie up to the writing. There is no tension, no suspense, and no heart to this film. You need someone to root for, someone in whom to invest, and neither of the main characters gave me that opportunity. They are thinly sketched, with about as much weight and substance as paper dolls; and they're not particularly likable paper dolls either. Partially for that reason they have no chemistry, although Valerian repeatedly professes his need (not even love, really) for what's-her-face and proposes marriage to her and the audience is meant to root for them to get together. I never felt the main characters (or anyone else, for that matter) were in any real danger; the film had zero stakes, and all of that makes for a very, very boring movie. I'm not sure why Rihanna was even in this movie; her character is literally a throwaway. She performed an extended burlesque routine that does next to nothing for the story, helped Valerian out a little, and then was swept off the screen like a pile of dust. You could put this movie on a screen in a waiting room and leave the sound off, and that's about all it's worth. I'm so glad I didn't buy a ticket for this sad waste of beautiful imagery and imagination.\nMove Along.

Contrary to the description, the DVD does NOT come with a digital copy. I actually ordered this disc twice. The first time I wasn't thinking about a digital copy and so wasn't paying attention to whether that was offered as an option. As I began adding other DVDs with digital copies included to my collection, I decided I wanted that option for this movie too. I came back to Amazon and ordered this DVD again, not realizing it was the exact same DVD I ordered before. The second time, it was on sale for something like $5, and I thought, 'What a great deal! I'll give away the DVD I already have and keep this one with the digital copy code!' The second DVD arrived, and like the first one I already had in my collection, THERE WAS NO DIGITAL COPY INCLUDED. I sent the second DVD back. Now I see a &#34;Lost World: Jurassic Park&#34; DVD with Digital Copy Included on offer, but I am really hesitant to even go through with the purchase, as I think I will end up exactly where I started with my two Jurassic Park discs--a DVD, but no digital copy code provided.\nRating for DVD Advertised as Including a Digital Copy\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Michael Gracey'], 'Producers': ['Laurence Mark', 'Peter Chernin', 'Jenno Topping'], 'Starring': ['Michelle Williams', 'Hugh Jackman', 'Zac Efron'], 'Studio': ['20th Century Fox']}\nI have enjoyed Hugh Jackman's acting ever since I first saw him in X-Men. When I learned that he was a song and dance man, I was even more impressed with him. He also seems like a stand-up guy in general. He must have been very passionate about this project to have worked so hard and so tirelessly on it for so long. The very first scene pulled me right in, and the film is full of color and catchy songs for sure. To quote the character Phillip Carlyle, \"Really, it's something.\"<br /><br />So why only 2 stars? Because Jackman's passion didn't translate to the screen, in my opinion. For me, this movie was like a confection for which they forgot to add the filling. They laid it on thick with the spectacle; and there's plenty of the popular \"stand up to the establishment\" chest-thumping from more than one character, but I didn't feel any true emotional payoff at any point.<br /><br />I'll gladly watch musicals like The Sound of Music, Fiddler on the Roof (with their long runtimes), and The King and I over and over again, start to finish.

I very much enjoy the Original Series, the Next Generation, and Deep Space Nine. I even enjoy reading the novels. However, the Star Trek universe began to sour for me with the arrival of Captain Janeway and the Vulcan who wouldn't stop frowning. I stopped watching Voyager at all in the later seasons and even chose to ignore the series finale entirely. So I had high hopes when Enterprise came out. Those hopes soon tanked, though, starting with the opening credits. Years later, I decided to give this series a second try, seeing as I enjoy most of the other series so much. I came to like the song used for the opening credits in the first two seasons. However, with the exception of a couple of characters, I found most of the people in this cast either thoroughly unlikable or barely developed. Captain Archer struck me as uppity and self-righteous in most episodes in the first couple of seasons, so much so that I sometimes couldn't bear to watch an episode all the way to the end. Then, especially starting in Season 3, he was always angry; he even spoke gruffly to his cute little dog, Porthos, for cryin' out loud. Hoshi Sato seems to me like a whiny brat who has no business on a starship. Poor Mayweather had little or no substance to him at all. Several episodes seemed to have no point, like &#34;Shuttlepod One&#34; and &#34;Two Days and Two Nights&#34; in Season 1.

It's that bad. I'm convinced it only survived four seasons because of Trekkies who would support any and all things Trek, regardless of the quality (or lack thereof). I hope Enterprise isn't the end of Star Trek on the small screen, but I hope just as fervently that Enterprise's show runners--Berman and Braga--aren't allowed anywhere near the next one.\nReview Title: The Series that Killed Star Trek on the Small Screen\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2015/11/09\nAverage Rating: 4.0\nProduct Details: {'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Reinhard Klooss'], 'Producers': ['Reinhard Klooss', 'Robert Kulzer', 'Martin Moszkowicz', 'Bernhard Thur'], 'Starring': ['Kellan Lutz', 'Spencer Locke', 'Jaime Ray Newman'], 'Studio': ['Lionsgate']}\nReview Text: The animation was pretty good, and so was the story--right up until the end.

Matt Smith charms from the very beginning, though, starting with his demands of various food items from a young Amelia Pond. Looking back, I'd have to say that Donna Noble is my favorite companion for the simple reason that she was just that--a companion--never once flirting with the Doctor. Also, for someone who thought very little of herself, Donna was pretty smart. Amy gets on my nerves a lot in Series Five, repeatedly taking stupid risks that turn out all right only because she's a character on a TV show. Having Rory around somehow improves things. I'm glad he joins the adventures full time in the sixth series. I also think Steve Moffat and his team made great improvements on the show's score/soundtrack. I had been watching nuWho from the beginning, but never wanted to own a piece of music from the show until Series 5, with the debut of &#34;I Am the Doctor&#34; (&#34;Onwards&#34; is a much shorter form of this piece).<br /><br />Geronimo!!\nReview Title: Bravo, Matt Smith\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2016/05/06\nAverage Rating: 4.9\nProduct Details: {'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Graeme Harper', 'Euros Lyn', 'Jamie Magnus Stone', 'Douglas Mackinnon', 'Rachel Talalay', 'James Strong', 'Charlie Palmer', 'James Hawes', 'Joe Ahearne', 'Toby Haynes'], 'Starring': ['David Tennant', 'Catherine Tate', 'Freema Agyeman'], 'Studio': ['BBC America']}\nReview Text: Donna Noble is, by far, my favorite companion of all the nuWho companions simply because she wanted to see all of time and space with the Doctor, not make out or sleep with him. Catherine Tate, imo, captures a great range of emotion during her run; I think I laughed the most while Donna accompanied the Doctor. But she did grief and indignation very well too. My only complaint, though, is the way Donna is set up to be this all-important figure throughout the multiverse. As far as I know, this is the first time one of the companions is given such a role, and it sets an annoying precedent that is repeated with Clara Oswald. Why can't companions just be ordinary people banging around space and time with the Doctor? Why must they be pivotal to the survival of the universe or the survival of the Doctor? On the whole, I enjoyed the Doctor Donna, and I hope we see more companions like her in attitude in the future.\nReview Title: Tennant and Tate Make a Great Team\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: The Martian\nReview Date: 2016/06/03\nCategories: Science Fiction, Drama, Anxious, Biting\nProduct Description: ['From legendary director Ridley Scott (Alien, Prometheus) comes a gripping tale of human strength and the will to survive, starring Matt Damon as an astronaut stranded on Mars.']\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Ridley Scott'], 'Producers': ['Simon Kinberg', 'Ridley Scott', 'Michael Schaeffer', 'Aditya Sood', 'Mark Huffam'], 'Starring': ['Matt Damon', 'Jessica Chastain', 'Kristen Wiig']}\nReview Text: A review on one site calls this flick &#34;Human Ingenuity: The Movie.&#34; Meh. I think &#34;Cast Away&#34; did that much better. I did not read the book on which this movie was based or read any reviews (critical or otherwise) before I watched &#34;The Martian&#34;. All I had seen was the trailer, and all I knew was that people seemed to love it and praise it to high heaven. So I eagerly anticipated enjoying the movie myself. Man, was this a letdown!<br /><br />Thin or nonexistent characterizations, too many superfluous characters (many of them flat), too much talking, too much switching between sets of characters. I think Jeff Daniels must have gotten botox injections before his scenes, because his face barely moved the entire movie. At one point two characters spend at least a minute debating the tone in which Matt Damon's character had written something along the lines of &#34;Are you kidding me?&#34; I'm serious. That conversation actually took place in the movie.<br /><br />Character A: 'Do you think he meant, &#34;Are you kidding me?&#34; Or was it more like &#34;Are you kidding me?!&#34;'<br />Character B: 'I think it was the first one.'<br /><br />I'm not watching this scene as I type this, so I can't be totally sure that's what they said, but it's close. And it didn't end there! They continued to discuss the possible tone of the message! Are YOU kidding me, movie? Stop wasting my time! This asinine conversation does NOT qualify as humor! The movie bored me and had zero emotional punch. I agree with others who have mentioned how predictable this was, too. That means zero tension, zero suspense, which translates to zero enjoyment. It was pretty, with mostly good SFX; that's IT. I might have found the movie more fascinating if the tagline (and outcome) had been &#34;Left to Die&#34; instead of &#34;Bring Him Home&#34; and the movie was about the recovery of Watney's body and cheery, yet resolute video logs (I dislike the non-word &#34;vlogs&#34;) and not the rescue of Watney himself. I didn't even like the guy.<br /><br />If you find profanity distasteful like I do, you'll be annoyed early and often. You get two f-bombs within the first half hour or so of the movie and more f-bombs are implied later. For me, this did nothing to make Matt Damon's character either sympathetic or heroic. On the back end of the movie, you get a gratuitous, yet creepy CGI visual of Matt Damon's naked back and backside as he walks away from a shower. I'm pretty sure I would have been able to tell that the character had lost a lot of weight without seeing &#34;him&#34; naked. And by &#34;him&#34;, I mean the CGI body they pasted onto the Matt Damon's head. It looked weird and slimy, probably because of the unnatural way it moved. Yuck.<br /><br />I feel I wasted my time and money on this movie. Maybe I can spare someone else.\nReview Title: \"Cast Away\" Covered This Theme Much, Much Better\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2016/06/03\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Peyton Reed'], 'Producers': ['Kevin Feige'], 'Starring': ['Paul Rudd', 'Michael Douglas', 'Evangeline Lilly']}\nReview Text: Maybe because this movie focused more on character development and less on fireworks and maybe because of the humor threaded throughout, I very much enjoyed this movie.

Truly, though, this movie has absolutely nothing beyond the visuals to recommend it. I won't say it was a waste of my time, because I was curious, and thanks to my Amazon Prime membership, I got to satisfy my curiosity without having to pay for it directly. I don't regret watching the movie and I don't hate it--as I have passionately hated some other movies, like ID: Resurgence and Suicide Squad--but I wouldn't recommend this one for either rental or purchase. If you haven't seen it before and you decide to pay for it, I believe you will be sorely disappointed.<br /><br />I chalk the ultimate failure of this movie up to the writing. There is no tension, no suspense, and no heart to this film. You need someone to root for, someone in whom to invest, and neither of the main characters gave me that opportunity. They are thinly sketched, with about as much weight and substance as paper dolls; and they're not particularly likable paper dolls either. Partially for that reason they have no chemistry, although Valerian repeatedly professes his need (not even love, really) for what's-her-face and proposes marriage to her and the audience is meant to root for them to get together. I never felt the main characters (or anyone else, for that matter) were in any real danger; the film had zero stakes, and all of that makes for a very, very boring movie. I'm not sure why Rihanna was even in this movie; her character is literally a throwaway. She performed an extended burlesque routine that does next to nothing for the story, helped Valerian out a little, and then was swept off the screen like a pile of dust. You could put this movie on a screen in a waiting room and leave the sound off, and that's about all it's worth. I'm so glad I didn't buy a ticket for this sad waste of beautiful imagery and imagination.\nReview Title: Move Along.

When I learned that he was a song and dance man, I was even more impressed with him. He also seems like a stand-up guy in general. He must have been very passionate about this project to have worked so hard and so tirelessly on it for so long. The very first scene pulled me right in, and the film is full of color and catchy songs for sure. To quote the character Phillip Carlyle, \"Really, it's something.\"<br /><br />So why only 2 stars? Because Jackman's passion didn't translate to the screen, in my opinion. For me, this movie was like a confection for which they forgot to add the filling. They laid it on thick with the spectacle; and there's plenty of the popular \"stand up to the establishment\" chest-thumping from more than one character, but I didn't feel any true emotional payoff at any point.<br /><br />I'll gladly watch musicals like The Sound of Music, Fiddler on the Roof (with their long runtimes), and The King and I over and over again, start to finish. But I've only been replaying a few of The Greatest Showman's scenes, and they're all musical numbers. Once the catchy tunes are out of my head, I'll probably forget about this movie altogether\u2014because there\u2019s really nothing to it.<br /><br />Knowing what I know about the making of this film, I would hardly call it a cold and shameless money grab.
