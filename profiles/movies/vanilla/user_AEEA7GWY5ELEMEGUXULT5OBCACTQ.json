Together, the two battle crime as as their feelings for each other.', 'Amazon.com', 'Remington Steele', \"'s fusion of whodunit mystery and screwball comedy burst onto television in 1982. After struggling to get clients to hire a female detective, Laura Holt (sultry Stephanie Zimbalist) invents a fictional boss named Remington Steele, whose dashing manly name draws in work. But while protecting some South African jewels, Holt runs across a mysterious thief and con-man (an elfin, baby-faced Pierce Brosnan) whom her client assumes is the nonexistent Steele--and when the case is resolved, the accidental detective decides he likes the work and sticks around, infuriating Holt with his arrogant ways and tantalizing her with his dashing good looks. Murders may occur at a winery, an island sex club, or a college reunion, but just about every episode plunders plot elements from classic movies like\", 'Bringing Up Baby', ',', 'The Third Man', ', and', 'The Trouble with Harry', \"(even the theme song was written by film composer Henry Mancini).

The dialogue sometimes slipped from arch camp to sheer cheese, but even at its most ridiculous (say, a scene where Holt and Steele question homeless bums while dressed in formal evening wear)\", 'Remington Steele', \"remains an eminently watchable show, thanks to zippy plotting and the chemistry between Zimbalist and Brosnan. Some episodes clearly implied that the pair had become intimate, yet that didn't defuse their attraction. Even when the stories became a bit silly, the mutual respect and desire between Holt and Steele never lost its sophistication.\", '--Bret Fetzer']\nAverage Rating: 4.6\nProduct Details: {'Aspect Ratio': '1.33:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'Unrated (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.5 x 0.5 inches; 6.4 Ounces', 'Director': 'Burt Brinckerhoff, Don Weis, Jeff Bleckner, Larry Elikann, Leo Penn', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, Dubbed, NTSC, Subtitled, Full Screen', 'Run time': '17 hours and 58 minutes', 'Release date': 'July 26, 2005', 'Actors': 'Stephanie Zimbalist, Pierce Brosnan, James Read, Janet DeMay, Carlene Watkins', 'Dubbed': 'English', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish', 'Language': 'Unqualified, English (Dolby Digital 1.0)', 'Studio': '20th Century Fox', 'Number of discs': '4'}\nReview Text: WHAT IS WITH THE COVER??

They know they can always rely on their friends to see them through. Joe (Romano) is a divorced, slightly neurotic father of two who runs a party store and recently overcame a gambling problem.

Terry (Bakula) the relaxed, handsome actor continues to search for stability after disastrous attempts at managing an apartment complex and reviving his acting career.', ']]>', 'Amazon.com', \"It's an overused term, but few words seem more apt than\", 'bittersweet', 'to describe the second and final season of the critically acclaimed comedy/drama', 'Men of a Certain Age', ': bitter in that the show was brought to a close far too soon for fans and many critics, but also sweet in that the series, created by Ray Romano and Mike Royce, ended on the same notes of honesty, poignancy, and sheer creative quality that marked its beginning. The sophomore season of', 'Certain Age', 'also found the show escaping from the short-sightedness that painted it as a series about \"guys in midlife crisis\" to become a program about the second chances and minor miracles that were also part of the lives of its trio of protagonists: party-store owner Joe (Romano) shakes off the torpor of his divorce to finally pursue his dream of professional golf, while married man Owen (Andre Braugher) takes hold of his long-delayed destiny as owner of his father\\'s car dealership. And while the transition of Terry (Scott Bakula) from lothario and would-be actor to a man committed to romance and a realistic future takes the occasional back seat to his friends\\' storylines, his struggles never lack for intimacy while also showcasing some of the show\\'s most cringe-worthy moments as he attempts to shake off a lifetime of half-steps and fruitless relationships. In each of their stories, as well as in those of the people who orbit their lives, from Joe\\'s children (Braeden Lemasters and Brittany Curran) to Owen\\'s wife (Lisa Gay Hamilton) and coworkers and Terry\\'s supremely patient girlfriend (Melinda McGraw), there is not a false note in regard to the operation of the human heart as how it truly works and not as depicted in network notes or audience demographic research. The writing in the second season (by several veterans of', 'Everybody Loves Raymond', \", among others) achieves a sort of literary level in its best moments, a gorgeous opaqueness that reveals such depths of richness and truth behind the veil of ordinary life. That high-water mark is met by the direction as well as the exceptional cast, from Romano, who continues to prove himself a remarkably subtle dramatic actor, and Braugher and Bakula, down to supporting players like Hamilton, McGraw, Richard Gant (as Braugher's prideful father), Alanna Ubach, Sarah Clarke (the\", 'Twilight', 'series), Matt Price, and Brian White. However, the season is again stolen by Jon Manfrellotti (', 'Mad Men', \") as Joe's bookie, Manfro, whose cancer diagnosis peels away his Runyonesque exterior to reveal a vinegary sagacity in his uncomfortable dealings with Joe.\", 'The three-disc presentation of', 'Men of a Certain Age', \"'s second season is anchored by commentaries by the show's key players on all 12 episodes. Romano and Royce are the dominant voices, and the humor that they and fellow writers Bridget Bedard, Lew Schneider, and Tucker Cawley provide also allows for glimpses into the show's production as well as what might have happened in its third season. Romano, Royce, Bedard, and Schneider additionally appear on a solid featurette that discusses the tone and direction of the series in fine detail. There is also a brace of deleted scenes from both seasons, as well as a frequently funny gag reel, all of which should appeal to the show's small but dedicated cadre of fans. But more significantly, what those viewers can take away from this final season is not just the excellence of the episodes, but also the fact that\", 'Men of a Certain Age', 'belongs in the ranks of such extraordinary works as', 'Freaks and Geeks', ',', 'Deadwood', ',', 'Sports Night', ',', 'Arrested Development', ',', 'Veronica Mars', ', and other series that slipped the surly bonds of the medium and truly defined the phrase', 'too good for television', '.', '--Paul Gaita']\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 0.01 Ounces', 'Item model number': '883929174317', 'Director': 'David Boyd', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Box set, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Run time': '8 hours and 48 minutes', 'Release date': 'January 15, 2013', 'Actors': 'Ray Romano, Scott Bakula, Andre Braugher, Lisa Gay Hamilton, Matt Price', 'Subtitles': 'English', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1)', 'Studio': 'TNT', 'Number of discs': '3'}\nReview Text: What else can be said?

The sophomore season of', 'Certain Age', 'also found the show escaping from the short-sightedness that painted it as a series about \"guys in midlife crisis\" to become a program about the second chances and minor miracles that were also part of the lives of its trio of protagonists: party-store owner Joe (Romano) shakes off the torpor of his divorce to finally pursue his dream of professional golf, while married man Owen (Andre Braugher) takes hold of his long-delayed destiny as owner of his father\\'s car dealership. And while the transition of Terry (Scott Bakula) from lothario and would-be actor to a man committed to romance and a realistic future takes the occasional back seat to his friends\\' storylines, his struggles never lack for intimacy while also showcasing some of the show\\'s most cringe-worthy moments as he attempts to shake off a lifetime of half-steps and fruitless relationships. In each of their stories, as well as in those of the people who orbit their lives, from Joe\\'s children (Braeden Lemasters and Brittany Curran) to Owen\\'s wife (Lisa Gay Hamilton) and coworkers and Terry\\'s supremely patient girlfriend (Melinda McGraw), there is not a false note in regard to the operation of the human heart as how it truly works and not as depicted in network notes or audience demographic research. The writing in the second season (by several veterans of', 'Everybody Loves Raymond', \", among others) achieves a sort of literary level in its best moments, a gorgeous opaqueness that reveals such depths of richness and truth behind the veil of ordinary life. That high-water mark is met by the direction as well as the exceptional cast, from Romano, who continues to prove himself a remarkably subtle dramatic actor, and Braugher and Bakula, down to supporting players like Hamilton, McGraw, Richard Gant (as Braugher's prideful father), Alanna Ubach, Sarah Clarke (the\", 'Twilight', 'series), Matt Price, and Brian White. However, the season is again stolen by Jon Manfrellotti (', 'Mad Men', \") as Joe's bookie, Manfro, whose cancer diagnosis peels away his Runyonesque exterior to reveal a vinegary sagacity in his uncomfortable dealings with Joe.\", 'The three-disc presentation of', 'Men of a Certain Age', \"'s second season is anchored by commentaries by the show's key players on all 12 episodes.

Romano, Royce, Bedard, and Schneider additionally appear on a solid featurette that discusses the tone and direction of the series in fine detail. There is also a brace of deleted scenes from both seasons, as well as a frequently funny gag reel, all of which should appeal to the show's small but dedicated cadre of fans. But more significantly, what those viewers can take away from this final season is not just the excellence of the episodes, but also the fact that\", 'Men of a Certain Age', 'belongs in the ranks of such extraordinary works as', 'Freaks and Geeks', ',', 'Deadwood', ',', 'Sports Night', ',', 'Arrested Development', ',', 'Veronica Mars', ', and other series that slipped the surly bonds of the medium and truly defined the phrase', 'too good for television', '.', '--Paul Gaita']\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 0.01 Ounces', 'Item model number': '883929174317', 'Director': 'David Boyd', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Box set, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Run time': '8 hours and 48 minutes', 'Release date': 'January 15, 2013', 'Actors': 'Ray Romano, Scott Bakula, Andre Braugher, Lisa Gay Hamilton, Matt Price', 'Subtitles': 'English', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1)', 'Studio': 'TNT', 'Number of discs': '3'}\nWhat else can be said?

And while the transition of Terry (Scott Bakula) from lothario and would-be actor to a man committed to romance and a realistic future takes the occasional back seat to his friends\\' storylines, his struggles never lack for intimacy while also showcasing some of the show\\'s most cringe-worthy moments as he attempts to shake off a lifetime of half-steps and fruitless relationships. In each of their stories, as well as in those of the people who orbit their lives, from Joe\\'s children (Braeden Lemasters and Brittany Curran) to Owen\\'s wife (Lisa Gay Hamilton) and coworkers and Terry\\'s supremely patient girlfriend (Melinda McGraw), there is not a false note in regard to the operation of the human heart as how it truly works and not as depicted in network notes or audience demographic research. The writing in the second season (by several veterans of', 'Everybody Loves Raymond', \", among others) achieves a sort of literary level in its best moments, a gorgeous opaqueness that reveals such depths of richness and truth behind the veil of ordinary life. That high-water mark is met by the direction as well as the exceptional cast, from Romano, who continues to prove himself a remarkably subtle dramatic actor, and Braugher and Bakula, down to supporting players like Hamilton, McGraw, Richard Gant (as Braugher's prideful father), Alanna Ubach, Sarah Clarke (the\", 'Twilight', 'series), Matt Price, and Brian White. However, the season is again stolen by Jon Manfrellotti (', 'Mad Men', \") as Joe's bookie, Manfro, whose cancer diagnosis peels away his Runyonesque exterior to reveal a vinegary sagacity in his uncomfortable dealings with Joe.\", 'The three-disc presentation of', 'Men of a Certain Age', \"'s second season is anchored by commentaries by the show's key players on all 12 episodes. Romano and Royce are the dominant voices, and the humor that they and fellow writers Bridget Bedard, Lew Schneider, and Tucker Cawley provide also allows for glimpses into the show's production as well as what might have happened in its third season. Romano, Royce, Bedard, and Schneider additionally appear on a solid featurette that discusses the tone and direction of the series in fine detail. There is also a brace of deleted scenes from both seasons, as well as a frequently funny gag reel, all of which should appeal to the show's small but dedicated cadre of fans. But more significantly, what those viewers can take away from this final season is not just the excellence of the episodes, but also the fact that\", 'Men of a Certain Age', 'belongs in the ranks of such extraordinary works as', 'Freaks and Geeks', ',', 'Deadwood', ',', 'Sports Night', ',', 'Arrested Development', ',', 'Veronica Mars', ', and other series that slipped the surly bonds of the medium and truly defined the phrase', 'too good for television', '.', '--Paul Gaita']\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 0.01 Ounces', 'Item model number': '883929174317', 'Director': 'David Boyd', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Box set, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Run time': '8 hours and 48 minutes', 'Release date': 'January 15, 2013', 'Actors': 'Ray Romano, Scott Bakula, Andre Braugher, Lisa Gay Hamilton, Matt Price', 'Subtitles': 'English', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1)', 'Studio': 'TNT', 'Number of discs': '3'}\nReview Text: What else can be said?
