Following Ashur\u2019s death, Naevia and Crixus fight as one. Together, the rebels engage in one bloody skirmish after another and prepare for the inevitable: a full out war with Rome. The Roman Senate turns to Marcus Crassus, a wealthy, strategic politician, for aid. He respects his opponent and refuses to make the same mistakes Glaber and his predecessors have. With a young and fiercely competitive Julius Caesar as an ally, Crassus is determined to crush Spartacus and his rebellion.']\n{'Aspect Ratio': '1.78:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 3.2 Ounces', 'Item model number': '27460994', 'Media Format': 'NTSC, Multiple Formats, Widescreen', 'Run time': '7 hours and 20 minutes', 'Release date': 'September 3, 2013', 'Actors': 'Liam McIntyre, Dustin Clare, Manu Bennett, Dan Feuerriegel', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish', 'Producers': 'Rob Tapert, Steven S.

Following Ashur\u2019s death, Naevia and Crixus fight as one. Together, the rebels engage in one bloody skirmish after another and prepare for the inevitable: a full out war with Rome.
