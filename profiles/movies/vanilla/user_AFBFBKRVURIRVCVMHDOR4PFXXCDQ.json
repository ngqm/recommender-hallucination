What fun! (I've read some negative things about this production but I would counsel to ignore them.)

You can completely forget the bills and what Congress is doing and suspend reality for the length of this film and enjoy it with the kids! It's got it all: Romance, knights in shining armor, horses, a cause at stake, a family secret, beautiful ladies in courtly clothes, and villians abound.

The scenery is beautiful and the characters engaging. It's one of my most favorite movies.<br /><br />My only complaint is, I wish it were the director's cut that I first saw. I think the cutting down of movies to secure shorter run times in manufacturing has ruined more than one excellent effort with heavy handed and insensitive cutting. I don't buy a lot of DVD's just because of the butchering that goes on with the original stories; they really don't do a very good job of it.

The first two seasonss are whimsical, fun, and upbeat. In this third season, Miss Fisher begins to mellow into a full on cozy detective and the tone is a little more serious and the plots a little more complex. The core cast is just fantastic and I certainly hope this series will take flight and a place alongside Poirot and Miss Marple in the classics of cozy mystery. Nathan Page plays detective Jack Robinson who, on his own, is the chief police detective for the district. However, his most endearing quality is how he entertains Miss Fisher's efforts and together they solve the mysteries. This series is funny (Jack and Hugh Collins in the police car late at night watching the legs of Miss Fisher disappear through an upstairs window,) and engrossing. The stories are well written and superbly acted. We love this series and hope to collect many more DVD's!\nReview Title: Essie Davis sparkles like diamonds in the Miss Fisher Mystery series\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Belly Dance For Beginners\nReview Date: 2016/01/26\nStore: Leila  (Actor),     Michael Wohl  (Director)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Exercise & Fitness\nProduct Description: ['Belly dance', \"is fun, exciting, sensual and suitable for all body types and fitness levels.

The first two seasonss are whimsical, fun, and upbeat. In this third season, Miss Fisher begins to mellow into a full on cozy detective and the tone is a little more serious and the plots a little more complex. The core cast is just fantastic and I certainly hope this series will take flight and a place alongside Poirot and Miss Marple in the classics of cozy mystery. Nathan Page plays detective Jack Robinson who, on his own, is the chief police detective for the district. However, his most endearing quality is how he entertains Miss Fisher's efforts and together they solve the mysteries. This series is funny (Jack and Hugh Collins in the police car late at night watching the legs of Miss Fisher disappear through an upstairs window,) and engrossing. The stories are well written and superbly acted.

What fun! (I've read some negative things about this production but I would counsel to ignore them.) Technically you can enjoy this without it breaking down into window pane pixels or slowing to a stop towards the end and it's great entertainment. You can completely forget the bills and what Congress is doing and suspend reality for the length of this film and enjoy it with the kids! It's got it all: Romance, knights in shining armor, horses, a cause at stake, a family secret, beautiful ladies in courtly clothes, and villians abound.

The scenery is beautiful and the characters engaging. It's one of my most favorite movies.<br /><br />My only complaint is, I wish it were the director's cut that I first saw. I think the cutting down of movies to secure shorter run times in manufacturing has ruined more than one excellent effort with heavy handed and insensitive cutting. I don't buy a lot of DVD's just because of the butchering that goes on with the original stories; they really don't do a very good job of it.

It stars Ronald Howard \u2013 the son of screen legend Leslie Howard (of Scarlet Pimpernel and Gone with the Wind fame) \u2013 as Holmes and Howard Marion Crawford as Watson. Howard portrays a younger, more laid-back version of Sherlock Holmes based on the character in A Study in Scarlet and in line with Producer Sheldon Reynold\u2019s vision. His rapport with Howard Marion-Crawford\u2019s Dr. Watson is also more cooperative and less needling than most portrayals.

The first two seasonss are whimsical, fun, and upbeat. In this third season, Miss Fisher begins to mellow into a full on cozy detective and the tone is a little more serious and the plots a little more complex. The core cast is just fantastic and I certainly hope this series will take flight and a place alongside Poirot and Miss Marple in the classics of cozy mystery. Nathan Page plays detective Jack Robinson who, on his own, is the chief police detective for the district. However, his most endearing quality is how he entertains Miss Fisher's efforts and together they solve the mysteries. This series is funny (Jack and Hugh Collins in the police car late at night watching the legs of Miss Fisher disappear through an upstairs window,) and engrossing. The stories are well written and superbly acted. We love this series and hope to collect many more DVD's!\nReview Title: Essie Davis sparkles like diamonds in the Miss Fisher Mystery series\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Belly Dance For Beginners\nReview Date: 2016/01/26\nStore: Leila  (Actor),     Michael Wohl  (Director)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Exercise & Fitness\nProduct Description: ['Belly dance', \"is fun, exciting, sensual and suitable for all body types and fitness levels.
