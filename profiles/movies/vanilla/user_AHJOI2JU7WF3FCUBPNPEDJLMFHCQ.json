I love the ocean and ships in general.  You get a lot of information from this series about how cruise's operate and how the ships are designed.  I have really enjoyed watching the series and seeing the differences in different cruise operators, destinations, and types of passengers that sail on the various vessels.  If you are a cruise and/or ship guru, you will appreciate this series.\nReview Title: Great information and cruise following\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Star Trek: Voyager: The Complete Series\nReview Date: 2018/08/17\nStore: Kate Mulgrew  (Actor),     Robert Beltran  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Paramount Home Entertainment, Boxed Sets\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Science Fiction & Fantasy/Television', 'Format': 'AC-3, Box set, Subtitled, Dolby, NTSC, Full Screen', 'Contributor': 'Kate Mulgrew, McNeill, Ethan Phillips, Robert Beltran, Robert Duncan, Roxann Dawson', 'Language': 'English', 'Number Of Discs': '47', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 2.71 Pounds', 'Media Format': 'AC-3, Box set, Subtitled, Dolby, NTSC, Full Screen', 'Release date': 'March 7, 2017', 'Actors': 'Kate Mulgrew, Robert Beltran, Ethan Phillips, Robert Duncan, McNeill', 'Subtitles': 'English', 'Studio': 'PARAMOUNT', 'Number of discs': '47'}\nReview Text: I have always been a Star Trek fan.  After TNG, I never really got into Deep Space Nine.  What I liked about Voyager is the similarity to TNG, with them being on a ship and exploring.  I wish they would release this on blu-ray, although it sounds like that probably won't happen.  The DVD box set is the next best thing and I am happy to have it and watch the series regularly.\nReview Title: Great Program\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Star Trek: The Original Series: The Complete Series\nReview Date: 2018/08/17\nStore: William Shatner  (Actor),     Leonard Nimoy  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: Blu-ray\nCategories: Movies & TV, Featured Categories, Blu-ray\nProduct Description: ['Complete Series']\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Science Fiction & Fantasy/Television', 'Format': 'Widescreen, DTS Surround Sound, Dubbed, Subtitled, Box set', 'Contributor': 'William Shatner, James Doohan, Leonard Nimoy', 'Language': 'English', 'Number Of Discs': '20', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 0.01 Ounces', 'Item model number': '35386474', 'Media Format': 'Widescreen, DTS Surround Sound, Dubbed, Subtitled, Box set', 'Release date': 'June 14, 2016', 'Actors': 'William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, James Doohan', 'Dubbed': 'Spanish, French', 'Subtitles': 'French, Spanish, English, Portuguese', 'Studio': 'PARAMOUNT', 'Number of discs': '20'}\nReview Text: I love the video quality in this set.  It was re-mastered to HD and offers you the option of the enhanced effects or the original effects.  All are in superb HD quality and stunning to watch.  Rewatching the series from these blu-ray discs is like watching it over again from the start.  There are so many details you wouldn't notice from the old SD version.  I highly recommend these for any Star Trek fan!\nReview Title: Awesome Quality\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
