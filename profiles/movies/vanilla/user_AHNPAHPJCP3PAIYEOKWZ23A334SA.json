I very much enjoyed this story-line, and once again I was glad I hadn\u2019t read negative reviews before watching. I only started reading after watching the season to determine if there will be more to come. As for history, I wouldn't ever get my facts from a show to write a research paper. Productions like this are driven by people who want it to do well and hook viewers. These types of shows are loosely based on history, and I appreciate the effort to add a bit of historical precision to adaptations. I'm not looking for a history lesson, I want entertainment. History buffs should go make their own movie --then complain about another\u2019s. I love how critics claim ownership of historical \u201cfacts\u201d like they have a Tardis and were actually there at the time. I dream of an internet where people would FIRST make their own movie or whatever product they go online to malign. Then I might respect their opinion when comparing products. I'd enjoy seeing how people type about their work compared with another work. Perhaps they would not be so quick to judge, because they would better appreciate and fully understand why decisions are made. Alas, all the expertise they deem worthy is having a keyboard, an internet connection, and a presumption. If you look, you'll find MOST critics haven't actually written historical works of their own, nor have they ever made their own product, movie, or show about anything they claim to be such experts on.

I never read video reviews, before watching because I don't want spoilers, and they are always so distorted in a way that is inaccurate, unfair, misleading, or simply not helpful to me. I very much enjoyed this story-line, and once again I was glad I hadn\u2019t read negative reviews before watching. I only started reading after watching the season to determine if there will be more to come. As for history, I wouldn't ever get my facts from a show to write a research paper. Productions like this are driven by people who want it to do well and hook viewers. These types of shows are loosely based on history, and I appreciate the effort to add a bit of historical precision to adaptations. I'm not looking for a history lesson, I want entertainment. History buffs should go make their own movie --then complain about another\u2019s. I love how critics claim ownership of historical \u201cfacts\u201d like they have a Tardis and were actually there at the time. I dream of an internet where people would FIRST make their own movie or whatever product they go online to malign. Then I might respect their opinion when comparing products. I'd enjoy seeing how people type about their work compared with another work. Perhaps they would not be so quick to judge, because they would better appreciate and fully understand why decisions are made. Alas, all the expertise they deem worthy is having a keyboard, an internet connection, and a presumption. If you look, you'll find MOST critics haven't actually written historical works of their own, nor have they ever made their own product, movie, or show about anything they claim to be such experts on. If they were truly erudite and passionate, you would have made their own adaptations by now.\nReview Title: So glad I finally watched this and did not read the negative reviews!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2018/11/21\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Starring': ['Kristen Bell', 'Ted Danson', 'William Jackson Harper'], 'Studio': ['NBC']}\nReview Text: I like the writing in the show, but I sure wish each episode was double the runtime. 20 minutes goes by too fast! I'm sure it makes it easier on the cast and production to do these type of short episodes though, so as long as they keep making the show I'll be happy.\nReview Title: Enjoyable to follow\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2019/07/19\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Starring': ['Kenny Florian', 'Chris Rose']}\nReview Text: This seasons episodes are great and I love the extras!\nReview Title: WOW!
