The son of Greek immigrants, born into humble beginnings in East Los Angeles, John Paul DeJoria has built a life full of good fortune and achieved vast wealth through a variety of businesses, among them John Paul Mitchell Hair Care Systems and Patron Tequila.In 1980, he partnered with Paul Mitchell to start a line of professional hair care products. They turned a $700 investment and 3 products into a wildly successful venture that today is worth more than $800 million. Proving his success wasn't just a fluke, John Paul then created the largest and the most recognizable tequila brand in the world - Patron.GOOD FORTUNE focuses on DeJoria's inspiring success story as well as his philanthropy. It's the true tale of a man who overcame obstacles and dedicates his life to giving back to those less fortunate. He ran through his early adulthood in and out of motorcycle gangs and today John Paul's quest is finding innovative ways to share his sizable fortune. DeJoria spends his life creating back-to-work programs for the homeless, fighting whale poachers in the Arctic and working on over 100 other philanthropic ventures. Along with Bill Gates and Warren Buffet DeJoria signed 'The Giving Pledge,' a formal promise to continue to contribute more than half of their wealth to philanthropy or charitable causes during their lifetime or in their will.Dan Aykroyd narrates the film spinning colorful stories with humor and wit.

Dule has a short scene and he shares a large part of the movie cover and Sam who is  second most scenes is not even on the cover. Gabrielle Union is well known and also on he cover as is the cheating boyfriend in this movie.
