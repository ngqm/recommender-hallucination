A tiny glitch causes Wayne, his brother, and their wives to shrink big time! Soon, they must brave household insects the size of dinosaurs, a treacherous loop-the-loop track in a toy race car, dizzying \"balloon\" rides inside soap bubbles, and more! Meanwhile, thinking they have the house all to themselves, the kids get into mega-mischief -- never guessing their pint-sized parents are watching their every move! With amazing special effects and nonstop excitement, HONEY, WE SHRUNK OURSELVES is a hilarious, heartwarming, hugely entertaining adventure for the entire family!|Wayne Szalinksi is back, and this time when his notorious shrink machine misfires, it\\'s the adults who are shrunk. Believing their parents have left them home alone for the weekend, the kids take advantage of their newfound unsupervised freedom by filling up on junk food, Rollerblading in the house, playing loud music, and throwing a party for their friends. While desperately trying to get the kids to notice them, since they are only three quarters of an inch tall, the adults are able to learn a few things about their offspring. The film was extremely complicated to produce, with almost 400 composite shots totaling approximately 40 minutes of screen time.

      "\"Peanuts\" creator Charles Schulz retired from the cartoonist's life early in 2000, and indeed left a few loose strings hanging among his chronically dissatisfied characters. He never did, for instance, cut Charlie Brown much slack in the romance department (or let him kick Lucy's football, for that matter). Sympathetic readers might have taken note of a story in the press just before Schulz said farewell, in which the inspiration for Charlie Brown's unrequited love interest--the never-seen, too-distant, \"little red-haired girl\"--was identified as a woman who turned down a marriage proposal from Schultz a half-century ago. That bit of biographical detail now adds poignancy to",

This half-hour show finds Charlie Brown suffering, typically, the ignominy of receiving no hearts-and-flowers greetings while the rest of the gang, including Snoopy, spend their day sorting through piles of love notes. Worse, Schulz's famous sad sack can't get up the nerve to approach his unapproachable angel, though there may be--just",
