Very easy to follow with instructions that are visually reinforced. Even a guy with two left feet, like me, can learn to be the dance king.

Comments I got were, \"Where did you learn to dance like that?\" and \"I didn\\'t know you could dance like that!\". One hint, though: Get this video early - don\\'t wait until the week before your wedding like I did. You need at least a month of practice for all of the steps to become easy. If you apply yourself just a half hour each night, you can really get the basics down pat. Enjoy. Make Fred and Ginger envious. --Bernd VanderSchuur, Verified PurchaseThis DVD provided several hours of laughter while my daughter and her fianc\u00e9, my daughter and I, and my wife and I learned some basic steps and prepared to dance at the daughter\\'s wedding last May. Certainly none of us rivaled Fred and Ginger, but just the confidence of knowing _something_ about dance made all the difference in the world.

It's nice to know how Ms. Rowling rose from the bottom to the top. It goes to show you that talent and skill could be hidden anywhere or where you least expect it. It also shows that even if you come from a &#34;good&#34; family that you can still hit rock bottom (well, almost, in her case). I liked how it showed that you can be courageous and also how you need to never give up on your dreams. I know I'm talking about the story/person and not the movie. Regarding the movie itself, I liked the movie a lot. It was an eye-opening to me.
