This show has a positive message about faith and humility which our whole family needed a reminder of.  We finished this movie happier than when we started.

The numerous talks about having sex with a hot guy, bikini waxing, climaxing and other sexual innuendos?  The dissing of the white hairdresser because she wants to \"act black\"?

I've seen so many movies/tv shows that I get bored easily, so it says a lot that I didn't change this \"channel\". The main actor is superb.  I'm not sure how many others could have pulled off this movie like he did. His facial expressions and his intonation spoke volumes. And kudos to all the voices behind the phone calls.

We take so much for granted that we can become self centered or blind to the blessings that we do have. I am guilty of both. This movie touched my heart and opened my eyes to faith, love, and hope.

Her acting didn't disappoint. She played her character so well that at times I empathize with her while other times, I just want to yell at her. Page Searcy played a teenager's attitudes and behaviors so well that she reminded me of my own teens.  It was frustrating to watch at times because the plot seemed ridiculously unfair and unrealistic.

She didn't act much older than her 16 year old daughter. She should've told her kids about the abuse at the beginning, kept her money with her, and not befriend a stranger, especially a male. He could be a psychopath. In real life, she and her kids could've end up badly. But, in the world of movies, they have a happy ending.\nReview Title: Can't stand the mom.
