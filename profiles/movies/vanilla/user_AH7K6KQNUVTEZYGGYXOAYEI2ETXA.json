The series follows a group of individuals who need to find a way to survive in the chaotic time after a major event such as a grid breakdown. Interesting to see the issues they have to deal with including deciding who they can take in, trust, the lawlessness of society, making something from nothing. There is a second season based in New Orleans and a third that never was completed due to a tragedy. But I wish they would make more.\nReview Title: Enjoyed this series\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: The Next Three Days\nReview Date: 2016/11/10\nStore: Russell Crowe  (Actor),     Liam Neeson  (Actor),     Paul Haggis  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Action & Adventure\nProduct Description: ['Product Description', 'Life seems perfect for John Brennan until his wife, Lara, is arrested for a murder she says she didn\u2019t commit. Three years into her sentence, John is struggling to hold his family together, raising their son and teaching at college while he pursues every means available to prove her innocence. With the rejection of their final appeal, Lara becomes suicidal and John decides there is only one possible, bearable solution: to break his wife out of prison. Refusing to be deterred by impossible odds or his own inexperience, John devises an elaborate escape plot and plunges into a dangerous and unfamiliar world, ultimately risking everything for the woman he loves.

Schoolteacher John Brennan (Crowe) is stunned when his wife Laura (Elizabeth Banks,', 'W.', ') is sentenced to life imprisonment for murder. As he watches her emotional decline behind bars, he becomes determined to break her out of prison--and', 'The Next Three Days', \"tracks his meticulous efforts, including wrong turns that threaten to capsize everything. The movie is most compelling in how it follows Brennan's wrenching emotional changes. He's not some cold, focused secret agent--he's torn between his painful devotion to his wife and the frightening possibility of what could go wrong, including the possible cost to their son. The outstanding supporting cast includes Liam Neeson, Brian Dennehy, and rapper RZA, but the vast majority of the movie rests on Crowe's shoulders and he carries it like an athlete. There's something deeply physical about Crowe's performances--his emotions seem to fill his entire body, even as his expressions are incredibly subtle. It's a gripping performance by a remarkable actor, anchoring a well-conceived and engaging thriller.\", '--Bret Fetzer']\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Thriller', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Russell Crowe, Paul Haggis, Liam Neeson', 'Language': 'English', 'Studio': 'Lionsgate', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '0.6 x 5.4 x 7.5 inches; 2.72 Ounces', 'Item model number': '29740', 'Director': 'Paul Haggis', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Release date': 'March 8, 2011', 'Actors': 'Russell Crowe, Liam Neeson', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: Gift\nReview Title: Dvd\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: The Revenant\nReview Date: 2016/11/10\nStore: Leonardo DiCaprio  (Actor),     Tom Hardy  (Actor),     Alejandro G.

The series follows a group of individuals who need to find a way to survive in the chaotic time after a major event such as a grid breakdown. Interesting to see the issues they have to deal with including deciding who they can take in, trust, the lawlessness of society, making something from nothing. There is a second season based in New Orleans and a third that never was completed due to a tragedy. But I wish they would make more.\nReview Title: Enjoyed this series\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: The Next Three Days\nReview Date: 2016/11/10\nStore: Russell Crowe  (Actor),     Liam Neeson  (Actor),     Paul Haggis  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Action & Adventure\nProduct Description: ['Product Description', 'Life seems perfect for John Brennan until his wife, Lara, is arrested for a murder she says she didn\u2019t commit. Three years into her sentence, John is struggling to hold his family together, raising their son and teaching at college while he pursues every means available to prove her innocence. With the rejection of their final appeal, Lara becomes suicidal and John decides there is only one possible, bearable solution: to break his wife out of prison.

The outstanding supporting cast includes Liam Neeson, Brian Dennehy, and rapper RZA, but the vast majority of the movie rests on Crowe's shoulders and he carries it like an athlete. There's something deeply physical about Crowe's performances--his emotions seem to fill his entire body, even as his expressions are incredibly subtle. It's a gripping performance by a remarkable actor, anchoring a well-conceived and engaging thriller.\", '--Bret Fetzer']\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Thriller', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Russell Crowe, Paul Haggis, Liam Neeson', 'Language': 'English', 'Studio': 'Lionsgate', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '0.6 x 5.4 x 7.5 inches; 2.72 Ounces', 'Item model number': '29740', 'Director': 'Paul Haggis', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Release date': 'March 8, 2011', 'Actors': 'Russell Crowe, Liam Neeson', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: Gift\nReview Title: Dvd\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: The Revenant\nReview Date: 2016/11/10\nStore: Leonardo DiCaprio  (Actor),     Tom Hardy  (Actor),     Alejandro G.

      "From Academy Award\u00ae-nominated director Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m (2000, The Cider House Rules) comes HACHI: A DOG\u2019S TALE, a film based on one of the most treasured and heartwarming true stories ever told. Golden Globe winner Richard Gere (2002, Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy, Chicago) stars as Professor Parker Wilson, a distinguished scholar who discovers a lost Akita puppy on his way home from work. Despite initial objections from Wilson\u2019s wife, Cate (Academy Award\u00ae nominee Joan Allen \u2013 2000, Best Actress, The Contender), Hachi endears himself into the Wilson family and grows to be Parker's loyal companion. As their bond grows deeper, a beautiful relationship unfolds embodying the true spirit of family and loyalty, while inspiring the hearts of an entire town.",

      "Based on a true story from Japan,",
      "Hachi: A Dog's Tale",
      "is a moving film about loyalty and the rare, invincible bonds that occasionally form almost instantaneously in the most unlikely places. College professor Parker Wilson (Richard Gere) finds a young Akita puppy that's been abandoned at the local train station, and he's instantly captivated by the dog. Assuming the dog's owner will return to the train station to claim him in the morning, Parker takes the puppy home overnight. But when no one comes to get the dog, Parker convinces his wife, Cate (Joan Allen), to welcome him as part of the family. He dubs the puppy Hachiko--Hachi, for short--because of the Japanese symbol for good luck that's hanging from his collar. Hachi is a somewhat peculiar dog that refuses to learn to fetch or master other people-pleasing tricks, but he is a faithful companion and friend to Parker, alerting him of potential dangers and accompanying him to the train station each morning and meeting him there after his return trip each evening. An unforeseen event will continually test Hachi's devotion. This film is neither overwrought nor sappy; it is heartfelt and immensely powerful despite its tendency to drag in a few places. Prepare to be moved to tears by this beautiful, seemingly simple film--it's about so much more than just the relationship between a man and his dog.",
