Beckinsale's Emma was overly moody and had none of the light cheerfulness of Austen's Emma (or Ms. Paltrow's for that matter). Mark Stong is not Jeremey Northrup but he is VERY good. Unfortunately, this movie never establishes that Mr. Knightly is a daily presence in the Woodhouse household (i.e., compare with the Northrup-Paltrow version), which is critical to understanding the relationship between Mr. Knightly and Emma. Indeed, their love for each other is nearly a shocker in this version coming in its last 10 minutes. If you are an Emma fan, you may find this film a disappointment. In general, I prefer Ms. Beckinsale over Ms. Paltrow but Ms. Paltrow's film is a better Reader's Digest adaptation of this lengthly and rich novel. I wonder if modern movie/DVD audiences have the patience for a longer 4 and 6 hour versions of this novel akin to what has been done for Pride & Prejudice by the BBC and A&E, respectively. Indeed, the latest 2-hour version of P&P by Hollywood is a bare skeleton of that incredible story.\nReview Title: Not quite Miss Jane's Emma\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2013/10/22\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'frightening scenes', 'smoking'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Peter Jackson'], 'Producers': ['Peter Jackson', 'Fran Walsh', 'Carolynne Cunningham', 'Zane Weiner'], 'Starring': ['Sir Ian McKellen', 'Martin Freeman', 'Richard Armitage']}\nReview Text: While I appreciate bringing elements of the appendices of LOTR into the Hobbit movies, beginning with this one, this movie is misguided in vision and execution.

As her romantic plans go ridiculously wrong, however, it's Emma herself who risks missing out on her perfect match!\", \"Join A&E for a wry visit to the drawing rooms and country manors of 19th-century England - a visit to the enchanting world of Jane Austen's Emma now in the crystal clear digital clarity of DVD.\"]\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Romance, Comedy', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Closed-captioned, Color, NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Raymond Coulthard, Bernard Hepton, Dido Miles, James Hazeldine, Samantha Morton, Prunella Scales, Guy Henry, Jane Austen, Sylvia Barter, Dominic Rowan, Kate Beckinsale, Mark Strong, Samantha Bond, Diarmuid Lawrence, Andrew DaviesRaymond Coulthard, Bernard Hepton, Dido Miles, James Hazeldine, Samantha Morton, Prunella Scales, Guy Henry, Jane Austen, Sylvia Barter, Dominic Rowan, Kate Beckinsale, Mark Strong, Samantha Bond, Diarmuid Lawrence, Andrew Davies  See more', 'Language': 'Unqualified, English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo)', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 47 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.33:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.38 x 0.6 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Director': 'Diarmuid Lawrence', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Closed-captioned, Color, NTSC', 'Run time': '1 hour and 47 minutes', 'Release date': 'July 5, 2000', 'Actors': 'Kate Beckinsale, Bernard Hepton, Mark Strong, Samantha Bond, James Hazeldine', 'Subtitles': 'English', 'Studio': 'A&E Home Video', 'Writers': 'Andrew Davies, Jane Austen', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: With Kate Beckinsale in the lead, this should have been a whale of a movie, especially if Ms. Beckinsale was allowed to bring some of her persona from Cold Comfort Farm in which she played a more Emma-like character there than she was allowed to do here. Beckinsale's Emma was overly moody and had none of the light cheerfulness of Austen's Emma (or Ms. Paltrow's for that matter). Mark Stong is not Jeremey Northrup but he is VERY good. Unfortunately, this movie never establishes that Mr. Knightly is a daily presence in the Woodhouse household (i.e., compare with the Northrup-Paltrow version), which is critical to understanding the relationship between Mr. Knightly and Emma. Indeed, their love for each other is nearly a shocker in this version coming in its last 10 minutes. If you are an Emma fan, you may find this film a disappointment. In general, I prefer Ms. Beckinsale over Ms. Paltrow but Ms. Paltrow's film is a better Reader's Digest adaptation of this lengthly and rich novel. I wonder if modern movie/DVD audiences have the patience for a longer 4 and 6 hour versions of this novel akin to what has been done for Pride & Prejudice by the BBC and A&E, respectively. Indeed, the latest 2-hour version of P&P by Hollywood is a bare skeleton of that incredible story.\nReview Title: Not quite Miss Jane's Emma\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2013/10/22\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'frightening scenes', 'smoking'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Peter Jackson'], 'Producers': ['Peter Jackson', 'Fran Walsh', 'Carolynne Cunningham', 'Zane Weiner'], 'Starring': ['Sir Ian McKellen', 'Martin Freeman', 'Richard Armitage']}\nReview Text: While I appreciate bringing elements of the appendices of LOTR into the Hobbit movies, beginning with this one, this movie is misguided in vision and execution.  Trying to craft another Aragorn out of Thorin is silly and disingenuous to the spirit of the dwarves.  Making this more about Thorin and not Bilbo is also not in keeping with the core elements of this story.  And then, all those chase scenes!  There were too many, and they way, way were too long. I stopped watching the movie for awhile.  If this keeps up, this series of films will be reminescent of the second Star Wars series with the young Anakin - and that series was a disaster in story telling.\nReview Title: Way too many tedious chases\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Marvel's The Avengers\nReview Date: 2013/11/26\nCategories: Science Fiction, Adventure, Ambitious, Fantastic\nProduct Description: ['Marvel\u2019s The Avengers is the Super Hero team up of a lifetime, featuring iconic Marvel Super Heroes Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye and Black Widow.']\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Joss Whedon'], 'Producers': ['Kevin Feige'], 'Starring': ['Robert Downey Jr. Chris Evans']}\nReview Text: Great one liners and actually some very nice acting here and there from Downey, Johansson and Ruffalo (the man can communicate a lot without uttering a word) but otherwise this was tepid story.

The story line bears little relationship to the book, which turns out to be OK as the plague theme runs well in this adaptation.

I think that if Roger Rees' version of Scoorge's nephew bore the same lightness that Barry Mackay did in the 1938 version, this might be the superior film.

By the time we ended our chat with the Amazon help, he had us unplugging everything.....I was waiting for him to tell us to go turn off the circuit at the circuit breaker or call the city to have them turn off power to our neighborhood....and then, reboot the move so that we can see 4-6 minutes of video at a time.

Great cast; great, engaging characters. The plots are smart, witty, and engaging. Lucy Lui (as Joan Watson) is subtly outstanding, and Aidan Quinn (NYPD Captain) and Johnny Lee Miller (as Sherlock Holmes) are on their A-game. Marcus Bell is new to me but he does a lot with what little he is given to do.  Keep your eye on this guy.  This show is a great complement and contrast to Benedict Cumberbatch's and Martin Freeman's version of Homes and Watson, respectively, in &#34;Sherlock.&#34;\nReview Title: Sherlock Holmes in NYC!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2015/08/22\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['David Hare'], 'Producers': ['Bill Nighy', 'Nigel Marchant', 'Rebecca Eaton', 'Gareth Neame', 'David Barron', 'Christine Langan', 'Celia Duval', 'Scott Rudin', 'David Heyman'], 'Starring': ['Bill Nighy', 'Christopher Walken', 'Felicity Jones'], 'Studio': ['PBS']}\nReview Text: This film is dark and funny at times.
