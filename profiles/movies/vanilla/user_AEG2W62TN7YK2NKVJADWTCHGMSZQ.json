Beautiful cinematography and breathtaking scenes of the Basque country.  One of the reasons I chose to watch it is just that to see the country scenes.  This seems to be a \"film noir\" type with a good plot and an unexpected ending.  All new actors for me however, I had seen Susi Sanchez acting in a previous Spanish film.  The only thing that I felt was NOT NECESSARY were all the sex scenes in the earlier episodes ... don't believe this contributed to the plot or if they had to throw in sex, the directors could have given it a \"softer\" touch ... I didn't dock any stars for that though.  For those language fans out there, there's a lot of the Basque language you see in the film ... and I picked up some of the simpler Basque greetings.

It had beautiful outdoor scenery.  A bittersweet story of two gay men experiencing falling in love and faced with serious choices.\nReview Title: Bittersweet story but good theme\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2019/09/08\nAverage Rating: 4.6\nProduct Details: {'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English'], 'Directors': ['John Patrick Shanley'], 'Producers': ['Scott Rudin'], 'Starring': ['Meryl Streep', 'Philip Seymour Hoffman', 'Amy Adams'], 'Studio': ['Paramount']}\nReview Text: It has been a while since I have enjoyed a film of this magnitude.  The performances of three main personalities, Streep as Sister Aloysius, Hoffman as Father Flynn and Adams as sister James unifies one of the main themes of the film - Power struggle.<br />The film peeks into the persecution of Roman Catholic priests during the 60's in regards to pedophiles.  I loved Hoffman's portrayal of the priest showing compassion and love.  This was one of his best performances.<br />Streep, as always, is outstanding in her artistic abilities.  A moving dramatic story.\nReview Title: Outstanding performances by Streep, Hoffman, Adams\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
