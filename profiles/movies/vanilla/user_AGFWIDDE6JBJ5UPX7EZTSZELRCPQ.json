A bride who showed zero concern for her missing groom-to-be throughout the entire movie.  Poor script, weak plot and over-the-top acting.  This is drivel & a waste of time to watch.  I've read many 'cosy mysteries' and this movie tries to bring one to the screen, but the entire plot is poorly developed and the characters are unreal.  For example, one character goes from making love to her old boyfriend who soon afterwards pushes her off a cliff allegedly because she had previously broken up their relationship.

A bride who showed zero concern for her missing groom-to-be throughout the entire movie.  Poor script, weak plot and over-the-top acting.  This is drivel & a waste of time to watch.  I've read many 'cosy mysteries' and this movie tries to bring one to the screen, but the entire plot is poorly developed and the characters are unreal.  For example, one character goes from making love to her old boyfriend who soon afterwards pushes her off a cliff allegedly because she had previously broken up their relationship.  Not even soap opera good.\nReview Title: Poorly done (decent cast, poor plot, erratic story line and not very nice characters)\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
