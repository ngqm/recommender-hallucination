While searching for his little brother in the woods, 12-year-old David Freeman (Joey Cramer) falls down a ravine and is knocked unconscious. After what seems like minutes, he returns home, only to discover that eight years have passed since he was declared missing and presumed dead. Even more mystifying is that David hasn't aged, nor can he account for the time lapse. Meanwhile, NASA officials stumble upon a futuristic spacecraft and are determined to assess what David knows about it by locking him in a top-secret lab for scanning and testing. His only chance of escape is in the spacecraft manned by Max, a wisecracking robot. Cramer gives an earnest performance, which overcomes an imperfect script, while enough one-liners and imaginative animation will keep families engaged.

Jake Lonergan (Daniel Craig, of James Bond fame) wakes up in the midst of sagebrush with a mysterious gadget around his wrist and no idea who he is--but he sure does remember how to take care of the bounty hunters who want to bring him in. His path soon crosses with a ruthless cattle baron named Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford, of Indiana Jones fame), who's not too happy with Lonergan, who got Dolarhyde's son in trouble. But their fracas becomes beside the point when spaceships descend and start lassoing people like cattle. The humans, including a mysterious woman (Olivia Wilde,\", 'Tron', '), a Native American tribe, and some snaggletoothed outlaws, band together to fight off this invasion from another world. The first two-thirds of', 'Cowboys & Aliens', \"is peppy fun, with its tongue-in-cheek Wild West-ness and colorful supporting cast (including Sam Rockwell, Keith Carradine, Paul Dano, and Walton Goggins) and fairly understated CGI. The last third, with the obligatory assault on the alien vessel and a mess of clich\u00e9s and inconsistencies, deflates a bit, which isn't surprising given that six screenwriters were involved. Director Jon Favreau (\", 'Iron Man', ') does what he can to keep things lively. Fortunately, the good spirits of the first two-thirds will carry most viewers through to the end.', '--Bret Fetzer', 'Stills from', 'Cowboys & Aliens', '(Click for larger image)']\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Science Fiction & Fantasy, DVD Movie, Blu-ray Movie, Action & Adventure/Thrillers, Westerns, Action & AdventureScience Fiction & Fantasy, DVD Movie, Blu-ray Movie, Action & Adventure/Thrillers, Westerns, Action & Adventure  See more', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Blu-ray, AC-3, Color, Dolby, Subtitled, Dubbed, Widescreen, DTS Surround Sound, UltravioletMultiple Formats, Blu-ray, AC-3, Color, Dolby, Subtitled, Dubbed, Widescreen, DTS Surround Sound, Ultraviolet  See more', 'Contributor': 'Buck Taylor, Harrison Ford, Jon Favreau, Abigail Spencer, Olivia Wilde, Noah Ringer, Daniel Craig', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1), Spanish (Dolby Digital 5.1), French Canadian (Dolby Digital 5.1), English (DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1), French Canadian (DTS 5.1), Spanish (DTS 5.1)', 'Runtime': '2 hours and 15 minutes', 'Digital Copy Expiration Date': 'May 2, 2016', 'Aspect Ratio': '2.40:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '6.75 x 5.4 x 0.4 inches; 0.01 Ounces', 'Item model number': '25192107184', 'Director': 'Jon Favreau', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Blu-ray, AC-3, Color, Dolby, Subtitled, Dubbed, Widescreen, DTS Surround Sound, Ultraviolet', 'Run time': '2 hours and 15 minutes', 'Release date': 'December 6, 2011', 'Actors': 'Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, Abigail Spencer, Buck Taylor, Olivia Wilde', 'Dubbed': 'French, Spanish', 'Subtitles': 'Spanish, French, English', 'Studio': 'Universal Pictures', 'Number of discs': '2'}\nReview Text: Decent movie...seems like a pilot for a TV series that didn't quite make it to the networks.
