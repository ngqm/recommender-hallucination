I saw Tara on You Tube and loved her style.<br /><br />All 4 of the DVD's are excellent.  These are recorded in various venues.  The atmospheres are minimalistic and there is no backgound music.  Tara directs you through the poses in her earthy approach to yoga.  She is beautiful, talented, and humble.<br /><br />She studied ballet in her youth and it shows.  She is so graceful.  Thanks Tara for your beautiful Diva style of yoga!<br /><br />She has a studio in NYC, if you live there or  travel it would be fun to drop in for a class.  She has lots of videos on You Tube, so check her out and get this DVD set if you like her style.\nReview Title: Tara is the Diva of earthbound yoga with minimal ego\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2014/03/18\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Betty Thomas'], 'Producers': ['Ivan Reitman'], 'Starring': ['Howard Stern', 'Robin Quivers', 'Mary McCormack'], 'Studio': ['Paramount Pictures']}\nReview Text: I must confess that I get a huge kick out of Howard, and I loved this movie.  This is the real deal, a slice of how Howard got to be the King of All Media.<br /><br />Even if you are not a big fan of Howard, you might still like seeing how he had to fight his way to the top of the pile against mainstream media and the FCC.<br /><br />But if you are a fan of Howard, you will love this movie.  His ex-wife Alison stars as herself, Robin as herself, Babbabooie as himself, and the very talented Fred as himself.  The NBC exec (aka Pig Vomit) is very well done by Paul Giamotti.<br /><br />You will get to see the very personal sensitive side of Howard on screen.  Too fun, and too funny!<br /><br />Although this is a 1997 film, it is still relevant today.  A good slice of the 80's and how we listen to radio today.<br /><br />I also bought the soundtrack because I love the Rob Zombie song The Great American Nightmare that starts off Howard's show.

MM is a perfectionist and attends to every single detail in his performances.  You gotta love that in any performer.<br /><br />Great editing from MM concerts worldwide on the Guns, God, Govt tour into one wonderful unique concert for this DVD.  The sound is great, so plan on cranking it up LOUD.<br /><br />I loved seeing the entire band play with reckless abandon.  They all poured 110% into their performances.  The costumes were great, lighting was perfect, special effects were terrific!<br /><br />The Death Parade film is a behind the scenes look at the band which was fun, except I could have done without the temper tantrums.<br /><br />I have watched this twice already this week, and I will be watching it many more times.  WAY too much fun!

In an age when Z-list celebrities garner more media attention than the truly gifted, Amy Winehouse is an anomaly - a woman of such extraordinary flair it beggars belief and a dream for the tabloids, all rolled into one.

If you don't find this alarming, especially in light of the events in Jan 2021, then you need to review the horrific regimes of Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini, and Franco.<br /><br />Trump's psychology and actions are brilliantly reviewed by leading psychologists followed by analysis.

Focuses on CIA interrogation tactics used on suspects, and the ethical and legal ramifications of the techniques recommended by psychologist contractors who advised the CIA.  Scenes are realistic and hard to watch, so not for immature audiences.  Reviews the Senate committee investigation of the CiA Enhanced Interrogation Techniques program and conflicts within goverment agencies regarding the results of the investigation.

I saw Tara on You Tube and loved her style.<br /><br />All 4 of the DVD's are excellent.  These are recorded in various venues.  The atmospheres are minimalistic and there is no backgound music.  Tara directs you through the poses in her earthy approach to yoga.  She is beautiful, talented, and humble.<br /><br />She studied ballet in her youth and it shows.  She is so graceful.  Thanks Tara for your beautiful Diva style of yoga!<br /><br />She has a studio in NYC, if you live there or  travel it would be fun to drop in for a class.  She has lots of videos on You Tube, so check her out and get this DVD set if you like her style.\nTara is the Diva of earthbound yoga with minimal ego\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Betty Thomas'], 'Producers': ['Ivan Reitman'], 'Starring': ['Howard Stern', 'Robin Quivers', 'Mary McCormack'], 'Studio': ['Paramount Pictures']}\nI must confess that I get a huge kick out of Howard, and I loved this movie.  This is the real deal, a slice of how Howard got to be the King of All Media.<br /><br />Even if you are not a big fan of Howard, you might still like seeing how he had to fight his way to the top of the pile against mainstream media and the FCC.<br /><br />But if you are a fan of Howard, you will love this movie.  His ex-wife Alison stars as herself, Robin as herself, Babbabooie as himself, and the very talented Fred as himself.  The NBC exec (aka Pig Vomit) is very well done by Paul Giamotti.<br /><br />You will get to see the very personal sensitive side of Howard on screen.  Too fun, and too funny!<br /><br />Although this is a 1997 film, it is still relevant today.  A good slice of the 80's and how we listen to radio today.<br /><br />I also bought the soundtrack because I love the Rob Zombie song The Great American Nightmare that starts off Howard's show.

It is a walk through on the rise of authoritarian leaders over the last 100 years, alongside Trump's actions which line up perfectly with his desire to stay in power in 2020 and when that failed, plan a run again in 2024.  If you don't find this alarming, especially in light of the events in Jan 2021, then you need to review the horrific regimes of Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini, and Franco.<br /><br />Trump's psychology and actions are brilliantly reviewed by leading psychologists followed by analysis.  It really is amazing.  I will watch this again to let it really soak in.

Too fun, and too funny!<br /><br />Although this is a 1997 film, it is still relevant today.  A good slice of the 80's and how we listen to radio today.<br /><br />I also bought the soundtrack because I love the Rob Zombie song The Great American Nightmare that starts off Howard's show.

MM is a perfectionist and attends to every single detail in his performances.  You gotta love that in any performer.<br /><br />Great editing from MM concerts worldwide on the Guns, God, Govt tour into one wonderful unique concert for this DVD.  The sound is great, so plan on cranking it up LOUD.<br /><br />I loved seeing the entire band play with reckless abandon.  They all poured 110% into their performances.  The costumes were great, lighting was perfect, special effects were terrific!<br /><br />The Death Parade film is a behind the scenes look at the band which was fun, except I could have done without the temper tantrums.<br /><br />I have watched this twice already this week, and I will be watching it many more times.

In an age when Z-list celebrities garner more media attention than the truly gifted, Amy Winehouse is an anomaly - a woman of such extraordinary flair it beggars belief and a dream for the tabloids, all rolled into one.

If you don't find this alarming, especially in light of the events in Jan 2021, then you need to review the horrific regimes of Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini, and Franco.<br /><br />Trump's psychology and actions are brilliantly reviewed by leading psychologists followed by analysis.

Focuses on CIA interrogation tactics used on suspects, and the ethical and legal ramifications of the techniques recommended by psychologist contractors who advised the CIA.  Scenes are realistic and hard to watch, so not for immature audiences.  Reviews the Senate committee investigation of the CiA Enhanced Interrogation Techniques program and conflicts within goverment agencies regarding the results of the investigation.  Still relevant and riveting issues.<br /><br />Acting, cinematography, casting were all top notch.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film.  Well done ia all respects.\nReview Title: Brilliant original movie by Amazon producers\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
