The costumes and scenery for the epic were amazing, and the acting was great.  The only thing I was iffy about was the musical numbers.

    "text": "as far as reality tv in competition format is concerned this is nothing like the type of shows i typically groan at and avoid watching.  there was a huge stress on safety - especially for the dogs - and also about the bonds we have with our dogs, and the competitors' with their dogs, and how during their travels and learning new things in unfamiliar situations they were able to strengthen those bonds even further than they thought possible.  it wasn't nearly as much about winning as it was about the dogs, which was important.  and the charity aspect was very important to me (in fact i would have loved it if, for example, in costa rica they had a challenge working at the territorio de zaguates for an afternoon or something).  i did take off a star because it bugged me how apparently nobody could speak or pronounce any foreign languages except one contestant who spoke french.  unless that was intentional when choosing contestants it made me want to bash my head into a wall, with so many people hailing from areas in the USA with huge latinx populations who couldn't read, speak, or understand spanish.  but if you're going to be doing a show like this don't you think that would have been something you might have been studying for as well as prepping yourself - and your dog - for any other kinds of training?  watching americans run around expecting everyone else in the world to cater to them and speak english in their own countries just bugs me.",
