This 'new' disc sold by Amazon, with no DVD security features on the packaging, has numerous glitches; I suspect it's on all copies of this edition, I bought it new. It pauses momentarily, perhaps makes a sound, and continues. It's done this several times already having started the movie (it's on as I speak). It's widescreen and the picture quality is okay, but my roommate pointed out to me that it's overdubbed, that is the sound isn't always matching the lips; I checked the listing, and sure enough, it says \"dubbed\". I haven't tried the French-language soundtrack. I already purchased a used copy of a more expensive edition of this film by Anchor Bay. I'll be returning this one. I'm surprised at Amazon for selling an inferior version as new.<br /><br />--<br /><br />I received and am playing the disk I referred to [[ASIN:6305511861 The Car]] and when trying to review the Amazon system informed me I have already reviewed the product, being the other disk of inferior condition that wouldn't play. This, of course, is ridiculous. This disk, as I have anticipated, is superior and is playing without a single glitch. It was professionally produced with packaging as a DVD should be. So, definitely get this (ASIN 6305511861) rather than the cheaper disk on Amazon which began this review. Both are Region 1. I bought a used disk which is in better condition than the \"new\" one sold by Amazon. Neither Region 1 DVD disk of this movie has subtitles. I'm happy with the widescreen version included on the ASIN mentioned. The single caveat of this edition is that the packaging has a definite flaw:  the ring that holds the disk continues in a full circle even past the finger indentations, making it impossible to remove the disk easily even when holding down the middle button. You could scratch the disk trying to get it out, I had to hold it upside down and dig with the \"button finger\". I won't return it to the case. But the disk itself is great, and the one I recommend (Anchor Bay). Too bad it's out of print.\nReview Title: Glitched. Dubbed.

Too bad it's not available for streaming. I loved it! I'd say one of her most enjoyable movies. She's older (middle-older teen) in this, and it only offers more depth and romantic escapades for her fans! The setting (modern day pirate's boat & cove) and adventure, with her relationship with her old salt dad, and her budding interest in a handsome, young modern man from the city, is refreshing, the 60's appeal is fun, and her character is a rough & tumble tomboy that you'd better not mess with! However, she's feeling soft new feelings she hasn't experienced before, and the coming-of-age conflict is portrayed very well and really fun to watch. This is now one of my very favorite films of hers (along with Gypsy Girl). :) I had never seen this one before, so glad it's available on DVD at least!\nReview Title: Now one of my very favorite Haley Mills films :)\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2015/01/12\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Ken Kwapis'], 'Producers': ['Howard W.

Timothy Dalton's character is completely over the top and tv-sitcom unbelievable, he barks, shouts, and doesn't seem real at all; however Fran is so likeable, warm, and believable in her role that it is still enjoyable for light, funny, romantic fare including children. The contrast between her New York City apartment life and family (her mother is also well-portrayed and hilarious!), and the setting in the Eastern bloc ... castle... is great and Fran's character is spontaneous, outrageous, and make you laugh outloud.

I mistook this movie for &#34;Lakki...the Boy Who Could Fly ...&#34;, which I had barely remembered from years ago, and bought this by mistake. I do remember the original theatre-house trailers, my impression is that this film was more promoted than many others of the genre, the title alone obtaining &#34;classic&#34; status. I ended up enjoying this clean, uncomplicated script as much as the discombobulated movie I eventually found. Nothing too dramatic here, except for one extended bullying scene, retaining a light-hearted romantic-comedy 80's teen feel throughout. The primary relationship seems spontaneous and naturalistic, not..., er.... scripted. There's little dialogue between our young heroes. I was a bit bored throughout. However my heart was glad to see our protagonists together naturally in an easy, romantic embrace in the same school filmroom as a heterosexual couple doing the same behavior among the class of students, and all accepting smiles as if it was natural and commonplace, which, of course, it was (and should be) in the last scene. Ending sort of made up for the uneventful film, almost.\nReview Title: light-hearted feel-good teenage romance, (slight spoiler last scene alert)\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Too bad it's not available for streaming. I loved it! I'd say one of her most enjoyable movies. She's older (middle-older teen) in this, and it only offers more depth and romantic escapades for her fans! The setting (modern day pirate's boat & cove) and adventure, with her relationship with her old salt dad, and her budding interest in a handsome, young modern man from the city, is refreshing, the 60's appeal is fun, and her character is a rough & tumble tomboy that you'd better not mess with! However, she's feeling soft new feelings she hasn't experienced before, and the coming-of-age conflict is portrayed very well and really fun to watch. This is now one of my very favorite films of hers (along with Gypsy Girl). :) I had never seen this one before, so glad it's available on DVD at least!\nNow one of my very favorite Haley Mills films :)\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Ken Kwapis'], 'Producers': ['Howard W.

The contrast between her New York City apartment life and family (her mother is also well-portrayed and hilarious!), and the setting in the Eastern bloc ... castle... is great and Fran's character is spontaneous, outrageous, and make you laugh outloud.

A young couple's romance, family friendly. Our mystery woman arrives unseen in a small town where everyone knows everyone and mainstreet is still open. We learn she has inhereted the large, abandoned mansion. Catherine Bell is at once mysterious, spunky, a rebel, sweet, moral, kind-hearted, intimidating, cute, wise, vulnerable, tough, and all-around absolutely adorable and lovable. She produces the series, and I don't grow tired of the story. See why this is a much beloved modern tv-movie series for years.\nI love this movie & series!

I mistook this movie for &#34;Lakki...the Boy Who Could Fly ...&#34;, which I had barely remembered from years ago, and bought this by mistake. I do remember the original theatre-house trailers, my impression is that this film was more promoted than many others of the genre, the title alone obtaining &#34;classic&#34; status. I ended up enjoying this clean, uncomplicated script as much as the discombobulated movie I eventually found. Nothing too dramatic here, except for one extended bullying scene, retaining a light-hearted romantic-comedy 80's teen feel throughout. The primary relationship seems spontaneous and naturalistic, not..., er.... scripted. There's little dialogue between our young heroes. I was a bit bored throughout. However my heart was glad to see our protagonists together naturally in an easy, romantic embrace in the same school filmroom as a heterosexual couple doing the same behavior among the class of students, and all accepting smiles as if it was natural and commonplace, which, of course, it was (and should be) in the last scene. Ending sort of made up for the uneventful film, almost.\nlight-hearted feel-good teenage romance, (slight spoiler last scene alert)",

This 'new' disc sold by Amazon, with no DVD security features on the packaging, has numerous glitches; I suspect it's on all copies of this edition, I bought it new. It pauses momentarily, perhaps makes a sound, and continues. It's done this several times already having started the movie (it's on as I speak). It's widescreen and the picture quality is okay, but my roommate pointed out to me that it's overdubbed, that is the sound isn't always matching the lips; I checked the listing, and sure enough, it says \"dubbed\". I haven't tried the French-language soundtrack. I already purchased a used copy of a more expensive edition of this film by Anchor Bay. I'll be returning this one. I'm surprised at Amazon for selling an inferior version as new.<br /><br />--<br /><br />I received and am playing the disk I referred to [[ASIN:6305511861 The Car]] and when trying to review the Amazon system informed me I have already reviewed the product, being the other disk of inferior condition that wouldn't play. This, of course, is ridiculous. This disk, as I have anticipated, is superior and is playing without a single glitch. It was professionally produced with packaging as a DVD should be. So, definitely get this (ASIN 6305511861) rather than the cheaper disk on Amazon which began this review. Both are Region 1. I bought a used disk which is in better condition than the \"new\" one sold by Amazon. Neither Region 1 DVD disk of this movie has subtitles. I'm happy with the widescreen version included on the ASIN mentioned. The single caveat of this edition is that the packaging has a definite flaw:  the ring that holds the disk continues in a full circle even past the finger indentations, making it impossible to remove the disk easily even when holding down the middle button. You could scratch the disk trying to get it out, I had to hold it upside down and dig with the \"button finger\". I won't return it to the case. But the disk itself is great, and the one I recommend (Anchor Bay). Too bad it's out of print.\nReview Title: Glitched. Dubbed.

You'll identify with her easily. I love this theme, even in silly comedies.\nReview Title: Silly, laugh out loud comedy, but Fran Drescher's portrayal is simply superb.

A young couple's romance, family friendly. Our mystery woman arrives unseen in a small town where everyone knows everyone and mainstreet is still open. We learn she has inhereted the large, abandoned mansion. Catherine Bell is at once mysterious, spunky, a rebel, sweet, moral, kind-hearted, intimidating, cute, wise, vulnerable, tough, and all-around absolutely adorable and lovable. She produces the series, and I don't grow tired of the story. See why this is a much beloved modern tv-movie series for years.\nReview Title: I love this movie & series!

At a Danish boy's boarding school in the late 1970s, Bo and Kim are naive young classmates, whose friendship blossoms into a childlike love affair. When their friend is expelled for a prank involving lewd posters, the student body bands together to strike against the school and its authoritarian headmaster.

I mistook this movie for &#34;Lakki...the Boy Who Could Fly ...&#34;, which I had barely remembered from years ago, and bought this by mistake. I do remember the original theatre-house trailers, my impression is that this film was more promoted than many others of the genre, the title alone obtaining &#34;classic&#34; status. I ended up enjoying this clean, uncomplicated script as much as the discombobulated movie I eventually found. Nothing too dramatic here, except for one extended bullying scene, retaining a light-hearted romantic-comedy 80's teen feel throughout. The primary relationship seems spontaneous and naturalistic, not..., er.... scripted. There's little dialogue between our young heroes. I was a bit bored throughout. However my heart was glad to see our protagonists together naturally in an easy, romantic embrace in the same school filmroom as a heterosexual couple doing the same behavior among the class of students, and all accepting smiles as if it was natural and commonplace, which, of course, it was (and should be) in the last scene. Ending sort of made up for the uneventful film, almost.\nReview Title: light-hearted feel-good teenage romance, (slight spoiler last scene alert)\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
