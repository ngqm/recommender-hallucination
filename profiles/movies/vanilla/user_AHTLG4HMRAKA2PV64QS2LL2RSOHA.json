This is the second prequel to the original Star Wars trilogy takes place ten years after the events of Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace.  Nice action, great duels. Fun & exciting. Poor acting though and the CGI animation was still in the infancy stage. It was fun watching Anakin as a hot tempered impatient teenager.

I love scifi but many films and stories just can't cut it. I thought I would not even get through the first episode. But the more I watched it the more interesting it got. Each episode is its own story, but is also connected to the people and events of all the other episodes. The last eposide really got to me and was in tears. No spoilers, watch them all. The only dislike or warning is: no true details or explanations given for many things that happen in this show. very little true back stories or explanations.<br />If you found my  review helpful, kindly vote below so I can improve my future reviews.\nReview Title: Slow burn, but worth watching\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: My Spy\nReview Date: 2020/09/18\nCategories: Young Adult Audience, Comedy, Charming, Optimistic\nProduct Description: ['My Spy follows JJ, a hardened CIA operative (Dave Bautista), who has been demoted and finds himself at the mercy of a precocious 9-year old girl named Sophie (Chloe Coleman) after he is sent undercover to surveil her family.

Its a light, action, and amusing family comedy (with a bit of too much violence for younglings).<br />JJ is a hardened CIA spy that has been demoted and finds himself at the mercy of a precocious 9-year-old girl, named Sophie where he has been sent undercover begrudgingly to surveil her family. Despite his reluctance, JJ finds he is no match for Sophie's disarming charm and wit. There has been many similiar such stories before, but I found this one a bit refreshing & cute.

I dont wont to write any details or spoilers of the story, but I do wish they would have explored a bit more about the ghost life ( why he was there, what was the purpose, etc ) as it is an important part of the storyline.

There are so many cop shows today to choose from. Many of them are pretty simliar in style type murder.  I was a late comer to this show, but glad I started binge watching them. This series has a new Fresh twist for a crime show. The characters are amazing and there is great chemistry between Lucifer & Chloe. Tom Ellis as Lucifer is absolutely brilliant!!! His humor is infectious, and his relationships with the other characters are unique. The writers seem to deviate from the standard known text of bibles and religions and adjusts them to fit their narrative. Which I feel is a good thing. Its fun tv, not bible accuracy. Every episode comes up with an amazing plot and a moral value, which helps Lucifer learn more about human beings and of course His Dad.<br /><br />Tasteful, respectful, and charming as this show is, its most definately entertaining.<br /><br />Please click below vote if you found my review helpful to you so I may improve my other reviews  as well.\nReview Title: Fresh twist for a crime show\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: The Invisible Man (2020)\nReview Date: 2020/10/07\nCategories: Science Fiction, Suspense, Anxious, Harrowing\nProduct Description: ['\"The Invisible Man\" stars Emmy\u00ae winner Elisabeth Moss (\"Us,\" \"The Handmaid\\'s Tale\") as a woman who fears she is being hunted by the unseen presence of her abusive ex (Oliver Jackson-Cohen).']\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Leigh Whannell'], 'Producers': ['Jason Blum', 'Kylie Du Fresne'], 'Starring': ['Elisabeth Moss', 'Aldis Hodge', 'Storm Reid']}\nReview Text: This is another remake of a 120 year old movie originally written by H.G. Wells and is nothing alike. Many have attemted to rewrite the story based on this interesting concept. Elisabeth Moss performs her part very well, as she plays the victim again just like Handmaids Tale. The beginning of the movie is a slow burn, but eventually picks up on the suspense. Very little character development with no emotional connection to the main characters to make you care what happens to them. Overall, it was entertaining to watch for free, but not if you have to rent it for top dollar.\nReview Title: Was expecting at least a little more.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2020/10/20\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'frightening scenes', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Starring': ['Sonequa Martin-Green', 'Doug Jones', 'Anthony Rapp', 'Mary Wiseman', 'David Ajala', 'Wilson Cruz'], 'Studio': ['CBS']}\nReview Text: Sequels and spinoffs are very dissicult to pull off. Some shows and movies did not quite hit the mark. But I feel that CBS has continued the torch for us Star Trek fans. I have been watching Star Trek since the 1970's and some spinoffs did not do it for me. Discovery Season 1 was a fresh take in the Star Trek experience and still trekking steady as she goes into its third season, with episode one done very well. I guess this story line no feels familiar a bit to Star Trek Voyager being lost in a diffrent universe or time. I have confidence that this season will continue to entertain us Trekies.<br /><br />Live long & Prosper\nReview Title: CBS bodly going where no network has gone before!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2020/11/20\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'frightening scenes', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Barry J.

These episodes focus on the low ranking officers on one of the Starfleet\u2019s least important ships, the U.S.S. Cerritos.

This is the tale of an eight-year old boy who escapes the Warsaw Ghetto and for three years survives on his own in Nazi-occupied Poland could easy defy belief!  Run Boy Run is a film well worth watching and showing the true horrors of the Holocaust and World War II. Without giving away any storylines or spoilers and you can stomach this heavy drama filled movie, it is a must see. I like when these types of movies focus on one family or person, as it shows the individual struggle to survive during that time. My mother and father both survived and told me stories of such horror, so I can relate very well as they were young children during the war as well.\nReview Title: A must see film.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2020/11/29\nAverage Rating: 4.6\nProduct Details: {'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Terry Ingram', 'Sean McNamara', 'Siobhan Devine', 'Martin Wood', 'Anne Wheeler', 'Andy Mikita', 'Mike Rohl', 'Peter DeLuise', 'Alysse Leite-Rogers', 'Michael Robison'], 'Starring': ['Meghan Ory', 'Barbara Niven', 'Laci J Mailey']}\nReview Text: ( No Spoilers )<br />Abby returns to her hometown after hearing troubling news about the family inn facing foreclosure in the series premiere of this drama about a divorced mom dealing with her past.

I expected a cheesy sci fi film, but in the end I found it a bit entertaining. There is Lots of green alien blood and missing limbs. There is action, humors, sci fi, war, and some warm emotional moments. Overall, a nice paced film with a decent ending as far as a sci fi film can go. Overall, characters are from all walks of life and make positive contributions with the skills they have, including women who are assured leaders and kids who love science.<br />Not for younger kids, or people who are a bit squeamish. Parents should also know that there is foul language as well. \ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\nReview Title: \ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d Action, aliens, guts, and more... \ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2021/12/27\nAverage Rating: 4.9\nProduct Details: {'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Frank Capra'], 'Producers': ['Frank Capra'], 'Starring': ['James Stewart', 'Donna Reed', 'Lionel Barrymore'], 'Studio': ['Paramount Pictures']}\nReview Text: George Bailey as portrayed by James Stewart is the kind of everyman hero we can all identify with. He's got the everyday problems to be sure, raising and providing for a family, but he's got bigger problems than that. Fate has made him the rallying point of opposition in his small town of Bedford Falls to the \"richest and meanest man in town\", embodied in Lionel Barrymore.<br />George Bailey (James Stewart) is at the edge of financial ruin. He thinks his life has amounted to nothing and is about to jump off a bridge. An angel named Clarence is assigned to give George a second chance by showing him what if he was never born.<br /><br />This is an unabashed sentimental tear-jerker. The movie starts with George's life as it is. His dream is to travel the world and create great monuments. He is constantly dragged back to the unimpressive little Bedford Falls and the family Savings and Loans. He is a good guy who constantly does the right thing.<br />It has its uplifting conclusion and the theme that every life has its purpose in the great scheme of things. What if we had never existed?\nReview Title: One of the Most Beautiful Movies of the Cinema History Ever\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Each episode is its own story, but is also connected to the people and events of all the other episodes. The last eposide really got to me and was in tears. No spoilers, watch them all.

There are so many cop shows today to choose from. Many of them are pretty simliar in style type murder.  I was a late comer to this show, but glad I started binge watching them. This series has a new Fresh twist for a crime show. The characters are amazing and there is great chemistry between Lucifer & Chloe. Tom Ellis as Lucifer is absolutely brilliant!!! His humor is infectious, and his relationships with the other characters are unique. The writers seem to deviate from the standard known text of bibles and religions and adjusts them to fit their narrative. Which I feel is a good thing. Its fun tv, not bible accuracy. Every episode comes up with an amazing plot and a moral value, which helps Lucifer learn more about human beings and of course His Dad.<br /><br />Tasteful, respectful, and charming as this show is, its most definately entertaining.<br /><br />Please click below vote if you found my review helpful to you so I may improve my other reviews  as well.\nFresh twist for a crime show\nThe Invisible Man (2020)\nScience Fiction, Suspense, Anxious, Harrowing\n['\"The Invisible Man\" stars Emmy\u00ae winner Elisabeth Moss (\"Us,\" \"The Handmaid\\'s Tale\") as a woman who fears she is being hunted by the unseen presence of her abusive ex (Oliver Jackson-Cohen).']\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Leigh Whannell'], 'Producers': ['Jason Blum', 'Kylie Du Fresne'], 'Starring': ['Elisabeth Moss', 'Aldis Hodge', 'Storm Reid']}\nThis is another remake of a 120 year old movie originally written by H.G.

Elisabeth Moss performs her part very well, as she plays the victim again just like Handmaids Tale. The beginning of the movie is a slow burn, but eventually picks up on the suspense. Very little character development with no emotional connection to the main characters to make you care what happens to them.

Some shows and movies did not quite hit the mark. But I feel that CBS has continued the torch for us Star Trek fans. I have been watching Star Trek since the 1970's and some spinoffs did not do it for me. Discovery Season 1 was a fresh take in the Star Trek experience and still trekking steady as she goes into its third season, with episode one done very well. I guess this story line no feels familiar a bit to Star Trek Voyager being lost in a diffrent universe or time.

Without giving away any storylines or spoilers and you can stomach this heavy drama filled movie, it is a must see. I like when these types of movies focus on one family or person, as it shows the individual struggle to survive during that time.

Parents should also know that there is foul language as well. \ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\n\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d Action, aliens, guts, and more... \ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\n{'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Frank Capra'], 'Producers': ['Frank Capra'], 'Starring': ['James Stewart', 'Donna Reed', 'Lionel Barrymore'], 'Studio': ['Paramount Pictures']}\nGeorge Bailey as portrayed by James Stewart is the kind of everyman hero we can all identify with. He's got the everyday problems to be sure, raising and providing for a family, but he's got bigger problems than that. Fate has made him the rallying point of opposition in his small town of Bedford Falls to the \"richest and meanest man in town\", embodied in Lionel Barrymore.<br />George Bailey (James Stewart) is at the edge of financial ruin. He thinks his life has amounted to nothing and is about to jump off a bridge. An angel named Clarence is assigned to give George a second chance by showing him what if he was never born.<br /><br />This is an unabashed sentimental tear-jerker. The movie starts with George's life as it is. His dream is to travel the world and create great monuments. He is constantly dragged back to the unimpressive little Bedford Falls and the family Savings and Loans. He is a good guy who constantly does the right thing.<br />It has its uplifting conclusion and the theme that every life has its purpose in the great scheme of things.

I love scifi but many films and stories just can't cut it. I thought I would not even get through the first episode. But the more I watched it the more interesting it got. Each episode is its own story, but is also connected to the people and events of all the other episodes. The last eposide really got to me and was in tears. No spoilers, watch them all. The only dislike or warning is: no true details or explanations given for many things that happen in this show. very little true back stories or explanations.<br />If you found my  review helpful, kindly vote below so I can improve my future reviews.\nReview Title: Slow burn, but worth watching\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: My Spy\nReview Date: 2020/09/18\nCategories: Young Adult Audience, Comedy, Charming, Optimistic\nProduct Description: ['My Spy follows JJ, a hardened CIA operative (Dave Bautista), who has been demoted and finds himself at the mercy of a precocious 9-year old girl named Sophie (Chloe Coleman) after he is sent undercover to surveil her family.

There are so many cop shows today to choose from. Many of them are pretty simliar in style type murder.  I was a late comer to this show, but glad I started binge watching them. This series has a new Fresh twist for a crime show. The characters are amazing and there is great chemistry between Lucifer & Chloe. Tom Ellis as Lucifer is absolutely brilliant!!! His humor is infectious, and his relationships with the other characters are unique. The writers seem to deviate from the standard known text of bibles and religions and adjusts them to fit their narrative. Which I feel is a good thing. Its fun tv, not bible accuracy. Every episode comes up with an amazing plot and a moral value, which helps Lucifer learn more about human beings and of course His Dad.<br /><br />Tasteful, respectful, and charming as this show is, its most definately entertaining.<br /><br />Please click below vote if you found my review helpful to you so I may improve my other reviews  as well.\nReview Title: Fresh twist for a crime show\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: The Invisible Man (2020)\nReview Date: 2020/10/07\nCategories: Science Fiction, Suspense, Anxious, Harrowing\nProduct Description: ['\"The Invisible Man\" stars Emmy\u00ae winner Elisabeth Moss (\"Us,\" \"The Handmaid\\'s Tale\") as a woman who fears she is being hunted by the unseen presence of her abusive ex (Oliver Jackson-Cohen).']\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Leigh Whannell'], 'Producers': ['Jason Blum', 'Kylie Du Fresne'], 'Starring': ['Elisabeth Moss', 'Aldis Hodge', 'Storm Reid']}\nReview Text: This is another remake of a 120 year old movie originally written by H.G. Wells and is nothing alike. Many have attemted to rewrite the story based on this interesting concept. Elisabeth Moss performs her part very well, as she plays the victim again just like Handmaids Tale. The beginning of the movie is a slow burn, but eventually picks up on the suspense. Very little character development with no emotional connection to the main characters to make you care what happens to them.

Some shows and movies did not quite hit the mark. But I feel that CBS has continued the torch for us Star Trek fans.

Discovery Season 1 was a fresh take in the Star Trek experience and still trekking steady as she goes into its third season, with episode one done very well. I guess this story line no feels familiar a bit to Star Trek Voyager being lost in a diffrent universe or time.

I expected a cheesy sci fi film, but in the end I found it a bit entertaining. There is Lots of green alien blood and missing limbs. There is action, humors, sci fi, war, and some warm emotional moments. Overall, a nice paced film with a decent ending as far as a sci fi film can go. Overall, characters are from all walks of life and make positive contributions with the skills they have, including women who are assured leaders and kids who love science.<br />Not for younger kids, or people who are a bit squeamish. Parents should also know that there is foul language as well. \ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\nReview Title: \ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d Action, aliens, guts, and more... \ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7d\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2021/12/27\nAverage Rating: 4.9\nProduct Details: {'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Frank Capra'], 'Producers': ['Frank Capra'], 'Starring': ['James Stewart', 'Donna Reed', 'Lionel Barrymore'], 'Studio': ['Paramount Pictures']}\nReview Text: George Bailey as portrayed by James Stewart is the kind of everyman hero we can all identify with. He's got the everyday problems to be sure, raising and providing for a family, but he's got bigger problems than that. Fate has made him the rallying point of opposition in his small town of Bedford Falls to the \"richest and meanest man in town\", embodied in Lionel Barrymore.<br />George Bailey (James Stewart) is at the edge of financial ruin. He thinks his life has amounted to nothing and is about to jump off a bridge. An angel named Clarence is assigned to give George a second chance by showing him what if he was never born.<br /><br />This is an unabashed sentimental tear-jerker. The movie starts with George's life as it is. His dream is to travel the world and create great monuments. He is constantly dragged back to the unimpressive little Bedford Falls and the family Savings and Loans. He is a good guy who constantly does the right thing.<br />It has its uplifting conclusion and the theme that every life has its purpose in the great scheme of things. What if we had never existed?\nReview Title: One of the Most Beautiful Movies of the Cinema History Ever\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

    "text": "I like this new season and this animated comedy has found a new degree of confidence, both in itself and in its role in the franchise as a whole. While the friendship between Ensigns Beckett Mariner and Bradward Boimler continues to occupy the center stage, this season sees the crew of the Cerritos and the California Class at large further explored. Looking for copious Star Trek allusions, alien sex, and unexpected twists of perspective? Lower Decks season 3 has them all!<br /><br />\"Star Trek: Lower Decks\" season 3 finds the animated series, set in the late-\"Next Generation\" period after the events of \"Star Trek: Nemesis,\" continuing the stride it hit in season two. The jokes are funnier, the characters continuously on-point, and the storytelling, while certainly goofy, very much in-line with the basic tenets of \"Star Trek.\"",
