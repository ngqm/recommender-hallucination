When clean-cut Hal Ditmar (Hawaii Five-O's James MacArthur), son of a wealthy movie producer (James Daly), gets into a fight with a movie theater manager (Whit Bissell) no one believes he acted in self-defense. With the police concerned that they have another juvenile delinquent on their hands, Hal's mother (Kim Hunter) thinks the problem lies in the growing gulf between father and son. Heartfelt and effective, Frankenheimer's already sure hand at the helm and the talent that star MacArthur shared with his illustrious mother Helen Hayes buoy The Young Stranger above the common ground of 1950's delinquency dramas.\"]\nAverage Rating: 4.0\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Drama', 'Format': 'NTSC', 'Contributor': 'James Mac Arthur, Kim Hunter, James Daly, James Gregory, Jeffrey Silver, Whit Bissell', 'Language': 'English', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 24 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.33:1', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.5 x 0.5 inches; 2.12 Ounces', 'Media Format': 'NTSC', 'Run time': '1 hour and 24 minutes', 'Release date': 'February 16, 2012', 'Actors': 'James Mac Arthur, Kim Hunter, James Daly, James Gregory, Jeffrey Silver, Whit Bissell', 'Studio': 'Warner Archive', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: Great condition and good movie\nReview Title: good movie\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
