If you were a fan of Dynasty or still are, then purchase the series in its entirety. There is nothing disappointing about this show and it leaves you always looking for more after each episode.The Dynasty cast and show bring you into their world of intrigue, plots, schemes and behind the scenes deceptions and not so above board cut throat business deals.
