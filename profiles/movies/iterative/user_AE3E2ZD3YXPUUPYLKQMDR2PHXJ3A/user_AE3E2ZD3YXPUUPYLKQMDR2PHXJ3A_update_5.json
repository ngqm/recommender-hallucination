If you were a fan of Dynasty or still are, then purchase the series in its entirety. There is nothing disappointing about this show and it leaves you always looking for more after each episode.The Dynasty cast and show bring you into their world of intrigue, plots, schemes and behind the scenes deceptions and not so above board cut throat business deals.

Music Director Antonio Pappano conducts La traviata for the first time at Covent Garden. American oprano Ren\u00e9e Fleming returns to Covent Garden to sing Violetta for the first time with The Royal Opera. La traviata was first performed at the Teatro La Fenice, Venice in March 1853.\", 'Press Reviews', '\"Antonio Pappano takes charge of this revival, searching out the meaning of Verdi\\'s score in a supple, sentient reading that sweeps you along.\"', '(The Guardian', ')', '\"At the age of 50, [Fleming] still looks very good in the role of the doomed courtesan...[she] sounds good, too, singing with consistent skill...There\\'s a sincerity to Maltese tenor Joseph Calleja\\'s portrayal of Alfredo which gives it more spontaneity than his American colleagues supply...Stronger than the vocals is the conducting of Antonio Pappano, which possesses a natural stylishness and fluency. \"', '(BBC Music Magazine', '\u2605\u2605\u2605)', '\"I was sniffy about her first night but this DVD comes from later in the run, by which time she had found an uncharacteristic emotional freedom. She is still the prima donna playing the part, but the beautiful sounds she makes, especially in the Act One finale and the Act Two party, are well worth hearing, and the high-quality film-work puts us right at the heart of the action. \"', '(The Financial Times', '\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605)', '\"... this is a sensible, believable, attractive presentation that is more in line with Verdi than with the idiocies of Regietheater...Vocally, [Fleming] is on good form at almost every turn... Calleja must sound authentic enough as an Italianate tenor for anyone...I always have the impression that [Pappano] works with the singers rather than challenging them to a duel. The chorus and orchestra respond fittingly to his direction. \"', '(International Record Review', ')', 'Cast', 'Ren\u00e9e Fleming', '(Violetta)', 'Joseph Calleja', '(Alfredo)', 'Thomas Hampson', '(Germont)', 'The Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Antonio Pappano', 'Production', 'Company:', 'The Royal Opera', 'Stage Director:', 'Richard Eyre', 'Disc Information', 'Catalogue Number:', 'OA1040D', 'Date of Performance:', '2009', 'Running Time:', '135 minutes', 'Sound:', '2.0LPCM + 5.1(5.0) DTS', 'Aspect Ratio:', '16:9 Anamorphic', 'Subtitles:', 'EN, FR, DE, ES, IT', 'Label:', 'Opus Arte']\n{'Genre': 'Music Video & Concerts, Classical / Opera & Vocal', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, NTSC, Widescreen, Classical', 'Contributor': 'Thomas Hampson, Richard Wiegold, Antonio Pappano, Joseph Calleja, Richard Eyre, Eddie Wade, Kostas Smoriginas, Renee Fleming, Royal Opera Chorus, Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, Monika-Evelin LiivThomas Hampson, Richard Wiegold, Antonio Pappano, Joseph Calleja, Richard Eyre, Eddie Wade, Kostas Smoriginas, Renee Fleming, Royal Opera Chorus, Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, Monika-Evelin Liiv  See more', 'Language': 'Italian', 'Number Of Discs': '1', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.78:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 2.72 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'BOPU1040DVD', 'Director': 'Richard Eyre', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, NTSC, Widescreen, Classical', 'Run time': '2 hours and 34 minutes', 'Release date': 'May 31, 2011', 'Actors': 'Renee Fleming, Joseph Calleja, Thomas Hampson, Monika-Evelin Liiv, Eddie Wade', 'Subtitles': 'English, French, German, Spanish, Italian', 'Studio': 'Opus Arte', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nPurchased as a gift for a birthday and she loved it.
