I enjoy going back to all the lavishness and the story lines and the entire cast leaves you aching for more regardless of how many times you see it over and over. I am a die hard fan of the Dynasty series and Knots Landing series that have fallen into days gone by. Owning them all brings them back and if your a fan too you will not be disappointed.\nReview Title: Wonderfully digitally remastered series...\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Music Director Antonio Pappano conducts La traviata for the first time at Covent Garden.

She is still the prima donna playing the part, but the beautiful sounds she makes, especially in the Act One finale and the Act Two party, are well worth hearing, and the high-quality film-work puts us right at the heart of the action. \"', '(The Financial Times', '\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605)', '\"... this is a sensible, believable, attractive presentation that is more in line with Verdi than with the idiocies of Regietheater...Vocally, [Fleming] is on good form at almost every turn... Calleja must sound authentic enough as an Italianate tenor for anyone...I always have the impression that [Pappano] works with the singers rather than challenging them to a duel.
