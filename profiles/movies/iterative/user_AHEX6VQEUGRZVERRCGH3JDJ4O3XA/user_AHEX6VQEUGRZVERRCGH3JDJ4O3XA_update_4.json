Edwards'], 'Starring': ['Mike Vogel', 'Rachelle Lefevre', 'Natalie Martinez'], 'Studio': ['CBS']}\nReview Text: Some of these disaster series focus on the disaster itself, but this series focuses on human dysfunction. This TV series almost ignores the Dome and focuses instead on the soap opera of humankind greedily fighting amongst themselves for control. I watched every episode over a few nights, and was unimpressed with the writing, the acting, or even the implausible storyline. Perhaps I don't really enjoy programs aimed at the family demographic.\nReview Title: Meandering\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Mike Judge'], 'Producers': ['Mike Judge', 'Elysa Koplovitz'], 'Starring': ['Luke Wilson', 'Maya Rudolph', 'Dax Shepard'], 'Studio': ['20TH CENTURY FOX']}\nIt was a great concept borrowed from Woody Allen's Sleeper ( 1973) but not well executed. The Director expected the viewing audience to be as stupid as the general theme of the movie. It made no sense to use a hooker as the female protagonist. The updated concept is promising, but the execution was just terrible.\nIdiocracy\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['John Singleton'], 'Producers': ['Jane Bartelme', 'Jeremy Bell', 'Patrick Crowley', 'Doug Davison', 'Ellen Goldsmith-Vein', 'Wolfgang Hammer', 'Anthony Katagas', 'Dan Lautner', 'Roy Lee'], 'Starring': ['Taylor Lautner', 'Lily Collins', 'Alfred Molina'], 'Studio': ['IMDB Freedive']}\nThe acting in this movie is cardboard. Lautner and Collins seem suited to be supporting actors, but not leads in any sense. This movie's acting was similar to watching a high school play.\nTypical teen formula\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Jon Cassar', 'Brad Turner', 'Milan Cheylov', 'Bryan Spicer', 'Stephen Hopkins', 'Ian Toynton', 'Frederick King Keller', 'James Whitmore Jr.', 'Tim Iacofano', 'Kevin Hooks'], 'Starring': ['Kiefer Sutherland', 'Kim Raver', 'Mary Lynn Rajskub']}\nActing, script, suspense does not disappoint.  Of course, viewing without commercials is a huge plus.  This was a TV series that should never have ended.\nNothing better\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Jack Bender', 'Peter Leto', 'David Barrett', 'Sergio Mimica-Gezzan', 'Kari Skogland', 'Eriq La Salle', 'Edward Ornelas', 'Peter Weller', 'Roxann Dawson', 'Paul A.
