  "reference_summary": "{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Mike Judge'], 'Producers': ['Mike Judge', 'Elysa Koplovitz'], 'Starring': ['Luke Wilson', 'Maya Rudolph', 'Dax Shepard'], 'Studio': ['20TH CENTURY FOX']}\nIt was a great concept borrowed from Woody Allen's Sleeper ( 1973) but not well executed. The Director expected the viewing audience to be as stupid as the general theme of the movie. It made no sense to use a hooker as the female protagonist. The updated concept is promising, but the execution was just terrible.\nIdiocracy\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['John Singleton'], 'Producers': ['Jane Bartelme', 'Jeremy Bell', 'Patrick Crowley', 'Doug Davison', 'Ellen Goldsmith-Vein', 'Wolfgang Hammer', 'Anthony Katagas', 'Dan Lautner', 'Roy Lee'], 'Starring': ['Taylor Lautner', 'Lily Collins', 'Alfred Molina'], 'Studio': ['IMDB Freedive']}\nThe acting in this movie is cardboard. Lautner and Collins seem suited to be supporting actors, but not leads in any sense. This movie's acting was similar to watching a high school play.\nTypical teen formula\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Jon Cassar', 'Brad Turner', 'Milan Cheylov', 'Bryan Spicer', 'Stephen Hopkins', 'Ian Toynton', 'Frederick King Keller', 'James Whitmore Jr.', 'Tim Iacofano', 'Kevin Hooks'], 'Starring': ['Kiefer Sutherland', 'Kim Raver', 'Mary Lynn Rajskub']}\nActing, script, suspense does not disappoint.  Of course, viewing without commercials is a huge plus.  This was a TV series that should never have ended.\nNothing better\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Jack Bender', 'Peter Leto', 'David Barrett', 'Sergio Mimica-Gezzan', 'Kari Skogland', 'Eriq La Salle', 'Edward Ornelas', 'Peter Weller', 'Roxann Dawson', 'Paul A. Edwards'], 'Starring': ['Mike Vogel', 'Rachelle Lefevre', 'Natalie Martinez'], 'Studio': ['CBS']}\nSome of these disaster series focus on the disaster itself, but this series focuses on human dysfunction. This TV series almost ignores the Dome and focuses instead on the soap opera of humankind greedily fighting amongst themselves for control. I watched every episode over a few nights, and was unimpressed with the writing, the acting, or even the implausible storyline. Perhaps I don't really enjoy programs aimed at the family demographic.\nMeandering\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Michael Smith', 'Anton Cropper', 'Christopher Misiano', 'Kevin Bray', 'Roger Kumble', 'Silver Tree', 'John Scott', 'Cherie Nowlan', 'Gabriel Macht', 'Patrick J.

Adams', 'Rick Hoffman'], 'Studio': ['USA']}\nI like what I like. I am not a film critic, but the series appeals to me. Can't wait until Season 3 appears on Amazon Prime.\nGreat show\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Brian Percival', 'David Evans', 'Philip John', 'Andy Goddard', 'Catherine Morshead', 'Minkie Spiro', 'Brian Kelly', 'Michael Engler', 'Ben Bolt', 'Ashley Pearce'], 'Starring': ['Huge Bonneville', 'Michelle Dockery', 'Maggie Smith'], 'Studio': ['BritBox']}\nIt took awhile to understand the dialect, but it is a great show for period entertainment. The acting seem very authentic.\nInteresting\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Norberto Barba', \"Terrence O'Hara\", 'Eric Laneuville', 'Aaron Lipstadt', 'Peter Werner', 'David Solomon', 'Steven DePaul', 'John Behring', 'Darnell Martin', 'Karen Gaviola'], 'Starring': ['David Giuntoli', 'Bitsie Tulloch', 'Russell Hornsby']}\nInteresting twist on cop procedural shows. The weson transformations are funny and seamlessly detailed. The premise gets old in later seasons, but is fresh and interesting in Season 1.\nNice special effects\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Michael Lehmann', 'Scott Winant', 'Daniel Minahan', 'Howard Deutch', 'John Dahl', 'Michael Ruscio', 'Anthony Hemingway', 'Alan Ball', 'Lesli Linka Glatter', 'David Petrarca'], 'Producers': ['Alan Ball', 'Alexander Woo', 'Carol Dunn Trussell'], 'Starring': ['Anna Paquin', 'Stephen Moyer', 'Ryan Kwanten'], 'Studio': ['HBO']}\nGreat show to watch without commercials via streaming.\nFive Stars\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Jon Cassar', 'Milan Cheylov', 'Adam Kane', 'Omar Madha'], 'Producers': ['Jon Cassar', 'Robert Cochran', 'Ashley Contino', 'Manny Coto', 'David Fury', 'Howard Gordon', 'Brian Grazer'], 'Studio': ['FOX']}\nI thought this newest series was more predictable than the previous seasons. It didn't make sense to me that disgraced Agent Kate Morgan - relieved of her duties and reassigned to the US - would still be authorized to wander around the facility and involve herself in a major investigation of Jack Bauer. In real  life, a Security detail would be at her desk while she packed up her personal items before she was escorted from the building. This rambling artistic license by the writers to allow Morgan to become almost a rouge agent on the job stretched credibility to me. On the other hand, I was glad to see the series included more of the real-world violence that had been edited out of the final few seasons of the previous show.  The US government had previously complained that the show suggested that government agencies routinely violated the human rights of suspects during questioning.\nEnjoyable entertainment\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Jack Bender', 'Peter Leto', 'David Barrett', 'Sergio Mimica-Gezzan', 'Kari Skogland', 'Eriq La Salle', 'Edward Ornelas', 'Peter Weller', 'Roxann Dawson', 'Paul A.
