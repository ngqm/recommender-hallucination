  "reference_summary": "{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Mike Judge'], 'Producers': ['Mike Judge', 'Elysa Koplovitz'], 'Starring': ['Luke Wilson', 'Maya Rudolph', 'Dax Shepard'], 'Studio': ['20TH CENTURY FOX']}\nIt was a great concept borrowed from Woody Allen's Sleeper ( 1973) but not well executed. The Director expected the viewing audience to be as stupid as the general theme of the movie. It made no sense to use a hooker as the female protagonist. The updated concept is promising, but the execution was just terrible.\nIdiocracy\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['John Singleton'], 'Producers': ['Jane Bartelme', 'Jeremy Bell', 'Patrick Crowley', 'Doug Davison', 'Ellen Goldsmith-Vein', 'Wolfgang Hammer', 'Anthony Katagas', 'Dan Lautner', 'Roy Lee'], 'Starring': ['Taylor Lautner', 'Lily Collins', 'Alfred Molina'], 'Studio': ['IMDB Freedive']}\nThe acting in this movie is cardboard. Lautner and Collins seem suited to be supporting actors, but not leads in any sense. This movie's acting was similar to watching a high school play.\nTypical teen formula\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Jon Cassar', 'Brad Turner', 'Milan Cheylov', 'Bryan Spicer', 'Stephen Hopkins', 'Ian Toynton', 'Frederick King Keller', 'James Whitmore Jr.', 'Tim Iacofano', 'Kevin Hooks'], 'Starring': ['Kiefer Sutherland', 'Kim Raver', 'Mary Lynn Rajskub']}\nActing, script, suspense does not disappoint.
