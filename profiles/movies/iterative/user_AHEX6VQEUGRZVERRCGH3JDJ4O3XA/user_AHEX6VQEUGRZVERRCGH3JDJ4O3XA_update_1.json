The Director expected the viewing audience to be as stupid as the general theme of the movie. It made no sense to use a hooker as the female protagonist. The updated concept is promising, but the execution was just terrible.\nReview Title: Idiocracy\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
