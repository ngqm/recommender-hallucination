Relocating to the picturesque village of Portwenn is not what this doctor ordered. After developing a crippling fear of blood, hotshot London surgeon Martin Ellingham (Martin Clunes,', 'Men Behaving Badly', ') reluctantly retrains as a GP and opens a practice in the quirky seaside town, where he quickly offends the villagers with his dour and dismissive bedside manner.  In these five complete series, Doc Martin catches the eye of the most beautiful woman in Portwenn (Caroline Catz,', 'Murder in Suburbia', '), tests the patience of his long-suffering aunt (Stephanie Cole,', 'Tenko', '), and repeatedly hurts feelings as he heals bodies. The two feature-length movies reveal the character\u2019s first incarnation as Dr. Martin Bamford. He\u2019s still ornery but less socially inept, an obstetrician fleeing to the coastal village to reassess his marriage and career.  Martin Clunes delivers an uproarious lead performance, aided by outstanding supporting casts, in this award-winning fish-out-of-water comedy.']\n{'Genre': 'Comedy', 'Format': 'Box set, Widescreen, Multiple Formats, NTSC, Color', 'Contributor': 'Absolom, Joe, Clunes, Martin, Catz, Caroline, McNeice, Ian, Ferguson, Craig', 'Language': 'English', 'Number Of Discs': '13', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '5.5 x 3.6 x 7.7 inches; 15.2 Ounces', 'Item model number': '21388', 'Director': 'Ferguson, Craig', 'Media Format': 'Box set, Widescreen, Multiple Formats, NTSC, Color', 'Run time': '32 hours and 45 minutes', 'Release date': 'May 7, 2013', 'Actors': 'Clunes, Martin, Catz, Caroline, McNeice, Ian, Absolom, Joe', 'Studio': 'ACORN MEDIA', 'Number of discs': '13'}\nI really love this series..<br />It is funny, the timing is great.<br />Well written and boy, I want to live in a village like Portwenn.<br /><br />The only criticism I have as I move through this series is more on the portrayal of alternative medicine.  Obviously Doc Martin is strickly Left brain my way or the highway medical science is best.  And the series generally portrays any alternative more natural theories as utterly quackish  I feel that I had to say something because in all honesty I do not feel that natural alternative medicine is portrayed very fairly.  It is completely maligned and mocked while Doc Ellingham is generally won out to be right all the time.<br /><br />I just wanted folks to know that this is not exacty a balanced portrayal.  Yes, some alternative theories can be take to extreme.. but so can very left brain approaches in medicine and science.<br /><br />For example.. overuse of antibiotics.  Antibiotics are useful but overprescribed generally by doctors for everything.  He is somewhat more mannered that Edith... his ex.. who is VERY elitist.<br /><br />Anyway.. that is my 2 cents\nI really love this series\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Grant Baldwin'], 'Producers': ['Jenny Rustemeyer'], 'Starring': ['Jonathan Bloom', 'Tristram Stuart', 'Dana Gunders']}\nThis is a MUST WATCH Documentary!.  I have been wanting to see this for a while now because I know it is a horrendous issue. Furthermore, I know I am IMMENSELY GUILTY for wasting food.<br /><br />I am striving to change my ways and save $$ on food, on working not to waste so much food and to help bring awareness to this issue.<br /><br />I know &#34;shaming&#34; folks is frowned upon.. but maybe this is something we should shame .  People are supposidly going hungry and the question is WHY?<br /><br />It is our perceptions of food.  Those perceptions are cultivated by the ADVERTISING industry and so I think they need to do a lot more to focus on this. I think fast food companies, and markets and anyone that produces food needs to take responsibility for and UNDO the damage they have done.!\nMUST WATCH DOCUMENTARY.  !!!!\nPlanet X Nibiru and the Anunnaki\nSpecial Interest\n['Lloyd Pye reveals information regarding the genetic manipulation of the human species by an alien race from another planet.

It is hard not to though.<br />No, this isn't a &#34;scary&#34; Halloween movie , but it is about a ghost.  It is about a lot more.<br />It is meditative.  If you are in for an action flick.  This isn't it.<br /><br />But it is VERY good.  Give it a chance.  If you are in a calm, meditative and contemplative space this is for you.  Open yourself up to the quiet of this film.<br /><br />I won't give the plot away.

The youngest of 3, her father encouraged her to go into medicine, not nursing , like her older sister.  My parents divorced in 1977 (and my father, despite his own weaknesses was a nice good man).  My mother ended up raising me by herself.  I had my own personal struggles growing up but feeling inferior to a boy or a man was not one of them.  Both my parents loved me and gave me all they could.  I didn't really identify with the \"Feminist\" struggle although I appreciated it intellectually. I was active in the Pro Choice movement as a right for women to control their own bodies.  However, it was the more militant feminism of the 90s that unfortunately turned me away from the Feminist movement and I felt that a lot of the issues got lost among fighting over political  correct speech, endlessly talking about how men are evil patriarchal rapists...  So.. it was nice to return to the context on which the real women's struggle was about.<br /><br />It is hard to sympathise with a woman in the United states that generally (generally) has it easy.. while in places like India... women are STILL struggling for basic dignity and respect.. Or in Afganistan where the Taliban is coming back into power to oppress once again.. or in Saudi Arabia .... and while yes, the United States is losing the battle with the Pro Choice movement..... I fear it is because women in the US have lost the path... fighting over silly things rather than critically important ones... Unfortunately it is about \"branding your message\" sorry to say that..<br /><br />I don't demonize women who wanted to be homemakers. I think opportunties should be available for all women.. but that includes NOT being expected to take on big roles just because people like Gloria fought for that.. it wasn't JUST so all girls would desire to be president but they would also have the dignity of staying at home and raising children if that is their CHOICE...  again.. it is about CHOICE and about our personal awareness of what we want, the realities of what is  biologically available...  as sucky that may be...<br /><br />Overall, very enjoyable and inspiring.\nNice review of the woman's movement\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium', 'English Dialogue Boost: Low', 'Italiano', '\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e', 'Portugu\u00eas', 'Deutsch', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a)', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', 'Polski', '\u010ce\u0161tina', 'Magyar', 'Fran\u00e7ais'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', '\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629', '\u010ce\u0161tina', 'Dansk', 'Deutsch', '\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a)', 'Suomi', 'Filipino', 'Fran\u00e7ais', '\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea', '\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940', 'Magyar', 'Indonesia', 'Italiano', '\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e', '\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4', 'Norsk Bokm\u00e5l', 'Nederlands', 'Polski', 'Portugu\u00eas (Brasil)', 'Portugu\u00eas (Portugal)', 'Rom\u00e2n\u0103', '\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439', 'Svenska', '\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bcd', '\u0c24\u0c46\u0c32\u0c41\u0c17\u0c41', '\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22', 'T\u00fcrk\u00e7e', '\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7b80\u4f53\uff09', '\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7e41\u9ad4\uff09'], 'Directors': ['Andrew Patterson'], 'Producers': ['Adam Dietrich', 'Melissa Kirkendall', 'James Montague'], 'Starring': ['Sierra McCormick', 'Jake Horowitz', 'Gail Cronauer'], 'Studio': ['Amazon Studios']}\nI love this.<br />This film really transports you to the 1950s.
