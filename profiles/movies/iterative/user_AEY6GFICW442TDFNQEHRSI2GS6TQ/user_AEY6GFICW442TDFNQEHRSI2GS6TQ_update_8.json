The story of Britain's King Henry VIII (Jonathan Rhys Meyers),\", 'The Tudors', \"is a dynamic history of a kingdom whose role on the 16th century world stage seems largely defined by Henry's narcissistic whims. Season two is very much taken up with Henry's determination to break free of papal authority in Rome and establish himself as head of England's church--all because he seeks to divorce Queen Catherine (Maria Doyle Kennedy) and marry Anne Boleyn (Natalie Dormer). Meanwhile, poor Catherine is kept locked away from court, unable to see her daughter Mary (Sarah Bolger) but refusing to relinquish her throne despite such punishment. As for Anne, she enjoys Henry's passion and commitment, but only to a point. When Henry marries her (in a union not recognized by Rome nor many British subjects) and she does not produce a male heir, his fickle attentions begin to wander, and a grand power play by Anne's father, Thomas Boleyn (Nick Dunning) begins to unravel. In time, Henry's focus shifts to soon-to-be third wife Jane Seymour (Anita Briem), whom the king sees as a symbol of his own redemption after the complications of his love life to date. Toward the end of\", 'The Complete Second Season', \", all the hints that Henry's lack of scruples is leading to a full-scale psychological breakdown begin to show, manifest in his many cruelties and--at the last minute--a clear sign of his notorious gluttony to come. Other stories woven into the colorful, lustful, intrigue-driven season two concern the fate of Henry's one-time mentor Sir Thomas More (Jeremy Northam), who refuses to cooperate with Henry's attempted separation from the Catholic faith and pays dearly for it. The pope himself (Peter O'Toole) turns up in sometimes near-comical responses to the king's intransigence, and the untimely fate of many interesting characters during Henry's wrathful sweep of his court proves a shocking development mid-season. All the actors are first-rate, even down to the smallest roles, and the show's spare but compelling use of nudity and sex scenes makes\", 'The Tudors', 'powerful adult entertainment.', '--Tom Keogh']\n{'Genre': 'Drama/Television, Television/British Television', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Closed-captioned, Color, Widescreen, NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Padraic Delaney, Jeremy Podeswa, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Henry Cavill, Maria Doyle Kennedy, Michael Hirst, Natalie Dormer, Nick Dunning, Jon Amiel, Sarah Bolger, Ciaran Donnelly, Anthony Brophy, James Frain, Colm McCarthy, Dearbhla Walsh, Max Brown, Guy Carleton, Jeremy NorthamPadraic Delaney, Jeremy Podeswa, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Henry Cavill, Maria Doyle Kennedy, Michael Hirst, Natalie Dormer, Nick Dunning, Jon Amiel, Sarah Bolger, Ciaran Donnelly, Anthony Brophy, James Frain, Colm McCarthy, Dearbhla Walsh, Max Brown, Guy Carleton, J\u2026  See more', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround), English (Dolby Digital 5.1), Unqualified, Spanish (Mono)', 'Number Of Discs': '4', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.66 x 5.41 x 7.79 inches; 11.2 Ounces', 'Item model number': '4444125', 'Director': 'Ciaran Donnelly, Colm McCarthy, Dearbhla Walsh, Jeremy Podeswa, Jon Amiel', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Closed-captioned, Color, Widescreen, NTSC', 'Run time': '9 hours and 2 minutes', 'Release date': 'January 6, 2009', 'Actors': 'Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Henry Cavill, James Frain, Anthony Brophy, Sarah Bolger', 'Dubbed': 'Spanish', 'Studio': 'Showtime Ent.', 'Writers': 'Michael Hirst', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '4'}\na more sensual take on Henry 8's first two marraiges and court... a sexy romp!\nFive Stars\nAustenland\nKeri Russell  (Actor),     JJ Field  (Actor),     Jerusha Hess  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Studio Specials, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, All Sony Pictures Titles\n['Jane Hayes\u2019s (Keri Russell) adoration of all things Jane Austen is complicating her love life.
