Beckinsale's Emma was overly moody and had none of the light cheerfulness of Austen's Emma (or Ms. Paltrow's for that matter). Mark Stong is not Jeremey Northrup but he is VERY good. Unfortunately, this movie never establishes that Mr. Knightly is a daily presence in the Woodhouse household (i.e., compare with the Northrup-Paltrow version), which is critical to understanding the relationship between Mr. Knightly and Emma. Indeed, their love for each other is nearly a shocker in this version coming in its last 10 minutes. If you are an Emma fan, you may find this film a disappointment. In general, I prefer Ms. Beckinsale over Ms. Paltrow but Ms. Paltrow's film is a better Reader's Digest adaptation of this lengthly and rich novel. I wonder if modern movie/DVD audiences have the patience for a longer 4 and 6 hour versions of this novel akin to what has been done for Pride & Prejudice by the BBC and A&E, respectively. Indeed, the latest 2-hour version of P&P by Hollywood is a bare skeleton of that incredible story.\nNot quite Miss Jane's Emma\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'frightening scenes', 'smoking'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Peter Jackson'], 'Producers': ['Peter Jackson', 'Fran Walsh', 'Carolynne Cunningham', 'Zane Weiner'], 'Starring': ['Sir Ian McKellen', 'Martin Freeman', 'Richard Armitage']}\nWhile I appreciate bringing elements of the appendices of LOTR into the Hobbit movies, beginning with this one, this movie is misguided in vision and execution.  Trying to craft another Aragorn out of Thorin is silly and disingenuous to the spirit of the dwarves.  Making this more about Thorin and not Bilbo is also not in keeping with the core elements of this story.  And then, all those chase scenes!  There were too many, and they way, way were too long. I stopped watching the movie for awhile.  If this keeps up, this series of films will be reminescent of the second Star Wars series with the young Anakin - and that series was a disaster in story telling.\nWay too many tedious chases\nMarvel's The Avengers\nScience Fiction, Adventure, Ambitious, Fantastic\n['Marvel\u2019s The Avengers is the Super Hero team up of a lifetime, featuring iconic Marvel Super Heroes Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye and Black Widow.']\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Joss Whedon'], 'Producers': ['Kevin Feige'], 'Starring': ['Robert Downey Jr. Chris Evans']}\nGreat one liners and actually some very nice acting here and there from Downey, Johansson and Ruffalo (the man can communicate a lot without uttering a word) but otherwise this was tepid story.  We watched The Avengers to get background on the Agents of SHIELD TV show, which we are enjoying.\nGreat backstory for Agents of Shield - not much more\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'frightening scenes', 'alcohol use', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Marc Forster'], 'Producers': ['Brad Pitt', 'Dede Gardner', 'Jeremy Kleiner', 'Ian Bryce', 'Marc Forster', 'Brad Simpson', 'David Ellison', 'Dana Goldberg', 'Paul Schwake', 'Graham King', 'Tim Headington'], 'Starring': ['Brad Pitt', 'Mireille Enos', 'Fana Mokoena'], 'Studio': ['SciFi and Fantasy']}\nI watched this film for the second time on bluray and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The story line bears little relationship to the book, which turns out to be OK as the plague theme runs well in this adaptation.  Indeed, it makes for a nice double feature with the movie Contagion.\nNot the book but a lot of fun anyway\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'frightening scenes', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Clive Donner'], 'Producers': ['Robert E. Fuisz', 'Alfred R. Kelman', 'William F. Storke'], 'Starring': ['George C. Scott', 'Angela Pleasence', 'Edward Woodward'], 'Studio': ['20TH CENTURY FOX']}\nThe title of this review says it all.  I think that if Roger Rees' version of Scoorge's nephew bore the same lightness that Barry Mackay did in the 1938 version, this might be the superior film.  Too many versions ignore the importance of the lightness that Fred brings to this story.\nBetter than most but not the Reginald Owen 1938 version\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Kathryn Bigelow'], 'Producers': ['Colin Wilson', 'Greg Shapiro', 'Ted Schipper', 'Mark Boal', 'Kathryn Bigelow', 'Megan Ellison'], 'Starring': ['Jessica Chastain', 'Mark Strong', 'Joel Edgerton'], 'Studio': ['SONY PICTURES ENTERTAINMENT', 'INC.']}\nAfter what turned out to be the most entertaining exchange with the online help at Amazon Instant Video, we gave up trying to watch this video. DO NOT GET THIS ON AMAZON INSTANT VIDEO.  It will be a waste of $17 as  we are seeing more buffering time with Amazon Instant Video videos as we are movie....2-4 minutes of movie at a time.  By the time we ended our chat with the Amazon help, he had us unplugging everything.....I was waiting for him to tell us to go turn off the circuit at the circuit breaker or call the city to have them turn off power to our neighborhood....and then, reboot the move so that we can see 4-6 minutes of video at a time. By the way we have no problem with Netflix or Hulu+ steaming videos.\nMovie is great Amazon Instant Video is a disaster\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Jonathan Glazer'], 'Producers': ['James Wilson', 'Nick Wechsler', 'Tessa Ross', 'Reno Antoniades', 'Walter Campbell', 'Claudia Bluemhuber', 'Ian Hutchinson', 'Florian Dargel'], 'Starring': ['Scarlett Johansson'], 'Studio': ['A24']}\nThere is really nothing here. Dark scenes with actors reciting vapid lines.  Lots of longing looks.  It is almost a parody of 60's minimalist dialogue art films but no where as interesting.\nEmpty movie - a waste of talent\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Steven Soderbergh'], 'Producers': ['Michael Shamberg', 'Stacey Sher', 'Gregory Jacobs'], 'Starring': ['Matt Damon', 'Kate Winslet', 'Jude Law'], 'Studio': ['Warner Bros. Domestic Televisi']}\nBetter than Outbreak, better, more real characters.  The structural biochemistry is flaky and the timeline for the research nuts but it was fun to see all the same\nDon't watch this with the flu\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Gert Frobe'], 'Producers': ['Arnold Kopelson', 'Gert Frobe', 'Gail Katz'], 'Starring': ['Dustin Hoffman', 'Rene Russo', 'Morgan Freeman'], 'Studio': ['WARNER BROS.']}\nFun but not very realistic; certainly compared to Contagion.  Too bad the CDC does not have a rapid response team.  Probably just as well that the Army does not.\nAnother movie to not watch with the flu\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Marc Jobst', 'Dan Zeff', 'Bill Ander'], 'Producers': ['Alison Owen', 'Jenny Frayn', 'Nicole Finnan'], 'Starring': ['Jason Isaacs', 'Amanda Abbington', 'Natasha Little'], 'Studio': ['Acorn Media']}\nWe are two episodes in.  Pretty good so far.  Jason Isaac's character does not take himself too seriously, which lightens the mood a bit.\nGritty, slightly noirish crime procedural in Edinburgh\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Guy Ferland', 'Christine Moore', 'John Polson', 'Ron Fortunato', 'Seith Mann', 'Jerry Levine', 'Larry Teng', 'Lucy Liu', 'Aaron Lipstadt', 'Andrew Bernstein'], 'Studio': ['CBS']}\nI am only half of the way into the first season as I write this.  Great cast; great, engaging characters. The plots are smart, witty, and engaging. Lucy Lui (as Joan Watson) is subtly outstanding, and Aidan Quinn (NYPD Captain) and Johnny Lee Miller (as Sherlock Holmes) are on their A-game. Marcus Bell is new to me but he does a lot with what little he is given to do.  Keep your eye on this guy.  This show is a great complement and contrast to Benedict Cumberbatch's and Martin Freeman's version of Homes and Watson, respectively, in &#34;Sherlock.&#34;\nSherlock Holmes in NYC!\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['David Hare'], 'Producers': ['Bill Nighy', 'Nigel Marchant', 'Rebecca Eaton', 'Gareth Neame', 'David Barron', 'Christine Langan', 'Celia Duval', 'Scott Rudin', 'David Heyman'], 'Starring': ['Bill Nighy', 'Christopher Walken', 'Felicity Jones'], 'Studio': ['PBS']}\nThis film is dark and funny at times. Bill Nighy and Helena Bonham Carter are marvelous.  Ralph Fiennes is surreal as the Tony Blair-like PM, perhaps being miscast but hey, he is fun to watch, though I felt some lingering leftover from his role as Voldemort.\nGreat actors, great acting with a very nice story.\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Chris Morris'], 'Producers': ['Angus Aynsley', 'Carole Baraton', 'Peter Carlton', 'Will Clarke', 'Rita Dagher', 'Mark Findlay', 'Mark Herbert', 'Afi Khan', 'Caroline Leddy'], 'Starring': ['Kayvan Novak', 'Nigel Lindsay', 'Riz Ahmed'], 'Studio': ['Magnet Releasing']}\nA poignant, sad film about human folly (by nearly everyone and every institution) but somehow the film was a bit less than the some of its parts.\nsad film about human folly (by nearly everyone and every ...",
