Beckinsale's Emma was overly moody and had none of the light cheerfulness of Austen's Emma (or Ms. Paltrow's for that matter). Mark Stong is not Jeremey Northrup but he is VERY good. Unfortunately, this movie never establishes that Mr. Knightly is a daily presence in the Woodhouse household (i.e., compare with the Northrup-Paltrow version), which is critical to understanding the relationship between Mr. Knightly and Emma. Indeed, their love for each other is nearly a shocker in this version coming in its last 10 minutes. If you are an Emma fan, you may find this film a disappointment. In general, I prefer Ms. Beckinsale over Ms. Paltrow but Ms. Paltrow's film is a better Reader's Digest adaptation of this lengthly and rich novel. I wonder if modern movie/DVD audiences have the patience for a longer 4 and 6 hour versions of this novel akin to what has been done for Pride & Prejudice by the BBC and A&E, respectively. Indeed, the latest 2-hour version of P&P by Hollywood is a bare skeleton of that incredible story.\nNot quite Miss Jane's Emma\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'frightening scenes', 'smoking'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Peter Jackson'], 'Producers': ['Peter Jackson', 'Fran Walsh', 'Carolynne Cunningham', 'Zane Weiner'], 'Starring': ['Sir Ian McKellen', 'Martin Freeman', 'Richard Armitage']}\nWhile I appreciate bringing elements of the appendices of LOTR into the Hobbit movies, beginning with this one, this movie is misguided in vision and execution.  Trying to craft another Aragorn out of Thorin is silly and disingenuous to the spirit of the dwarves.  Making this more about Thorin and not Bilbo is also not in keeping with the core elements of this story.  And then, all those chase scenes!  There were too many, and they way, way were too long. I stopped watching the movie for awhile.  If this keeps up, this series of films will be reminescent of the second Star Wars series with the young Anakin - and that series was a disaster in story telling.\nWay too many tedious chases\nMarvel's The Avengers\nScience Fiction, Adventure, Ambitious, Fantastic\n['Marvel\u2019s The Avengers is the Super Hero team up of a lifetime, featuring iconic Marvel Super Heroes Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye and Black Widow.']\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Joss Whedon'], 'Producers': ['Kevin Feige'], 'Starring': ['Robert Downey Jr. Chris Evans']}\nGreat one liners and actually some very nice acting here and there from Downey, Johansson and Ruffalo (the man can communicate a lot without uttering a word) but otherwise this was tepid story.
