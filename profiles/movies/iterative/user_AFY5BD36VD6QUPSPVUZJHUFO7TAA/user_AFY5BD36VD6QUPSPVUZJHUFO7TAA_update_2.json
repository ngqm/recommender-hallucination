I very much enjoy the Original Series, the Next Generation, and Deep Space Nine. I even enjoy reading the novels. However, the Star Trek universe began to sour for me with the arrival of Captain Janeway and the Vulcan who wouldn't stop frowning. I stopped watching Voyager at all in the later seasons and even chose to ignore the series finale entirely. So I had high hopes when Enterprise came out. Those hopes soon tanked, though, starting with the opening credits. Years later, I decided to give this series a second try, seeing as I enjoy most of the other series so much. I came to like the song used for the opening credits in the first two seasons. However, with the exception of a couple of characters, I found most of the people in this cast either thoroughly unlikable or barely developed. Captain Archer struck me as uppity and self-righteous in most episodes in the first couple of seasons, so much so that I sometimes couldn't bear to watch an episode all the way to the end. Then, especially starting in Season 3, he was always angry; he even spoke gruffly to his cute little dog, Porthos, for cryin' out loud. Hoshi Sato seems to me like a whiny brat who has no business on a starship. Poor Mayweather had little or no substance to him at all. Several episodes seemed to have no point, like &#34;Shuttlepod One&#34; and &#34;Two Days and Two Nights&#34; in Season 1. And for anyone concerned with continuity in the Star Trek universe, this series dashes all that to pieces, complete with an appearance by the Ferengi in Season 1 and one by the Borg in Season 2.<br /><br />Variations of Star Trek were on the small screen for fourteen years straight before this series came along and killed the TV franchise dead. It's that bad. I'm convinced it only survived four seasons because of Trekkies who would support any and all things Trek, regardless of the quality (or lack thereof). I hope Enterprise isn't the end of Star Trek on the small screen, but I hope just as fervently that Enterprise's show runners--Berman and Braga--aren't allowed anywhere near the next one.\nThe Series that Killed Star Trek on the Small Screen\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Reinhard Klooss'], 'Producers': ['Reinhard Klooss', 'Robert Kulzer', 'Martin Moszkowicz', 'Bernhard Thur'], 'Starring': ['Kellan Lutz', 'Spencer Locke', 'Jaime Ray Newman'], 'Studio': ['Lionsgate']}\nThe animation was pretty good, and so was the story--right up until the end.
