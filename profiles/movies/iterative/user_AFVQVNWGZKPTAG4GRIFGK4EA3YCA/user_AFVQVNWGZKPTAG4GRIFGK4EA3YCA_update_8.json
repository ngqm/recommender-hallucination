I've seen it several times and it never get's old. The car chase scene with two muscle cars, 96 Mustang fast back, Steve's car, and a Dodge Charger, the bad guys, is simply too cool! The movie also has a very good plot and story line and there is much detective work involved although in todays world, no CIS would touch any evidence without surgical gloves on. All in all, still a great movie in todays world.\nReview Title: A great movie\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Much of my linage dates back to the Vikings and the Irish.<br />Therefore, the program was too snooty for my taste. I was waiting for Eric the Red to bust down the door and cleave everyone into little pieces but it wasn't going to happen so I changed the channel.\nI'm not an aristocrat\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Roman Polanski'], 'Producers': ['Wolfgang Glattes', 'Roman Polanski'], 'Starring': ['Johnny Depp', 'Frank Langella', 'Lena Olin'], 'Studio': ['LIONSGATE']}\nAnd Jonny Dep does a very good job with this character but I was a little disappointed with the end of the movie.\nGood dirrecting\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Tommy Wirkola'], 'Producers': ['Will Ferrell', 'Adam McKay', 'Kevin Messick', 'Beau Flynn'], 'Starring': ['Jeremy Renner', 'Gemma Arterton', 'Famke Janssen'], 'Studio': ['Paramount Pictures']}\nThe movie has great special effects and lot's of satire n a spoofish kind of way. It's very action packed from beginning to end with all kinds of neat, truly unbelievable weapons for the supposed time period. Great actors and Lots of fun!\nWitches get baked\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English'], 'Directors': ['Kurt Wimmer'], 'Producers': ['Jan De Bont', 'Lucas Foster'], 'Starring': ['Christian Bale', 'Taye Diggs', 'Emily Watson'], 'Studio': ['MIRAMAX']}\nChristian Bales' best performance ever! The movie has a great plot and storyline, with amazing visual effects for an older movie.<br />I was completely enthralled by this movie. I've watched it twice and could see it again.\nAn excellent movie\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Ridley Scott'], 'Producers': ['Dino De Laurentiis', 'Martha De Laurentiis', 'Ridley Scott', 'Terry Needham'], 'Starring': ['Anthony Hopkins', 'Julianne Moore', 'Gary Oldman'], 'Studio': ['MGM']}\nHannibal Lecture is back to being his extremely ruthless yet elegantly psychopathic self. In this bone chilling film, you know Hannibal is going to win because of his genius level intelligence. I found myself yelling at the screen, &#34;don't do it man, your going to die&#34;!\nGreat movie\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Simon West'], 'Producers': ['Danny Lerner', 'Les Weldon', 'Avi Lerner', 'Kevin King-Templeton'], 'Starring': ['Sylvester Stallone', 'Jason Statham', 'Jet Li'], 'Studio': ['Lions Gate Films Inc.']}\nIf you like a lot of action and don't mind a lack of pure drama, then this is your movie. Stallone even do's a good job of not sounding retarded. There's lots of cool weapons with firepower, things constantly getting blown to smithereens, and a large cast of mostly great actors.\nAnother great movie\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Peter Yates'], 'Producers': [\"Philip D'Antoni\"], 'Starring': ['Steve McQueen', 'Robert Vaughn', 'Jacqueline Bisset'], 'Studio': ['WARNER BROS.']}\nSteve McQueen's best movie in my opinion.
