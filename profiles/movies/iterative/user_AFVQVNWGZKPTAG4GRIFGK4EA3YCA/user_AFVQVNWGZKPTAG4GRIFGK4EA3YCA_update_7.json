Much of my linage dates back to the Vikings and the Irish.<br />Therefore, the program was too snooty for my taste. I was waiting for Eric the Red to bust down the door and cleave everyone into little pieces but it wasn't going to happen so I changed the channel.\nI'm not an aristocrat\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Roman Polanski'], 'Producers': ['Wolfgang Glattes', 'Roman Polanski'], 'Starring': ['Johnny Depp', 'Frank Langella', 'Lena Olin'], 'Studio': ['LIONSGATE']}\nAnd Jonny Dep does a very good job with this character but I was a little disappointed with the end of the movie.\nGood dirrecting\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Tommy Wirkola'], 'Producers': ['Will Ferrell', 'Adam McKay', 'Kevin Messick', 'Beau Flynn'], 'Starring': ['Jeremy Renner', 'Gemma Arterton', 'Famke Janssen'], 'Studio': ['Paramount Pictures']}\nThe movie has great special effects and lot's of satire n a spoofish kind of way.

The movie has a great plot and storyline, with amazing visual effects for an older movie.<br />I was completely enthralled by this movie.
