You\u2019ll see why in this hilarious five-disc DVD collection, containing the show\u2019s entire second season. Laugh out loud at such gems as \u201cJob Switching\u201d\u2014in which Lucy and Ethel do unforgettable battle with a chocolate factory conveyor belt; \u201c The Handcuffs\u201d\u2014in which Lucy cuffs herself to Ricky and then loses the key; and \u201cThe Operetta\u201d\u2014in which Lucy\u2019s money problems bring down the curtain on her role as \u201cQueen of the Gypsies.\u201d This collection also includes the groundbreaking \u201cpregnancy shows,\u201d including the touching moment at the Tropicana when Lucy breaks the news to Ricky that they are going to have a baby; and \u201cLucy Goes to the Hospital\u201d\u2014the record-setting episode that garnered the highest rating in the history of television!', 'Amazon.com', 'Season 2 of', 'I Love Lucy', 'includes two of the most famous half-hours in television history. \"Job Switching,\" originally broadcast mid-September of 1952, is the crazy, battle-of-the-sexes episode in which husbands Ricky Ricardo (Desi Arnaz) and Fred Mertz (William Frawley) trade roles with wives Lucy (Lucille Ball) and Ethel (Vivian Vance), culminating in the men making a shambles of domestic chores while Lucy and Ethel take disastrous work at a chocolate factory. That\\'s right: This is the show where the ladies have a Chaplinesque experience with a too-fast factory conveyor belt, forcing them to hide candies in their mouths, in their hats, and down their blouses lest a tough forewoman fire them for incompetence. A half-century later, the scene is still so fresh and funny it would grace any current sitcom. \"Lucy Goes to the Hospital,\" which received an amazing 71.7 rating on January 19, 1953, is the historic episode featuring the birth of Little Ricky and a load of wonderful slapstick. Other television series (', 'The Dick Van Dyke Show', ') and movies (', 'Nine Months', ') have tried to top', 'Lucy', \"'s time-to-go-to-the-hospital shenanigans, but there's nothing like the sight of Ricky and Fred falling all over themselves or Ricky showing up at the maternity ward (direct from a voodoo-themed show at the Tropicana) in witch doctor makeup.\", 'The other 31 episodes included in', 'I Love Lucy: The Compete Second Season', 'have choice moments, too. \"Lucy Becomes a Sculptress\" finds the ever-ambitious redhead falling for empty flattery at an art-supply store and commencing an ill-advised career working in clay. Ricky agrees to bless this new endeavor if an art critic says she has talent, but Lucy tries to increase her chances by posing as a bust of herself--resulting in mayhem, of course. The usual running themes in', 'I Love Lucy', \"--Lucy's misguided desire to be a part of Ricky's musical career, and her penchant for disguising herself to investigate something--are all over\", 'The Complete Second Season', '. \"Ricky Loses His Voice\" is a delightful piece in which Ricky\\'s laryngitis inspires Lucy, the Mertzes, and an aging chorus line to put on a Tropicana spectacle, and \"Ricky Has Labor Pains\" finds Lucy and Ethel going undercover as male reporters to find out what happens at a stag party. Lots to enjoy here, and the special features include bloopers, information about the guest cast, and snippets from Ball\\'s radio show.', '--Tom Keogh']\n{'Genre': 'Romance, Comedy', 'Format': 'Box set, Black & White, Dolby, DVD, Full Screen, NTSC, Subtitled', 'Contributor': 'Richard Reeves, Veola Vonn, Madelyn Davis, Bob Carroll Jr., William Asher, Marc Daniels, Carol Richards, Richard Lee Simmons, Jess Oppenheimer, Jerry Hausner, Vivian Vance, Desi Arnaz, Frank Gerstle, William Frawley, Will Wright, Paul Dubov, Lucille BallRichard Reeves, Veola Vonn, Madelyn Davis, Bob Carroll Jr., William Asher, Marc Daniels, Carol Richards, Richard Lee Simmons, Jess Oppenheimer, Jerry Hausner, Vivian Vance, Desi Arnaz, Frank Gerstle, William Frawley, Will Wright, Paul Dubov, Lucille Ball  See more', 'Language': 'Unqualified, English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono), Spanish (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono)', 'Number Of Discs': '5', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.33:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'Unrated (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.75 x 5.5 x 1.75 inches; 15.2 Ounces', 'Item model number': '2238096', 'Director': 'Marc Daniels, William Asher', 'Media Format': 'Box set, Black & White, Dolby, DVD, Full Screen, NTSC, Subtitled', 'Run time': '13 hours and 19 minutes', 'Release date': 'August 31, 2004', 'Actors': 'Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz, Vivian Vance, William Frawley, Paul Dubov', 'Dubbed': 'English', 'Subtitles': 'Spanish', 'Studio': 'Paramount', 'Writers': 'Bob Carroll Jr., Jess Oppenheimer, Madelyn Davis', 'Number of discs': '5'}\nI'm an old fuddy-duddy!  I don't want my kids (ages 8 and almost 6) watching 99% of the garbage that is on TV outside of PBS.  But they are getting too old for Sesame Street.  So where to turn?  I've found help in my old friend Lucy.  We have bought Season One of I Love Lucy on DVD, and the kids think it is the funniest thing ever.  I enjoy watching it with them, and I laugh all over again.  Season one has Vitmeatavegemin, and the kids laugh hysterically on the ground everytime they watch it.  I can't wait to show them the Chocolate factory.  The only caveat we need to do is explain about the cigarette smoking that goes on on the show.  We just explain that \"back then\" no one knew how bad smoking was for your health, and they are fine with that.  It's a great alternative to SpongeBob, I can tell you that!\nI Love Lucy - a great alternative to the current junk on TV\n{'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'Espa\u00f1ol', 'Portugu\u00eas'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', 'Espa\u00f1ol', 'Portugu\u00eas'], 'Directors': ['Mark Cendrowski', 'Anthony Rich', 'Peter Chakos', 'Nikki Lorre', 'James Burrows', 'Howard Murray', 'Gay Linvill', 'Kristy Cecil', 'Ted Wass', 'Andrew D.
