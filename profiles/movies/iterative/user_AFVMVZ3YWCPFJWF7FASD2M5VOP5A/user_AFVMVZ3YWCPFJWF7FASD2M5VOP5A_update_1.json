That\\'s right: This is the show where the ladies have a Chaplinesque experience with a too-fast factory conveyor belt, forcing them to hide candies in their mouths, in their hats, and down their blouses lest a tough forewoman fire them for incompetence. A half-century later, the scene is still so fresh and funny it would grace any current sitcom. \"Lucy Goes to the Hospital,\" which received an amazing 71.7 rating on January 19, 1953, is the historic episode featuring the birth of Little Ricky and a load of wonderful slapstick.

I don't want my kids (ages 8 and almost 6) watching 99% of the garbage that is on TV outside of PBS.  But they are getting too old for Sesame Street.  So where to turn?  I've found help in my old friend Lucy.  We have bought Season One of I Love Lucy on DVD, and the kids think it is the funniest thing ever.  I enjoy watching it with them, and I laugh all over again.  Season one has Vitmeatavegemin, and the kids laugh hysterically on the ground everytime they watch it.  I can't wait to show them the Chocolate factory.  The only caveat we need to do is explain about the cigarette smoking that goes on on the show.  We just explain that \"back then\" no one knew how bad smoking was for your health, and they are fine with that.  It's a great alternative to SpongeBob, I can tell you that!\nReview Title: I Love Lucy - a great alternative to the current junk on TV\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
