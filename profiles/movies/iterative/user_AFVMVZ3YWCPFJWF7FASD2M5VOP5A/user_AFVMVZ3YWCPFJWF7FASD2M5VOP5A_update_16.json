More about sex than the feminist movement. The characters are engaging and the acting is very well done, but they make really poor choices sometimes which is infuriating.  I suppose they left us hanging at the end so there can be a season 2, but frankly I'm not that interested. I do like how they portray the lives of woman in the early 1970s. I think it will be educational for millennial women to truly appreciate how far women have progressed in the last 45 years.  I would like my teenage daughter to watch it but all the sex scenes means it will have to wait several years before I can recommend it to her.<br /><br />One anachronism I found funny - several times Patti picks up a multi-line phone, but doesn't press the lit button to engage the call. Only someone old who had used phones like that would notice, but it would be nice if that was fixed in future seasons.  Also I think using the term &#34;unpack&#34; for explaining something is a 21st century usage - I never heard it used that way before 10 years ago.\nReview Title: I love the characters when I'm not mad at them.\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

That\\'s right: This is the show where the ladies have a Chaplinesque experience with a too-fast factory conveyor belt, forcing them to hide candies in their mouths, in their hats, and down their blouses lest a tough forewoman fire them for incompetence. A half-century later, the scene is still so fresh and funny it would grace any current sitcom. \"Lucy Goes to the Hospital,\" which received an amazing 71.7 rating on January 19, 1953, is the historic episode featuring the birth of Little Ricky and a load of wonderful slapstick.

I don't want my kids (ages 8 and almost 6) watching 99% of the garbage that is on TV outside of PBS.  But they are getting too old for Sesame Street.  So where to turn?  I've found help in my old friend Lucy.  We have bought Season One of I Love Lucy on DVD, and the kids think it is the funniest thing ever.  I enjoy watching it with them, and I laugh all over again.  Season one has Vitmeatavegemin, and the kids laugh hysterically on the ground everytime they watch it.  I can't wait to show them the Chocolate factory.  The only caveat we need to do is explain about the cigarette smoking that goes on on the show.  We just explain that \"back then\" no one knew how bad smoking was for your health, and they are fine with that.

I love Jane Austen, have a Jane Austen related web site, and I am pretty easy to please when it comes to Jane movies.  But I really disliked it.  This past week I thought I would give it another try, and watched it again.  I still really really disliked it. I just think it was poorly portrayed. The Bennet family is made to look excessively poor, grimy and shabby, and not portrayed as the gentlemen's family that they were. Kitty and Lydia were just foolishly, cartoonishly ridiculous, to the point of absurdity. The ball scenes were frenetic and overly crowded, again to the point of absurdity. Keira Knightley's Elizabeth was not likable in any part of the movie - her portrayal was too modern. The entire pace of the movie was too fast - the dialogue was so fast to the point of not being able to understand it at times (and I am not old and I watch British period dramas frequently and so am used to the language). Mr. Bingley seemed a buffoon, which he is not. Mr. Darcy was just never appealing. Their eventually romance seemed implausible.  The whole thing just seemed forced. Jane Austen's subtle humor was never fairly portrayed.<br /><br />It seemed like they wanted give these characters a modern feel while keeping them in early 19th century setting, and it just didn't work. I'm all for modernizations and retelling of Pride and Prejudice, and am a HUGE fan of the Lizzie Bennet Diaries on YouTube.<br /><br />Of course, by far the best Pride and Prejudice portrayal is the Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth 1995 BBC version. Well worth the $4.99 on Amazon Instant Video.

By necessity, Peter Jackson's ambitious epic compresses J.R.R. Tolkien's classic\", 'The Lord of the Rings', \", but this robust adaptation maintains reverent allegiance to Tolkien's creation, instantly qualifying as one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. At 178 minutes, it's long enough to establish the myriad inhabitants of Middle-earth, the legendary Rings of Power, and the fellowship of hobbits, elves, dwarves, and humans--led by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the brave hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood)--who must battle terrifying forces of evil on their perilous journey to destroy the One Ring in the land of Mordor. Superbly paced, the film is both epic and intimate, offering astonishing special effects and production design while emphasizing the emotional intensity of Frodo's adventure, and ends on a perfect note of heroic loyalty and rich anticipation.\", 'After the breaking of the Fellowship, Frodo and Sam journey to Mordor with the creature Gollum as their guide in', 'The Two Towers', \". Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) join in the defense of the people of Rohan, who are the first target in the eradication of the race of Men by the renegade wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee) and the dark lord Sauron.

The trilogy could never fully satisfy those who remain exclusively loyal to Tolkien's expansive literature, but as a showcase for physical and technical craftsmanship it is unsurpassed in pure scale and ambition, setting milestone after cinematic milestone as Frodo and Sam continue their mission to Mordor to destroy the soul-corrupting One Ring. While the heir to the kingdom of Men, Aragorn, endures the massive battle at Minas Tirith with the allegiance of Legolas, Gimli, and Gandalf, Frodo and Sam must survive the schizoid deceptions of Gollum, who remains utterly convincing as a hybrid of performance (by Andy Serkis) and subtly nuanced computer animation. Jackson and cowriters Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens have much ground to cover; that they do so with intense pacing and epic sweep is impressive enough, but by investing greater depth and consequence in the actions of fellow hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), they ensure that\", 'The Return of the King', \"maintains the trilogy's emphasis on intimate fellowship and remains faithful to Tolkien's overall vision. By ending the\", 'LOTR', 'trilogy with noble integrity and faith in the power of imaginative storytelling,', 'The Return of the King', ', like its predecessors, will stand as an adventure for the ages.', '--Jeff Shannon and David Horiuchi', 'Our Review of the Extended Edition on DVD (Dec. 14, 2004)', ':', \"The extended editions of Peter Jackson's\", 'The Lord of the Rings', \"present the greatest trilogy in film history in the most ambitious sets in DVD history. In bringing J.R.R. Tolkien's nearly unfilmable work to the screen, Jackson benefited from extraordinary special effects, evocative New Zealand locales, and an exceptionally well-chosen cast, but most of all from his own adaptation with co-writers Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, preserving Tolkien's vision and often his very words, but also making logical changes to accommodate the medium of film. While purists complained about these changes and about characters and scenes left out of the films, the almost two additional hours of material in the extended editions (about 11 hours total) help appease them by delving more deeply into Tolkien's music, the characters, and loose ends that enrich the story, such as an explanation of the Faramir-Denethor relationship, and the appearance of the Mouth of Sauron at the gates of Mordor. In addition, the extended editions offer more bridge material between the films, further confirming that the trilogy is really one long film presented in three pieces (which is why it's the greatest trilogy ever--there's no weak link). The scene of Galadriel's gifts to the Fellowship added to the first film proves significant over the course of the story, while the new Faramir scene at the end of the second film helps set up the third and the new Saruman scene at the beginning of the third film helps conclude the plot of the second.\", 'To top it all off, the extended editions offer four discs per film: two for the longer movie, plus four commentary tracks and stupendous DTS 6.1 ES sound; and two for the bonus material, which covers just about everything from script creation to special effects. The argument was that fans would need both versions because the bonus material is completely different, but the features on the theatrical releases are so vastly inferior that the only reason a fan would need them would be if they wanted to watch the shorter versions they saw in theaters (the last of which,', 'The Return of the King', ', merely won 11 Oscars).
