I'm glad Amazon offers it so I can watch more than one episode at a time. The CIA or not. The truth or not. Good person or bad. That's what we get to ponder. Well acted with likable but devious characters\nCliffhanger\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Jack Bender', 'Peter Leto', 'David Barrett', 'Sergio Mimica-Gezzan', 'Kari Skogland', 'Eriq La Salle', 'Edward Ornelas', 'Peter Weller', 'Roxann Dawson', 'Paul A.

Twelve year old boys would probably like it\nToo silly\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Ed Bianchi', 'Nicole Kassell', 'Phil Abraham', 'Daniel Attias', 'Keith Gordon', 'Agnieszka Holland', 'Lodge Kerrigan', 'Brad Anderson', 'Patty Jenkins', 'Jonathan Demme'], 'Starring': ['Mireille Enos', 'Joel Kinnaman']}\nI have just started watching this series.  Seattle homicide detective Sarah Linden, is asked to investigate the case of Rosie Larsen, a teenage girl who disappeared after attending a school dance on what was supposed to be Sarah's last day in Seattle.  Sarah's fiance is expecting her and her daughter to come to their new home and continue wedding plans.  So far, Sarah hasn't been able to get away.<br /><br />The story continues as a car is pulled from a local lake and Rosie's body is in the trunk.  Oh oh, the vehicle is registered to the campaign of a city councilman who is running for mayor against the incumbent.  This is as far as I have gotten with Season 1 but the twists and turns will keep me coming back.\nGood characters and interesting plot\nVeronica Mars\nSuspense, Drama\n[\"In the wealthy, seaside community of Neptune, California, the rich and powerful make the rules. Unfortunately for them, there's Veronica Mars, a smart, fearless 17-year-old apprentice private investigator dedicated to solving the town's toughest mysteries.\"]\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['John T. Kretchmer', 'Nick Marck', 'Michael Fields', 'Harry Winer', 'Jason Bloom', 'Steve Gomer', 'Guy Norman Bee', 'Marcos Siega', 'Sarah Pia Anderson', 'Mark Piznarski'], 'Producers': ['Not Specified'], 'Starring': ['Kristen Bell', 'Percy Daggs III', 'Teddy Dunn']}\nThis isn't a silly kids' story, but one that is fun to watch. Veronica's father was the sheriff of their small town where a wealthy man's daughter was murdered.  The sheriff suspected the girl's father did it but he never had conclusive evidence.  The wealthy man, embarrassed by the suspicions about him, had the sheriff fired.  Veronica's father is now working as a private detective and she is his &#34;girl Friday&#34;.  Veronica's mother left them soon after the sheriff was fired and, so far, this is a continuing theme as Veronica attends high school by day and does her own detective work at night for her friends and looking for her mother.<br /><br /> I am a Kristen Bell fan and she does a great job as a teenage sluth.  The first couple of episodes were interesting and well done.  The second related somewhat to the first.  Now, I have watched 3 and 4 and they are not as good and are &#34;stand alone&#34; episodes, so I'm only giving this one 3 stars. The hunt for Veronica's mother and the truth about why she left is the only relating factor.<br /><br /> I'll continue watching hoping the writers do a better job.\nGood story\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Norberto Barba', \"Terrence O'Hara\", 'Eric Laneuville', 'Aaron Lipstadt', 'Peter Werner', 'David Solomon', 'Steven DePaul', 'John Behring', 'Darnell Martin', 'Karen Gaviola'], 'Starring': ['David Giuntoli', 'Bitsie Tulloch', 'Russell Hornsby']}\nThis series is well-acted and each episode is different, but on the same theme.  I think sifi fans will like this, but I am not one of them.  I did enjoy the ingenuity of the first few episodes, but then I got a little &#34;much&#34; for me.\nI think sifi fans will like this, but I am not one of them\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Andrew Grieve'], 'Starring': ['Anthony Andrews', 'Betsy Blair', 'Jane Curtin']}\nLove at first sight - married quickly - then the troubles begin.

It is a look at TV news production (that may or may not be true) and exciting in the Pilot.

Getting the down payment wasn't easy.  They didn't get a non-compete clause, so the original owner became their competition.  Add to that chef problems, musician problems, more money problems and more.  This is a great movie for teens - lots of these things wouldn't have happened had these guys taken school seriously.\nThis movie told the sad tale of 2 well meaning guys who decided to ...\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Dan Lerner', 'Christine Moore', 'Kevin Dowling', 'Adam Kane', 'Adam Arkin', 'Daniel Attias', 'Paris Barclay', 'Matt Earl Beesley', 'Allen Coulter', 'Holly Dale'], 'Studio': ['CBS']}\nI watched the 1st season on TV and thought it was an interesting concept.  I was happy to see that Amazon offered the next season, but it is really getting weird now.  The actors are excellent, but the story has the child, conceived in outer space, becoming a really spooky character.  He seems to be a devil's spawn with eyes glowing yellow when he is ready to make trouble.\nNice couple - bad child\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Ben Taylor'], 'Producers': ['Rob Delaney', 'Sharon Horgan', 'Richard Allen-Turner', 'Kara Baker', 'Jon Thoday'], 'Starring': ['Sharon Horgan', 'Rob Delaney']}\nListed as a comedy, I didn't think it was funny.  This is a unique story about a couple who thought they were having a one night stand, but made a baby.  Their sense of humor and attraction to each other get them through life.  So, I thought this would be a fun series, but instead it is more about there sex life.  Not all that interesting and it got tiring.  I watched quite a few episodes, then gave up.\nA Catastrophe\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Jon Cassar', 'Brad Turner', 'Milan Cheylov', 'Bryan Spicer', 'Stephen Hopkins', 'Ian Toynton', 'Frederick King Keller', 'James Whitmore Jr.', 'Tim Iacofano', 'Kevin Hooks'], 'Starring': ['Kiefer Sutherland', 'Leslie Hope', 'Sarah Clarke'], 'Studio': ['FOX']}\nThis is a well written, directed, and acted series. This program is, sometimes, running 3 stories simultaneously and still are fully comprehensible.  I'm hooked!  And need more sleep.  Each segment ends with a cliff hanger and I usually am up to midnight because I just have to know what happens.  The events are not predictable.\nGreat Adventure\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Jon Cassar', 'Brad Turner', 'Milan Cheylov', 'Bryan Spicer', 'Stephen Hopkins', 'Ian Toynton', 'Frederick King Keller', 'James Whitmore Jr.', 'Tim Iacofano', 'Kevin Hooks'], 'Starring': ['Kiefer Sutherland', 'Kim Raver', 'Mary Lynn Rajskub'], 'Studio': ['FOX']}\nThe writing, directing and acting in this series continue to be strong.
