Seattle homicide detective Sarah Linden, is asked to investigate the case of Rosie Larsen, a teenage girl who disappeared after attending a school dance on what was supposed to be Sarah's last day in Seattle.  Sarah's fiance is expecting her and her daughter to come to their new home and continue wedding plans.  So far, Sarah hasn't been able to get away.<br /><br />The story continues as a car is pulled from a local lake and Rosie's body is in the trunk.  Oh oh, the vehicle is registered to the campaign of a city councilman who is running for mayor against the incumbent.  This is as far as I have gotten with Season 1 but the twists and turns will keep me coming back.\nGood characters and interesting plot\nVeronica Mars\nSuspense, Drama\n[\"In the wealthy, seaside community of Neptune, California, the rich and powerful make the rules. Unfortunately for them, there's Veronica Mars, a smart, fearless 17-year-old apprentice private investigator dedicated to solving the town's toughest mysteries.\"]\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['John T. Kretchmer', 'Nick Marck', 'Michael Fields', 'Harry Winer', 'Jason Bloom', 'Steve Gomer', 'Guy Norman Bee', 'Marcos Siega', 'Sarah Pia Anderson', 'Mark Piznarski'], 'Producers': ['Not Specified'], 'Starring': ['Kristen Bell', 'Percy Daggs III', 'Teddy Dunn']}\nThis isn't a silly kids' story, but one that is fun to watch. Veronica's father was the sheriff of their small town where a wealthy man's daughter was murdered.  The sheriff suspected the girl's father did it but he never had conclusive evidence.  The wealthy man, embarrassed by the suspicions about him, had the sheriff fired.  Veronica's father is now working as a private detective and she is his &#34;girl Friday&#34;.  Veronica's mother left them soon after the sheriff was fired and, so far, this is a continuing theme as Veronica attends high school by day and does her own detective work at night for her friends and looking for her mother.<br /><br /> I am a Kristen Bell fan and she does a great job as a teenage sluth.  The first couple of episodes were interesting and well done.  The second related somewhat to the first.  Now, I have watched 3 and 4 and they are not as good and are &#34;stand alone&#34; episodes, so I'm only giving this one 3 stars. The hunt for Veronica's mother and the truth about why she left is the only relating factor.<br /><br /> I'll continue watching hoping the writers do a better job.\nGood story\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Norberto Barba', \"Terrence O'Hara\", 'Eric Laneuville', 'Aaron Lipstadt', 'Peter Werner', 'David Solomon', 'Steven DePaul', 'John Behring', 'Darnell Martin', 'Karen Gaviola'], 'Starring': ['David Giuntoli', 'Bitsie Tulloch', 'Russell Hornsby']}\nThis series is well-acted and each episode is different, but on the same theme.  I think sifi fans will like this, but I am not one of them.  I did enjoy the ingenuity of the first few episodes, but then I got a little &#34;much&#34; for me.\nI think sifi fans will like this, but I am not one of them\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Andrew Grieve'], 'Starring': ['Anthony Andrews', 'Betsy Blair', 'Jane Curtin']}\nLove at first sight - married quickly - then the troubles begin.
