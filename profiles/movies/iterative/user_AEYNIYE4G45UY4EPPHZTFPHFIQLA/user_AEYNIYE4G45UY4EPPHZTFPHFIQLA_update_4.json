And with the Cold War in full effect, there are plenty of Eastern bloc operatives with dodgy accents to keep them busy. The year begins with a two-parter in which Stetson pretends to fall for a Soviet spy, but when the plan backfires, Amanda has to prove that he hasn\\'t been \"playing footsie with the Russians,\" as their boss, Billy (Mel Stewart), puts it. Once they put that business behind them, Lee proposes, and the two make (secret) plans for the future. After awhile, though, Amanda\\'s mother, Dotty (Beverly Garland, delightful as ever), and others start to catch on.', 'In the meantime, Lee receives damning information about his late parents, who also worked in intelligence, and sets out to clear their names (Jackson directed this episode, which features film noir-like flashbacks starring Wendie Malick). Other cases involve terrorists, kidnappers, art thieves, shady toy manufacturers, and Dotty\\'s gambling-addicted boyfriend (though the actors who play Amanda\\'s sons still appear in the credits, they garner minimal screen time). In the process, evildoers poison Lee, shoot Amanda, and manipulate Billy\\'s memories in scenarios involving familiar faces like Dennis Haysbert and Blair Underwood. If Francine (Martha Smith) assists with most operations, Dr. Smyth (Myron Natwick) hinders more than he helps--Lee describes his high-blown speech as \"verbal fruit salad.\" Due to Jackson\\'s health problems, which contributed to the show\\'s demise, Smith fills in for the final three episodes. In retrospect,', 'Scarecrow and Mrs. King', 'was a sweet, sincere series that shares much of the same romantic appeal as', 'Remington Steele', '.', '--Kathleen C.
