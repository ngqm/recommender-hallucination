Munster, Go Home!: The laughs begin when Herman moves the family to an English estate he inherited.

Both filmed in Technicolor, the vibrance of the Munsters' spooky lifestyle is most apparent in\", 'Munsters, Go Home', '(1966), far superior to the cornier', \"Munsters' Revenge\", \". A true '60s relic,\", 'Munsters, Go Home', \"begins when Herman's deceased relative bestows him with Lord status, necessitating the Munsters' trip to England to claim his title. There, he meets other Munsters, Lady Effigy and Freddie Munster, whose jealousy results in frightening antics that only thrill Herman, Grandpa, Lily, Eddie, and Marilyn (with Pat Priest replaced by Debbie Watson). As the plot thickens, Herman faces other threats to the family honor with his classic innocent bravado. In\", \"Munsters' Revenge\", \", a wax museum criminal circuit sends Munsters' imposters out to commit crimes, so it's up to the real family to solve the mystery. Different Eddies and Marilyns slightly spoil the family reunion's ambience, though ample physical comedy--for example when Herman's bee sting causes him to destroy the police precinct where he's being held as a criminal suspect--makes the film authentic to its original characters. Moreover, watching this double feature is an inspiring reminder of what props used to look like, like George Barris's Munster Koach, not to mention those that grace the entire Munster Mansion.\", '--Trinie Dalton']\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Kids & Family, Comedy', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, Full Screen, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Bob Mosher, K.C.

The year begins with a two-parter in which Stetson pretends to fall for a Soviet spy, but when the plan backfires, Amanda has to prove that he hasn\\'t been \"playing footsie with the Russians,\" as their boss, Billy (Mel Stewart), puts it. Once they put that business behind them, Lee proposes, and the two make (secret) plans for the future.

In the process, evildoers poison Lee, shoot Amanda, and manipulate Billy\\'s memories in scenarios involving familiar faces like Dennis Haysbert and Blair Underwood. If Francine (Martha Smith) assists with most operations, Dr. Smyth (Myron Natwick) hinders more than he helps--Lee describes his high-blown speech as \"verbal fruit salad.\" Due to Jackson\\'s health problems, which contributed to the show\\'s demise, Smith fills in for the final three episodes.
