Take the coolest show on daytime TV, select the best moments plus never-before-seen outrageous footage, and you have The Best of Trading Spaces. This unique DVD captures the fun, creative side of the crew and homeowners and places them in an interactive format. Meet each crew member in specially edited vignettes. Witness extreme reveals (when the homeowners see their redesigned rooms for the first time) complete with awkward moments of truth. And go behind the scenes for never-before-seen bloopers and outtakes. It\\'s the best of the best! DO UNTO YOUR NEIGHBORS... In this one-of-a-kind decorating show, two sets of neighbors swap keys to transform one room in each other\\'s home. They have two days, a set budget, and they\\'re not allowed back into their own homes until the moment of truth. This is the \"how-to\" with a neighborly twist.', 'Amazon.com', 'This phenomenally popular reality TV series that put the Learning Channel on the map obviously hopes to further build its fan base with this nearly two-hour collection of memorable moments, behind-the-scenes segments, and crew profiles. The premise: Two sets of neighbors have 48 hours to redo a room in each other\\'s home. At their disposal are a designer, a carpenter, and a $1,000 budget. Most entertaining are the \"reveals,\" presented in too-brief \"Love it\" and \"Hate it\" segments. These are all subjective, of course. One couple loved their new safari-inspired bedroom. I thought it made Graceland look like Monticello. Those new to the series might want to get a few episodes under their (tool) belt to really appreciate this. Fans of the series will make it a valuable addition to their DVD library.', '--Donald Liebenson']\nAverage Rating: 3.6\nProduct Details: {'Format': 'Color, NTSC, Closed-captioned, DVD, Full Screen', 'Contributor': 'Douglas Wilson, Hildi Santo Tomas, Brandon Russell, Genevieve Gorder, Edward Walker, Amy Wynn Pastor, Frank Bielec, Ty Pennington, Paige Davis, Alex McLeod, Faber Dewar, Laurie SmithDouglas Wilson, Hildi Santo Tomas, Brandon Russell, Genevieve Gorder, Edward Walker, Amy Wynn Pastor, Frank Bielec, Ty Pennington, Paige Davis, Alex McLeod, Faber Dewar, Laurie Smith   See more', 'Language': 'English', 'Number Of Discs': '1', 'Runtime': '1 hour', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.33:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'Unrated (Not Rated)', 'Package Dimensions': '7.1 x 5.42 x 0.58 inches; 3.2 Ounces', 'Media Format': 'Color, NTSC, Closed-captioned, DVD, Full Screen', 'Run time': '1 hour', 'Release date': 'March 18, 2003', 'Actors': 'Paige Davis, Frank Bielec, Faber Dewar, Hildi Santo Tomas, Alex McLeod', 'Studio': 'Live / Artisan', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: Not a great dvd.

With his help, she\\'ll eventually settle into her new environment, especially when she lands a house and a cat on the same day (conveniently left behind by a victim). Just as it takes awhile for the chief to grow on her squad--and to get used to driving in LA--Sedgwick\\'s Golden Globe-nominated performance follows a similar trajectory. Fortunately, \"Scarlett O\\'Hara,\" as the droll Provenza dubs her, becomes more fully-rounded as the season progresses, aided by a superb SAG Award-nominated ensemble cast.
