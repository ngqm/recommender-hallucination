After having done so and recovered from the shock, I can honestly say I don't understand what the creators were thinking in having the characters make the choices they made. And the women, this season, were just two-dimensional victims for the most part. I'd probably re-watch seasons one and two but, sadly, not this one.\ni liked the previous two seasons better\nDorfman in Love\nComedy, Passionate, Sweet, Ambitious\n[\"When Deb Dorfman volunteers to cat sit at her unrequited love's new downtown LA loft, her world changes forever.
