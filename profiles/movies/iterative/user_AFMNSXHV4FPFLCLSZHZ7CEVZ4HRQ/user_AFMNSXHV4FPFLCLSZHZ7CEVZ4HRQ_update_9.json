Pettiette', 'Claudie Viguerie'], 'Starring': ['Gina Phillips', 'Faye Dunaway'], 'Studio': ['Screen Media Ventu']}\nThe movie is extremely pedestrian.....it is well made.  The photography and all the elements for a great movie are there but the plot is without any real surprise and you can access the outcome way to early in the film.  Its too bad the scenery is great and the backdrop is really haunting.  The acting is fairly good.  The script should have been used as toliet paper....\nThe photography and all the elements for a great movie are there but the plot is without any ...\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Andrew Lau', 'Andrew Loo'], 'Producers': ['Allen Bain', 'Stuart Ford', 'Ara Katz', 'Andrew Lau', 'Jesse Scolaro', 'Martin Scorsese', 'Michael Bassick', 'Steven Chao', 'Claudie Chung', 'Corey Large', 'Deepak Nayar', 'Alan Pao', 'Art Spigel', 'Steven Squillante'], 'Starring': ['Justin Chon', 'Kevin Wu', 'Harry Shum Jr.'], 'Studio': ['A24 Distribution LLC']}\nThe storyline is terrific.  Dialogue and acting is okay.  The direction is little shaky ....too much disoriented shots.......This could have been a great film but it needed a little more integration with the police angle......it seems ridiculous that suddenly the gang members want to help the police who have been essentially non-existent until the end of the film.  Either integrate the police into the story entirely or leave them out because its like an irritating cameo when Ray Liotta shows up with his Asian counterpart.....who you can't quite believe is really even up with what is going on in his own community.  The part about the book and the money is also stupid......a lot of extra scenes for nothing....should have written that in differently.  This film could have been so much better......I just felt it missed a great opportunity to be a great film and just fell short because it was not thought out better.\nCrouching tiger....meets Gritty Chinatown\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Bill Anderson', 'Bille Eltringham', 'Nicholas Renton'], 'Producers': ['Chris Burt', 'Damien Timmer', 'Michele Buck', 'Rebecca Eaton'], 'Starring': ['Clare Holman', 'Kevin Whately', 'Laurence Fox'], 'Studio': ['PBS']}\nI always love Inspector Lewis Episodes.....\nFive Stars\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Paul McGuigan'], 'Producers': ['Chris Roberts'], 'Starring': ['Bruce Willis', 'Josh Hartnett', 'Lucy Liu']}\nThis was a good gangster movie......some parts a little unbelievable but all in all pretty damn good.  Not for the faint of heart ....there is a lot of violence and shooting, and blood spatter EVERYWHERE!........All in all it captured my attention for the entire movie....\nThis was a good gangster movie\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'frightening scenes', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'Italiano', 'Espa\u00f1ol', 'Portugu\u00eas', 'Fran\u00e7ais'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a)', 'Fran\u00e7ais', 'Italiano', 'Nederlands', 'Portugu\u00eas', 'Svenska'], 'Directors': ['Mikael H\u00e5fstr\u00f6m'], 'Producers': ['Lorenzo Di Bonaventura'], 'Starring': ['John Cusack', 'Samuel L. Jackson', 'Mary McCormack'], 'Studio': ['Lionsgate']}\nThe movie started out JUST GREAT.....I was ready to get down when the main character checked into 1408...then the script and the main character's reactions got ridiculous.......they took a great idea......an okay script and then F'd it up......It seems the script must have ended up in ROOM 1408....because it seems it suffered the same naufrage or shipwreck that the main character did.......the best scene was his chase in the vents.....everything else was ....disappointingly mundane.....a stoic writer suddenly starts reacting like a scared schoolgirl ...just plain dumb.\nScript must have ended up in Room 1408....\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Martin Scorsese'], 'Producers': ['Mike Medavoy', 'Arnold Messer', 'Brad Fischer', 'Martin Scorsese'], 'Starring': ['Leonardo DiCaprio', 'Mark Ruffalo', 'Ben Kingsley']}\nThis was a great movie......I was going all the way. The end on the other hand had to long of a antithesis......I would have liked a faster resolution .....to cinematically wordy is the best way I can describe it.  Love the shots that pan all the way out and in  on the island and the scenes.......very artsty......and THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU Mr. Scorcese for NOT SHAKING YOUR CAMERAS around during scenes......I can't understand how so many films are produced with this STUPID IRRITATING CAMERA WORK and you want the public to accept this as a professionals work.  A couple of panning mistakes , I counted two.  but other than that ....spot on.  DiCaprio pulled off the Boston persona without it being overdone.....and the local and scenes were believable while still holding to the story.......This film should have gotten more critical acclaim.\nTerrific Entertaiment ....TOP NOTCH\n{'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu'], 'Producers': ['Alejandro G.

Skotchdopole'], 'Starring': ['Michael Keaton', 'Zach Galifianakis', 'Edward Norton']}\nThis was a very good film. I enjoyed everything about it.  Keaton; character is clearly well developed.  The camera work is GREAT considering all the running back and forth....none of that camera shaking that is so DAMN IRRITATING that I would like to scream.  The movement from character to character gives a wonderful narrative of each of the main characters. Worth that watch.\nGotta see this ....\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['David Fincher'], 'Producers': ['Cean Chaffin', 'Joshua Donen', 'Arnon Milchan', 'Reese Witherspoon', 'Leslie Dixon', 'Bruna Papandrea'], 'Starring': ['Ben Affleck', 'Rosamund Pike', 'Neil Patrick Harris']}\nI was okay with the film until the end .....it was believable and twisted just like its characters but it got a little messy and too unbelievable at the end ....Amazing Amy was just a bit too OVERACTING in the Hospital ward and that was not due to the actress but the director and the plot.....her character was subtle and laid back even when she was being a manipulative psycho...suddenly she was disorganized and it seemed her manipulation was overplayed......this was a flaw in the script and needed to be worked on.  Other than that it was worth the time.\nA twisted tale of love.....\nA Haunting at Preston Castle\nSuspense, Horror\n['What begins as a dare for 3 teens seeking weekend excitement, turns into a grisly nightmare as they try to escape an evil presence lurking in the terrifying darkness of PRESTON CASTLE.']\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Martin Rosenberg'], 'Producers': ['Peter Bailey'], 'Starring': ['Heather Tocquigny', 'Jake White', 'Mackenzie Firgens']}\nI have never seen such a waste of film and resources as in this piece of pantywaste.
