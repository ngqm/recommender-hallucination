  "reference_summary": "The Barchester Chronicles\nAlan Rickman  (Actor),     Nigel Hawthorne  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, BBC, All BBC Titles\n['Product Description', \"The cozy community of Barchester is rocked from its complacency when a crusade against the Church of England's practice of self-enrichment misfires. Overnight, Septimus Harding (Donald Pleasence) becomes the pawn in a political battle begun by his younger daughter's beau, John Bold, and kept kindled by his older daughter's husband, Archdeacon Grantly (Nigel Hawthorne).\", 'Amazon.com', 'The first two episodes of this BBC miniseries only hint at the delights to come. A lawsuit aimed at church reform in the town of Barchester forces a decent middle-aged clergyman (the august Donald Pleasence, best known in the U.S. for the', 'Halloween', 'movies) into a moral crisis and a conflict with his son-in-law, a pompous archdeacon (Nigel Hawthorne,', 'The Madness of King George', '). The gracefully written and acted narrative shows glimpses of dry wit--but in episode 3, the arrival of a new bishop (Clive Swift,', 'Keeping Up Appearances', '), his imperious wife (Geraldine McEwan,', 'The Magdalene Sisters', '), and his devious chaplain (Alan Rickman,', 'Truly Madly Deeply', ', the', 'Harry Potter', 'movies) launches', 'The Barchester Chronicles', 'into a satirical power struggle all the more mesmerizing because of the smallness of the territory. The scheming of the citizens and clergy of this British town is both Byzantine and wonderfully comic as the tempestuous personalities claw and dig at each other.', \"Rickman, in one of his first film or television roles, turns in a tour de force of oily ambition. McEwan's ferocious machinations are downright terrifying, while the sputtering Hawthorne (\", 'The Madness of King George', ') seems constantly in danger of bursting a vein. At the center of it all is Pleasence. Making goodness compelling has always been difficult, since wickedness is always more dramatic; but Pleasence brings a deep and stirring passion to his role that proves as engaging as all the back-biting that surrounds him. And these are just the more familiar faces; a host of lesser-known actors give equally superb performances. The final episode (of seven) will have you on pins and needles.', 'The Barchester Chronicles', ', adapted from two novels by Anthony Trollope, is one of those marvels of British television, a skillful production that proves intelligent fare can be hugely entertaining.', '--Bret Fetzer']\n{'Genre': 'Classics, Art House & International/Period Piece, Drama', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, NTSC, Closed-captioned, Original recording remastered', 'Contributor': 'Susan Hampshire, Donald Pleasence, Alan Rickman, Geraldine McEwan, Nigel Hawthorne', 'Language': 'Unqualified, English (Mono)', 'Number Of Discs': '2', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.5 x 0.75 inches; 3.52 Ounces', 'Item model number': '794051211125', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, NTSC, Closed-captioned, Original recording remastered', 'Run time': '6 hours and 25 minutes', 'Release date': 'May 16, 2006', 'Actors': 'Alan Rickman, Nigel Hawthorne, Susan Hampshire, Donald Pleasence, Geraldine McEwan', 'Studio': 'BBC Home Entertainment', 'Number of discs': '2'}\nReally enjoy this series; the costumes and cast are fantastic, and the scenery is incredible.
