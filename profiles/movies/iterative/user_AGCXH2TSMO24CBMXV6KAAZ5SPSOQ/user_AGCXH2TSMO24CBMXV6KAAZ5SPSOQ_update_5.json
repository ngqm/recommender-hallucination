McEwan's ferocious machinations are downright terrifying, while the sputtering Hawthorne (\", 'The Madness of King George', ') seems constantly in danger of bursting a vein. At the center of it all is Pleasence. Making goodness compelling has always been difficult, since wickedness is always more dramatic; but Pleasence brings a deep and stirring passion to his role that proves as engaging as all the back-biting that surrounds him. And these are just the more familiar faces; a host of lesser-known actors give equally superb performances. The final episode (of seven) will have you on pins and needles.', 'The Barchester Chronicles', ', adapted from two novels by Anthony Trollope, is one of those marvels of British television, a skillful production that proves intelligent fare can be hugely entertaining.', '--Bret Fetzer']\n{'Genre': 'Classics, Art House & International/Period Piece, Drama', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, NTSC, Closed-captioned, Original recording remastered', 'Contributor': 'Susan Hampshire, Donald Pleasence, Alan Rickman, Geraldine McEwan, Nigel Hawthorne', 'Language': 'Unqualified, English (Mono)', 'Number Of Discs': '2', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.5 x 0.75 inches; 3.52 Ounces', 'Item model number': '794051211125', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, NTSC, Closed-captioned, Original recording remastered', 'Run time': '6 hours and 25 minutes', 'Release date': 'May 16, 2006', 'Actors': 'Alan Rickman, Nigel Hawthorne, Susan Hampshire, Donald Pleasence, Geraldine McEwan', 'Studio': 'BBC Home Entertainment', 'Number of discs': '2'}\nReally enjoy this series; the costumes and cast are fantastic, and the scenery is incredible.
