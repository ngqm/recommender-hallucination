I am a movie lover of all types of movies and I loved this.  I have watched lots of Christian movies but this one may be there very best.  I learned a lot and I was surprised as the movie went on.  Some Christian movies don't have big budgets and some have totally expected endings but this one was different.  The acting was great and I was very impressed with Kevin Sorbo's performance.  I can't wait to watch it again to see what I missed the first time.  I would definitely recommend!\nAwesome movie!

My whole family really enjoyed it and we think we liked it even better than the Hunger Games movies. Also, it was nice to have such a great movie that didn't have anything I wanted to keep my 12 year-old from seeing.\nLiked it more than we thought!\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Chris Carter'], 'Producers': ['Chris Carter', 'Marc Rosen', 'Gabe Rotter'], 'Starring': ['Aldis Hodge', 'Andrew Howard', 'Arielle Kebbel']}\nI enjoyed the first part of the show but the amount of F Bombs was ridiculous!  Even some of the toughest R rated movies I have seen had less bad language.  I really thought it was a joke at first.  Once we got to the end, I thought it was just plan evil.  Lots of reviews give spoilers about this so I am not giving too much away but the creature at the end just looks evil.  I won't watch again.\nNot a great show and the language was ridiculous!\n{'Audio languages': ['English', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica) [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Kevin Reynolds'], 'Producers': ['Roger Birnbaum', 'Gary Barber', 'Jonathan Glickman'], 'Starring': ['Jim Caviezel', 'Guy Pearce', 'Richard Harris'], 'Studio': ['Buena Vista Pay Television']}\nOne of my family's favs!
