Based on Irwin Shaw's best-selling novel and featuring an all-star cast (including Edward Asner, Bill Bixby, Susan Blakely, and Robert Reed), the series focuses in particular on Rudy Jordache (Peter Strauss) and his troubled brother Tom (Nick Nolte) as they navigate divergent paths away from their impoverished immigrant upbringing. While ambitious Rudy seems destined for success, Tom suffers from an endless string of bad luck but in the end, finds love. Encompassing a period of tremendous social and political upheaval, the Jordache saga explores timeless themes such as the difficulty of human relationships and the disillusionment of the American dream.An absorbing and masterful portrait of a fascinating and ill-fated family, RICH MAN, POOR MAN: THE COMPLETE COLLECTION recaptures a landmark moment in American broadcasting history.BONUS FEATURE: Brand-new audio commentary for Book I: Chapter 1 featuring star Peter Strauss and television historian David Bianculli\", 'Amazon.com', 'Rich Man, Poor Man', 'may not have been the first miniseries, but its success in 1976 gave the format legs and set the template for many that followed: based on a popular book, starring new faces but surrounded by familiar stars, with a panoramic sweep that juxtaposes personal trials against historical events.', 'Book I', 'of', 'Rich Man, Poor Man', 'follows the ups and downs of the Jordache brothers--Rudy (Peter Strauss,', 'Masada', ') and Tom (Nick Nolte,', '48 Hours', \")--starting at the close of World War II through to the late '60s. Allusions to race relations, the Rosenberg trials, and other topical issues provide a backdrop to the tumultuous soap opera of these two men and Julie Prescott (Susan Blakely,\", 'The Towering Inferno', \"), Rudy's high-school sweetheart and eventually his wife. Rudy's ambition leads him into politics, Tom struggles as a prizefighter and has children with a couple of women, and Julie falls into an unhappy marriage, a career in journalism, and alcoholism. Probably the most interesting aspect of\", 'Rich Man, Poor Man', \"for today's audiences is its sexual honesty; it's hard to imagine anything on contemporary broadcast television being as frank about women's desires and the instability of marriages (though cable series like\", 'Mad Men', 'have picked up that lead--in fact,', 'Mad Men', 'owes a considerable debt to', 'Rich Man, Poor Man', \"). It's no surprise that Nolte was the breakout star from the series; the rest of the cast varies from a bit wooden to solidly capable, but Nolte's energy and spontaneity--not to mention his six-pack abs!--pop out.\", 'The success of', 'Rich Man, Poor Man', 'led to', 'Rich Man, Poor Man: Book II', \", also included on this DVD set; almost twice as long, this second miniseries suffers from the absence of Nolte and from being more distanced from the source material.

Still, it has its moments and features the ongoing malevolence of William Smith as the series' dominant villain, Falconetti--a character who made such an impression that the actor was harassed on the street by the miniseries' fans.

Long before Donnie Brasco brought similar drama to the big screen, Golden Globe\u00ae winner Ken Wahl brought charisma, credibility and chutzpah to his small-screen role as Vincent Terranova, a handsome 30-year-old agent with the FBI's Organized Crime Bureau. The special Collector's Set presents 67 episodes that span the series' highly successful 4 season run on 13 DVDs! Also included are 3 unaired, never before seen episodes from the show's final season.  How does a deep-cover operative keep his sanity and morality intact when the criminal lifestyle he's sworn to bring down from within is more compelling than his own? Federal Agent Vincent Terranova (Ken Wahl) is plagued by the question in this innovative take on 80s cop dramas. Created by veteran hit producer Stephen J. Cannell, Wiseguy veers from traditional 'bad guy of the week' police procedural by breaking the drama into multi-episode story arcs that followed an Organized Crimes Bureau case - and its charismatic criminal suspects - to its logical conclusion.
