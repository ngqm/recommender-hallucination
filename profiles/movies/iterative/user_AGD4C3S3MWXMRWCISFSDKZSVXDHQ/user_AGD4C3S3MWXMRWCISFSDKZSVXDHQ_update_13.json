Based on Irwin Shaw's best-selling novel and featuring an all-star cast (including Edward Asner, Bill Bixby, Susan Blakely, and Robert Reed), the series focuses in particular on Rudy Jordache (Peter Strauss) and his troubled brother Tom (Nick Nolte) as they navigate divergent paths away from their impoverished immigrant upbringing. While ambitious Rudy seems destined for success, Tom suffers from an endless string of bad luck but in the end, finds love. Encompassing a period of tremendous social and political upheaval, the Jordache saga explores timeless themes such as the difficulty of human relationships and the disillusionment of the American dream.An absorbing and masterful portrait of a fascinating and ill-fated family, RICH MAN, POOR MAN: THE COMPLETE COLLECTION recaptures a landmark moment in American broadcasting history.BONUS FEATURE: Brand-new audio commentary for Book I: Chapter 1 featuring star Peter Strauss and television historian David Bianculli\", 'Amazon.com', 'Rich Man, Poor Man', 'may not have been the first miniseries, but its success in 1976 gave the format legs and set the template for many that followed: based on a popular book, starring new faces but surrounded by familiar stars, with a panoramic sweep that juxtaposes personal trials against historical events.', 'Book I', 'of', 'Rich Man, Poor Man', 'follows the ups and downs of the Jordache brothers--Rudy (Peter Strauss,', 'Masada', ') and Tom (Nick Nolte,', '48 Hours', \")--starting at the close of World War II through to the late '60s.

Long before Donnie Brasco brought similar drama to the big screen, Golden Globe\u00ae winner Ken Wahl brought charisma, credibility and chutzpah to his small-screen role as Vincent Terranova, a handsome 30-year-old agent with the FBI's Organized Crime Bureau. The special Collector's Set presents 67 episodes that span the series' highly successful 4 season run on 13 DVDs!

How does a deep-cover operative keep his sanity and morality intact when the criminal lifestyle he's sworn to bring down from within is more compelling than his own? Federal Agent Vincent Terranova (Ken Wahl) is plagued by the question in this innovative take on 80s cop dramas. Created by veteran hit producer Stephen J. Cannell, Wiseguy veers from traditional 'bad guy of the week' police procedural by breaking the drama into multi-episode story arcs that followed an Organized Crimes Bureau case - and its charismatic criminal suspects - to its logical conclusion.
