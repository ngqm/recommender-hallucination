After a while, it's just too much to watch.\nDubbing dulls this film\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Jos\u00e9 Delgado'], 'Producers': ['Pacific Media'], 'Studio': ['CLA GmbH']}\nThis series is excellent and provides information not available on other WWII figures in a clear and unbiased way.  Recommended for anyone interested in the major players and the details of their lives, involvement in the war and their contributions to history.\nGREAT AND INFORMATIVE SERIES\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Phillip Noyce'], 'Producers': ['Hilary Bevan Jones', 'Genevieve Hofmeyr', 'Tim Bevan', 'Eric Fellner', 'Juliette Howell', 'Liza Chasin'], 'Starring': ['Hilary Swank', 'Brenda Blethyn', 'Sam Claflin'], 'Studio': ['HBO']}\nStirring film with great performances.\nFive Stars",
