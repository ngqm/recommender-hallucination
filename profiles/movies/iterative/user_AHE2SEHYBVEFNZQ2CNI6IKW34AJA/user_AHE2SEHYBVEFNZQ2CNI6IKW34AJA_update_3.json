After his explosive regeneration, the Eleventh Doctor awakes to discover his TARDIS is about to crash! After falling from the sky, he pulls himself out of the wreckage to come face-to-face with young Amy Pond. The Doctor promises to take Amy to the stars. But first they must divert an alien plot that could destroy the Earth. The Doctor makes good his promise, and Amy boards the regenerated TARDIS, ready to take to the stars on a series of wild adventures that will change her life. As always, wherever the Doctor goes, his oldest enemies, the Daleks, are never far behind. They are hatching a new master plan from the heart of war-torn London in the 1940s. But they are not the only strange creatures the Doctor and Amy must face--there are also alien vampires, humanoid reptiles, the Weeping Angels, and a silent menace that follows Amy and the Doctor around wherever they go.', 'Amazon.com', 'Sometimes, change is good, as evidenced by Matt Smith\\'s assumption of the mantle of Britain\\'s beloved science-fiction hero, Doctor Who, in this stellar series. Replacing David Tennant, who was arguably the most popular incarnation of the Time Lord since Tom Baker, was an unenviable task for any actor. But relative newcomer Smith--the youngest performer to play the Doctor--makes the role his own within the first few moments of the series opener, \"The Eleventh Hour,\" which introduces his puckish interpretation, as well as companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan). The pair, whose banter is a terrific mix of screwball humor and light sexual tension, are later joined by Amy\\'s fianc\u00e9, Rory (Arthur Darvill), who is not quite whom he appears, as revealed in \"The Pandorica Opens.\" Old enemies such as the Daleks (\"Victory of the Daleks\"), the Silurians (\"The Hungry Earth\"), and the formidable Weeping Angels (\"The Time of the Angels\") test the Eleventh Doctor\\'s mettle, as does the series\\' central adventure, in which a host of the Doctor\\'s foes, including the Cybermen and the Sontarans, unite to seal him in the fabled Pandorica, an inescapable prison located within Stonehenge.

Chief among these are the six commentary tracks, most of which feature newly minted show runner Steven Moffat (', 'Sherlock', '), as well as Gillan and Darvill, and run the gamut from giggly, lightweight chats to informative looks at the production process.
