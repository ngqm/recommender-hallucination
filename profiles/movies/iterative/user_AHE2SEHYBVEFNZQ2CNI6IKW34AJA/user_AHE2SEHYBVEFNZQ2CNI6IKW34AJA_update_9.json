After his explosive regeneration, the Eleventh Doctor awakes to discover his TARDIS is about to crash! After falling from the sky, he pulls himself out of the wreckage to come face-to-face with young Amy Pond. The Doctor promises to take Amy to the stars. But first they must divert an alien plot that could destroy the Earth. The Doctor makes good his promise, and Amy boards the regenerated TARDIS, ready to take to the stars on a series of wild adventures that will change her life. As always, wherever the Doctor goes, his oldest enemies, the Daleks, are never far behind. They are hatching a new master plan from the heart of war-torn London in the 1940s. But they are not the only strange creatures the Doctor and Amy must face--there are also alien vampires, humanoid reptiles, the Weeping Angels, and a silent menace that follows Amy and the Doctor around wherever they go.', 'Amazon.com', 'Sometimes, change is good, as evidenced by Matt Smith\\'s assumption of the mantle of Britain\\'s beloved science-fiction hero, Doctor Who, in this stellar series. Replacing David Tennant, who was arguably the most popular incarnation of the Time Lord since Tom Baker, was an unenviable task for any actor. But relative newcomer Smith--the youngest performer to play the Doctor--makes the role his own within the first few moments of the series opener, \"The Eleventh Hour,\" which introduces his puckish interpretation, as well as companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan). The pair, whose banter is a terrific mix of screwball humor and light sexual tension, are later joined by Amy\\'s fianc\u00e9, Rory (Arthur Darvill), who is not quite whom he appears, as revealed in \"The Pandorica Opens.\" Old enemies such as the Daleks (\"Victory of the Daleks\"), the Silurians (\"The Hungry Earth\"), and the formidable Weeping Angels (\"The Time of the Angels\") test the Eleventh Doctor\\'s mettle, as does the series\\' central adventure, in which a host of the Doctor\\'s foes, including the Cybermen and the Sontarans, unite to seal him in the fabled Pandorica, an inescapable prison located within Stonehenge.

It\\'s been nearly a year since the volatile detective was suspended from the NYPD for fatally shooting another undercover officer, an accident that not only cost him his job, but fueled the alcoholism and anger that has alienated his wife and kids and left him crashing on his sister\\'s couch in Queens. Desperate to pull his life together and reconnect with his family, Carson takes a job as a night watchman at the burned-out ruins of the Mayflower department store. What once was a symbol of prosperity and grandeur now sits decaying in the darkness like a rotting ghost ship, destroyed by a massive fire that devoured numerous innocent lives. As Carson patrols the eerie, charred remains of the store, he begins to notice something sinister about the ornate mirrors that adorn the Mayflower walls. Reflected in the gigantic shimmering glass are horrific images that stun Carson. Beyond projecting gruesome images of the past, the mirrors appear to be manipulating reality as well. When Carson sees his own reflection being tortured, he suffers the physical effects of his fractured visions. Suddenly the troubled ex-cop finds himself battling his personal demons and the ones that have hijacked his reflection, tormenting him with convulsions, spontaneous bleeding and near suffocation. His sympathetic but skeptical sister Angela (AMY SMART) dismisses these bizarre \"nightmares\" as a consequence of his stress and guilt over the accidental shooting, but Carson\\'s estranged wife Amy (PAULA PATTON), a no-nonsense NYPD medical examiner, is less forgiving. Her husband\\'s increasingly erratic behavior frightens her, pushing his family farther away - and, she fears, it\\'s putting their children in danger. But a much deadlier threat looms, trapped within the mirrors and reflective surfaces that pervade their everyday life. As Carson investigates the mysterious disappearance of a Mayflower security guard and its possible connection to his ghastly visions, he realizes that a malevolent, otherworldly force is using reflections as a gateway to terrorize him and his family. If he has any hope of saving his wife and children from a horrifying death, Carson must somehow uncover the truth behind the mirrors - and convince Amy to help him battle the greatest evil he has ever faced.']\n{'Genre': 'Kids & Family', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Blu-ray, Color, Dolby, Dubbed, NTSC, Special Edition, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Erica Gluck, Amy Smart, Tim Ahern, Kiefer Sutherland, Cameron Boyce, Alexandre Aja, Jason Flemyng, Mary Beth Peil, Paula Patton, Julian Glover, John Shrapnel, Grgory Levasseur, Josh Cole, Sung-ho Kim, Ezra BuzzingtonErica Gluck, Amy Smart, Tim Ahern, Kiefer Sutherland, Cameron Boyce, Alexandre Aja, Jason Flemyng, Mary Beth Peil, Paula Patton, Julian Glover, John Shrapnel, Grgory Levasseur, Josh Cole, Sung-ho Kim, Ezra Buzzington  See more', 'Language': 'English, Spanish, French', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 50 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '2.40:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'Unrated (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 0.7 x 5.4 inches; 0.01 Ounces', 'Director': 'Alexandre Aja', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Blu-ray, Color, Dolby, Dubbed, NTSC, Special Edition, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Run time': '1 hour and 50 minutes', 'Release date': 'January 13, 2009', 'Actors': 'Kiefer Sutherland, Paula Patton, Amy Smart, Cameron Boyce, Erica Gluck', 'Dubbed': 'French, Spanish', 'Subtitles': 'English, French, Korean, Spanish, Cantonese', 'Studio': '20th Century Fox', 'Writers': 'Alexandre Aja, Grgory Levasseur, Sung-ho Kim', 'Number of discs': '2'}\nVery entertaining movie.
