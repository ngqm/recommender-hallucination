I get it, she didn't want to be there - like the rest of them - but her whining did get on my nerves after a while. I do hope the next movie will be better.\nNot As Good As The First\n{'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Dennis Smith', \"Terrence O'Hara\", 'John Peter Kousakis', 'Tony Wharmby', 'Eric A.

Gets more into the relationship of Jo and Callen - won't say anymore than that. Also it builds on the Deeks relationship with Kensi. All in all a great season. Can't wait for Season 8!\nExcellent Season To Date\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['Norsk Bokm\u00e5l'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Roar Uthaug'], 'Producers': ['Martin Sundland', 'Are Heidenstr\u00f8m'], 'Starring': ['Kristoffer Joner', 'Ane Dahl Torp', 'Jonas Hoff Oftebro']}\nIncredible movie! Yes it has subtitles but it's well worth the read. Hollywood should take notes on how to make a disaster movie without all the unbelievable nonsense they LOVE to add in...<br /><br />Great movie with characters I actually cared about - wow - what a rarity these days in Hollywood.\nAwesome Movie\nBigfoot Vs. Zombies\nScience Fiction, Suspense, Comedy, Horror\n['A scientist creates a toxic cocktail that slowly leaks into the local population, creating flesh-eating zombies - and only one creature of legend can stop the growing hordes of the undead.']\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Mark Polonia'], 'Producers': ['Rob Hauschild']}\nI have seen a lot of movies that some would call extraordinarily bad. But alas, this one does not measure up to any of those. The spectacular Bigfoot gorilla suit...er...I mean, make-up, was outstanding. The zombies were obviously trained by the best acting coaches that Hollywood had to offer. Every &#34;Errr&#34; was pronounced with depth, every &#34;Arrrg&#34; was breathtakingly realistic. The last time I heard such agonizing sounds was when I slipped in my shower...<br /><br />And the humans - well - they left me as speechless as the stumbling zombies. Even with minimal dialog and plots that kept me on the edge of my seat. This brought back memories of the time I was hiking on Kauai, and almost slipped off a cliff in the rainstorm. Meaning, I had no idea if I would live through the next devastating twist...<br /><br />Bigfoot Vs. Zombies - a movie that I would highly recommend to anyone seeking a movie to watch while you're waiting for a meteor to strike the earth...\nIncredible!\nBlue Bloods: 5 Seasons\nRated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Drama\n['Each season contains 6 discs.']\n{'Format': 'Box set, Multiple Formats, Widescreen, Color, NTSC', 'Contributor': 'BLUE BLOODS: FIVE SEASON PACK', 'Number Of Discs': '6', 'Publication Date': 'September 8, 2015', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'Unrated (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 0.7 x 5.4 inches; 2.15 Pounds', 'Media Format': 'Box set, Multiple Formats, Widescreen, Color, NTSC', 'Release date': 'September 8, 2015', 'Studio': 'Paramount', 'Number of discs': '6'}\nLove this season!

This film has left me so scarred that I will never celebrate Easter ever again. Even looking at pictures of colored eggs leaves me shivering and almost catatonic!<br /><br />When the movie was over, I released all of your rabbits into the wild and was overwhelmed with joy when eagles appeared out of nowhere and protected me by taking them all away.<br /><br />I should have never watched this.
