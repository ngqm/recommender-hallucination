This subject has been covered so many times that it's become a cliche already. I found myself not caring at all about any of the characters because I just couldn't connect to them at all.<br /><br />What a waste of time.\nReview Title: Terrible Movie\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I get it, she didn't want to be there - like the rest of them - but her whining did get on my nerves after a while. I do hope the next movie will be better.\nNot As Good As The First\n{'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Dennis Smith', \"Terrence O'Hara\", 'John Peter Kousakis', 'Tony Wharmby', 'Eric A.

Gets more into the relationship of Jo and Callen - won't say anymore than that. Also it builds on the Deeks relationship with Kensi. All in all a great season. Can't wait for Season 8!\nExcellent Season To Date\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['Norsk Bokm\u00e5l'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Roar Uthaug'], 'Producers': ['Martin Sundland', 'Are Heidenstr\u00f8m'], 'Starring': ['Kristoffer Joner', 'Ane Dahl Torp', 'Jonas Hoff Oftebro']}\nIncredible movie! Yes it has subtitles but it's well worth the read. Hollywood should take notes on how to make a disaster movie without all the unbelievable nonsense they LOVE to add in...<br /><br />Great movie with characters I actually cared about - wow - what a rarity these days in Hollywood.\nAwesome Movie\nBigfoot Vs. Zombies\nScience Fiction, Suspense, Comedy, Horror\n['A scientist creates a toxic cocktail that slowly leaks into the local population, creating flesh-eating zombies - and only one creature of legend can stop the growing hordes of the undead.']\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Mark Polonia'], 'Producers': ['Rob Hauschild']}\nI have seen a lot of movies that some would call extraordinarily bad. But alas, this one does not measure up to any of those. The spectacular Bigfoot gorilla suit...er...I mean, make-up, was outstanding. The zombies were obviously trained by the best acting coaches that Hollywood had to offer. Every &#34;Errr&#34; was pronounced with depth, every &#34;Arrrg&#34; was breathtakingly realistic. The last time I heard such agonizing sounds was when I slipped in my shower...<br /><br />And the humans - well - they left me as speechless as the stumbling zombies. Even with minimal dialog and plots that kept me on the edge of my seat. This brought back memories of the time I was hiking on Kauai, and almost slipped off a cliff in the rainstorm. Meaning, I had no idea if I would live through the next devastating twist...<br /><br />Bigfoot Vs. Zombies - a movie that I would highly recommend to anyone seeking a movie to watch while you're waiting for a meteor to strike the earth...\nIncredible!\nBlue Bloods: 5 Seasons\nRated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Drama\n['Each season contains 6 discs.']\n{'Format': 'Box set, Multiple Formats, Widescreen, Color, NTSC', 'Contributor': 'BLUE BLOODS: FIVE SEASON PACK', 'Number Of Discs': '6', 'Publication Date': 'September 8, 2015', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'Unrated (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 0.7 x 5.4 inches; 2.15 Pounds', 'Media Format': 'Box set, Multiple Formats, Widescreen, Color, NTSC', 'Release date': 'September 8, 2015', 'Studio': 'Paramount', 'Number of discs': '6'}\nLove this season!

Creepy in its own right and great twist at the end. I'll certainly watch it again.\nGreat Movie!\nCosmos - War Of The Planets (1977)\nScience Fiction, Adventure\n['A strange signal arrives on the Earth disturbing all communications, while an ufo appears above the Antarctic sea.']\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Alfonso Brescia'], 'Producers': ['Luigi Alessi', 'Doro Vlado Hreljanovic'], 'Starring': ['John Richardson', 'Yanti Sommer']}\nUm...yah...not much to say really...lol! Oh wait! I liked the helmets...\nGreat Helmets...\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'substance use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['The Snygg Brothers'], 'Producers': ['The Snygg Brothers'], 'Starring': ['Peter Sullivan', 'Marisol Custodio', 'John Fedele'], 'Studio': [\"Uncork'd Entertainment\"]}\nThis special effects of this movie had me on the edge of my seat!<br /><br />I couldn't believe how realistic a gigantic-marionette-zombie rabbit could look. This film has left me so scarred that I will never celebrate Easter ever again. Even looking at pictures of colored eggs leaves me shivering and almost catatonic!<br /><br />When the movie was over, I released all of your rabbits into the wild and was overwhelmed with joy when eagles appeared out of nowhere and protected me by taking them all away.<br /><br />I should have never watched this. Beware the rabbits - they - are - everywhere...\nOh the blood...the horror of it all...\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['---'], 'Producers': ['Olga Valanos'], 'Starring': ['Russel Means'], 'Studio': ['Syndicado']}\nMost people think that Tribes have it made because they 1) Own Casinos  2) Get free government money 3) Get free homes.<br /><br />They don't realize that Tribes are the ONLY race of people that have NO rights and NO equality in the United States. It's disgusting.<br /><br />Watch this movie and educate yourselves BEFORE you open your mouth to tell us how we &#34;got it made.&#34;\nWatch The Truth\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Michael Chuah'], 'Producers': ['Michael Chuah', 'Oliver Jeyrald Lee'], 'Starring': ['Amber Chia', 'Juin Juin Leong', 'Vick Teo'], 'Studio': ['Midnight Pulp']}\nThis movie was slow...it began slow...it stayed slow and it ended slow.<br /><br />It was incredibly hard to get through because it was so slow. I kept finding my mind wandering but I refused to fast forward the movie like I usually do to movies of this caliber. The shots were too long, the angles rough and the 'jump factor' was too mild to be considered 'scary'.<br /><br />All in all it was a horrible movie that I would never recommend to anyone - unless of course you have a TON of time to waste and absolutely nothing else to do.\nI Watched It\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Casey Nolan'], 'Producers': ['Casey Nolan'], 'Starring': ['Casey Nolan', 'Tanner McBride'], 'Studio': ['MindSeed Productions']}\nI actually watched the entire movie. Most of it is silly. I hate it when the so-called paranormal experts use a voice-box and struggle to make sense of the string of words. They ALL do it and that's just stupid. And the over-acting and \"real\" footage was a waste of time. At least it's not as bad as Ghost Adventures - thus I gave them 2 stars. If you have time to waste like I did, great. If you're looking for a movie of substance - forget it, you're not going to find it in this movie.\nTime Wasted\nThese Final Hours\nScience Fiction, Suspense, Serious, Tense\n['A self-obsessed young man makes his way to the party-to-end-all-parties on the last day on Earth, but ends up saving the life of a little girl searching for her father. Their relationship ultimately leads him on the path to redemption.']\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Zak Hilditch'], 'Producers': ['Liz Kearney'], 'Starring': ['Nathan Phillips', 'Angourie Rice', 'Jessica De Gouw']}\nI really enjoyed it a lot. This movie gives you a lot to think about when it's over. I think most people won't like this movie because it doesn't have a happy ending, but the fact is, in real life, REAL happy endings are few and far between.<br /><br />This is exactly what it would be like if we were hit like this. Scary, yes, depressing, yes, but it is true to life so there you have it. Well done.\nIncredible movie\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', 'Espa\u00f1ol [CC]'], 'Directors': ['John Stephenson'], 'Producers': ['Hannah Leader', 'Tom Newman', 'Andre Relis'], 'Starring': ['Hans Matheson', 'Samantha Barks', 'Lesley Manville'], 'Studio': ['Samuel Goldwyn Films']}\nVery nice movie to spend time watching. The plot is great and so are the actors except for Susan Boyle. She needs to stick to singing and leave the acting to those that can. Overall a good movie for the holidays.\nHeart Warming\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium', 'English Dialogue Boost: Low', 'Italiano', '\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e', 'Portugu\u00eas', 'Deutsch', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a)', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', 'Polski', '\u010ce\u0161tina', 'Magyar', 'Fran\u00e7ais'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', '\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629', '\u010ce\u0161tina', 'Dansk', 'Deutsch', '\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a)', 'Suomi', 'Filipino', 'Fran\u00e7ais', '\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea', '\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940', 'Magyar', 'Indonesia', 'Italiano', '\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e', '\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4', 'Bahasa Melayu', 'Norsk Bokm\u00e5l', 'Nederlands', 'Polski', 'Portugu\u00eas (Brasil)', 'Portugu\u00eas (Portugal)', 'Rom\u00e2n\u0103', '\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439', 'Svenska', '\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bcd', '\u0c24\u0c46\u0c32\u0c41\u0c17\u0c41', '\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22', 'T\u00fcrk\u00e7e', '\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7b80\u4f53\uff09', '\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7e41\u9ad4\uff09'], 'Directors': ['Stefano Sollima'], 'Producers': ['Akiva Goldsman', 'Josh Appelbaum', 'Andr\u00e9 Nemec', 'Michael B.
