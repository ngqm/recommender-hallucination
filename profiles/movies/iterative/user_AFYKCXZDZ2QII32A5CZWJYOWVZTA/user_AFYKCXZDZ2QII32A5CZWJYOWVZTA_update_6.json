Co-starring Tom Sizemore (Natural Born Killers), Chelsea Field (The Last Boy Scout), Tia Carrere (True Lies) and Vanessa Williams (Shaft), this relentlessly explosive action pic just may prove that 'it's better to be dead and cool than alive and uncool.' When their favorite bar is threatened with closure, outlaw biker Harley (Rourke) and modern-day cowboy Marlboro (Johnson) hatch a scheme to save the day - by robbing the corrupt bank behind the bar's shutdown! When the robbery yields not money but a shipment of drugs, Harley and Marlboro find themselves on the run from the bank's sinister president (Sizemore) and a posse of seemingly unstoppable hit men. Now wanted dead or alive, the hard-riding heroes must fight for their very lives and learn that when the going gets tough, the tough take the law into their own hands.\"]\n{'Genre': 'Action & Adventure', 'Format': 'Blu-ray', 'Contributor': 'Don Johnson, Mickey Rourke, Simon Wincer, Chelsea Field', 'Language': 'English', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 38 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.78:1', 'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 2.12 Ounces', 'Item model number': '15776', 'Director': 'Simon Wincer', 'Media Format': 'Blu-ray', 'Run time': '1 hour and 38 minutes', 'Release date': 'May 19, 2015', 'Actors': 'Mickey Rourke, Don Johnson, Chelsea Field', 'Subtitles': 'English', 'Studio': 'Shout Factory', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nlove this movie\nFive Stars\nHatfields & McCoys [Blu-ray]\nKevin Costner  (Actor, Producer),     Bill Paxton  (Actor),     Kevin Reynolds  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    NR    Format: Blu-ray\nMovies & TV, Featured Categories, Blu-ray, Drama\n['Bonded by their oath to the same flag, two confederate soldiers, \u201cDevil\u201d Anse Hatfield (Kevin Costner) and Randall McCoy (Bill Paxton), return home seeking peace after tireless months of battle.
