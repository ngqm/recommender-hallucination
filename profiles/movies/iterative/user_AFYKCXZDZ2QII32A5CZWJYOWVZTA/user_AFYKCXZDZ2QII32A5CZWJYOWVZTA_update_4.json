Co-starring Tom Sizemore (Natural Born Killers), Chelsea Field (The Last Boy Scout), Tia Carrere (True Lies) and Vanessa Williams (Shaft), this relentlessly explosive action pic just may prove that 'it's better to be dead and cool than alive and uncool.' When their favorite bar is threatened with closure, outlaw biker Harley (Rourke) and modern-day cowboy Marlboro (Johnson) hatch a scheme to save the day - by robbing the corrupt bank behind the bar's shutdown! When the robbery yields not money but a shipment of drugs, Harley and Marlboro find themselves on the run from the bank's sinister president (Sizemore) and a posse of seemingly unstoppable hit men. Now wanted dead or alive, the hard-riding heroes must fight for their very lives and learn that when the going gets tough, the tough take the law into their own hands.\"]\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Action & Adventure', 'Format': 'Blu-ray', 'Contributor': 'Don Johnson, Mickey Rourke, Simon Wincer, Chelsea Field', 'Language': 'English', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 38 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.78:1', 'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 2.12 Ounces', 'Item model number': '15776', 'Director': 'Simon Wincer', 'Media Format': 'Blu-ray', 'Run time': '1 hour and 38 minutes', 'Release date': 'May 19, 2015', 'Actors': 'Mickey Rourke, Don Johnson, Chelsea Field', 'Subtitles': 'English', 'Studio': 'Shout Factory', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: love this movie\nReview Title: Five Stars\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
