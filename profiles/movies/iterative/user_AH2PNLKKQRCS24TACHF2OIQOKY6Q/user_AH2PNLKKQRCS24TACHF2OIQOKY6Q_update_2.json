I considered 4 due to some unnecessary elements and length. But, I still have to give it a five. I really appreciated the portrayal of lifelong love, commitment, and the character development in this film. It seemed a bit long...but maybe that is because these filmmakers stayed true to the reality of these lives, instead of giving into the overly-dramatic, cheap, Hollywood-ism that is so prevalent in film today. Overall...well done. My husband and I truly enjoyed it.\nReview Title: Had To Lean To The Five\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Adult themes dressed in children's clothing. So glad I previewed this before I let the kids watch!
