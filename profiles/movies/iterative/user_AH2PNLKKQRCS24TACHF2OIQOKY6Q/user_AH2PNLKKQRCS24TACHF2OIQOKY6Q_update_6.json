Adult themes dressed in children's clothing. So glad I previewed this before I let the kids watch!

I considered 4 due to some unnecessary elements and length. But, I still have to give it a five. I really appreciated the portrayal of lifelong love, commitment, and the character development in this film. It seemed a bit long...but maybe that is because these filmmakers stayed true to the reality of these lives, instead of giving into the overly-dramatic, cheap, Hollywood-ism that is so prevalent in film today. Overall...well done. My husband and I truly enjoyed it.\nHad To Lean To The Five\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Steven Suderman'], 'Producers': ['Steven Suderman'], 'Studio': ['FilmBuff']}\nThis is not a &#34;How to&#34; per se. It is more about the heart and soul, and struggles, of farming. Though we felt the film was a bit slow in some places, it is insightful and we enjoyed it very much. I particularly enjoyed watching the &#34;animal mommy,&#34; as I've dubbed her. She is really amazing. Thank you to everyone who had a part in the making of this film.

It is worth your while to get. But, if you've seen the programs, interviews, and read the books, there is not really any new information here. I bought it because I thought he was going to give some in depth advice on preparing (as the description suggests) after perhaps interviewing some professionals and alluding to what he is doing himself. But, while the spiritual preparation part was wise (and hopefully obvious)...there was little else beyond that. My only question is...how can you accurately, and with certainty, count Shemitah's if you cannot be sure when the Jubilee (50th) year is? It's not an accusation, it's just an observation. However, as history shows, there have been significant collapses during the periods noted by Cahn...so worthwhile knowledge, either way.\nIf You Just Won't Read...\nAll For Liberty\nDrama, Military and War\n[\"It is 1775.
