It is more about the heart and soul, and struggles, of farming. Though we felt the film was a bit slow in some places, it is insightful and we enjoyed it very much.

Adult themes dressed in children's clothing. So glad I previewed this before I let the kids watch! Trash.\nCartoons Aren't Always For Kids\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Michael McGowan'], 'Producers': ['Michael McGowan', 'Jody Colero', 'Avi Federgreen', 'Tamara Deverell'], 'Starring': ['James Cromwell', 'Genevieve Bujold', 'Campbell Scott'], 'Studio': ['SAMUEL GOLDWYN FILMS LLC.']}\nI was torn between a four and five star rating. I considered 4 due to some unnecessary elements and length. But, I still have to give it a five. I really appreciated the portrayal of lifelong love, commitment, and the character development in this film. It seemed a bit long...but maybe that is because these filmmakers stayed true to the reality of these lives, instead of giving into the overly-dramatic, cheap, Hollywood-ism that is so prevalent in film today. Overall...well done. My husband and I truly enjoyed it.\nHad To Lean To The Five\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Steven Suderman'], 'Producers': ['Steven Suderman'], 'Studio': ['FilmBuff']}\nThis is not a &#34;How to&#34; per se.
