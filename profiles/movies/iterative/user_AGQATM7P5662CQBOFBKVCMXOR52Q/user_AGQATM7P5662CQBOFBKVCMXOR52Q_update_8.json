The sound is terrific, enhancing the sense of depth with a seamless DTS surround-sound mix that works well even in headphones.', '--Michael Mikesell', 'From the Back Cover', \"A young musician is summoned to his mother's castle in accordance with her final wishes.

Critics and audiences were divided between those who hailed it as an instant classic that captures the visual splendor and evocative innocence of Chris Van Allsburg\\'s popular children\\'s book, and those who felt that the innovative use of \"performance capture\"--to accurately translate live performances into all-digital characters--was an eerie and not-quite-lifelike distraction from the story\\'s epic-scale North Pole adventure. In any case it\\'s a benign, kind-hearted celebration of the yuletide spirit, especially for kids who have almost grown out of their need to believe in Santa Claus. Tom Hanks is the nominal \"star\" who performs five different computer-generated characters, but it\\'s the visuals that steal this show, as director Robert Zemeckis indulges his tireless pursuit of technological innovation. No matter how you respond to the many wonders on display, it\\'s clear that The Polar Express represents a significant milestone in the digital revolution of cinema. If it also fills you with the joy of Christmas (in spite of its Nuremberg-like rally of frantic elves), so much the better.', '--Jeff Shannon']\n{'Genre': 'Kids & Family, Animation, Action & Adventure, Performing Arts', 'Format': 'Color, Dolby, NTSC, Animated, Digital Sound', 'Contributor': 'Deezen, Eddie, Hanks, Tom, King, Brendan', 'Language': 'English', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'G (General Audience)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.5 x 0.75 inches; 4.8 Ounces', 'Media Format': 'Color, Dolby, NTSC, Animated, Digital Sound', 'Release date': 'October 28, 2008', 'Actors': 'Hanks, Tom, Deezen, Eddie, King, Brendan', 'Dubbed': 'French, Spanish', 'Subtitles': 'English, French, Spanish', 'Studio': 'Warner Home Video', 'Number of discs': '2'}\nMy granddaughter had the blue ray version and loves this one\nFive Stars\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'frightening scenes', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Chris Fisher', 'Constantine Makris', 'Tawnia McKiernan', 'Jack Kenny', 'Stephen Surjik', 'Jace Alexander', 'Vincent Misiano', 'Michael W.
