I know many people like his Great Escape, and so do I, but this movie has it all.  Romance, intrigue and a fantastic car chase!!!  Especially because it was set in San Francisco, what a place for a car chase.  The next best is our modern day \"Ronin\", but that's a different kind of chase.  It's set in Europe, where the street are super narrow.  This movie, Bullit, is a great cop movie also.  So if by chance you've missed it, it needs to go on  your must see list.<br />Carolyn Gleeson- Lover of Steve McQueen movies in any form.  In fact if you like Steve, see his motorcycle documentary,\"On any Sunday\". Unbelievable!!!\nReview Title: Bullitt- must see for car buffs!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
