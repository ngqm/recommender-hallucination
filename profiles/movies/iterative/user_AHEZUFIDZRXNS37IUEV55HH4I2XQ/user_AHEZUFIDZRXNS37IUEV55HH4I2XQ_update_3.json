But when the witness is murdered, Bullitt mercilessly tracks a trail of lies and corruption that leads all the way to the halls of power in Washington.

I know many people like his Great Escape, and so do I, but this movie has it all.  Romance, intrigue and a fantastic car chase!!!  Especially because it was set in San Francisco, what a place for a car chase.  The next best is our modern day \"Ronin\", but that's a different kind of chase.  It's set in Europe, where the street are super narrow.  This movie, Bullit, is a great cop movie also.  So if by chance you've missed it, it needs to go on  your must see list.<br />Carolyn Gleeson- Lover of Steve McQueen movies in any form.  In fact if you like Steve, see his motorcycle documentary,\"On any Sunday\". Unbelievable!!!\nBullitt- must see for car buffs!\nLuminarias\nEvelina Fernandez  (Actor),     Scott Bakula  (Actor),     Jose Luis Valenzuela  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Comedy\n{}\nThis is one of my favorite movies. Sort of like a Latina, &#34;Waiting to Exhale&#34;.  I love the characters and how they explore every facet, whether it's real or a myth about the way people perceive each other.  It is funny, poignant and serious all at the same time.  And the music is fabulous, the best soundtrack ever.  This is a great rainy day movie and one that you will watch over and over again.<br />Carolyn G\nLuminarias-movie\nOn Any Sunday - Re-Mastered-Director's Special Edition 2 Disc Set\nBruce Brown  (Actor, Director),     Mert Lawwill  (Actor)    Rated:    G    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Fully Loaded DVDs, Special Editions\n['Featuring Steve McQueen with music by the famed Dominick Fronteirie, this film is without a doubt the quintessential motorcycle film, now digitally remastered and loaded with never-before-seen extras.']\n{'Genre': 'Sports', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Closed-captioned, Color, NTSC, Special Edition', 'Contributor': 'Bruce Brown, Malcolm Smith, Mert Lawwill, Steve McQueen', 'Language': 'Unqualified', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 28 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.33:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'G (General Audience)', 'Item model number': 'Relay Time: 88 min; 2Videos', 'Director': 'Bruce Brown', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Closed-captioned, Color, NTSC, Special Edition', 'Run time': '1 hour and 28 minutes', 'Release date': 'September 4, 2007', 'Actors': 'Bruce Brown, Mert Lawwill, Malcolm Smith, Steve McQueen', 'Studio': 'Monterey Video', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '2'}\nProbably the great motorcycle movie every made.
