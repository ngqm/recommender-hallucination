Partnered with secret agent Lucy Wilde, Gru, along with the wildly unpredictable Minions, must figure out how to keep his cover while also keeping up with his duties as a father.

Parenting is no less sticky, and the fact that Gru will go to any length to ensure the happiness of his adopted girls Agnes, Edith, and Margo is evident by the elaborate birthday party he's throwing for Agnes that includes a live unicorn and a princess named Gruzinkerbell. Anti-Villain League operative Lucy Wild (Kristen Wiig) kidnaps Gru after the party, using an arsenal of spy gadgetry that would make James Bond jealous, and the agency solicits his help in apprehending a criminal who's made an entire secret lab disappear from the Arctic Circle and stolen a dangerous transmutation formula. The lure of excitement tempts Gru, and he and Lucy set up an undercover operation in a bakery in Paradise Mall, the minions start cranking out cupcakes, and Gru and Lucy begin investigating their fellow business owners. Meanwhile, Agnes pines for a mother, Margo finds her first boyfriend, Dr. Nefario takes a more exciting job, a slew of minions go missing, and Gru staunchly refuses to enter the dating scene. Little does Gru know that his whole life is about to change once again. The minions and their antics are quite funny in this second film, and, for the 10-and-under crowd, they completely steal the show. For the older crowd, the film does a decent job of further developing Gru's character and provides lots of comedic material in the exaggeration of the many challenges of parenthood as well as through the wacky exploits of the minions.

I know many people like his Great Escape, and so do I, but this movie has it all.  Romance, intrigue and a fantastic car chase!!!  Especially because it was set in San Francisco, what a place for a car chase.  The next best is our modern day \"Ronin\", but that's a different kind of chase.  It's set in Europe, where the street are super narrow.  This movie, Bullit, is a great cop movie also.  So if by chance you've missed it, it needs to go on  your must see list.<br />Carolyn Gleeson- Lover of Steve McQueen movies in any form.  In fact if you like Steve, see his motorcycle documentary,\"On any Sunday\".
