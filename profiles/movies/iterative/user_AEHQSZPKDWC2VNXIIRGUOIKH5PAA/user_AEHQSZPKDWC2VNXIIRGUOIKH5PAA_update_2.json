Lewis and a divorced American poet named Joy Gresham. Best known for writing', 'The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe', \", Lewis (Anthony Hopkins) is living comfortably as a respected Oxford don, his academic lifestyle a kind of shell protecting him from the emotional risk of love. Joy Gresham (Debra Winger) arrives at Oxford as an avid admirer of Lewis's writing, and the safety of his collegiate routine is quickly disrupted when Lewis realizes that he's fallen deeply and unexpectedly in love. Their courtship is uniquely engaging; he's shy and uncertain, she's outspoken and bold. But when Joy is diagnosed with cancer, Lewis's Christian faith is put to the test--he cannot fathom why their happiness together would be so drastically challenged. Together, they find a way to accept and honor the time they have shared together, and under the sensitive direction of Richard Attenborough,\", 'Shadowlands', 'arrives at a conclusion that is both heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time. Hopkins and Winger are equally superb in this absorbing story of personal and spiritual transformation--a story previously filmed for British television in 1985, with Joss Ackland and Claire Bloom.', '--Jeff Shannon']\n{'Aspect Ratio': '2.35:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG (Parental Guidance Suggested)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.38 x 0.6 inches; 4 Ounces', 'Director': 'Richard Attenborough', 'Media Format': 'AC-3, Color, Dolby, DVD, Widescreen, NTSC, Letterboxed', 'Run time': '2 hours and 11 minutes', 'Release date': 'April 13, 1999', 'Actors': 'Anthony Hopkins, Debra Winger, Michael Denison, Andrew Seear, Tim McMullan', 'Dubbed': 'Spanish', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish, French', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1), Spanish (Dolby Digital 1.0), French (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround)', 'Studio': 'Hbo Home Video', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nI thought I  was purchasing the full version of the movie on DVD, but got an edited version.
