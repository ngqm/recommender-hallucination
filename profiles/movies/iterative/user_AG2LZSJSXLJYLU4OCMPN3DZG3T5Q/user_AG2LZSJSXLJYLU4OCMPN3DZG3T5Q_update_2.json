  "reference_summary": "Way We Were, The\nDrama, Passionate, Sad, Sentimental\n['Set during the politically charged time of pre-WWII McCarthyism, a young couple with diametrically opposing views of politics, friendships and careers find it difficult to balance their private love and desires with their very public lives.']\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Pollack', 'Sydney'], 'Producers': ['Ray Stark'], 'Starring': ['Barbra Streisand', 'Robert Redford', 'Bradford Dillman']}\nMost movies have happy endings. The ending is not horible but its not a good one. I wish the main character would had fought for his wife, specialy because it is because of her that he got to the top! Never even notice him being depress or ask for a second opportunity or do anything to save the marriage. It broke my heart!\nUpset! No happy ending to an amazong movie!\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Radha Bharadwaj'], 'Producers': ['Radha Bharadwaj', 'Gregory Cascante', 'Mike Cline', 'Christian Slater'], 'Starring': ['Jared Leto', 'Christian Slater', 'Claire Forlani'], 'Studio': ['Multicom Entertainment Group (MEG)']}\nThe only reason why i gave this movie a 4 n not a  5 star is because basil didnt mary clara at the end.\nAmazing movie.",
