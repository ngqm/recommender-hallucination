Her physical pain is evident in the scars that line her body and the way she carries herself, wincing with each tentative step. She's no good at hiding her emotional pain either. Blunt to the point of searing insult, Claire's anger seethes out of her with nearly every interaction. She has driven away her husband, her friends - even her chronic-pain support group has kicked her out. The only one left in Claire's otherwise solitary existence is her housekeeper-cum-caretaker, Silvana (Academy Award nominee Adriana Barraza), who barely tolerates her boss' need for liquor and prescription pills. But the suicide of Nina (Academy Award nominee Anna Kendrick), one of Claire's fellow chronic-pain group members, prompts another fixation. In pursuing questions about the death of a woman she barely knew, Claire explores the boundaries between life and death, abandonment and heartbreak, danger and salvation. As she inserts herself into the lives of Nina's husband (Sam Worthington) and the son Nina left behind, Claire just might find salvation.\"]\nAverage Rating: 4.2\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'TCFHE', 'Item Weight': '0.1 Pounds', 'Unit Count': '1.0 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Weight': '0.06 Kilograms', 'Aspect Ratio': '2.40:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 1.6 Ounces', 'Item model number': '2311542', 'Director': 'Daniel Barnz', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, Dolby, Subtitled, Widescreen, NTSC, DTS Surround Sound', 'Run time': '1 hour and 42 minutes', 'Release date': 'April 21, 2015', 'Actors': 'Sam Worthington, Jennifer Aniston, Anna Kendrick, Paula Cale, Mamie Gummer', 'Subtitles': 'Spanish, French, English', 'Studio': '20th Century Fox', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: Doesn't relate to the real thing and people.
