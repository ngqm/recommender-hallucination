Big companies don't want people to know that every debt gets resold for a profit and when it comes to things like huge debts such as student loans they get resold over, and over, and over again. Each time profiting someone who isn't the original debt owner or the original company responsible for lending the debt. This process is highly illegal and for those who can make it through the end of the movie can see exactly why. Eventually you get a total and utter economic collapse of the securities these debts are held under because of the fake money and inflation created from the sickening number of resales that have happened with the securities. Definitely up there with the Wolf of Wall street.\nReview Title: A must watch for those in the business industry\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

The guy is locked away behind an automated system and no matter what he does the controller will not listen to him even tho it is 100% right that if he stays in the automated prison that he will die.<br /><br />In the united states working hard every day and fixing every little problem in a persons life by spending every dollar they earn towards a better tomorrow is frowned upon. I say this because that is what I do. If I see a problem I fix it, even if there is a cost associated with it. While those who are incarcerated are allowed to be forgiven for student loans those of us who are not and wake up every day to do good are told too bad if you can't pay based on your life. #MyTwoCents #Symbolism\nA true psychological thriller\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Mark Palansky'], 'Producers': ['Daniel Bekerman', 'Lee Clay'], 'Starring': ['Peter Dinklage', 'Julia Ormond', 'Martin Donovan'], 'Studio': ['tribecashortlist']}\nThis movie was very thought provoking and captivating. Certainly a testament to Peter Dinklages acting is that he is more than Game of Thrones. All in all it makes me wonder what holding onto memories can do and whether or not it is even good to do so at times. A good watch if you're into the type of movies that make you think.\nSaddening yet englightening\n{'Content advisory': ['Substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['J.C.
