When accused arsonist Leopold Dilg (Cary Grant) escapes jail, he hides out in the home of friend Nora(Jean Arthur). Posing as a gardener, Dilg teams up with Nora to convince her summer tenant, SupremeCourt candidate Michael Lightcap (Ronald Colman, Lost Horizon) that Dilg was framed. The zaniness never stops as the three of them dodge the cops, try to snag the real crooks and discover along the way that both men have fallen for Nora. But who has captured Nora's heart?

Cary Grant, awkwardly cast, is a small-town political agitator who is framed for the burning of a local factory; he takes refuge in the attic of a country cottage that landlady Jean Arthur is preparing to rent out to a celebrated law professor (silver-tongued Ronald Colman, perhaps the only actor in Hollywood who could make Grant look like a proletarian). Stevens, suspended between his light '30s style (\", 'Swing Time', ') and his heavy postwar manner (', 'A Place in the Sun', \"), struggles to balance a charming, surprisingly suspenseful romantic triangle with the heavy, debating-society tone of the screenplay, which pits Grant, the representative of a compassionate, emotional sense of justice, against the cool, abstract application of the law advocated by Colman. Caught between these two highly verbal characters, Jean Arthur doesn't have much to do but be adorable and provide the occasional quizzical reaction shot--two things she does with exquisite skill. Stevens and Arthur teamed up again one year later for another strange-bedfellows farce, the marvelous\", 'The More the Merrier', \"; in 1953 Arthur made her final film appearance in Stevens's\", 'Shane', '.', '--Dave Kehr']\n{'Genre': 'Romance, Comedy', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Black & White, Full Screen, NTSC, Subtitled', 'Contributor': 'Ronald Colman, Columbia Pictures Corporation, George Stevens, Cary Grant, Jean Arthur, Glenda Farrell, Edgar Buchanan, Charles DingleRonald Colman, Columbia Pictures Corporation, George Stevens, Cary Grant, Jean Arthur, Glenda Farrell, Edgar Buchanan, Charles Dingle  See more', 'Language': 'English, Unqualified', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 57 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.33:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.75 x 5.75 x 0.53 inches; 4 Ounces', 'Item model number': '2226600', 'Director': 'George Stevens', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Black & White, Full Screen, NTSC, Subtitled', 'Run time': '1 hour and 57 minutes', 'Release date': 'February 25, 2003', 'Actors': 'Cary Grant, Jean Arthur, Ronald Colman, Edgar Buchanan, Glenda Farrell', 'Subtitles': 'English, French, Japanese, Georgian', 'Producers': 'George Stevens', 'Studio': 'Sony Pictures Home Entertainment', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nI enjoyed this movie when I rented it that I ended up purchasing the DVD.
