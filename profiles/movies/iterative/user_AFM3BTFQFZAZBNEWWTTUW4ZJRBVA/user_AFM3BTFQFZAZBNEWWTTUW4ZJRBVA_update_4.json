Although his new, much-younger wife Mona is a bundle of nerves, Stewart seizes the opportunity to reconnect with his children, whom he loves dearly.

Stewart (Maurice Lauchner), divorced and remarried to a much younger wife, Mona (Taral Hicks), must fight to have access to his children (Paris Bennett and Jeffery Lewis). But he doesn't know just how angry his ex-wife Gloria (Melonie Daniels) is, and the lengths to which she'll go to turn his son against him. Can Aunt Bam save this family? Well, really, there's not much doubt, but\", \"Aunt Bam's Place\", \"glides along smoothly with snappy comedy, heartfelt Christian sentiment, and gospel songs (every character gets his or her own showstopping number). The play was filmed in front of a live audience at an Atlanta theater, giving it the look of a standard sitcom. Its greatest strength--besides Aunt Bam's crowd-pleasing wisecracks--is that it extends compassion to every character. Gloria, demonized though she is, has her own song wailing out her personal pain.\", \"Aunt Bam's Place\", 'is straight-ahead Tyler Perry (creator of Madea, director of', 'Diary of a Mad Black Woman', 'and', 'I Can Do Bad All by Myself', \").
