Matt Damon's performance is perfect, Jude Law is wonderful and Gwyneth Paltrow is luminescent.  It is mysterious, haunting, and thought provoking.  The acting is intense and masterful and you cannot help but be drawn into the story.  The complex layers of the characters are slowly revealed and wonderfully portrayed.\nAmazing performances\nPenelope\nRichard Grant  (Actor),     Catherine O'Hara  (Actor),     Mark Palansky  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Comedy\n['Born with the snout of a pig, young Penelope Wilhern (Christina Ricci) spends life a virtual prisoner in her home.
