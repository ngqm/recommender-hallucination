Matt Damon's performance is perfect, Jude Law is wonderful and Gwyneth Paltrow is luminescent.  It is mysterious, haunting, and thought provoking.  The acting is intense and masterful and you cannot help but be drawn into the story.  The complex layers of the characters are slowly revealed and wonderfully portrayed.\nReview Title: Amazing performances\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
