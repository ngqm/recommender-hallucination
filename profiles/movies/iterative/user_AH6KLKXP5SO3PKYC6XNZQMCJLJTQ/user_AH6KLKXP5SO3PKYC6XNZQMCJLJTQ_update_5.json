This movie should have been labeled \"One man's descent into insanity\".  Timothy Treadwell was a self absorbed,selfish, egocentric man and this story is about him and not the bears.  Due to his own behavior he became a  dish for one of the bears.  Too bad he took someone else along with him to his death. A couple of the bears he \"loved\" so much had to be murdered because of his behavior.  I would not recommend this movie.\nConservationist? Who? Timothy Treadwell?\nThe Way\nEmilio Estevez  (Actor, Director),     Martin Sheen  (Actor)    Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Independently Distributed, Drama\n['\"The Way\" is a powerful and inspirational story about family, friends, and the challenges we face while navigating this ever-changing and complicated world. Martin Sheen plays Tom, who comes to St. Jean Pied de Port, France to collect the remains of his adult son , killed in the Pyrenees in a storm while walking the Camino de Santiago,. Rather than return home, Tom decides to embark on the historical pilgrimage to honor his son\\'s desire to finish the journey. What Tom doesn\\'t plan on is the profound impact the journey will have on him. From the unexpected and, oftentimes, amusing experiences along \"The Way,\" Tom begins to learn what it means to be a citizen of the world again. Through his unresolved relationship with his son, he discovers the difference between \"the life we live and the life we choose.\"']\n{'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Emilio Estevez, Martin Sheen', 'Language': 'English', 'Runtime': '2 hours and 1 minute', 'Studio': 'Arc Entertainment', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned)', 'Product Dimensions': '5.4 x 0.6 x 7.5 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Director': 'Emilio Estevez', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Run time': '2 hours and 1 minute', 'Release date': 'February 21, 2012', 'Actors': 'Emilio Estevez, Martin Sheen', 'Subtitles': 'Spanish', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nI've added The Way to my list of all time favorite movies.

It was more of a movie about civil rights. Entwined was the real life story of the White House Buller. Forest Whitaker played the role well and deserves accolades for his performance.\nWonderful movie\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['David Frankel', 'Mikael Salomon', 'Tom Hanks', 'David Leland', 'Richard Loncraine', 'David Nutter', 'Phil Alden Robinson', 'Tony To'], 'Producers': ['Tom Hanks', 'Steven Spielberg', 'Mary Richards'], 'Starring': ['Patrick Dempsey', 'Rick Gomez', 'Scott Grimes'], 'Studio': ['Discovery Global']}\nVery intense.
