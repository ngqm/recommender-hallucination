This movie should have been labeled \"One man's descent into insanity\".  Timothy Treadwell was a self absorbed,selfish, egocentric man and this story is about him and not the bears.  Due to his own behavior he became a  dish for one of the bears.  Too bad he took someone else along with him to his death. A couple of the bears he \"loved\" so much had to be murdered because of his behavior.  I would not recommend this movie.\nReview Title: Conservationist? Who?
