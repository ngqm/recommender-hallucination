The costumes and scenery for the epic were amazing, and the acting was great.  The only thing I was iffy about was the musical numbers. Considering the length of time for this film, having so few song and dance numbers in a Bollywood film they felt a bit forced and random, and in my personal opinion should have been cut.\nReview Title: A beautiful interpretation of the story\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

The costumes and scenery for the epic were amazing, and the acting was great.  The only thing I was iffy about was the musical numbers. Considering the length of time for this film, having so few song and dance numbers in a Bollywood film they felt a bit forced and random, and in my personal opinion should have been cut.\nA beautiful interpretation of the story",
