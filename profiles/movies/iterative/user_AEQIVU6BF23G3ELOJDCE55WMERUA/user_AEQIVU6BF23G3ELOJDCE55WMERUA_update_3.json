It's clearly not, and from what I can tell (I only watched 20 minutes it's not that great of a movie.\nNot a Documentary\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Joe Berlinger', 'Bruce Sinofsky'], 'Producers': ['Joe Berlinger', 'Bruce Sinofsky', 'IFC'], 'Starring': ['Delbert Ward', 'Roscoe Ward', 'Connie Chung']}\nI felt this was well done and true. No need to make a story this one tells itself in the footage alone and does a great job. I think it is easy to understand the peoples emotions in this movie and how they feel about the family.\nWell Done\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Richard Press'], 'Producers': ['Philip Gefter'], 'Starring': ['Bill Cunningham', 'Anna Wintour', 'Tom Wolfe'], 'Studio': ['Zeitgeist Films']}\nI love a good documentary about talented interesting people and this is one of them for sure.
