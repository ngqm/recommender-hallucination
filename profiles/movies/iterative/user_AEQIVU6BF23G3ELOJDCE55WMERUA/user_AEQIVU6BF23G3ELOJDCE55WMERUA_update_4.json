Or too much of a good thing? Based on the best-selling book a Short History of Progress, this provocative documentary explores the concept of progress in our modern world, guiding US through a sweeping but detailed survey of the major \"progress traps\" facing our civilization in the arenas of technology, economics, consumption, and the environment. Featuring powerful arguments from such visionaries as Jane Goodall, Margaret Atwood, Stephen Hawking, Craig Venter, Robert Wright, Michael Hudson, and Ronald Wright, this enlightening and visually spectacular film invites US to contemplate the progress traps that destroyed past civilizations and that lie treacherously embedded in our own. Leading critics of Wall Street, cognitive psychologists, and ecologists lay bare the consequences of progress-as-usual as the film travels around the world - from a burgeoning China to the disappearing rainforest\\'s of Brazil to a chimp research lab in New Iberia, Louisiana - to construct a shocking overview of the way our global economic system is eating away at our planet\\'s resources and shackling entire populations with poverty.

It's clearly not, and from what I can tell (I only watched 20 minutes it's not that great of a movie.\nNot a Documentary\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Joe Berlinger', 'Bruce Sinofsky'], 'Producers': ['Joe Berlinger', 'Bruce Sinofsky', 'IFC'], 'Starring': ['Delbert Ward', 'Roscoe Ward', 'Connie Chung']}\nI felt this was well done and true. No need to make a story this one tells itself in the footage alone and does a great job. I think it is easy to understand the peoples emotions in this movie and how they feel about the family.\nWell Done\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Richard Press'], 'Producers': ['Philip Gefter'], 'Starring': ['Bill Cunningham', 'Anna Wintour', 'Tom Wolfe'], 'Studio': ['Zeitgeist Films']}\nI love a good documentary about talented interesting people and this is one of them for sure.
