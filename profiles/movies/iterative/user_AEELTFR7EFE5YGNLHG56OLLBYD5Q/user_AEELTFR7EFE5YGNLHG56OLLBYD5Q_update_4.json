One of which was an IED for years. So this movie really hit home with me. It's hard to watch at times, but it's very well written, directed and played out. This is why I plan on getting a degree in psychology. I've been listening to stories like this my whole life. I guarantee every actor & crew member on this movie has some degree of PTSD.\nReview Title: Interesting\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

When Doug falls into a passionate romance with the bank manager (Rebecca Hall) briefly taken hostage in their last heist, he wants out of this life and out of the town.

Doug had a chance to go legit as a pro hockey player, but he threw it away on drugs and bad behavior. After the armed robbery that opens the film, Jem becomes convinced that bank manager Claire (\", 'Vicki Cristina Barcelona', \"'s Rebecca Hall) saw something, so Doug, who wore a disguise at the time, sets out to make sure she doesn't tell FBI agent Frawley (\", 'Mad Men', \"'s Jon Hamm) anything incriminating (Titus Welliver plays Frawley's partner). Doug starts by asking Claire out, and finds she's more shaken than stirred--and that he likes her better than Jem's oxy-addicted sister, Krista (\", 'Gossip Girl', \"'s Blake Lively), his sometime girlfriend.
