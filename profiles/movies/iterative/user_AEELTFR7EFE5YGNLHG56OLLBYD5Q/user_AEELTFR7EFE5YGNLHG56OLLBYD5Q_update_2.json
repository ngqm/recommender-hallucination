There's a bunch of hilarious irony & smart-aleck comments to make you think this group of detectives have been together for a long time. They make this work. The one piece I found to be quite ironic & funny was in the pilot episode, Jeremy Renner's character made a smart-aleck comment to a lady that &#34;this isn't a Bourne movie,&#34; then a few years later he starred in &#34;The Bourne Legacy.&#34;\nSeries is hilarious\nThe Town\nBen Affleck  (Actor, Director),     Rebecca Hall  (Actor)    Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Studio Specials, Warner Home Video, All Titles\n['Product Description', 'Ben Affleck follows his acclaimed', 'Gone Baby Gone', 'directorial debut by directing, co-writing and starring in a taut thriller about robbers and cops, friendship and betrayal, love and hope and escaping a past that has no future.
