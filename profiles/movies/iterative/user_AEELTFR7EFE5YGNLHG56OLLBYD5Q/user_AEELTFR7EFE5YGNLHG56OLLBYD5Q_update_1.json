There's a bunch of hilarious irony & smart-aleck comments to make you think this group of detectives have been together for a long time. They make this work. The one piece I found to be quite ironic & funny was in the pilot episode, Jeremy Renner's character made a smart-aleck comment to a lady that &#34;this isn't a Bourne movie,&#34; then a few years later he starred in &#34;The Bourne Legacy.&#34;\nReview Title: Series is hilarious\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
