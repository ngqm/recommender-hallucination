He calls it as he sees it and he goes to far lengths and very thorough investigation to the people who are experts on the subject matter and none of those people who only had an opinion on the subject.\n\"Decoded: One Man;s Honest Opinion\"\nFrontline\nDocumentary, Talk Show and Variety, Special Interest\n['Hailed upon its television broadcast debut as \"the last best hope for broadcast documentaries,\" Frontline\\'s stature over more than 28 years is reaffirmed each week through incisive documentaries covering the scope and complexity of the human experience.']\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Michael Kirk', 'Ofra Bikel', 'Marcela Gaviria', 'Rick Young', 'Neil Docherty', 'William Cran', 'Jon Palfreman', 'Martin Smith', 'Thomas Jennings', 'Daniel Edge']}\nI have been a fan of PBS as long as I can even remember. This how tells you an honest look about controversial subject matters that important to you and they also asks the tough questions of the hows and the whys. I have been a follower of this show. UYou should try watching it sometime and you'll be hooked!\n\"I really Love this!\"\nNOVA\nDocumentary, Special Interest\n['Now in its 39th season, NOVA is the most-watched primetime science series on American television, reaching an average of five million viewers weekly.']\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Kirk Wolfinger', 'Sarah Holt', 'Gary Glassman', 'Terri Randall', 'Liesl Clark', 'Daniel McCabe', 'Brian Kaufman', 'Doug Hamilton', \"Miles O'Brien\", 'Michael Barnes']}\nThis is great channel and NOVA would never disappoint you. I have been watching this program through KQED Channel 9 here in the Bay Area and it has never let me down yet program-wise. This channel has a lot of great stories pertaining to real people's lives and I highly recommend this program if you're into documentaries...\n\"A great channel if love documentaries\"\nMountain Men\nUnscripted, Western, Special Interest\n[\"It's a race against winter for men who make their living off the land - hunting, fishing and trapping to put food on the table. For Mountain Men, survival is predicated on using ancient skills perfected over hundreds of years. HISTORY follows the lives of four American men and their families as<NL>they strive for the sustenance they need to make it through the harshest season.\"]\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['David Arabia', 'Mason Gertz', 'Randy Wimberg', 'Andrew Weed', 'Trevor Campbell'], 'Producers': ['Marc Pierce', 'Chris Richardson', 'Bridger Pierce', 'Dawn Fitzgerald', 'Lee Robinson']}\nA series that shows real people learning to survive in the wilderness of Alaska and other remote parts of the world. entertaining and you can learn a few tricks if you're planning to live a life like them in the boonies.\nReal Life survival\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Russell Morash', 'David B. Atwood', 'Russell Fortier', 'David Griffiths'], 'Producers': ['Russell Morash', 'Ruth Lockwood'], 'Starring': ['Julia Child'], 'Studio': ['PBS']}\nJulia Child basically started all of these cooling show series and this series tell you why she's the pioneer of TV cooking. She made cooking on TV cool and when no one else is doing it. Now there's a TON of these shows which is not really entertaining but reality shows existing only for the ratings. ANY idiot with a frying pan on one hand and a spatula on the other can participate on any cooking show and call themselves chef. Any guy cooking tacos in a taco truck is a chef i suppose...\nJulia Child\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Bryan Singer'], 'Producers': ['Gilbert Adler', 'Christopher McQuarrie', 'Bryan Singer', 'Ken Kamins', 'Chris Lee', 'John Ottman', 'Dwight C. Schar', 'Mark Shapiro', 'Daniel M. Snyder'], 'Starring': ['Tom Cruise', 'Kenneth Branagh', 'Bill Nighy'], 'Studio': ['MGM - Film']}\nGreat historical drama. You can only imagine if Lt.Colonel Clause Von Stauffenberg would have succeeded in killing Adolf Hitler if he placed the suit case bomb in the right place where Hitler was sitting in the wolfs lair THEN history could have been made very different and a lot of people could have lived longer and a lot less blood shed. Stauffenberg was a hero on all of this because he knew that Hitler was the beginning and the end of the coming world war when no one else has the sense of learning it and he died trying to prove it to the world. And in the end he was proven correct and if only he succeeded.... (sigh)\nYou need to watch this and learn from History\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Egami'], 'Starring': ['Gabriel Iglesias'], 'Studio': ['Egami']}\nThis dude's funny!
