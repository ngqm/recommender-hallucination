This is the type of movie you might watch and discuss in a film appreciation class. It's overly esoteric. It needs an interpretation (not the language but the &#34;meaning&#34;). For those who are into film studies, I imagine it would be enjoyable. I was disappointed in the lack of clarity, the depressing, muddy depiction of Chile, and most of all Neruda, who used to be one of my favorite poets. I am all for arty, literary movies, but this one left me cold and confused. It's a difficult movie to watch with subtitles because it requires a lot of visual concentration.

Bryson's wit replaced with vulgarity. Completely lacking in the true challenge of the experience. Ending anticlimactic. Insipid. I guess the money was too tempting. Only redeeming feature of this film was the acting.\nDisappointment.\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'frightening scenes', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['Fran\u00e7ais'], 'Subtitles': ['English'], 'Directors': ['Anne Fontaine'], 'Producers': ['Eric Altmayer', 'Nicolas Altmayer'], 'Starring': ['Lou de Laage', 'Agata Buzek', 'Agata Kulesza'], 'Studio': ['Music Box Films']}\nA profound movie about the atrocities of war. Beautifully crafted, visually stunning, bleak and stark, but with moments of utter tenderness, I found it as heartwarming and it was painful. The atrocities themselves were not depicted, and this absence was the work of genius that left room for an examination of the depths and heights humanity can reach. There is hope to be found, and much love, and for some, faith. I'm so glad I found out about this film. I loved it. So very thought provoking.\nProfound movie, refreshing in its simplicity.\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Hope Dickson Leach'], 'Producers': ['Rachel Robey'], 'Starring': ['Ellie Kendrick', 'David Troughton', 'Jack Holden'], 'Studio': ['Monterey Media']}\nA massive festival of human and animal misery and nothing else. Miserable people, miserable circumstances, miserable setting. Thoroughly depressing and unconvincing. Overacted, overwritten. Truly wretched. A study in how people do not behave in reality, no matter how dire the circumstances.\nOne Dimensional.\nA Street Cat Named Bob\nDrama, Kids, Cheerful, Emotional\n['Based on the international bestselling book.

Full of hope and love but not overly sugar coating the grit and dangers of drugs and homelessness, it shows how the companionship of a remarkable animal can sometimes be the one thing that pulls people through really tough times. There were some very compassionate and loving humans involved too. Really glad I watched it. A unique story that made such a change from the doom and gloom of so much of what passes as entertainment. This would appeal to a wide age range I believe, and obviously a broad audience. I'm so happy for the success of all involved.\nUplifting Power of Animals\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['John Stephenson'], 'Producers': ['Steve Christian', 'Alice Dawson', 'Ivan Dunleavy', 'Huw Penallt Jones', 'Hannah Leader', 'Candace Lee', 'Brian Lockhart', 'Christopher Morrow', 'Tom Newman'], 'Starring': ['Hans Matheson', 'Samantha Barks', 'Susan Boyle'], 'Studio': ['Group 1200 Media']}\nJust a sweet Christmas film with a religious theme that's uplifting more than annoying. I allowed myself to be swept into it, and enjoyed every moment of its sentimentality. Very beautiful scenery. British acting well done. Susan Boyle!

I've heard the story of Vincent Van Gogh's life several times before, but this was the first time it really hit me in the heart. This movie is a masterpiece, the art of film at its finest.
