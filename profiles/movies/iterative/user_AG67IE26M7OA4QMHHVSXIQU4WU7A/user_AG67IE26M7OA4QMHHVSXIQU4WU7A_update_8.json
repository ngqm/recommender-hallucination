I probably won't remember it for long, but it was enjoyable. Judi &#34;wonderful as usual&#34; Dench was wonderful as usual. The acting was very good all the way around. If not for that and the scenery it would have been perhaps a three star movie or even less. The reason? Because they used so much contemporary dialogue, including a lot of swearing, which coming from the mouths of the characters was jarring rather than amusing. Did they do it to avoid a PG rating? The opening scene even looks like it might be set today. They didn't quite pull it off, the mixture of contemporary and Victorian. I also didn't much appreciate the role of comics that the Indian characters were given in the beginning. The whole movie was on the shallow side. I would like to read the book to get to the heart of what is actually quite a deep story. However, in spite of all that, it gets four stars from me because I enjoyed it a lot anyway.\nReview Title: Swearing out of place.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Bryson's wit replaced with vulgarity. Completely lacking in the true challenge of the experience. Ending anticlimactic. Insipid. I guess the money was too tempting. Only redeeming feature of this film was the acting.\nDisappointment.\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'frightening scenes', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['Fran\u00e7ais'], 'Subtitles': ['English'], 'Directors': ['Anne Fontaine'], 'Producers': ['Eric Altmayer', 'Nicolas Altmayer'], 'Starring': ['Lou de Laage', 'Agata Buzek', 'Agata Kulesza'], 'Studio': ['Music Box Films']}\nA profound movie about the atrocities of war. Beautifully crafted, visually stunning, bleak and stark, but with moments of utter tenderness, I found it as heartwarming and it was painful. The atrocities themselves were not depicted, and this absence was the work of genius that left room for an examination of the depths and heights humanity can reach. There is hope to be found, and much love, and for some, faith. I'm so glad I found out about this film. I loved it. So very thought provoking.\nProfound movie, refreshing in its simplicity.\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Hope Dickson Leach'], 'Producers': ['Rachel Robey'], 'Starring': ['Ellie Kendrick', 'David Troughton', 'Jack Holden'], 'Studio': ['Monterey Media']}\nA massive festival of human and animal misery and nothing else. Miserable people, miserable circumstances, miserable setting. Thoroughly depressing and unconvincing. Overacted, overwritten. Truly wretched.

Full of hope and love but not overly sugar coating the grit and dangers of drugs and homelessness, it shows how the companionship of a remarkable animal can sometimes be the one thing that pulls people through really tough times. There were some very compassionate and loving humans involved too. Really glad I watched it. A unique story that made such a change from the doom and gloom of so much of what passes as entertainment. This would appeal to a wide age range I believe, and obviously a broad audience. I'm so happy for the success of all involved.\nUplifting Power of Animals\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['John Stephenson'], 'Producers': ['Steve Christian', 'Alice Dawson', 'Ivan Dunleavy', 'Huw Penallt Jones', 'Hannah Leader', 'Candace Lee', 'Brian Lockhart', 'Christopher Morrow', 'Tom Newman'], 'Starring': ['Hans Matheson', 'Samantha Barks', 'Susan Boyle'], 'Studio': ['Group 1200 Media']}\nJust a sweet Christmas film with a religious theme that's uplifting more than annoying. I allowed myself to be swept into it, and enjoyed every moment of its sentimentality. Very beautiful scenery. British acting well done. Susan Boyle!

I've heard the story of Vincent Van Gogh's life several times before, but this was the first time it really hit me in the heart. This movie is a masterpiece, the art of film at its finest. I plan to watch it again. I can count on one hand the number of movies I've said that about, and I've seen a lot!\nNow I think I know...\n{'Audio languages': ['Espa\u00f1ol'], 'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Pablo Larra\u00edn'], 'Producers': ['Juan De Dios Larra\u00edn'], 'Starring': ['Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal', 'Luis Gnecco', 'Mercedes Mor\u00e1n']}\nI watched it in two parts because I was fed up after half way through. This is the type of movie you might watch and discuss in a film appreciation class. It's overly esoteric. It needs an interpretation (not the language but the &#34;meaning&#34;). For those who are into film studies, I imagine it would be enjoyable. I was disappointed in the lack of clarity, the depressing, muddy depiction of Chile, and most of all Neruda, who used to be one of my favorite poets. I am all for arty, literary movies, but this one left me cold and confused. It's a difficult movie to watch with subtitles because it requires a lot of visual concentration. At one point I wondered if the color settings on my tv had been altered by mistake.\nBleak and Confusing\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Stephen Frears'], 'Producers': ['Tim Bevan', 'Eric Fellner', 'Beeban Kidron', 'Tracey Seaward'], 'Starring': ['Judi Dench', 'Ali Fazal', 'Eddie Izzard'], 'Studio': ['Focus Features']}\nThe movie was just what I was in the mood for.
