Beautifully crafted, visually stunning, bleak and stark, but with moments of utter tenderness, I found it as heartwarming and it was painful. The atrocities themselves were not depicted, and this absence was the work of genius that left room for an examination of the depths and heights humanity can reach. There is hope to be found, and much love, and for some, faith. I'm so glad I found out about this film. I loved it. So very thought provoking.\nReview Title: Profound movie, refreshing in its simplicity.\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Bryson's wit replaced with vulgarity. Completely lacking in the true challenge of the experience. Ending anticlimactic. Insipid. I guess the money was too tempting. Only redeeming feature of this film was the acting.\nDisappointment.\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'frightening scenes', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['Fran\u00e7ais'], 'Subtitles': ['English'], 'Directors': ['Anne Fontaine'], 'Producers': ['Eric Altmayer', 'Nicolas Altmayer'], 'Starring': ['Lou de Laage', 'Agata Buzek', 'Agata Kulesza'], 'Studio': ['Music Box Films']}\nA profound movie about the atrocities of war.
