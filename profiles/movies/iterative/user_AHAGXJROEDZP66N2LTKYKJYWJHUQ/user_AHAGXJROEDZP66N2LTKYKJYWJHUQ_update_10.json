Unfortunately for Mr. X, the pills were stolen from a Serbian drug lord who'll cut offhis head if he sells them. And with a London crime czar (Michael Gambon, Open Range & The Insider)promising to retire him permanently if he doesn't, Mr. X may be rightfully concerned about his future. Nothing worth losing his head over.\", 'Amazon.com', 'As its title suggests,', 'Layer Cake', 'is a crime thriller that cuts into several levels of its treacherous criminal underworld. The title is actually one character\\'s definition of the drug-trade hierarchy, but it\\'s also an apt metaphor for the separate layers of deception, death, and betrayal experienced by the film\\'s unnamed protagonist, a cocaine traffic middle-man played with smooth appeal by Daniel Craig (rumored at the time of this film\\'s release to be on the short list for consideration as the next James Bond). Listed in the credits only as \"XXXX,\" the character is trapped into doing a favor for his volatile boss, only to have tables turned by his boss\\'s boss (Michael Gambon) in a twisting plot involving a stolen shipment of Ecstasy, a missing girl, duplicitous dealers, murderous Serbian gangsters, and a variety of lowlifes with their own deadly agendas. As adapted by J.J. Connolly (from his own novel) and directed by Matthew Vaughan (who earned his genre chops as producer of Guy Ritchie\\'s', 'Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels', 'and', 'Snatch', '),', 'Layer Cake', \"improves upon those earlier British gangland hits with assured pacing, intelligent plotting, and an admirable emphasis on plot-moving dialogue over routine action. Sure, it's violent (that's to be expected) and not always involving, but it's smarter than most thrillers, and Vaughan's directorial debut has a confident style that's flashy without being flamboyant. This could be the start of an impressive career.\", '--Jeff Shannon']\n{'Genre': 'Thriller', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Color, Dolby, Dubbed, NTSC, Special Edition, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Ben Davis, Kenneth Cranham, Matthew Ryan, Jason Flemyng, Dragan Micanovic, Don McCorkindale, Francis Magee, Ivan Kaye, Matthew Vaughn, Dexter Fletcher, Louis Emerick, Marcel Iures, Stephen Walters, Dimitri Andreas, Colm Meaney, Steve John Shepherd, Michael Gambon, Darren Healy, Tom Hardy, Ben Whishaw, Benjamin Davis, Daniel Craig, George HarrisBen Davis, Kenneth Cranham, Matthew Ryan, Jason Flemyng, Dragan Micanovic, Don McCorkindale, Francis Magee, Ivan Kaye, Matthew Vaughn, Dexter Fletcher, Louis Emerick, Marcel Iures, Stephen Walters, Dimitri Andreas, Colm Meaney, Steve John Shepherd, Mich\u2026   See more', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1), French (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround), Unqualified', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 45 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '2.40:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.5 x 0.5 inches; 3.2 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'MFR043396108899#VG', 'Director': 'Matthew Vaughn', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Color, Dolby, Dubbed, NTSC, Special Edition, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Run time': '1 hour and 45 minutes', 'Release date': 'August 23, 2005', 'Actors': 'Daniel Craig, Kenneth Cranham, Dexter Fletcher, Michael Gambon, Colm Meaney', 'Dubbed': 'French', 'Subtitles': 'English, French', 'Studio': 'Sony Pictures Home Entertainment', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nDark comedy<br />Lots of action<br />Highly recommend it<br />Daniel Craig always looks hot<br />Lots of twists and turns, must watch\nGreat move\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Anne Fletcher', 'David Feeney', 'John Quaintance'], 'Producers': ['Dana Fox', 'Bruna Papandrea', 'Reese Witherspoon'], 'Starring': ['Richard T.
