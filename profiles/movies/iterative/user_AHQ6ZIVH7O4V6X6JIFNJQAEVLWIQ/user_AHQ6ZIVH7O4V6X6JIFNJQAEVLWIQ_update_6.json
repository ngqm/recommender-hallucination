In the process, both', 'Voyager', \"and the Maquis ship under surveillance are accidentally catapulted out of the galaxy's Alpha Quadrant (the familiar stomping grounds of Starfleet personnel) by a benign but dying being called the Caretaker.\", 'Voyager', 'ends up in the unexplored Delta Quadrant, some 70,000 light years away.', 'So much seemed dramatically promising in this debut, especially the unwieldy alliance of Starfleet regulars and hostile Maquis, and the likelihood that a lifetime spent in isolation, trying to get home, would lead to the development of a self-contained society on the ship, yet', 'Voyager', 'never entirely made up its mind what it was supposed to be about. The curiously cheesy sets and fascinating, progressive management style of Janeway (half mommy, half taskmaster) were also new developments in', 'Star Trek', 'culture. As the 16-episode season continued, character backstories were developed in such episodes as \"The Cloud\" (arguably the best episode of the season), \"Eye of the Needle\" (underscoring Janeway and the crew\\'s sadness), \"State of Flux\" (in which a search for a traitor reveals a past romance between Commander Chakotay, played by Robert Beltran, and sexy Bajoran engineer Seska, played by Martha Hackett), and \"Jetrel\" (which explores the character of Neelix, the Talaxian played by Ethan Phillips, during a parable about scientific ethics and moral responsibility).', 'Among other notable episodes, \"Phage\" strikes a nice balance among character development, story hook, and moral and emotional conflict when Neelix is literally robbed of his lungs by the Vidiians, a once-civilized people who are combating a deadly disease called the Phage by stealing organs. (The disease would return in \"Faces,\" a fine showcase for Roxann Biggs-Dawson as Chief Engineer B\\'Elanna Torres.) \"Emanations\" stirred controversy among the series\\' producers and some fans for its philosophical look at death, and \"Time and Again\" is a unique time-travel story in which Janeway and Tom Paris (Robert Duncan McNeill) get caught in a subspace fracture that places them just hours before they know a planet is going to be destroyed. In \"Prime Factors,\" latent tensions among', 'Voyager', 'personnel erupts into serious conflict, an issue revisited in the season finale, \"Learning Curve.\" Despite a pat ending that resolves the Maquis conflict much too easily, the episode drives home the fact that', 'Voyager', 'and its crew are all alone, making the most of a difficult predicament.', '--Tom Keogh and Jeff Shannon', 'Set Contains:', \"There's a rare treat in the first-season set of\", 'Star Trek: Voyager', \": scenes from the pilot episode featuring the original captain Janeway, played by Genevieve Bujold. She was quickly replaced, and with the benefit of hindsight, it's easy to see that she lacked sufficient presence for the role. That segment is part of the set's 78 minutes of bonus features, including a spotlight on the eventual captain Janeway, Kate Mulgrew (mostly comprised of 1994 and 2003 interviews); a season overview; reflections by the cast; and spotlights on visual effects, location, Startrek.com, and the science behind the show (wormholes, time travel).

What I don't understand though is why the same set, but region 2 dvd, is the equivalent of $60 from the UK version of Amazon.. (amazon.co.uk). You use the same log in and password as on Amazon and it can be shipped internationally.  So if anyone has a multi-regional DVD player get it from there, even with shipping it's got to be cheaper. The series itself is 5 star but the price sucks.<br /><br />Update 5-28-08: Finally this comes down to a much more reasonable price :) Love it!\nReview Title: I wish\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

The \"Sgt. Candy Scene\" is a must-see and, unfortunately, the best thing on the second disc. The rushed HBO documentary shows us far more flash than substance. Better is the Visual Effects Lab that goes more in-depth with four sequences, although you need to wade through a hokey interface for each segment. Making your \"own\" effects isn\\'t that much fun; you can only choose a few effects that change in two scenes. Anyone looking to get the complicated backstory of the trilogy figured out should dig into the \"Sky Net Database\" and an intricate timeline. The two commentary tracks are worth a listen, with director Jonathan Mostow\\'s solo track the better one. The director goes into great detail on how the little things (from lighting street scenes to tricks for destroying buildings) count. The second track is pieced together from the actors recorded separately. Mostow appears with actress Claire Danes (doing her first commentary track) and their chemistry is enjoyable after a slow start.

The problem is the plot seems to be to take T2 make the bad terminator a she instead of a he. Throw in a few good special effects, and some very very bad jokes, which should of  been cut on final editing and call yourself T3. It never seems to reach the drama of T2, the jokes are old and the plot recycled. I gave it 4 stars because of the special effects and that I love the other movies in the series.\nGood effects, same plot\nPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)\nJohnny Depp  (Actor),     Geoffrey Rush  (Actor),     Gore Verbinski  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment, Live Action, All Titles\n['Product Description', \"From producer Jerry Bruckheimer (PEARL HARBOR) comes PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL, the thrilling high-seas adventure with a mysterious twist.

When I got this DVD I feared the worst but I was wrong. I loved the movie, though it is NOT one for the kids despite being made by Disney. To the people that complain about the violence, by their very nature pirates were far from nice people. The only problem I had was the accents seem to get strangely Australian rather than English by the end. There is also one point where Depp slide down a rope, a little difficult to do when your hands are chained together, he clearly throws the chain over the rope. Aside from that I loved it but then I prefer the darker movies. Buy it but do not buy it for kids! It's the same people complaining that thought taking the kids to see Jurassic Park a good idea...

The computer generated dog fight scenes are great and keep you on the edge of your seat. It has its funny and sad moments but not too many dull moments. So if you're looking for a couple of hours of entertainment give it a try, if you're looking for a sickly love interest go and watch Titanic for the 50th time..\nAlmost great\nStar Trek Voyager - The Complete First Season\nKate Mulgrew  (Actor),     Robert Beltran  (Actor),     Winrich Kolbe  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Science Fiction\n['Product Description', 'The complete first season of the TV series Star Trek Voyager.', 'Amazon.com', 'Star Trek: Voyager', 'began life in 1995 with some truly fascinating prospects in its two-hour pilot episode.

In the process, both', 'Voyager', \"and the Maquis ship under surveillance are accidentally catapulted out of the galaxy's Alpha Quadrant (the familiar stomping grounds of Starfleet personnel) by a benign but dying being called the Caretaker.\", 'Voyager', 'ends up in the unexplored Delta Quadrant, some 70,000 light years away.', 'So much seemed dramatically promising in this debut, especially the unwieldy alliance of Starfleet regulars and hostile Maquis, and the likelihood that a lifetime spent in isolation, trying to get home, would lead to the development of a self-contained society on the ship, yet', 'Voyager', 'never entirely made up its mind what it was supposed to be about. The curiously cheesy sets and fascinating, progressive management style of Janeway (half mommy, half taskmaster) were also new developments in', 'Star Trek', 'culture. As the 16-episode season continued, character backstories were developed in such episodes as \"The Cloud\" (arguably the best episode of the season), \"Eye of the Needle\" (underscoring Janeway and the crew\\'s sadness), \"State of Flux\" (in which a search for a traitor reveals a past romance between Commander Chakotay, played by Robert Beltran, and sexy Bajoran engineer Seska, played by Martha Hackett), and \"Jetrel\" (which explores the character of Neelix, the Talaxian played by Ethan Phillips, during a parable about scientific ethics and moral responsibility).', 'Among other notable episodes, \"Phage\" strikes a nice balance among character development, story hook, and moral and emotional conflict when Neelix is literally robbed of his lungs by the Vidiians, a once-civilized people who are combating a deadly disease called the Phage by stealing organs. (The disease would return in \"Faces,\" a fine showcase for Roxann Biggs-Dawson as Chief Engineer B\\'Elanna Torres.) \"Emanations\" stirred controversy among the series\\' producers and some fans for its philosophical look at death, and \"Time and Again\" is a unique time-travel story in which Janeway and Tom Paris (Robert Duncan McNeill) get caught in a subspace fracture that places them just hours before they know a planet is going to be destroyed. In \"Prime Factors,\" latent tensions among', 'Voyager', 'personnel erupts into serious conflict, an issue revisited in the season finale, \"Learning Curve.\" Despite a pat ending that resolves the Maquis conflict much too easily, the episode drives home the fact that', 'Voyager', 'and its crew are all alone, making the most of a difficult predicament.', '--Tom Keogh and Jeff Shannon', 'Set Contains:', \"There's a rare treat in the first-season set of\", 'Star Trek: Voyager', \": scenes from the pilot episode featuring the original captain Janeway, played by Genevieve Bujold. She was quickly replaced, and with the benefit of hindsight, it's easy to see that she lacked sufficient presence for the role.

What I don't understand though is why the same set, but region 2 dvd, is the equivalent of $60 from the UK version of Amazon.. (amazon.co.uk). You use the same log in and password as on Amazon and it can be shipped internationally.  So if anyone has a multi-regional DVD player get it from there, even with shipping it's got to be cheaper. The series itself is 5 star but the price sucks.<br /><br />Update 5-28-08: Finally this comes down to a much more reasonable price :) Love it!\nI wish",
