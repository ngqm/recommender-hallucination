The premise for the movie was great, the special effects were great but the storyline was OK. It just didn't gel too well for the most part. A great movie needs a storyline no matter how great the special effects are. I just couldn't seem to relate to the characters or their feelings. It's worth watching for the effects, as long as you don't mind the storyline being weak.\nReview Title: Could of been better\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

The \"Sgt. Candy Scene\" is a must-see and, unfortunately, the best thing on the second disc. The rushed HBO documentary shows us far more flash than substance. Better is the Visual Effects Lab that goes more in-depth with four sequences, although you need to wade through a hokey interface for each segment. Making your \"own\" effects isn\\'t that much fun; you can only choose a few effects that change in two scenes. Anyone looking to get the complicated backstory of the trilogy figured out should dig into the \"Sky Net Database\" and an intricate timeline. The two commentary tracks are worth a listen, with director Jonathan Mostow\\'s solo track the better one. The director goes into great detail on how the little things (from lighting street scenes to tricks for destroying buildings) count. The second track is pieced together from the actors recorded separately. Mostow appears with actress Claire Danes (doing her first commentary track) and their chemistry is enjoyable after a slow start. The other actors have less interesting things to say, including Schwarzenegger who is constantly--yet enthusiastically--selling the film.', '--Doug Thomas']\n{'Genre': 'Action & Adventure', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Color, Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Dolby, Subtitled, Widescreen, NTSC, DubbedMultiple Formats, AC-3, Color, Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Dolby, Subtitled, Widescreen, NTSC, Dubbed  See more', 'Contributor': 'Mark Famiglietti, Claire Danes, Michael Ferris, Nick Stahl, Carolyn Hennesy, John D.

The problem is the plot seems to be to take T2 make the bad terminator a she instead of a he. Throw in a few good special effects, and some very very bad jokes, which should of  been cut on final editing and call yourself T3. It never seems to reach the drama of T2, the jokes are old and the plot recycled. I gave it 4 stars because of the special effects and that I love the other movies in the series.\nGood effects, same plot\nPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)\nJohnny Depp  (Actor),     Geoffrey Rush  (Actor),     Gore Verbinski  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment, Live Action, All Titles\n['Product Description', \"From producer Jerry Bruckheimer (PEARL HARBOR) comes PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL, the thrilling high-seas adventure with a mysterious twist. The roguish yet charming Captain Jack Sparrow's (Academy Award(R) Nominee Johnny Depp) idyllic pirate life capsizes after his nemesis, the wily Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), steals his ship, the Black Pearl, and later attacks the town of Port Royal, kidnapping the governor's beautiful daughter Elizabeth (Keira Knightley). In a gallant attempt to rescue her and recapture the Black Pearl, Elizabeth's childhood friend Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) joins forces with Jack. What Will doesn't know is that a cursed treasure has doomed Barbossa and his crew to live forever as the undead. Rich in suspense-filled adventure, sword-clashing action, mystery, humor, unforgettable characters, and never-before-seen special effects, PIRATES is a must-have epic on the grandest scale ever.\", 'Set Contains:', 'Like any DVD blockbuster from producer Jerry Bruckheimer, the extras are plentiful and often a bit too self-congratulatory (worst offender here is the primary commentary track). The slickly (natch) produced making-of documentary goes through the standard routine; however, the less-flashy \"fly on the wall\" bits--just showing what happens on set without comment--is more fun, offering effortless insight on the filmmaking process. The best treasure is a nifty interactive history on pirates with plenty of background material. You can simply play the filmed segments or take a tour around a ship to discover the material (and a few surprises). There\\'s a lot of archival material on the theme-park ride that inspired the film and several odds and ends including an enjoyable chronicle of the vintage ship\\'s voyage from its home harbor to the movie set. The kids should really dig the DVD-ROM \"Moonlight Becomes Ye,\" in which they can turn their own mug into a ghostly pirate. There\\'s also a bounty of extended and deleted scenes (19 in all) and a very funny blooper reel.

When I got this DVD I feared the worst but I was wrong. I loved the movie, though it is NOT one for the kids despite being made by Disney. To the people that complain about the violence, by their very nature pirates were far from nice people. The only problem I had was the accents seem to get strangely Australian rather than English by the end. There is also one point where Depp slide down a rope, a little difficult to do when your hands are chained together, he clearly throws the chain over the rope. Aside from that I loved it but then I prefer the darker movies. Buy it but do not buy it for kids! It's the same people complaining that thought taking the kids to see Jurassic Park a good idea...

It start off well enough but descended into absurdity soon after the entrance on Mr Hyde. After awhile you forget what the plot was originally meant to be. The special effects are good in places, not so in others.A good movie needs more than special effects, it needs a story and characters you can relate to. I am sure any sequel will be stright to video/DVD as I am sure Connery won't be in it, though his character probably will.
