Now 25, Connor lives \"off the grid\" - no home, no credit cards, no cell phone and no job. No record of his existence. No way he can be traced by Skynet - the highly developed network of machines that once tried to kill him and wage war on humanity. Until?out of the shadows of the future steps the T-X (KRISTANNA LOKEN), Skynet\\'s most sophisticated cyborg killing machine yet. Sent back through time to complete the job left unfinished by her predecessor, the T-1000, this machine is as relentless as her human guise is beautiful. Now Connor\\'s only hope for survival is the Terminator (ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER), his mysterious former assassin. Together, they must triumph over the technologically superior T-X and forestall the looming threat of Judgment Day?or face the apocalypse and the fall of civilization as we know it.', 'Set Contains:', 'There\\'s only one deleted scene in this two-disc DVD set, but it\\'s a doozy. The \"Sgt. Candy Scene\" is a must-see and, unfortunately, the best thing on the second disc. The rushed HBO documentary shows us far more flash than substance. Better is the Visual Effects Lab that goes more in-depth with four sequences, although you need to wade through a hokey interface for each segment. Making your \"own\" effects isn\\'t that much fun; you can only choose a few effects that change in two scenes. Anyone looking to get the complicated backstory of the trilogy figured out should dig into the \"Sky Net Database\" and an intricate timeline. The two commentary tracks are worth a listen, with director Jonathan Mostow\\'s solo track the better one. The director goes into great detail on how the little things (from lighting street scenes to tricks for destroying buildings) count. The second track is pieced together from the actors recorded separately. Mostow appears with actress Claire Danes (doing her first commentary track) and their chemistry is enjoyable after a slow start. The other actors have less interesting things to say, including Schwarzenegger who is constantly--yet enthusiastically--selling the film.', '--Doug Thomas']\nAverage Rating: 4.6\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Action & Adventure', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Color, Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Dolby, Subtitled, Widescreen, NTSC, DubbedMultiple Formats, AC-3, Color, Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Dolby, Subtitled, Widescreen, NTSC, Dubbed  See more', 'Contributor': 'Mark Famiglietti, Claire Danes, Michael Ferris, Nick Stahl, Carolyn Hennesy, John D.

The problem is the plot seems to be to take T2 make the bad terminator a she instead of a he. Throw in a few good special effects, and some very very bad jokes, which should of  been cut on final editing and call yourself T3. It never seems to reach the drama of T2, the jokes are old and the plot recycled. I gave it 4 stars because of the special effects and that I love the other movies in the series.\nReview Title: Good effects, same plot\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
