The show's second season ended with the brutal and shocking death of Caitlin Todd (Sasha Alexander). The first two episodes of this season deal with the aftermath of bringing her killer to justice and examining the emotional impact of her loss on the remaining members of the NCIS team, which is led by Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon). The six-disc set includes all 24 episodes, which aired on CBS during 2005-2006. Returning are happy-go-lucky ladies' man Tony DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly,\", 'Dark Angel', '), forensics expert and resident Goth chick Abby Sciuto (Pauley Perrette), medical examiner Dr. Donald \"Ducky\" Mallard (David McCallum,', 'The Man from U.N.C.L.E', '), and agent Timothy McGee (Sean Murray). Former Mossad intelligence officer Ziva David (Cote de Pablo) joins the close-knit cast, as does Jennifer Shepard (Lauren Holly,', 'Dumb & Dumber', ') as the new NCIS director. Working on a daily basis with Shepard initially makes Gibbs wary. Not only is she a former girlfriend, but she also was his underling at one time. Equal parts', 'CSI', 'and', 'JAG', ',', 'NCIS', \"works primarily because of its quirky cast, which is able to take sometimes regurgitated ideas and rework them into something engagingly watchable. Throughout this season, we will see agents endangered and framed, and one will accidentally kill an undercover detective who may not have been armed. But the explosive two-part season finale will finally shed light on Gibbs' painful history and help explain why he is who is he today.\", '--Jae-Ha Kim']\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.95 x 6.21 x 7.07 inches; 1 Pounds', 'Item model number': '64260845840', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Run time': '17 hours and 37 minutes', 'Release date': 'April 24, 2007', 'Actors': 'Mark Harmon, Michael Weatherly, Pauley Perrette, David McCallum', 'Dubbed': 'Spanish', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish, Portuguese', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1), English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround), Unqualified (DTS ES 6.1), Spanish (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo)', 'Studio': 'Paramount', 'Number of discs': '6'}\nlove it\nFive Stars\nNCIS: Season 2\nMark Harmon  (Actor),     Michael Weatherly  (Actor)    Rated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Paramount Home Entertainment, Action & Adventure\n['Product Description', '1007 minutes', 'Amazon.com', 'NCIS', 'takes the', 'CSI', 'formula, throws in a good dose of', 'JAG', ', and comes up with an entertaining series that takes advantage of the actors\\' likeability.
