Star Mark Harmon, Lauren Holly, Michael Weatherly, Pauley Parrette Special Features: Full Frame Format.\", 'Amazon.com', 'With two solid seasons already banked,', 'NCIS', \"returns for a compelling third year with exciting plotlines and a slightly tweaked cast. The show's second season ended with the brutal and shocking death of Caitlin Todd (Sasha Alexander). The first two episodes of this season deal with the aftermath of bringing her killer to justice and examining the emotional impact of her loss on the remaining members of the NCIS team, which is led by Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon). The six-disc set includes all 24 episodes, which aired on CBS during 2005-2006. Returning are happy-go-lucky ladies' man Tony DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly,\", 'Dark Angel', '), forensics expert and resident Goth chick Abby Sciuto (Pauley Perrette), medical examiner Dr. Donald \"Ducky\" Mallard (David McCallum,', 'The Man from U.N.C.L.E', '), and agent Timothy McGee (Sean Murray). Former Mossad intelligence officer Ziva David (Cote de Pablo) joins the close-knit cast, as does Jennifer Shepard (Lauren Holly,', 'Dumb & Dumber', ') as the new NCIS director. Working on a daily basis with Shepard initially makes Gibbs wary. Not only is she a former girlfriend, but she also was his underling at one time. Equal parts', 'CSI', 'and', 'JAG', ',', 'NCIS', \"works primarily because of its quirky cast, which is able to take sometimes regurgitated ideas and rework them into something engagingly watchable. Throughout this season, we will see agents endangered and framed, and one will accidentally kill an undercover detective who may not have been armed. But the explosive two-part season finale will finally shed light on Gibbs' painful history and help explain why he is who is he today.\", '--Jae-Ha Kim']\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.95 x 6.21 x 7.07 inches; 1 Pounds', 'Item model number': '64260845840', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Run time': '17 hours and 37 minutes', 'Release date': 'April 24, 2007', 'Actors': 'Mark Harmon, Michael Weatherly, Pauley Perrette, David McCallum', 'Dubbed': 'Spanish', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish, Portuguese', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1), English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround), Unqualified (DTS ES 6.1), Spanish (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo)', 'Studio': 'Paramount', 'Number of discs': '6'}\nlove it\nFive Stars\nNCIS: Season 2\nMark Harmon  (Actor),     Michael Weatherly  (Actor)    Rated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Paramount Home Entertainment, Action & Adventure\n['Product Description', '1007 minutes', 'Amazon.com', 'NCIS', 'takes the', 'CSI', 'formula, throws in a good dose of', 'JAG', ', and comes up with an entertaining series that takes advantage of the actors\\' likeability. The season begins with the introduction a couple new regulars--agent Timothy McGee (Sean Murray) and assistant medical examiner Jimmy Palmer (Brian Dietzen). And one cast member departs the show by the end of the season. The six-disc set includes all 23 episodes, which aired on CBS during 2004-2005. The show\\'s sophomore year begins with \"See No Evil,\" in which a Navy officer (guest star David Keith) is forced to embezzle millions of dollars, or risk having his wife and blind daughter killed by a kidnapper (played by Tom Cruise\\'s cousin William Mapother). Led by Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon), the crack NCIS team comes through to save the day and reveal the mastermind behind the twisted case. Gibbs doesn\\'t display much more emotion this season than he did in the show\\'s debut, but he\\'s just as sarcastic (and even tempered) when being threatened. During one altercation, the mafia threatens to kill his father, brothers and uncles. Non-plussed, Gibbs calmly says that while he has no male relatives still alive, he\\'d be happy to fax over the numbers of his three ex-wives.', 'With the help of his ace medical examiner Dr. Donald \"Ducky\" Mallard (David McCallum from', 'The Man from U.N.C.L.E', '), Gibbs and his team are almost invincible when it comes to solving complicated crimes. Whether he\\'s piecing together the bones of a body, or performing an autopsy on a crisply burnt poodle, Ducky is matter-of-fact as he talks to his dead \"clients.\" Of his nervous but eager assistant Jimmy, Ducky notes, \"He means well, but sometimes I have an overwhelming urge to slap him.\" This season, viewers get to see the romantic (and slightly gross) side of Ducky as he briefly romances a doctor half this age. Also on hand to aid (and annoy) Gibbs are happy-go-lucky Tony DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly), former Secret Service agent Caitlin Todd (Sasha Alexander), and forensics expert Abby Sciuto (Pauley Perrette), who can solve anything if you say \"please\" and bring her a Big Gulp to sip. Look for a gentle guest appearance by Charles Durning as a Medal of Honor recipient who wants to turn himself in for killing his best friend and fellow comrade during World War II. While the plot twists won\\'t surprise most viewers, the acting, writing, and spirit of the episode leaves the viewer feeling satisfied.', '--Jae-Ha Kim']\n{'Aspect Ratio': '1.78:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'Unrated (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.94 x 5.49 x 7.67 inches; 8.8 Ounces', 'Item model number': '442809829', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Box set, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Release date': 'November 14, 2006', 'Actors': 'Mark Harmon, Michael Weatherly, Pauley Perrette, David McCallum', 'Subtitles': 'English', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround), Spanish (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround), Unqualified (DTS ES 6.1)', 'Studio': 'Paramount', 'Number of discs': '6'}\nlove it\nFive Stars\nNCIS: Season 9\nMichael Weatherly  (Actor),     Sean Murray  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Paramount Home Entertainment, Action & Adventure\n['NCIS (Naval Criminal Investigative Service)', \"is more than just an action drama.
