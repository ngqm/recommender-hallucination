  "reference_summary": "Evan Almighty\nComedy, Fantasy, Fun\n[\"When God instructs him to build an ark, Evan's life goes from overnight success to almighty mess!\"]\n{'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Tom Shadyac'], 'Producers': ['Tom Shadyac', 'Gary Barber', 'Roger Birnbaum', 'Neal H. Moritz', 'Michael Bostick'], 'Starring': ['Steve Carell', 'Morgan Freeman', 'Lauren Graham']}\nAt first my kids didn't want to see this.  This wasn't their kind of movies.  I didn't have high expectations either.  However, the main actor who played Evan was the star of the show. He did an excellent job of potraying a nutty and off the wall character.\nFirst time I've geniunely laughed in a long time.\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Mark Marchillo'], 'Producers': ['Micah E. Brandt'], 'Starring': ['Richard Riehle', 'Chris Kattan', 'Lee Meriwether'], 'Studio': ['Vision Films']}\nHave you ever watched a movie and wished you hadn't?  I regret watching this with my children.  I thought this would be an inspirational movie revolving around dance and although I like the minimal dance performances by \"Bloom\", the rest of the movie was full of morally messed up characters.\nYoung teens kissing/ Adults doing nothing to stop bullying/Immoral ending\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Thomas Borch Nielse'], 'Producers': ['Nina Crone'], 'Starring': ['Jane Lynch'], 'Studio': ['Phase 4 Films (USA)', 'LLC']}\n\"It's fun, funky, and amazing\", said my child.
