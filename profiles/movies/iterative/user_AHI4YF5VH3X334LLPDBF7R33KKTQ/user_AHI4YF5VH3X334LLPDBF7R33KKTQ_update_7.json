  "reference_summary": "Evan Almighty\nComedy, Fantasy, Fun\n[\"When God instructs him to build an ark, Evan's life goes from overnight success to almighty mess!\"]\n{'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Tom Shadyac'], 'Producers': ['Tom Shadyac', 'Gary Barber', 'Roger Birnbaum', 'Neal H. Moritz', 'Michael Bostick'], 'Starring': ['Steve Carell', 'Morgan Freeman', 'Lauren Graham']}\nAt first my kids didn't want to see this.  This wasn't their kind of movies.  I didn't have high expectations either.  However, the main actor who played Evan was the star of the show. He did an excellent job of potraying a nutty and off the wall character.\nFirst time I've geniunely laughed in a long time.\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Mark Marchillo'], 'Producers': ['Micah E. Brandt'], 'Starring': ['Richard Riehle', 'Chris Kattan', 'Lee Meriwether'], 'Studio': ['Vision Films']}\nHave you ever watched a movie and wished you hadn't?  I regret watching this with my children.  I thought this would be an inspirational movie revolving around dance and although I like the minimal dance performances by \"Bloom\", the rest of the movie was full of morally messed up characters.\nYoung teens kissing/ Adults doing nothing to stop bullying/Immoral ending\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Thomas Borch Nielse'], 'Producers': ['Nina Crone'], 'Starring': ['Jane Lynch'], 'Studio': ['Phase 4 Films (USA)', 'LLC']}\n\"It's fun, funky, and amazing\", said my child.  Actually, even the teens watched it and they usually stay away from \"kiddies shows\".  I found it surprisingly entertaining too and I couldn't help but boogie along with the music.\nMy kids love it.\n{'Audio languages': ['\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Tzipi Baider']}\nThe love and devotion that this family have for each other gives me hope that there is still good in this world.  The birth of the baby girl and the joy that she gave everyone brought me to tears.  I wish this family much happiness.\nA beautiful story\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Nina May'], 'Producers': ['Nina May'], 'Starring': ['Joshua Blake', 'Scott Clark', 'Kristine Cornils'], 'Studio': ['Willette Acquisition Corp.', 'DBA Allied Vaughn']}\nWe enjoyed listening to a bit of mountain/bluegrass music played in the background.  This show has a positive message about faith and humility which our whole family needed a reminder of.  We finished this movie happier than when we started.  Now that's a mark of a good movie.\nInspirational & great to watch with the kids.\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Billie Woodruff'], 'Producers': ['David Hoberman', 'George Tillman Jr.', 'Louise Rosner', 'Otis Best', 'Queen Latifah', 'Robert Teitel', 'Shakim Compere'], 'Starring': ['Queen Latifah', 'Alicia Silverstone', 'Andie MacDowell']}\nWhat was so humorous about this movie?  The numerous talks about having sex with a hot guy, bikini waxing, climaxing and other sexual innuendos?  The dissing of the white hairdresser because she wants to \"act black\"?  Queen Latifah was the only good thing about this movie.  It's rated PG-13 but it's not appropriate for my family.\nNot that funny\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940'], 'Subtitles': ['English (UK)', 'English (UK) [CC]', 'English (US)', '\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629', 'Dansk', 'Suomi', 'Filipino', '\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea', '\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940 [CC]', 'Indonesia', '\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4', 'Bahasa Melayu', 'Norsk Bokm\u00e5l', 'Nederlands', '\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439', 'Svenska', '\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bcd', '\u0c24\u0c46\u0c32\u0c41\u0c17\u0c41', '\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22', 'T\u00fcrk\u00e7e', '\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7b80\u4f53\uff09', '\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7e41\u9ad4\uff09'], 'Directors': ['Zoya Akhtar'], 'Producers': ['Farhan Akhtar', 'Zoya Akhtar', 'Ritesh Sidhwani'], 'Starring': ['Ranveer Singh', 'Alia Bhatt', 'Kalki Koechlin']}\nI'm an old lady who isn't familiar with Indian culture or rap music.
