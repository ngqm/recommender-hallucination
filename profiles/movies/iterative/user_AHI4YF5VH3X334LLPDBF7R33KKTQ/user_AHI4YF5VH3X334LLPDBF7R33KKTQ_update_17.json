  "reference_summary": "Evan Almighty\nComedy, Fantasy, Fun\n[\"When God instructs him to build an ark, Evan's life goes from overnight success to almighty mess!\"]\n{'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Tom Shadyac'], 'Producers': ['Tom Shadyac', 'Gary Barber', 'Roger Birnbaum', 'Neal H. Moritz', 'Michael Bostick'], 'Starring': ['Steve Carell', 'Morgan Freeman', 'Lauren Graham']}\nAt first my kids didn't want to see this.  This wasn't their kind of movies.  I didn't have high expectations either.  However, the main actor who played Evan was the star of the show. He did an excellent job of potraying a nutty and off the wall character.\nFirst time I've geniunely laughed in a long time.\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Mark Marchillo'], 'Producers': ['Micah E. Brandt'], 'Starring': ['Richard Riehle', 'Chris Kattan', 'Lee Meriwether'], 'Studio': ['Vision Films']}\nHave you ever watched a movie and wished you hadn't?  I regret watching this with my children.  I thought this would be an inspirational movie revolving around dance and although I like the minimal dance performances by \"Bloom\", the rest of the movie was full of morally messed up characters.\nYoung teens kissing/ Adults doing nothing to stop bullying/Immoral ending\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Thomas Borch Nielse'], 'Producers': ['Nina Crone'], 'Starring': ['Jane Lynch'], 'Studio': ['Phase 4 Films (USA)', 'LLC']}\n\"It's fun, funky, and amazing\", said my child.  Actually, even the teens watched it and they usually stay away from \"kiddies shows\".  I found it surprisingly entertaining too and I couldn't help but boogie along with the music.\nMy kids love it.\n{'Audio languages': ['\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Tzipi Baider']}\nThe love and devotion that this family have for each other gives me hope that there is still good in this world.  The birth of the baby girl and the joy that she gave everyone brought me to tears.  I wish this family much happiness.\nA beautiful story\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Nina May'], 'Producers': ['Nina May'], 'Starring': ['Joshua Blake', 'Scott Clark', 'Kristine Cornils'], 'Studio': ['Willette Acquisition Corp.', 'DBA Allied Vaughn']}\nWe enjoyed listening to a bit of mountain/bluegrass music played in the background.  This show has a positive message about faith and humility which our whole family needed a reminder of.  We finished this movie happier than when we started.  Now that's a mark of a good movie.\nInspirational & great to watch with the kids.\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Billie Woodruff'], 'Producers': ['David Hoberman', 'George Tillman Jr.', 'Louise Rosner', 'Otis Best', 'Queen Latifah', 'Robert Teitel', 'Shakim Compere'], 'Starring': ['Queen Latifah', 'Alicia Silverstone', 'Andie MacDowell']}\nWhat was so humorous about this movie?  The numerous talks about having sex with a hot guy, bikini waxing, climaxing and other sexual innuendos?  The dissing of the white hairdresser because she wants to \"act black\"?  Queen Latifah was the only good thing about this movie.  It's rated PG-13 but it's not appropriate for my family.\nNot that funny\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940'], 'Subtitles': ['English (UK)', 'English (UK) [CC]', 'English (US)', '\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629', 'Dansk', 'Suomi', 'Filipino', '\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea', '\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940 [CC]', 'Indonesia', '\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4', 'Bahasa Melayu', 'Norsk Bokm\u00e5l', 'Nederlands', '\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439', 'Svenska', '\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bcd', '\u0c24\u0c46\u0c32\u0c41\u0c17\u0c41', '\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22', 'T\u00fcrk\u00e7e', '\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7b80\u4f53\uff09', '\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7e41\u9ad4\uff09'], 'Directors': ['Zoya Akhtar'], 'Producers': ['Farhan Akhtar', 'Zoya Akhtar', 'Ritesh Sidhwani'], 'Starring': ['Ranveer Singh', 'Alia Bhatt', 'Kalki Koechlin']}\nI'm an old lady who isn't familiar with Indian culture or rap music.  However, I'm so impressed by the artistry of Gully Boy's music and his story of proclaiming self-worth and self-identity despite of one's origin.  I finished this movie feeling elated and hopeful about my life.\nI didn't expect to like this!\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Robert Fernandez'], 'Producers': ['Chris Jung'], 'Starring': ['Nick Alexander', 'Scott West', 'Jeff Kribs'], 'Studio': ['Vision Video']}\nThis is just what I needed this Easter.  My soul needed this to remember who I am in Christ and that He is my purpose in life.\nThank-you Lord, for this movie.\n{'Content advisory': ['Foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Jeff Bleckner'], 'Producers': ['Larry Y. Albucher', 'Michael Besman', 'Cameron Johann', 'Ricki Lake', 'Brent Shields'], 'Starring': ['Lauren Ambrose', 'Adam Kaufman', 'Susie Essman'], 'Studio': ['Hallmark Hall of Fame']}\nI love the the conservative values of the families. I like romances that are built on friendship and trust rather than on a quick sexual relationship.\nA beautiful love story\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['John Gray'], 'Producers': ['Christopher Morgan'], 'Starring': ['Julia Stiles', 'David Walton', 'Georgia Lyman'], 'Studio': ['Hallmark Hall of Fame']}\nMy favorite part was Mr. Doolittle's \"beauty\" makeover.\nOkay. Kinda boring but I do like transformation stories.\n{'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Nimisha Mukerji'], 'Producers': ['Anthony Fankhauser', 'Jeff Holland', 'Melinda Wells McCabe', 'Stan Spry', 'Eric Scott Woods'], 'Starring': ['Kat Graham', 'Kendrick Sampson'], 'Studio': ['Crown Media United States']}\nIt's a cloudy and dreary day but this light hearted romance with two good looking main characters just made my day brighter.\nA feel good movie!\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Tony Tilse'], 'Producers': ['Every Cloud Productions'], 'Starring': ['Essie Davis', 'Rupert Penry-Jones', 'Ashleigh Cummings']}\nYes! Finally, a declaration of love. I enjoyed  Phryne's new adventure with the same casts as the TV series - which I own all three!\nLove it.\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Kevin Connor'], 'Producers': ['H. Daniel Gross', 'Erik Heiberg', 'Lincoln Lageson', 'Larry Levinson', 'Randy Pope'], 'Starring': ['Jennifer Esposito', 'David Sutcliffe', 'Mark Deklin'], 'Studio': ['Larry Levinson Productions']}\nI like romantic stories about how someone who might not seem compatible with you at first but later discovers he/she is actually the best person for you.  The actors played their parts very well.\nFun\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Eric Nemoto'], 'Producers': ['Eric Nemoto', 'Dann Seki', 'Larry Cortez', 'Mark Bush'], 'Starring': ['Dann Seki', 'Kristen Nemoto Jay', 'Jim Aina'], 'Studio': ['Yellow Brick Studio']}\nI've never seen a movie like this - with virtually no actions or scenes - but is actually more captivating than many of the movies I've seen in the past 50+ years. I've seen so many movies/tv shows that I get bored easily, so it says a lot that I didn't change this \"channel\". The main actor is superb.  I'm not sure how many others could have pulled off this movie like he did. His facial expressions and his intonation spoke volumes. And kudos to all the voices behind the phone calls. We never see their faces but I could picture them in my head.\nUnique and surprisingly entertaining.\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'Espa\u00f1ol'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Jeff Beesely'], 'Producers': ['Bruce Cohn Curtis', 'Will Dixon', 'Stephen Onda', 'Mark Reid', 'Lance H. Robbins'], 'Starring': ['Gabrielle Anwar', 'Max Martini', 'Diego Wallraff'], 'Studio': ['All Channel Films']}\nBoring. Slow. Scenes filled with suspenseful music to cover up no dialogues or actions. Worse of all, the role of Lisa Monroe as a cop was pathetic. No cop in real life could come close to being as incompetent as she is.\nA waste of time\n{'Content advisory': ['Alcohol use', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Brian Skiba'], 'Producers': ['Vincent De Paul', 'Christian Filippella', 'Gloria Kisel', 'Kip Konwiser', 'Kirsten Lea', 'Donna Spangler'], 'Starring': ['Dean Cain', 'John Savage', 'Donna Spangler'], 'Studio': ['ITN Distribution', 'Inc.']}\nNot what I had expected. We take so much for granted that we can become self centered or blind to the blessings that we do have. I am guilty of both. This movie touched my heart and opened my eyes to faith, love, and hope. Faith that God cares about me. Love that I can give, especially to those who are hurting. And hope for the future even in life's dark moments.\nBeautiful story.\nMOMMY, I DIDN'T DO IT\nDrama, Dark, Mysterious, Tense\n['Starring Danica McKellar.

Her acting didn't disappoint. She played her character so well that at times I empathize with her while other times, I just want to yell at her. Page Searcy played a teenager's attitudes and behaviors so well that she reminded me of my own teens.
