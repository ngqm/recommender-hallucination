Columbo is the landmark series that inspired a genre. And now, for the first time ever, all 69 episodes from its seven seasons and all 24 television movies are together in this 34-disc anthology. Every criminal, every innocent victim (and some not-so-innocent ones), and every wily deduction are here in one definitive collection. Seemingly befuddled but always brilliant, the cigar-chomping detective will have you following the clues and asking \"just one more thing\" until the last case is cracked.   Note: This set contains 34 discs which are contained in 8 cases.']\n{'Aspect Ratio': '1.33:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 5.12 Pounds', 'Media Format': 'Color, Full Screen, Widescreen, NTSC', 'Run time': '99 hours and 52 minutes', 'Release date': 'October 16, 2012', 'Actors': 'Peter Falk', 'Subtitles': 'French, Spanish', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono), Unknown (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono), English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo)', 'Studio': 'Universal', 'Number of discs': '34'}\nThis will be our Winter entertainment and really looking forward to it.
