And for that, I'm thankful. The story was fun! There were moments where characters were innovatively extended by use of inanimate objects. The characters were kept to a minimum which was nice. There weren't many uneven moments where I thought, &#34;why is this person even here?&#34; Also, the whole thing was funny. If you're someone with a short attention span who needs something like Yo-Gabba-Gabba or the Transformers series to justify a decent film, this will be disappointing.

However, they failed to describe how the main character was being repressed by her husband. That was a HUGE component in the text. Wasn't the room supposed to be converted from an old nursery? I didn't get that feeling. And, they certainly didn't build the connection between her increased writing and the emergence of her apparent illness. Just because the text is short does not mean the movie should have less. It certainly felt that way. Who ever converted the text for screen definitely should have stood their ground on keeping true to the meaning of the text. Maybe a student indie film will pick up the text and do it some justice.\nKind of a let down if you've read the story already.\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a)', 'Italiano', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', 'Polski', '\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e', 'Portugu\u00eas', 'Deutsch', 'Fran\u00e7ais'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', '\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629', '\u010ce\u0161tina', 'Dansk', '\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac', 'Suomi', 'Filipino', '\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea', '\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940', 'Magyar', 'Indonesia', '\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e', '\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4', 'Bahasa Melayu', 'Norsk Bokm\u00e5l', 'Nederlands', 'Polski', 'Portugu\u00eas', 'Rom\u00e2n\u0103', '\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439', 'Svenska', '\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bcd', '\u0c24\u0c46\u0c32\u0c41\u0c17\u0c41', '\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22', 'T\u00fcrk\u00e7e', '\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430', 'Ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t', '\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7b80\u4f53\uff09', '\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7e41\u9ad4\uff09'], 'Directors': ['Joey Soloway', 'Andrea Arnold', 'Nisha Ganatra', 'Silas Howard', 'Jim Frohna', 'Stacie Passon', 'Marta Cunningham', 'Allison Liddi-Brown', 'Marielle Heller', 'So Yong Kim'], 'Producers': ['Joey Soloway', 'Nisha Ganatra', 'Andrea Sperling', 'Victor Hsu', 'Bridget Bedard', 'Rick Rosenthal', 'Jennifer Corey'], 'Starring': ['Jeffrey Tambor', 'Gaby Hoffmann', 'Jay Duplass'], 'Studio': ['Amazon Studios']}\nThe players and the plots are top notch.
