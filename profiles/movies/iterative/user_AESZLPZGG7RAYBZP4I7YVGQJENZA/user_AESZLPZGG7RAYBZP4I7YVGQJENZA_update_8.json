  "reference_summary": "{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Ridley Scott'], 'Producers': ['Simon Kinberg', 'Ridley Scott', 'Michael Schaeffer', 'Aditya Sood', 'Mark Huffam'], 'Starring': ['Matt Damon', 'Jessica Chastain', 'Kristen Wiig'], 'Studio': ['20th Century Fox']}\nIt was a good movie and I found Matt Damon was a perfect actor for the role.  I wasn't sure why this was in the comedy/drama category for Golden Globe but I guess I know why now for scattered comedic moments which I thought he struck a pretty good balance of being funny as a person with extreme condition and a possible fate.<br />Had a good pace and story is strong and convincing (less numbers and scientific theories which are way beyond me) enough to follow without losing focus.<br />This would be a good choice to watch with your pre-teen and older children.\nEntertaining\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Christopher McQuarrie'], 'Producers': ['Tom Cruise', 'J.J. Abrams', 'Bryan Burk'], 'Starring': ['Tom Cruise', 'Jeremy Renner', 'Simon Pegg'], 'Studio': ['Paramount Pictures']}\nIt is a good entertainment as long as you can get over Tom Cruise being himself. Good pace with good depth in the story. Perfect for a family movie night with kids from pre-teen and up.\nGood entertainment\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Woody Allen'], 'Producers': ['Letty Aronson', 'Stephen Tenenbaum', 'Jaume Roures'], 'Starring': ['Kathy Bates', 'Adrien Brody', 'Carla Bruni'], 'Studio': ['Sony Pictures Entertainment Co']}\nLove this film.  All start ensemble is nice.  Good casting.  Not so many but still get to see &#34;beautiful&#34; areas of Paris.\nGood entertainment.\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Patrick Hughes'], 'Producers': ['Danny Lerner', 'Les Weldon', 'John Thompson', 'Avi Lerner', 'Kevin King-Templeton'], 'Starring': ['Sylvester Stallone', 'Jason Statham', 'Antonio Banderas'], 'Studio': ['Lionsgate']}\nIt is a good entertainment. Just go with it without thinking too much of it or looking for anything. Some lines are cheesy and kinds of cheap jokes but just enjoy. This series kind of makes me think Stalone is actually quite a decent fellow who remembers his colleagues - &#34;action stars&#34; from the past, and I like it. They are having fun. Why don't we?\nFun and guys would be pumped up with this.\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'frightening scenes', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Stephen Norrington'], 'Producers': ['Peter Frankfurt', 'Wesley Snipes', 'Robert Engelman'], 'Starring': ['Wesley Snipes', 'Stephen Dorff', 'Kris Kristofferson'], 'Studio': ['New Line']}\nIt's an okay movie.  The concept is interesting and character is someone convincing. The story is somewhat choppy and could have been better up until the head of vampires got executed/ Frost started to carry out his grand plan.\nEntertaining\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Louis Leterrier', 'Corey Yuen'], 'Producers': ['Luc Besson', 'Steven Chasman', 'Steve Chasman'], 'Starring': ['Jason Statham', 'Qi Shu', 'Franois Berland'], 'Studio': ['The Walt Disney Studios']}\nI knew this wasn't a 4 or 5 star movie before renting it and it is not but it is entertaining. Jason Statham's martial art skills are all displayed here (could have been more?).  The script is awkward and could use a lot of help. It is visually beautiful for using the location in Nice, France.  But that is about it.  So, take it as seeing south of France and Jason Statham and just go with it.\nIt is visually beautiful for using the location in Nice\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Alex Garland'], 'Producers': ['Andrew Macdonald', 'Allon Reich'], 'Starring': ['Alicia Vikander', 'Domhnall Gleeson', 'Oscar Isaac'], 'Studio': ['A24 Distribution LLC']}\nI was surprised with the story. It is different from many other movies, certainly nothing like The Terminator or any other movies that feature AI or robots. Acting was great and convincing. I was totally expecting a B movie but this is A and much more and better than what you may expect. The house and surrounding area are so breath takingly beautiful (mostly shot in Norway?). Highly recommended.\nThis is for you if you are looking for something different and new\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'frightening scenes', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Ben Stiller'], 'Producers': ['Ben Stiller', 'Stuart Cornfeld', 'Scott Rudin', 'Clayton Townsend', 'Jeff Mann'], 'Starring': ['Ben Stiller', 'Owen Wilson', 'Will Ferrell']}\nThe story is very choppy and it seems they tried so hard to be funny but were not able to use actors natural acting abilities.
