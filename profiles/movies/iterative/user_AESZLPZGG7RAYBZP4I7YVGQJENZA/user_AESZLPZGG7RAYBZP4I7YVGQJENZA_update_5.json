I wasn't sure why this was in the comedy/drama category for Golden Globe but I guess I know why now for scattered comedic moments which I thought he struck a pretty good balance of being funny as a person with extreme condition and a possible fate.<br />Had a good pace and story is strong and convincing (less numbers and scientific theories which are way beyond me) enough to follow without losing focus.<br />This would be a good choice to watch with your pre-teen and older children.\nEntertaining\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Christopher McQuarrie'], 'Producers': ['Tom Cruise', 'J.J. Abrams', 'Bryan Burk'], 'Starring': ['Tom Cruise', 'Jeremy Renner', 'Simon Pegg'], 'Studio': ['Paramount Pictures']}\nIt is a good entertainment as long as you can get over Tom Cruise being himself. Good pace with good depth in the story. Perfect for a family movie night with kids from pre-teen and up.\nGood entertainment\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Woody Allen'], 'Producers': ['Letty Aronson', 'Stephen Tenenbaum', 'Jaume Roures'], 'Starring': ['Kathy Bates', 'Adrien Brody', 'Carla Bruni'], 'Studio': ['Sony Pictures Entertainment Co']}\nLove this film.  All start ensemble is nice.  Good casting.  Not so many but still get to see &#34;beautiful&#34; areas of Paris.\nGood entertainment.\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Patrick Hughes'], 'Producers': ['Danny Lerner', 'Les Weldon', 'John Thompson', 'Avi Lerner', 'Kevin King-Templeton'], 'Starring': ['Sylvester Stallone', 'Jason Statham', 'Antonio Banderas'], 'Studio': ['Lionsgate']}\nIt is a good entertainment. Just go with it without thinking too much of it or looking for anything. Some lines are cheesy and kinds of cheap jokes but just enjoy. This series kind of makes me think Stalone is actually quite a decent fellow who remembers his colleagues - &#34;action stars&#34; from the past, and I like it. They are having fun. Why don't we?\nFun and guys would be pumped up with this.\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'frightening scenes', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Stephen Norrington'], 'Producers': ['Peter Frankfurt', 'Wesley Snipes', 'Robert Engelman'], 'Starring': ['Wesley Snipes', 'Stephen Dorff', 'Kris Kristofferson'], 'Studio': ['New Line']}\nIt's an okay movie.
