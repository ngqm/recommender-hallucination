I wasn't sure why this was in the comedy/drama category for Golden Globe but I guess I know why now for scattered comedic moments which I thought he struck a pretty good balance of being funny as a person with extreme condition and a possible fate.<br />Had a good pace and story is strong and convincing (less numbers and scientific theories which are way beyond me) enough to follow without losing focus.<br />This would be a good choice to watch with your pre-teen and older children.\nEntertaining\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Christopher McQuarrie'], 'Producers': ['Tom Cruise', 'J.J.
