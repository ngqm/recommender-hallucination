I wasn't sure why this was in the comedy/drama category for Golden Globe but I guess I know why now for scattered comedic moments which I thought he struck a pretty good balance of being funny as a person with extreme condition and a possible fate.<br />Had a good pace and story is strong and convincing (less numbers and scientific theories which are way beyond me) enough to follow without losing focus.<br />This would be a good choice to watch with your pre-teen and older children.\nEntertaining\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Christopher McQuarrie'], 'Producers': ['Tom Cruise', 'J.J.

Good pace with good depth in the story. Perfect for a family movie night with kids from pre-teen and up.\nGood entertainment\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Woody Allen'], 'Producers': ['Letty Aronson', 'Stephen Tenenbaum', 'Jaume Roures'], 'Starring': ['Kathy Bates', 'Adrien Brody', 'Carla Bruni'], 'Studio': ['Sony Pictures Entertainment Co']}\nLove this film.
