I wasn't sure why this was in the comedy/drama category for Golden Globe but I guess I know why now for scattered comedic moments which I thought he struck a pretty good balance of being funny as a person with extreme condition and a possible fate.<br />Had a good pace and story is strong and convincing (less numbers and scientific theories which are way beyond me) enough to follow without losing focus.<br />This would be a good choice to watch with your pre-teen and older children.\nEntertaining\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Christopher McQuarrie'], 'Producers': ['Tom Cruise', 'J.J. Abrams', 'Bryan Burk'], 'Starring': ['Tom Cruise', 'Jeremy Renner', 'Simon Pegg'], 'Studio': ['Paramount Pictures']}\nIt is a good entertainment as long as you can get over Tom Cruise being himself. Good pace with good depth in the story. Perfect for a family movie night with kids from pre-teen and up.\nGood entertainment\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Woody Allen'], 'Producers': ['Letty Aronson', 'Stephen Tenenbaum', 'Jaume Roures'], 'Starring': ['Kathy Bates', 'Adrien Brody', 'Carla Bruni'], 'Studio': ['Sony Pictures Entertainment Co']}\nLove this film.  All start ensemble is nice.  Good casting.  Not so many but still get to see &#34;beautiful&#34; areas of Paris.\nGood entertainment.\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Patrick Hughes'], 'Producers': ['Danny Lerner', 'Les Weldon', 'John Thompson', 'Avi Lerner', 'Kevin King-Templeton'], 'Starring': ['Sylvester Stallone', 'Jason Statham', 'Antonio Banderas'], 'Studio': ['Lionsgate']}\nIt is a good entertainment. Just go with it without thinking too much of it or looking for anything. Some lines are cheesy and kinds of cheap jokes but just enjoy. This series kind of makes me think Stalone is actually quite a decent fellow who remembers his colleagues - &#34;action stars&#34; from the past, and I like it. They are having fun. Why don't we?\nFun and guys would be pumped up with this.\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'frightening scenes', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Stephen Norrington'], 'Producers': ['Peter Frankfurt', 'Wesley Snipes', 'Robert Engelman'], 'Starring': ['Wesley Snipes', 'Stephen Dorff', 'Kris Kristofferson'], 'Studio': ['New Line']}\nIt's an okay movie.  The concept is interesting and character is someone convincing. The story is somewhat choppy and could have been better up until the head of vampires got executed/ Frost started to carry out his grand plan.\nEntertaining\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Louis Leterrier', 'Corey Yuen'], 'Producers': ['Luc Besson', 'Steven Chasman', 'Steve Chasman'], 'Starring': ['Jason Statham', 'Qi Shu', 'Franois Berland'], 'Studio': ['The Walt Disney Studios']}\nI knew this wasn't a 4 or 5 star movie before renting it and it is not but it is entertaining. Jason Statham's martial art skills are all displayed here (could have been more?).  The script is awkward and could use a lot of help. It is visually beautiful for using the location in Nice, France.  But that is about it.  So, take it as seeing south of France and Jason Statham and just go with it.\nIt is visually beautiful for using the location in Nice\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Alex Garland'], 'Producers': ['Andrew Macdonald', 'Allon Reich'], 'Starring': ['Alicia Vikander', 'Domhnall Gleeson', 'Oscar Isaac'], 'Studio': ['A24 Distribution LLC']}\nI was surprised with the story. It is different from many other movies, certainly nothing like The Terminator or any other movies that feature AI or robots. Acting was great and convincing. I was totally expecting a B movie but this is A and much more and better than what you may expect. The house and surrounding area are so breath takingly beautiful (mostly shot in Norway?). Highly recommended.\nThis is for you if you are looking for something different and new\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'frightening scenes', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Ben Stiller'], 'Producers': ['Ben Stiller', 'Stuart Cornfeld', 'Scott Rudin', 'Clayton Townsend', 'Jeff Mann'], 'Starring': ['Ben Stiller', 'Owen Wilson', 'Will Ferrell']}\nThe story is very choppy and it seems they tried so hard to be funny but were not able to use actors natural acting abilities. I so wanted to like it but didn't come close.\nCan be skipped.\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'Fran\u00e7ais (Canada)', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a)', 'Italiano', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', 'Polski', '\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e', 'Portugu\u00eas', 'Deutsch', 'Fran\u00e7ais (France)'], 'Subtitles': ['English', 'English [CC]', 'Dansk', 'Deutsch', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica) [CC]', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a) [CC]', 'Suomi', 'Fran\u00e7ais', 'Fran\u00e7ais [CC]', 'Italiano [CC]', 'Nederlands [CC]', 'Nynorsk', 'Polski', 'Portugu\u00eas (Brasil)', 'Portugu\u00eas (Brasil) [SDH]', 'Portugu\u00eas (Portugal)', 'Svenska'], 'Directors': ['George Miller'], 'Producers': ['Bruce Berman', 'Graham Burke', 'Chris Defaria', 'Steven Mnuchin', 'Iain Smith', 'Courtenay Valenti', 'Doug Mitchell', 'George Miller', 'P.J. Voeten'], 'Starring': ['Tom Hardy', 'Charlize Theron', 'Nicholas Hoult'], 'Studio': ['WARNER BROS.']}\nI was not disappointed with this reboot. This doesn't have too much extra fluffy stuff (except for those models that may or may not have added much to the movie) but stayed true to the bones. Overall acting was very convincing and the plot is fine. The audio wasn't that clear and I missed some of the dialogues but no issues in following the story. I recommend it.\nVery nice reboot and recommend it.\nArrival\nDrama, Science Fiction, Cerebral, Dreamlike\n['When mysterious spacecraft touch down across the globe, an elite team - led by expert translator Louise Banks (Academy Award nominee Amy Adams) - races against time to decipher their intent.']\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English (US) [CC]', 'English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['---'], 'Producers': ['Shawn Levy', 'Dan Levine', 'Aaron Ryder', 'David Linde'], 'Starring': ['Amy Adams', 'Jeremy Renner', 'Forest Whitaker']}\nThis was an excellent movie and I would want to see it again. It is sci-fi and there is quite bit of visual effects and special effect but it's only a little part of the story. It is very emotional and Amy Adams did such a great job to tell her character's story and feelings. The chemistry with Jeremy Renner was very convincing as well. It is NOT just another alien movie but a story in the sci-fi format, rather.\nHighly recommending this movie.\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', 'Espa\u00f1ol'], 'Directors': ['Edgar Wright'], 'Producers': ['Nira Park'], 'Starring': ['Simon Pegg', 'Nick Frost', 'Paddy Considine'], 'Studio': ['NBC Universal']}\nAs much as I love Simon Pegg, I didn't like his character in this movie.
