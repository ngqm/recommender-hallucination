Two weeks later, all of them were found dead. What happened is a mystery that has baffled investigators and researchers for decades. It has become known as the Dyatlov Pass Incident. When five ambitious American college students are issued a grant to return to the site of the original events, they gear up with the belief that they can uncover and document the truth of what happened to the supposedly experienced hikers. But what they find is more shocking than anything they could have imagined. Retracing the steps of the Russians' ill-fated journey, the students are plagued by strange and increasingly terrifying phenomena that suggest that in spite of the desolate surroundings, they are not alone. The forces at work in the Dyatlov Pass Incident have been waiting for them. Based on a true story, director Renny Harlin's (Cliffhanger) DEVIL'S PASS is an edge-of-your-seat thriller that delivers nail-biting suspense right up to it's shocking final frame.\"]\n{'Genre': 'Horror', 'Format': 'NTSC, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Renny Harlin, Holly Goss, Matt Stokoe', 'Language': 'English', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 40 minutes', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 2.72 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'IDFC9895DVD', 'Director': 'Renny Harlin', 'Media Format': 'NTSC, Widescreen', 'Run time': '1 hour and 40 minutes', 'Release date': 'December 17, 2013', 'Actors': 'Holly Goss, Matt Stokoe', 'Studio': 'IFC Independent Film', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nThe movie had an excellent plot and seemed to move along rather well until about two thirds through the movie, then it seems to lose its game plan and began rushing to the finale.  A three star revue in my opinion.\nSwedeish Horror\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Jay Andrews', 'Jim Wynorski'], 'Producers': ['Daniel Gilboy', 'Dan Golden', 'Paul Hertzberg', 'Michael Par?', 'Kimberly A. Ray'], 'Starring': ['Michael Pare', 'Michelle Borth', 'Jerri Manthey'], 'Studio': ['Lionsgate']}\nNo doubt a believable project to a point, but yet as Sci-Fi movies go it was worth the 3 stars. Michael Pare, as usual works with an average script and without a net but still gives the audience its money worth.\nAction Packed\nJohn Carter of Mars\nTraci Lords  (Actor),     Antonio Sabato Jr.  (Actor),     Mark Atkins  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Action & Adventure\n[\"A classic story that inspired Jame's Cameron's Avatar.
