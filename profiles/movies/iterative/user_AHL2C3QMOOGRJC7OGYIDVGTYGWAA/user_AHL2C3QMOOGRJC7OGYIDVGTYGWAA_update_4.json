This heroic tale chronicles the courageous exploits of the Robinson family after they are shipwrecked on a deserted island. Using teamwork and ingenuity, they skillfully overcome the obstacles of nature and transform their new home into a \"civilized\" community. But the ultimate challenge lies ahead when a band of cutthroat pirates threaten to destroy the Robinson\\'s Makeshift paradise. Capture the thrills, romance, and fun of this unforgettable Disney film!|The film was based on the book by Johann Wyss, written to preserve the tales he and his sons made up while imagining themselves in Robinson Crusoe\\'s predicament. Not originally intended for publication, the narrative was later edited and illustrated by Wyss\\' descendants.|Filmed on the Caribbean island of Tobago, the motion picture\\'s lavish preproduction planning and on-location shooting (22 weeks) resulted in a budget that exceeded $4 million, but the extraordinary box office returns, subsequent popular reissues, and release on home video in 1982 has made it one of Disney\\'s top-grossing films.|There was one problem with the filming location of Tobago: it had no animals. Tropical birds, gulls, ostriches, snakes, tigers, zebras, baby elephants, and monkeys were all flown to the island, along with 14 animal trainers.|One afternoon the flamingos Disney \"hired\" for the film took off from Tobago and headed south to British Guiana. Fortunately, they returned the next day at feeding time.']\n{'Genre': 'ACTION, Action/Adventure, LIVE', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Color, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Sessue Hayakawa, Dorothy McGuire, Tommy Kirk, Kevin Corcoran, Janet Munro, Ken Annakin, John Mills, James MacArthurSessue Hayakawa, Dorothy McGuire, Tommy Kirk, Kevin Corcoran, Janet Munro, Ken Annakin, John Mills, James MacArthur   See more', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1), Unqualified, Spanish (Dolby Digital 2.0)', 'Runtime': '2 hours and 6 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '2.35:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'G (General Audience)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.75 x 5.75 x 0.75 inches; 3.04 Ounces', 'Audio Description': 'English, Spanish', 'Item model number': '786936143836', 'Director': 'Ken Annakin', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Color, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Run time': '2 hours and 6 minutes', 'Release date': 'May 7, 2002', 'Actors': 'John Mills, Dorothy McGuire, James MacArthur, Janet Munro, Sessue Hayakawa', 'Subtitles': 'English', 'Studio': 'WALT DISNEY PICTURES', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\ngreat movie!\nFive Stars\nTim Hawkins-Greatest Hits & Greatest Bits\nTim Hawkins  (Actor),     Rockshow Comedy  (Director)    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Comedy\n[\"Greatest Hits & Greatest Bits contains 25 awesome musical hits (20 live performance and 5 music videos) and 43 fan-favorite stand up bits that span 10 years of Tim's career.
