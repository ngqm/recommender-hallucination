The crossroads for three great religions, the Holy Land has been coveted and fought over for centuries. Dining with both Jews and Muslims, we realize the menu is essentially the same, whether in Hebrew or Arabic. While visiting the big sights, we delve deeper to better understand and empathize with both peoples. In Israel, we go from the venerable ramparts of Jerusalem to the vibrant modern skyline of Tel Aviv. In Palestine, by harvesting olives near Hebron, visiting a home in Bethlehem, and popping into a university in Ramallah, we get to know a land few tourists visit. And all along the way, we learn about security walls, disputed settlements, and the persistent challenges facing the region as Israelis and Palestinians learn to live together.', \"Director's Cut DVD\", \"This special director's cut features an extended version of the original 1-hour public television special\u2014plus a commentary track featuring Rick Steves and director Simon Griffith.\", 'Bonus Features', 'Q&A with Rick StevesExtended interviewsBonus Disc:', \"Rick Steves' Iran\", 'Review', 'What public television viewers are saying about the', 'Rick Steves The Holy Land', 'special:', '\"I was entranced the whole hour.\" \u2013Anne, OETA viewer\"[', 'The Holy Land', '] was excellent.
