However, after a storm traps a baby orca in the park's lagoon, the park not only gets more visitors, but Kirra and the whale she names Willy develop an amazing friendship. Knowing that Willy will soon outgrow the lagoon and that her grandfather will be forced to sell the whale to his competitor, Kirra must not only locate Willy's pod, but also find a way to teach the young whale to survive and be free in the open sea.\", ']]>', 'Amazon.com', 'More a retelling of the original 1993', 'Free Willy', 'film than a third sequel in the series,', \"Free Willy: Escape from Pirate's Cove\", \"is the story of a young whale who's separated from his pod, used in a moneymaking scheme, and befriended by a young girl who ultimately makes a huge difference in the young whale's life. The film stars Bindi Irwin (daughter of the late Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin and host of the TV nature documentary series\", 'Bindi the Jungle Girl', \") in her first film, and she is surprisingly believable and passionate in her role as Kirra, if not entirely polished. Beau Bridges plays Kirra's grandfather, Gus, a down-on-his-luck gambler and owner of a dilapidated amusement park who's obsessed with making money. When Kirra's father is injured, Gus is unexpectedly saddled with caring for his granddaughter over the summer. Bongo Mbutuma, Siyabulela Ramba, and Stephen Jennings round out the cast. When a young orca becomes trapped in the lagoon at Gus's ocean-side amusement park in South Africa, Kirra and her grandfather clash over the whale's future. Kirra quickly dubs the whale Willy and pleads with her grandfather to set him free, but Gus wants to use Willy to boost profits. When a mammal rescue group determines that Willy's underdeveloped echolocation makes him unfit to survive alone in the wild, Kirra bristles at their suggestion to put Willy down, and she vows to rehabilitate the orca. Meanwhile, Kirra's grandfather contemplates selling Willy to a neighboring park owner at a handsome profit, in hopes that he will have the necessary funds to properly house and care for Willy. More than just a story about right versus wrong,\", \"Free Willy: Escape from Pirate's Cove\", 'is an exploration of a much more complicated ethical dilemma in which the best course of action is unclear. As the characters each struggle to choose the right path, what becomes crystal clear is the power of perseverance and the personal growth that results from love, adversity, and challenge. While the CGI graphic scenes of the orca pods swimming are admittedly poor and some other aspects of this film could have been improved,', \"Escape from Pirate's Cove\", \"is still a good family film with a heartfelt message. Bonus features include a fairly interesting featurette about filming on location in South Africa, Bindi's first movie diary, a quick look at the film's animal costars, two deleted scenes, and one outtake. The Blu-ray also features a pop-up trivia option that runs the length of the film.\", '--Tami Horiuchi']\n{'Genre': 'Kids & Family, Drama, Action & Adventure', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, Dolby, Full Screen, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Beau Bridges, Mike Falkow, Will Geiger, Bindi Irwin', 'Initial release date': '2010-03-23', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1), French (Dolby Digital 5.1), Unqualified', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.78:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG (Parental Guidance Suggested)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'WHV1000099825DVD', 'Director': 'Will Geiger', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, Dolby, Full Screen, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Run time': '1 hour and 42 minutes', 'Release date': 'March 23, 2010', 'Actors': 'Bindi Irwin, Beau Bridges, Mike Falkow', 'Subtitles': 'English, French, Spanish', 'Studio': 'Studio Distribution Services', 'Number of discs': '1'}\ngrand son liked\nFour Stars\nWild Kratts: Bugging Out\n.

It is an existence that mirrors that of her favorite literary character, Alex Rover- the world's greatest adventurer. But Alexandra, the author of the Rover books, leads a reclusive life in the big city. When Nim's father goes missing from their island, a twist of fate brings her together with Alexandra. Now, they must draw courage from their fictional hero, Alex Rover, and find strength in one another to conquer Nim's Island.\", 'Amazon.com', \"Adventure doesn't always begin with pirates on the high seas or explorers deep in the desert; sometimes it starts with an idyllic life on a private island in the middle of the South Asiatic Sea. For 11-year old Nim (Abigail Breslin) and her father and microbiologist Jack Russo (Gerard Butler), life is perfect thanks to their love of nature, Jack's mechanical ingenuity, and regular deliveries via supply ship. Loneliness is never an issue for Nim because of her special friendships with Selkie the sea lion, Galileo the pelican, and Freddie the iguana and her education is intensive, if rather unique. Adventure and imagination are ways of life for Nim whether she's heading out to sea to help her father collect plankton specimens, playing soccer on the beach with Selkie, or delving into the latest Alex Rover adventure novel, but everything changes when Jack departs on the boat for a two-night expedition to collect plankton specimens and gets caught in an unexpected storm. Alone on the island, Nim begins to worry about her father's safety as well as her own and, through a chance email, connects with Alex Rover (Jodie Foster) whom she begs to come help find her father. Problem is, author Alexandra Rover is an unbalanced big city shut-in who's afraid to leave her townhouse, not the fearless adventure hero portrayed in her books. Nim, Alexandra, and Jack embark upon the adventures of a lifetime in which each must overcome his or her own fears and perceived powerlessness and limitations in order to grow and help one another. The question is; can each prevail against his or her own insecurities and the fury of nature?

Thneedville is an artificial place, made primarily from plastic. It sports inflatable trees, fast cars, and air quality so poor that the residents are forced to purchase bottled fresh air. In another new twist to the story, 12-year-old Ted (Zac Efron) discovers that his crush Audrey (Taylor Swift) wants nothing more than to see a long-extinct Truffula Tree, so he sets out to impress her by finding one. Since there are no real trees in Thneedville, Ted acts on the crazy stories of his grandmother (Betty White), venturing beyond the city\\'s walls into the desolate wasteland to locate a mysterious creature called the Once-ler (Ed Helms). Here the story and animation begin to more closely follow the book. Ted discovers the grumpy recluse, who reluctantly begins to tell him a tale about a once-perfect landscape filled with beautiful Truffula Trees and cute frolicking animals--a landscape now decimated by one greedy young man\\'s insatiable appetite for profit. The beauty and wonder of the Truffula forest and its creatures are right out of Dr. Seuss\\'s illustrations. While the forest creatures may not be directly referred to as Brown Bar-ba-loots, Swomee-Swans, and Humming-Fish, the cute little bears, funny-looking ducks, and especially charming trio of singing fish are instantly recognizable. They serve, as they do in Dr. Seuss\\'s book, to add just the right amount of humor and levity to what would otherwise be a pretty heavy-handed message from the Lorax (Danny DeVito) about environmental preservation. Ted\\'s hormonal instincts to impress Audrey slowly begin to take a back seat to the plight of the lost trees and animals, and the Once-ler\\'s assertion that \"Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better\" rings true by the end of the film. The abundance of original music is a nice and unexpected addition to the story, though why neither Efron nor Swift actually gets to sing is perplexing.

The question is, will working together, combined with a little help from a golf-playing goose and his duck caddy, be enough to get the pair all the way back to Jasper National Park before the rival wolf packs tear one another apart at the next full moon? And what will become of their relationship if they do return in time? This animated film is amusing and entertaining, if not particularly outstanding. A lot of the humor is pretty corny and the plot has been done many times before (think\", 'Open Season 2', '), but the characters are likable, the action is pretty good, and who can resist chuckling at images like a retired, golf-playing French-Canadian goose or the distractive powers of a good cupcake?
