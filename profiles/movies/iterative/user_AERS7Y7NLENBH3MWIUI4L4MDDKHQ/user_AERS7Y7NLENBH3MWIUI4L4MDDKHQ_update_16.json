This guy tried to make the entire story about him, a guy who pushed a button on a machine. Line after line of how he was Picasso, how his photograph compared to Pulitzer Prize winning photos, every last thing the guy said was about himself. I defy you to find a sentence without the word &#34;I&#34; or &#34;me&#34; in it.\nThe Most Narcissistic Photographer in the History of Photographs\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Stephanie Kaim'], 'Producers': ['Ir\u00e8ne Challand', 'Claire Colart', 'Sandrine Delegiewicz', 'St\u00e9phane Haumant', 'Gaspard Lamuni\u00e8re', 'Daniel Leconte', 'Andreas Lemos', '\u00c9milie Raffoul', 'Olivier Stroh'], 'Studio': ['MagellanTV']}\nOut after 40 seconds.

That HAD to be a ghost! I now believe in ghosts! This was a lower budget Blair Witch Project that was hoping a large percentage of the people were too young to remember The Blair Witch Project. The only reason it barely made it to three stars is that it's a cute couple. And they did get me to watch the whole thing. This was very terrible.\nThis was very terrible.\n{'Content advisory': ['Alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Lee Schloss'], 'Producers': ['Mike Bocchetti'], 'Starring': ['Mike Bocchetti', 'Artie Lange', 'Sal the Stockbroker']}\nThe quality of the video could be better, but the quality of Mike could not. He's got a heart of gold, and if you want to see who he is, I recommend youtubing \"Mike Bocchetti and the weather\". Crisp video quality, and Mike never has a bad word to say about anyone. His true comic talents are brought out by Artie Lange on Artie's show when he does the weather. Please watch, I've seen it so many times.\nMike is a 5 star person\n{'Content advisory': ['Foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['CJ Wallis'], 'Producers': ['Mallory Kennedy', 'CJ Wallis'], 'Starring': ['Ted Slauson', 'Bob Barker', 'Roger Dobkowitz']}\nThe guy who does the narrating (the principle subject) has this style that doesn't seem like he'd like any kind of game show at all. But it kind of grows on you. There is a surprising amount of footage that captures all of his appearances. I thought there would be a little more scandal to it. It really should be titled The Contestant Who Knew a Fair Amount. There were some tones of stalker in him, but that helped my fascination.  And Holly didn't have to fear him because well, ya know, I mean- ya know? She knew.<br /><br />Also, at the time when he was young, he was a good looking guy, I think that's how the models kind of liked him. In his prime, it wasn't weird to ask for a kiss from Holly. It was really sad to see Bob Barker get older, because you see the pics of him when he was younger, and you just couldn't look more alive. For even someone that good looking to get old, damn, what's that say for the rest of us.<br /><br />But I highly recommend this doc for sure for sure watch it.\nA really good documentary\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence'], 'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Sally Howell'], 'Producers': ['Heather Dreiling', 'Eric Schotz', 'Kathy Williamson'], 'Studio': ['MagellanTV']}\nThe narrator, who looks like the kind of guy who got beat up a lot in grammar school, is a little too alarmist, and rehashes  stuff the main authority on sugar has already talked about. This goofball says he is serious about exercise and then says who needs a gym and walks up a hill with rocks. Wow. I've lived in England, and just like the rest of English TV, this seems like, I don't know- practice television, and a practice documentary. Also what I've noticed in English documentaries, they seem to be fascinated by the narrator WALKING. It must be a luxury in the UK to walk, or it must denote thinking. Anyway, I couldn't make it all the way through.\nCouldn't make it to the end\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['---'], 'Producers': ['Paul Dechant'], 'Starring': ['Paul Dechant']}\nThe way we think about sugar is going to change; but not from this micro-mentary. I had a longer report about sugar in 5th grade. In about 300 seconds, this snippet talks about how there is sugar in food, and they made labels to know how much.<br /><br />I have changed the way I think about sugar. Also, I wish I had the last 5 minutes of my life back.\nWay too long\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Austin Meyer'], 'Producers': ['Austin Meyer'], 'Starring': ['Austin Meyer', 'Peter Braxton', 'Alex Charro'], 'Studio': ['AMC Plus Documentaries']}\nThis had me thinking the next day. Somebody told me about it, and I couldn't wait to watch it, even though I have nothing to do with patents. It's well told on a low budget and you'll find out why the budget is low. I could only slightly see the point of the other side, it was cool of Oscar Meyer to include them too, but in the balance, these patent trolls are very terrible people.\nBest Doc in a long while\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Michal Siewierski'], 'Producers': ['Peter Eastwood', 'Nicky Taylor', 'Gwyn Whittaker'], 'Starring': ['John Mackey', 'Rich Roll', 'Rip Esselstyn'], 'Studio': ['Gravitas Ventures']}\nI'm going to wait for the English speaking version.\nNot sure\nBillion Dollar Bully\nDocumentary, Arts, Entertainment, and Culture\n[\"Today consumers Yelp everything from restaurants to dentists; plumbers to surgeons.

God, I could not stand the snarky tone of the Yelp reps on the phone, I felt like punting them from here on the West Coast all the way to Rhode Island. And to think the person actually exists. And that Jackie Reses phone call- so glad she was exposed.<br /><br />I wish this documentary not so much put Yelp out of business, but held them more accountable. And I will take the advice of the person in the doc who said don't START advertising with them, because they won't let you stop. And it IS  the company culture, those are young reps under pressure from within to get a stupid cow bell ring instead of enough money to pay their rent in SF.<br /><br />They're a monopoly, take them down, and I am going to visit that guys' Italian restaurant in Richmond, and if you know Richmond, that's saying something.\nOh The Irony\nThe Florida Project [DVD]\nWillem Dafoe  (Actor),     Brooklynn Prince  (Actor),     Sean Baker  (Director, Producer)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Drama\n['Product Description', \"On the shabby grounds of an Orlando budget hotel, youngsters Moonee (Brooklynn Prince), Scooty (Christopher Rivera), and Jacey (Valeria Cotto) are left to fend for themselves as their struggling parents eke out an existence on the margins of the tourist trade.
