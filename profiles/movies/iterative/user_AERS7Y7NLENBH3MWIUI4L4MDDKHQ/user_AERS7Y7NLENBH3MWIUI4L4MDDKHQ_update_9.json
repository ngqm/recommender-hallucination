But it kind of grows on you. There is a surprising amount of footage that captures all of his appearances. I thought there would be a little more scandal to it. It really should be titled The Contestant Who Knew a Fair Amount. There were some tones of stalker in him, but that helped my fascination.  And Holly didn't have to fear him because well, ya know, I mean- ya know? She knew.<br /><br />Also, at the time when he was young, he was a good looking guy, I think that's how the models kind of liked him. In his prime, it wasn't weird to ask for a kiss from Holly. It was really sad to see Bob Barker get older, because you see the pics of him when he was younger, and you just couldn't look more alive. For even someone that good looking to get old, damn, what's that say for the rest of us.<br /><br />But I highly recommend this doc for sure for sure watch it.\nReview Title: A really good documentary\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

That HAD to be a ghost! I now believe in ghosts! This was a lower budget Blair Witch Project that was hoping a large percentage of the people were too young to remember The Blair Witch Project.
