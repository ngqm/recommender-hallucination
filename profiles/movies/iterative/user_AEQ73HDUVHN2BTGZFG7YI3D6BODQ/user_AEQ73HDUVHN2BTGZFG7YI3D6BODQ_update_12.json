I am not really familiar with all the Marvel Universe stories or characters other than from watching the Marvel films, but this one shows a facet of Natasha's character that was really nice to learn. This story takes place during the big split within the Avengers between Captain America and Ironman. Full of action and humor, it is thoroughly enjoyable. I am only sad that we just got to know a little bit more about her and then she's gone.\nReview Title: Sad happy\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Torchwood\nScience Fiction, Fantasy, Suspense, Drama\n['Torchwood follows the adventures of a team of investigators led by the enigmatic Captain Jack Harkness. Set in the UK in the present day, the team uses scavenged alien technology to solve crime both alien and human.']\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Andy Goddard', 'Ashley Way', 'Euros Lyn', 'Colin Teague', 'Billy Gierhart', 'Guy Ferland', 'Brian Kelly', 'James Strong', 'Alice Troughton', 'Jonathan Fox Bassett'], 'Starring': ['John Barrowman', 'Eve Myles', 'Gareth David-Lloyd']}\nTorchwood: Miracle Day is edgier than season 3, not really for the very young as it contains some sexual content. The story line is fabulous. I have only gotten to episode 8, but have been engrossed in this plot. Best yet!\nLuv it!\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Michael Nankin', 'Allan Kroeker', 'Andy Wolk', 'Allan Arkush', 'Larry Shaw', 'Omar Madha', 'Scott Stewart', 'Mairzee Almas', 'F\u00e9lix Enr\u00edquez Alcal\u00e1', 'Todd Slavkin'], 'Starring': ['Grant Bowler', 'Grant Bowler', 'Julie Benz'], 'Studio': ['Syfy']}\nI enjoyed watching this series and am truly disappointed that it has been discontinued. Like others have mentioned, it is like a fast-moving Western. These last episodes for me held many surprises. The biggest surprise for me is the Datak character's development. And it is bittersweet that the hero and Doc Yewll find redemption from their guilt through sacrifice and that Nolan gets to fulfill a longstanding wish to travel through space. So there is somewhat closure. Yet I feel like I did after watching &#34;Star Trek: Generations&#34;, or even another SyFy series, &#34;Continuum&#34;. The heros' s get what they hoped for, but not quite: like a wish granted by a Djin.\nBittersweet\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Graeme Harper', 'Euros Lyn', 'Jamie Magnus Stone', 'Douglas Mackinnon', 'Rachel Talalay', 'James Strong', 'Charlie Palmer', 'James Hawes', 'Joe Ahearne', 'Toby Haynes']}\nI've been a &#34;Doctor Who&#34; fan since childhood, and I'm 60 years old now! The David Tennant reinvention of Dr. Who is one of my favorites. The portrayal is so charismatic. I never tire of watching any &#34;Doctor Who&#34; episodes featuring my favorite versions of the Doctor. &#34;The Waters of Mars&#34; is especially poignant and telling as to the Doctor's developing nature. It still hits me every time I watch it.\nPoignant\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Sergei Bodrov'], 'Producers': ['Basil Iwanyk', 'Thomas Tull', 'Lionel Wigram'], 'Starring': ['Jeff Bridges', 'Ben Barnes', 'Alicia Vikander'], 'Studio': ['Universal Pictures']}\nAlthough this movie turned out to be not what I expected (I, for some reason, thought it would be along the line of the Orson Scott Card book series), it is enjoyable. There is action, beautiful scenery, fantastical creatures, a bit of a twist, and a touch of romance in this sorcerer versus witch film. I almost wrote good versus evil, but that does not actually fit. Without hopefully giving anything away, the film basically covers the main character's initiation into the legacy his birthing inheritance bestows upon him to the ongoing struggle against the dark forces. Before that point, Gregory, the Jeff Bridges character, and his companion are the last remnant of the light forces, once a vast army. The only complaint I have would be Gregory's speech mannerism. It's not really an accent. I am not sure what Jeff Bridges was going for. In any case, &#34;Seventh Son&#34; is an enjoyable fantasy.\nEnjoyable\n{'Content advisory': ['Alcohol use', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Brian Skiba'], 'Producers': ['Vincent De Paul', 'Christian Filippella', 'Gloria Kisel', 'Kip Konwiser', 'Kirsten Lea', 'Donna Spangler'], 'Starring': ['Dean Cain', 'John Savage', 'Donna Spangler'], 'Studio': ['ITN Distribution', 'Inc.']}\nIt is a pleasant movie with good messages throughout, but nothing much else to recommend it. Not that it is bad. It just doesn't seem to have the &#34;umph&#34; to it to be really uplifting as it could be. I was disappointed that Dean Cain actually is not featured much, although he carries his part charmingly well. This is a wholesome movie nevertheless, nice family fare.\nNice family fare\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Guido T\u00f6lke', 'Neil Every', 'Brent Crowell', 'Kryshan Randel'], 'Producers': ['Julia Dordel'], 'Starring': ['Julia Dordel', 'Eric Breker', 'Anita Reimer']}\nWell, the description intrigued, so I went for it. Did not see the relation of the Pam Grier &#34;Foxy Brown&#34; reference as applied by Jones to the hench person, who is definitely too young to know the film (70's), nor did Roger's James Bond reference make any sense either to me. Bailed shortly after that. It was trying to be clever, edgy and current, but truly missed on all counts.\nDon't bother\nLand of the Lost\nFantasy, Adventure, Action\n[\"In this action-adventure tale, a pair of hunters mistakenly come across the Land of the Lost and abduct its princess, intending to sell her off to the highest bidder. However, the princess's secret powers lead to an escape, and soon, two soldiers are on the hunt to save her life.\"]\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Samnao Sudto'], 'Starring': ['Nicky Theerakul', 'Chacha Ulthermate']}\nA delightfully unexpected foreign film fantasy provoking thought on exotic animal trafficking. I wish I could identify the language spoken. It is subtitled in English, however, and the titles roll smoothly in pace with the actions, although sometimes the translations are awkward. I would call it family fare for pre-teens and over, since, in addition to following the subtitles, there is bad language, violence, and scenes which may be stressful for anyone younger than that, despite the fairytale quality of the story. I thoroughly enjoyed it!\nUnexpected\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Wes Anderson'], 'Producers': ['Wes Anderson', 'Scott Rudin', 'Jeremy Dawson', 'Steven Rales'], 'Starring': ['Bryan Cranston', 'Koyu Rankin', 'Edward Norton'], 'Studio': ['Searchlight']}\nReally an enjoyable film. The animation is superb. I am not sure, though, if I would show this to children under 10, as there are some content that might be too scary for them, such as dogs that have been experimented on, the dog fights, shooting at dogs, and murder. Rather violent, but a story very well told.\nGreat for somewhat older children\n{'Audio languages': ['\u4e2d\u6587'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Stephen Chow'], 'Producers': ['Ivy Kong'], 'Starring': ['Deng Chao', 'Lin Yun', 'Show Luo'], 'Studio': ['SONY PICTURES ENTERTAINMENT', 'INC.']}\nThis really was ridiculous to me. After seeing this, I frankly do not understand the hype or the international interest.

I'm a real action fan. I'm also a Jean Reno fan and had noticed Ruby Rose from \"XXX:  Return of Xander Cage\" and \"John Wick\" so I just had to watch this. It's great, with a very solid performance from Ms. Rose. I'm certainly no film expert, but, like I said in the beginning, this, I enjoyed and wanted to keep for my collection!\nWatched it, bought it!\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Cate Shortland'], 'Producers': ['Kevin Feige'], 'Starring': ['David Harbour', 'Olga Kurylenko'], 'Studio': ['Marvel']}\nI liked this movie.
