The David Tennant reinvention of Dr. Who is one of my favorites. The portrayal is so charismatic. I never tire of watching any &#34;Doctor Who&#34; episodes featuring my favorite versions of the Doctor. &#34;The Waters of Mars&#34; is especially poignant and telling as to the Doctor's developing nature. It still hits me every time I watch it.\nReview Title: Poignant\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

The story line is fabulous. I have only gotten to episode 8, but have been engrossed in this plot. Best yet!\nLuv it!\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Michael Nankin', 'Allan Kroeker', 'Andy Wolk', 'Allan Arkush', 'Larry Shaw', 'Omar Madha', 'Scott Stewart', 'Mairzee Almas', 'F\u00e9lix Enr\u00edquez Alcal\u00e1', 'Todd Slavkin'], 'Starring': ['Grant Bowler', 'Grant Bowler', 'Julie Benz'], 'Studio': ['Syfy']}\nI enjoyed watching this series and am truly disappointed that it has been discontinued. Like others have mentioned, it is like a fast-moving Western. These last episodes for me held many surprises. The biggest surprise for me is the Datak character's development. And it is bittersweet that the hero and Doc Yewll find redemption from their guilt through sacrifice and that Nolan gets to fulfill a longstanding wish to travel through space. So there is somewhat closure. Yet I feel like I did after watching &#34;Star Trek: Generations&#34;, or even another SyFy series, &#34;Continuum&#34;. The heros' s get what they hoped for, but not quite: like a wish granted by a Djin.\nBittersweet\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Graeme Harper', 'Euros Lyn', 'Jamie Magnus Stone', 'Douglas Mackinnon', 'Rachel Talalay', 'James Strong', 'Charlie Palmer', 'James Hawes', 'Joe Ahearne', 'Toby Haynes']}\nI've been a &#34;Doctor Who&#34; fan since childhood, and I'm 60 years old now!
