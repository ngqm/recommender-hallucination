Despite the wit and charm brought to their Spiel-speak dialogue by the talented young performers, The Goonies is less a movie than an entertainment machine. --The Globe and Mail, Jay ScottThis is truly a great kids film and great family film. The clever usage of the plot is what will really capture your attention. If not that then the great characters, bits of action, and bits of comedy will catch your eye. --Zilcell\"]\n{'Aspect Ratio': '16:9', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG (Parental Guidance Suggested)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.75 x 5.75 x 0.53 inches; 0.64 Ounces', 'Item model number': '116314', 'Director': 'Richard Donner', 'Media Format': 'NTSC, Multiple Formats, Color, Widescreen, Closed-captioned', 'Run time': '1 hour and 54 minutes', 'Release date': 'January 8, 2008', 'Actors': 'Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, Jeff Cohen, Corey Feldman, Kerri Green', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish, French, Portuguese', 'Producers': 'Richard Donner, Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall, Harvey Bernhard, Kathleen Kennedy', 'Language': 'Unqualified', 'Studio': 'WarnerBrothers', 'Writers': 'Chris Columbus, Steven Spielberg', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nMy favorite movie!!\nAwesome product",
