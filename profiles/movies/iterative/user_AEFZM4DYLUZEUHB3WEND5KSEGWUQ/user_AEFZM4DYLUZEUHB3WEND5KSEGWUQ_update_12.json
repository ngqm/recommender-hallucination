Academy Award(R)-winning director Hayao Miyazaki (2002, Best Animated Feature, SPIRITED AWAY) and legendary filmmaker John Lasseter together with Disney bring to life a heartwarming and imaginative telling of Hans Christian Andersen's classic fairy tale THE LITTLE MERMAID.

Set in a dystopian future in which the income gap is greater than ever, 24 underprivileged youth fight to the death every year in a televised spectacle designed to entertain the rich and give the poor enough hope to quell any further unrest--but not too much, warns Panem president Snow (Donald Sutherland), because that would be \"dangerous.\" Hailing from the same mining town, 16-year-olds Katniss and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson,', 'The Kids Are All Right', \") represent District 12 with the help of escort Effie (an unrecognizable Elizabeth Banks) and mentor Haymitch (a scene-stealing Woody Harrelson).

Hayao Miyazaki\\'s latest triumph, filled with astonishing animation and epic adventure, is a dazzling masterpiece for the ages. It\\'s a \"wonderfully welcoming work of art that\\'s as funny and entertaining as it is brilliant, beautiful, and deep\" (Joe Morgenstern, Wall Street Journal). SPIRITED AWAY is a wondrous fantasy about a young girl, Chihiro, trapped in a strange new world of spirits. When her parents undergo a mysterious transformation, she must call upon the courage she never knew she had to free herself and return her family to the outside world. An unforgettable story brimming with creativity, SPIRITED AWAY will take you on a journey beyond your imagination. \"To enter the world of Hayao Miyazaki is to experience a kind of lighthearted enchantment that is unique to the world of animation\" (Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times). It\\'s a fantastic tale the whole family will want to experience over and over again.~~(c) 2001 Nibariki -- GNDDTM', 'Set Contains:', 'The most interesting extra feature on the two-disc set is the Nippon Television Special on the making of', 'Spirited Away', ', not because it\\'s significantly different from American making-of programs, but because the camera crew was allowed to film Miyazaki at work. It\\'s fascinating to watch the visionary director explaining how individual movements should be animated, and even performing the little dance the frog-master does to welcome the No-Face to Yubaba\\'s bath house. (Old animators describe Walt Disney giving similar performances, but no comparable footage exists.) It\\'s also striking to see how intimate Studio Ghibli is, unencumbered by the tiers of management that burden American studios. The scene comparisons enable the viewer to study the storyboards for the film, which Miyazaki draws himself.
