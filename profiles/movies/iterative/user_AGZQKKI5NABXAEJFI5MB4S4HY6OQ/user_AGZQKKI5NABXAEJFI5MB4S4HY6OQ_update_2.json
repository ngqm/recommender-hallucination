Silverado thus finds its own funky tone--sometimes rousing, sometimes winking. Four cowpokes converge on a little Western burg called Silverado; they're played by Kevin Kline (a distinctly modern kind of Western hero), Scott Glenn, Danny Glover, and the rowdy young Kevin Costner. Kasdan peppers the somewhat generic action with smart dialogue and a parade of quirky supporting players, including John Cleese as a sheriff who seems to have stepped straight from a Monty Python sketch into an Old West saloon. Bruce Broughton supplies the music, a real throwback to the glory days of thundering Western themes. One thing's for sure: Silverado's a lot more fun than the later Kasdan-Costner Western, Wyatt Earp. --Robert Horton\"]\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.32 x 4.19 x 1.12 inches; 6.13 Ounces', 'Director': 'Lawrence Kasdan', 'Release date': 'June 1, 1999', 'Date First Available': 'October 25, 2006', 'Actors': 'Kevin Kline, Scott Glenn, Kevin Costner, Danny Glover, Marvin J.
