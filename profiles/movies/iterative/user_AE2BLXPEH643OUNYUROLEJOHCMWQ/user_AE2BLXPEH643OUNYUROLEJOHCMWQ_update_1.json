The execution was perfect. Charlie Croker pulled off the crime of a lifetime. The one thing that he didn\\'t plan on was being double-crossed.

Mark Wahlberg is electrifying as Croker in this \"fast and furious action-adventure.\" Along with a drop-dead gorgeous safecracker (Charlize Theron), Croker and his team take off to re-steal the loot and end up in a pulse-pounding, pedal-to-the-metal chase that careens up, down and below the streets of Los Angeles.

It wasn't worth it!  It has trouble rewriting quickly during the action scenes.  We actually compared it to the regular DVD that we own and to be honest... it isn't worth the additional expense to purchase the Blu-ray.  Overall, we have noticed that with all of the older movies that have been converted to Blu-ray... they tend to be a disappointment in the blu-ray version for the same rewriting problems.  However, animations are incredible and all of the new movies that have recently been released in the theaters that are just coming out on Blu-Ray are great... like Ironman... that one was incredible on Blu-ray.\nReview Title: Movie is great...
