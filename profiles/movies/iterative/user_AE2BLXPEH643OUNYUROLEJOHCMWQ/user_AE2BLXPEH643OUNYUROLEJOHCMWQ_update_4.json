My complaint and reason for the one star is that it eems Sony got a bit sneaky with this one.  They list a digital copy as part of the set.  I paid more for this set expecting to get the digital copy.  There is one problem... the digital copy only works with a Sony Playstation 3.  It does say this on the back jacket of the disc set.  However, when I ordered it off of Amazon, I had no idea until I opened the package.

It wasn't worth it!  It has trouble rewriting quickly during the action scenes.  We actually compared it to the regular DVD that we own and to be honest... it isn't worth the additional expense to purchase the Blu-ray.  Overall, we have noticed that with all of the older movies that have been converted to Blu-ray... they tend to be a disappointment in the blu-ray version for the same rewriting problems.  However, animations are incredible and all of the new movies that have recently been released in the theaters that are just coming out on Blu-Ray are great... like Ironman... that one was incredible on Blu-ray.\nMovie is great...

Now, he\\x92s on a mission to save the world as a hero who\\x92s built, not born, to be unlike any other. Co-starring Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrence Howard and Jeff Bridges, it\\x92s a fantastic, high-flying journey that is \"hugely entertaining\" (Joe Morgenstern, The Wall Street Journal).', 'Amazon.com', \"You know you're going to get a different kind of superhero when you cast Robert Downey Jr. in the lead role. And\", 'Iron Man', \"is different, in welcome ways. Cleverly updated from Marvel Comics' longstanding series,\", 'Iron Man', \"puts billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (that's Downey) in the path of some Middle Eastern terrorists; in a brilliantly paced section, Stark invents an indestructible suit that allows him to escape. If the rest of the movie never quit hits that precise rhythm again, it nevertheless offers plenty of pleasure, as the renewed Stark swears off his past as a weapons manufacturer, develops his new Iron Man suit, and puzzles both his business partner (Jeff Bridges in great form) and executive assistant (Gwyneth Paltrow). Director Jon Favreau geeks out in fun ways with the hardware, but never lets it overpower the movie, and there's always a goofy one-liner or a slapstick pratfall around to break the tension. As for Downey, he doesn't get to jitterbug around too much in his improv way, but he brings enough of his unpredictable personality to keep the thing fresh. And listen up, hardcore Marvel mavens: even if you know the Stan Lee cameo is coming, you won't be able to guess it until it's on the screen. It all builds to a splendid final scene, with a concluding line delivery by Downey that just feels absolutely right.\", '--Robert Horton', 'Stills from', 'Iron Man', '(Click for larger image)']\n{'Genre': 'Action & Adventure', 'Format': 'Closed-captioned, Color, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Jon Favreau, Robert Downey Jr., Terrence Howard, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1), French (Dolby Digital 5.1), Spanish (Dolby Digital 5.1)', 'Runtime': '2 hours and 5 minutes', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned)', 'Product Dimensions': '6.75 x 5.5 x 0.5 inches; 3.2 Ounces', 'Director': 'Jon Favreau', 'Media Format': 'Closed-captioned, Color, Widescreen', 'Run time': '2 hours and 5 minutes', 'Release date': 'September 30, 2008', 'Actors': 'Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges', 'Dubbed': 'French, Spanish', 'Subtitles': 'English, French, Portuguese, Spanish', 'Studio': 'Paramount', 'Number of discs': '2'}\nThis was an excellent movie... probably one of Robert Downy Jr.'s best.
