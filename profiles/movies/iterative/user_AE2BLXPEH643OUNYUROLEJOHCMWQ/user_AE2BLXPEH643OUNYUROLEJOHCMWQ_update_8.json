The execution was perfect. Charlie Croker pulled off the crime of a lifetime. The one thing that he didn\\'t plan on was being double-crossed. Now he wants more than the job\\'s payoff... he wants payback. Mark Wahlberg is electrifying as Croker in this \"fast and furious action-adventure.\" Along with a drop-dead gorgeous safecracker (Charlize Theron), Croker and his team take off to re-steal the loot and end up in a pulse-pounding, pedal-to-the-metal chase that careens up, down and below the streets of Los Angeles.

It wasn't worth it!  It has trouble rewriting quickly during the action scenes.  We actually compared it to the regular DVD that we own and to be honest... it isn't worth the additional expense to purchase the Blu-ray.  Overall, we have noticed that with all of the older movies that have been converted to Blu-ray... they tend to be a disappointment in the blu-ray version for the same rewriting problems.  However, animations are incredible and all of the new movies that have recently been released in the theaters that are just coming out on Blu-Ray are great... like Ironman... that one was incredible on Blu-ray.\nMovie is great...

If the rest of the movie never quit hits that precise rhythm again, it nevertheless offers plenty of pleasure, as the renewed Stark swears off his past as a weapons manufacturer, develops his new Iron Man suit, and puzzles both his business partner (Jeff Bridges in great form) and executive assistant (Gwyneth Paltrow). Director Jon Favreau geeks out in fun ways with the hardware, but never lets it overpower the movie, and there's always a goofy one-liner or a slapstick pratfall around to break the tension. As for Downey, he doesn't get to jitterbug around too much in his improv way, but he brings enough of his unpredictable personality to keep the thing fresh. And listen up, hardcore Marvel mavens: even if you know the Stan Lee cameo is coming, you won't be able to guess it until it's on the screen.

My complaints are with this Combo set.  This was my first combo DVD/Blu Ray/Digital where it is an ultraviolet digital copy. I must admit that I didn't fully understand the whole \"ULTRAVIOLET\" thing when I purchased it, so I must admit I made some poor assumptions.  All of the past purchases (with the exception of one Sony which would only play if I had a PlayStation) have come with a digital copy I could download to my computer and place on my kid's iPods. But this one... BUYER BEWARE... it only allows you to stream the video through Flixter.  This doesn't help when you're in the car and don't have an internet connection.  I need a digital copy my kids can watch on their iPods while we are traveling in the car.  So, this combo pack is a complete waste of time.  I would have done better to purchase the DVD and burn my own digital copy to the iPods.  I will know better next time.  Also, you have to sign up for a Flixter account and select several required boxes which I did not agree with.  So, this whole marketing scheme they have going is awful!  I will never buy another combo that comes with the ultraviolet digital copy.\nBEWARE OF ULTRAVIOLET... the movie is GREAT.\nReal Genius\nScience Fiction, Comedy, Cerebral, Strange\n['An eccentric group of college student geniuses are recruited to work on the latest generation laser beam - but when they find out the truth behind their experiments, they plot a hilarious revenge!']\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Martha Coolidge'], 'Producers': ['Brian Grazer'], 'Starring': ['Val Kilmer', 'Gabe Jarret', 'William Atherton']}\nI love this film!
