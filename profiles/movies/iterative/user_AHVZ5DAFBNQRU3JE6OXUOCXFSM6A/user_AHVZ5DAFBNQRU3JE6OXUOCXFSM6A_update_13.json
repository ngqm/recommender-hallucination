Along for the chase are a dazzling lineup of Hollywood\\'s brightest stars including Robert Culp, Valerie Harper, Dean Stockwell, Leonard Nimoy, Martin Landau, Marc Singer and more.

Performances by Richard Basehart, Laurence Harvey, Leonard Nimoy, Anne Francis, Anne Baxter, and Mel Ferrer also highlight the season; direction by small-screen stalwarts like Boris Sagal, Jeremy Paul Kagan, and Nicholas Colasanto (\"Coach\" on', 'Cheers', ') and scripts by Stephen Bochco also bring quality and style to the proceedings.
