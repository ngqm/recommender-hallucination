Performances by Richard Basehart, Laurence Harvey, Leonard Nimoy, Anne Francis, Anne Baxter, and Mel Ferrer also highlight the season; direction by small-screen stalwarts like Boris Sagal, Jeremy Paul Kagan, and Nicholas Colasanto (\"Coach\" on', 'Cheers', ') and scripts by Stephen Bochco also bring quality and style to the proceedings.

Vincent, then 40 years old, was still a year or two away from ruining his career with substance abuse problems, but his work here is hardly of Emmy-winning caliber; indeed, it's a lazy performance pretty much devoid of emotional resonance. Borgnine, on the other hand, is always reliable, but even the former Oscar winner (in 1955, for\", 'Marty', \") can't overcome\", 'Airwolf', \"'s procession of cardboard characters (especially the villains) and credulity-challenging scripts, which find our heroes traveling to a Laotian prison camp, battling nuclear terrorists in California, rescuing the president of a South American banana republic, investigating a religious cult, fending off jungle cats kept on a Texas hunting ranch, and saving a country singer from the nefarious machinations of her manager-husband, among other silliness. In fairness, creator-executive producer Donald Bellisario (who also brought us\", 'Magnum, P.I.', ',', 'Quantum Leap', ', and', 'JAG', ') and his team make an effort to inject a human element; there\\'s an episode in which Dominic is arrested for murdering his faithless wife, and a couple that find the guilt-ridden Hawke searching for his brother, Saint John (pronounced \"Sinjin\"), who was presumed lost during the Vietnam War when Stringfellow left him in the jungle.

Nonetheless, low expectations are definitely in order for anyone who wasn't, say, ten years old when the show was on the air.But overall, the show lacks a strong vibe, a recognizable sense of style and pace to draw viewers in and make believers out of us.
