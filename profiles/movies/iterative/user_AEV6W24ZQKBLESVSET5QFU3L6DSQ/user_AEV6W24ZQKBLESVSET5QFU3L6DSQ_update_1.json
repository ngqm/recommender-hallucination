Princesses Anna and Elsa are sisters and the closest friends until one day Elsa discovers that she can no longer control her power to create ice and snow. Terrified for the safety of her sister and everyone around her, Elsa isolates herself and vows to never feel any sort of passionate emotion again in hopes of suppressing her powers. But when Elsa comes of age and is set to be crowned queen, she must open the gates of the palace and let in the public, not to mention her sister Anna. Things go horribly wrong and Anna pursues her sister into the mountains in an attempt to save Elsa and reverse the deep freeze that Elsa has inadvertently released on the kingdom of Arendelle. Along the way, Anna joins forces with Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), an ice seller with a strangely close relationship with his reindeer Sven, and Olaf (Josh Gad), a goofy snowman whom she suddenly remembers from early childhood. In the end, Anna and Elsa discover that only by embracing their deepest feelings do they have a chance of saving themselves and the kingdom. Inspired by \"The Snow Queen\" story by Hans Christian Andersen, the film has plenty of quirky, lovable characters along with a nice blend of corny humor, serious sentiment, suspense, and peril.

I haven't liked a Disney movie since The Fox & The Hound. However, the storyline of Frozen is awesome. At first you think this is going to be another big sister is a monster and poor little sister needs a man to save her and make all her decisions for her. Then you see that big sister is just in need of love and little sister is just in need of her big sister. The cute boy turns into the villian and the regular joe turns into the hottie with a HUGE heart! Plus the snowman is wonderfully loving and encouraging! I love that this fairytale's happy ending is family empowering! I love that this fairytale's happy ending doesn't stomp on any one difference in characters. except the rottenness of a selfish person. I really love this movie and so does my 14yo son!\nReview Title: Not your everyday Disney movie\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
