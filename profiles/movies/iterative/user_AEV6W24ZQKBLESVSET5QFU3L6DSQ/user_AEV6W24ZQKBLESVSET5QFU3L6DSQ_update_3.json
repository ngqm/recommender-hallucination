Princesses Anna and Elsa are sisters and the closest friends until one day Elsa discovers that she can no longer control her power to create ice and snow. Terrified for the safety of her sister and everyone around her, Elsa isolates herself and vows to never feel any sort of passionate emotion again in hopes of suppressing her powers. But when Elsa comes of age and is set to be crowned queen, she must open the gates of the palace and let in the public, not to mention her sister Anna. Things go horribly wrong and Anna pursues her sister into the mountains in an attempt to save Elsa and reverse the deep freeze that Elsa has inadvertently released on the kingdom of Arendelle. Along the way, Anna joins forces with Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), an ice seller with a strangely close relationship with his reindeer Sven, and Olaf (Josh Gad), a goofy snowman whom she suddenly remembers from early childhood. In the end, Anna and Elsa discover that only by embracing their deepest feelings do they have a chance of saving themselves and the kingdom. Inspired by \"The Snow Queen\" story by Hans Christian Andersen, the film has plenty of quirky, lovable characters along with a nice blend of corny humor, serious sentiment, suspense, and peril.

I haven't liked a Disney movie since The Fox & The Hound. However, the storyline of Frozen is awesome. At first you think this is going to be another big sister is a monster and poor little sister needs a man to save her and make all her decisions for her. Then you see that big sister is just in need of love and little sister is just in need of her big sister. The cute boy turns into the villian and the regular joe turns into the hottie with a HUGE heart! Plus the snowman is wonderfully loving and encouraging! I love that this fairytale's happy ending is family empowering! I love that this fairytale's happy ending doesn't stomp on any one difference in characters. except the rottenness of a selfish person. I really love this movie and so does my 14yo son!\nNot your everyday Disney movie\nRemember the Titans (Widescreen Edition)\nDenzel Washington  (Actor),     Will Patton  (Actor),     Boaz Yakin  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Fully Loaded DVDs, DTS\n['Product Description', 'Academy Award(R)-winner Denzel Washington (Best Actor, TRAINING DAY, 2001) gives a victorious performance in this stirring and uplifting film. REMEMBER THE TITANS is a rousing celebration of how a town torn apart by resentment, friction, and mistrust comes together in triumphant harmony. The year is 1971. After leading his team to 15 winning seasons, football coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton) is demoted and replaced by Herman Boone (Washington), tough, opinionated, and as different from the beloved Yoast as he could be. How these two men overcome their differences and turn a group of hostile young men into champions, plays out in a remarkable and triumphant story full of soul and spirit. You and your family will never forget the Titans.', 'Amazon.com', \"With only one major star (Denzel Washington), an appealing cast of fresh unknowns, and a winning emphasis of substance over self-indulgent style, Boaz Yakin's\", 'Remember the Titans', 'is, like', 'Rudy', 'before it, a football movie that will be fondly remembered by anyone who sees it.', \"Set in Alexandria, Virginia, in 1971, the fact-based story begins with the integration of black and white students at T. C. Williams High School. This effort to improve race relations is most keenly felt on the school's football team, the Titans, and bigoted tempers flare when a black head coach (Washington) is appointed and his victorious predecessor (Will Patton) reluctantly stays on as his assistant. It's affirmative action at its most potentially volatile, complicated by the mandate that the coach will be fired if he loses a single game in the Titans' 13-game season. The players represent a hotbed of racial tension, but as the team struggles toward unity and gridiron glory,\", 'Remember the Titans', 'builds on several subplots and character dynamics to become an inspirational drama of', 'Rocky', '-like proportions.', 'Yakin--whose debut,', 'Fresh', \", was one of the best independent films of the 1990s--understands the value of connecting small scenes to form a rich climactic payoff. Likewise, Washington provides a solid dramatic foundation (his coach is obsessively harsh, but for all the right reasons) while giving his younger co-stars ample time in the spotlight. The result is a film that achieves what it celebrates: an enriching sense of unity that's unquestionably genuine.
