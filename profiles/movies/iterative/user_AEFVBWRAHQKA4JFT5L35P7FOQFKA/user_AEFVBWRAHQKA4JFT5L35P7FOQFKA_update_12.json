A man of scientific progress as well as devout Catholicism, Murdoch (Yannick Bisson) approaches mysteries with such new, state-of-the-art techniques as fingerprinting, blood-testing, and trace evidence, collaborating closely with his department's pathologist, Dr. Julia Ogden (H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Joy). Working under the skeptical Inspector Brackenreid (Thomas Craig), an old-school copper who respects his lead investigator's results but has little patience for his complex methods, Murdoch often encounters new-fangled technology that, in time, will pave the way for such 20th-century staples as radio, television and the electronic grid. At the same time, the faith element in Murdoch's view of the world allows him to be something more than a complete rationalist. His occasional reliance on a medium (Maria del Mar) to help him discover clues, and his church-derived ethics are all part of Murdoch's approach to an increasingly complicated world.\", 'The first episode in', 'Murdoch Mysteries: Season One', 'is an excellent template for all 13 shows in this boxed set. \"Power\" finds Murdoch trying to discover how and why a woman was killed during a demonstration of the \"evils\" of alternating-current-derived electricity put on by a direct-current power company. Murdoch\\'s queries put him in touch with Nikola Tesla, the real-life father of the AC motor. \"The Glass Ceiling\" pits Murdoch\\'s scientific techniques against the more brutal approach of his boss, Brackenreid, who seems to be the target of a killer linked to an old case. \"Elementary, My Dear Murdoch\" somewhat inevitably pairs Murdoch in a murder investigation with one of his idols, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, whose faith in such spiritualist pursuits as seances complicates things. (Doyle returns in a later episode, \"Belly Speaker,\" again proving more of a meddler than a help in a case involving a mad ventriloquist.) \"Bad Medicine\" is a scary story about a hooded archer killing off the patients at a clinic for advanced brain study. (The aforementioned medium has unnerving visions of Murdoch becoming one of the murderer\\'s victims.)
