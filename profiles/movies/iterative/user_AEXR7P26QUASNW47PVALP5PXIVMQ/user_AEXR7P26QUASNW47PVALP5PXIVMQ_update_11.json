Age + laziness set in.  I needed to lose weight as my BP was out of sight.  Walking outside in WA state is tough with the rain.  I have a treadmill in the garage and was dreadfully bored.  I pulled out Leslie's old videos.  I decided to look at her new items.  I ordered several and have been amazing surprised at what she is doing now!!!  I am excited about the purchases and have been doing them everyday and eating better.  It is still early but I am focused and excited exercising with the people in the DVDs.  Somehow it is better than walking alone outside or on the treadmill.  I will throw those two in from time to time.  I was excited to see the 80-year-old doing it with the group!!!  I turn 80 in Feb and can still do all the videos so far.  My daughter, who is a nurse, says I am in better shape than many of her 60-year-old patients in the cardiac floor.  This despite taking a long hiatus from doing exercise and eating right.  I am back in the saddle and loving Leslie.  Great job, Leslie\nReview Title: Bravo Leslie Sansone\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
