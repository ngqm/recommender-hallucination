I feel like there are so many EXCELLENT and AMAZING under the radar teen movies that deserve Oscar credit than this mediocre film like Edge of Seventeen or even more recently Love, Simon.<br />Lady Bird tries to do much in one movie without a general vision. The character meanders and is often awful. I hate the relationship she has with her mom and her best friend. She treats everyone horribly.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:<br /><br />At the end, there is no life lessons learned by the main character; however, she becomes lonely and instead cow-tows to her mom, who was verbally abusive to her in the entire movie. That is a horrible lesson for any teen or any one else to take away from this movie. This character should have dropped her mom like it is hot and realized that she is better off without her belittling her all of the time and yelling in her face and demeaning her. I don't understand why this movie got so much buzz when the Edge of Seventeen deals with the tension between a mother and daughter in a much more mature and well-developed way. This movie leaves a lot to be desired.\nReview Title: Why the Oscar Buzz? You can do much better for a movie tonight!\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
