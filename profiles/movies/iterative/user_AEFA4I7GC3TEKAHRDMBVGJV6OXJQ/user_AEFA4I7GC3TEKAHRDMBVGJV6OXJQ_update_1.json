The shooting itself took place at the end of the previous season, but the ripple effect is strong this time out, as the usual banter between the brilliant but somewhat clueless Maura (Rizzoli calls her \"the dumbest genius I know\") and the more roughhewn and street-wise Jane takes on a decidedly nasty, if still amusing, edge for the first couple of episodes (Maura: \"Drive straight past the coniferous spruce.\" Jane: \"Sure, maybe I\\'ll pass the hemlock, too\"). The repartee continues throughout the season, as the pair trade witty bons mots while they and the other cops are solving various murder cases, some of them gripping (human trafficking, a serial killer) and others laughably absurd (two brothers in a rock group kill their third bro, who\\'s also a member, thinking it will boost the band\\'s record sales; an ex-Army Ranger turned yoga guru garrotes a young environmentalist who was on to his sinister oil-fracking scheme). Looming large over all of these scenarios are Rizzoli and Isles\\' crazily tangled family dramas. Aside from her gangster father, Maura has a birth mother (a doctor played by Sharon Lawrence) who thinks she\\'s dead and doesn\\'t react well when informed otherwise. Then there\\'s Jane\\'s dad (a cameo by Chazz Palminteri), who wants estranged wife Angela (Lorraine Bracco in a recurring role) to grant him an annulment so he can marry a much younger woman--who just happens to have had an affair with Tommy (Colin Egglesfield), Jane\\'s brother. Throw in the two leads\\' various romantic entanglements, and you\\'ve got a show that\\'s as much supermarket tabloid as cop drama. So', 'Rizzoli & Isles', \"isn't as hard core as, say,\", 'Southland', \".
