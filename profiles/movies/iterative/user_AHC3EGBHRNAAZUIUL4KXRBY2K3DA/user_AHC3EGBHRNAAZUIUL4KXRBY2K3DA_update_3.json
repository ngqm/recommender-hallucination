This is the captivating saga of a musical family that homesteads in the Dakota Territory of the 1880s and becomes embroiled in the presidential battle between Grover Cleveland and Benjamin Harrison. A robust, song-filled movie for those who enjoy a good love story, admire a family that sticks together through thick and thin, or respond to rousing, Broadway-style music ... composed by the Academy Award(R) winning Sherman Brothers (1964 Best Score, Best Original Song, MARY POPPINS).|Goldie \"Jean\" Hawn plays a bit part in this 1968 film, which also features her future significant other, Kurt Russell.', 'Amazon.com', '\"All I know is, the Democrats elected a president, and the Republicans cheated \\'em out of it!\" No, this is not a Michael Moore documentary, but a 1968 Disney musical.', 'The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band', 'is probably the best musical comedy set against the 1888 presidential campaign between Grover Cleveland and Benjamin Harrison. The family band, a bit like American prairie Von Trapps, settles in the Dakota territory. Problem is, Grandpappy Walter Brennan is a diehard Democrat, and Dakota is rife with Republicans, including the suitor (John Davidson at his dimpledest) to his granddaughter (Lesley Ann Warren). The score by the Sherman brothers is not their best, and the \"family fare\" approach almost killed Disney films during this era.
