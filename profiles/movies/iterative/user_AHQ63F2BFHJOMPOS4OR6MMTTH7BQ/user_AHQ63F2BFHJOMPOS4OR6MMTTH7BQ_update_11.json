This is a GREAT  story.  I love the blend of city and country settings, I like the characters, and I want to know what happens to brothers, cousins, and grandparents.  More, more, more please !!\nI Want To Know What's Next\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'sexual content'], 'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Niall MacCormick'], 'Producers': ['Helen Gregory'], 'Studio': ['Amazon Studios']}\nI recently read many of Trollope' s novels and was thrilled to see that a theatrical adaptation was available.  Yes the movie has some slight changes, but it is a great representation of Trollope' s work.  If you have not exposed yourself to his writing, it can be confusing at first, but all is made clear by the conclusion.  The movie was the same.  I felt as if I read the book for a second time.  Excellent\nLike Both Book and Movie\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium', 'Espa\u00f1ol', 'Deutsch'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', 'Deutsch', 'Espa\u00f1ol'], 'Directors': ['Alex Zakrzewski', 'Ernest R.

Now she has me hooked on the series.

Bosch seems approachable but intense.  I enjoy that the Bosch in the novels and in the Amazon series are not exactly alike but very closely related.  Even if my Bosch novel character differs in my mind a bit from the Amazon Bosch, both represent an exceptional excellence in writing.  I don't watch much cable or network television but save my time for reading and Amazon series !!\nBosch Bosch Bosch\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['David Duchovny'], 'Producers': ['Richard B. Lewis', 'Bob Yari', 'Jane Rosenthal'], 'Starring': ['Anton Yelchin', 'T\u00e9a Leoni', 'David Duchovny'], 'Studio': ['tribecashortlist']}\nAs I was watching this film, I was watching through the lives of the actors in real life.  It's touching how through the death in the film, life was lived.  As the actors have subsequently died, divorced, grew, changed, life continues and changes.  If I watched this film after it came out, I would have had a different perspective.  I am glad I ran across it now because it is so appropriate.\nIn The Light of Their Lives\n{'Content advisory': ['Alcohol use', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Mark Pellington'], 'Producers': [\"Kirk D'Amico\", 'Anne-Marie MacKay', 'Mark Pellington'], 'Starring': ['Shirley MacLaine', 'Amanda Seyfried', 'AnnJewel Lee Dixon'], 'Studio': ['BLEECKER STREET FILMS']}\nWe all know or have known one older person that seems to a pain in everyone's backside.  You might be that curmudgeon that people are polite, seemingly interested but melt away once your head is turned.  People, even bitchy old people can make a difference.  Listen to what they mean, not just what they say.  And they need to listen to themselves so that they might impart wisdom to the finale.  McClain is superb. Highly recommended.  Warning of foul language but I take that over a non violent, non graphically pictorial of sexual encounters.\nAppreciate the Curmudgeon\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', 'Fran\u00e7ais'], 'Directors': ['Tyler Perry'], 'Producers': ['Tyler Perry', 'Reuben Cannon'], 'Starring': ['Tyler Perry', 'Derek Luke', 'Keshia Knight Pulliam'], 'Studio': ['LIONSGATE']}\nGood movie.  Love the big with Dr Phil. Love the out take during the credits.  Tyler Perry might be getting tired of playing Madea but I will always love that old fart.\nI Love Madea\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Jon Favreau'], 'Producers': ['Jon Favreau', 'Sergei Bespalov'], 'Starring': ['Jon Favreau', 'Sofia Vergara', 'John Leguizamo'], 'Studio': ['Open Road Films']}\nI enjoyed the characters, plot, and various messages in the film.
