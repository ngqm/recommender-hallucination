  "reference_summary": "{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Richard Standeven'], 'Producers': ['Gub Neal'], 'Starring': ['Robbie Coltrane', 'Ricky Tomlinson', 'Dennis Philby'], 'Studio': ['Acorn Media']}\nRight in line with others in this series.  Great writing and great acting.  A vintage retrospective look at British Hong Kong at the time of the handover to China also.\nCrime in Hong Kong\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Antonia Bird'], 'Producers': ['ITV'], 'Starring': ['Robbie Coltrane', 'Barbara Flynn', 'Geraldine Somerville'], 'Studio': ['Acorn TV']}\nThis story is that of a British vet with 3 tours in Ulster under its belt.  He has lost mates and is suffering from PTSD.  The anti-American comments and moments are from his point of view.  As Fitz says, understandable but not justified.  I find the other reviewers a bit thin skinned.  If they had complained about the believability of the vet going off the rails, that would have been more valid in my opinion.\nNot that bloody awful if you watch the whole thing\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['David Carson', 'Michael Grossman', 'Michael Robison', 'Jim Contner'], 'Producers': ['David Simkins', 'Robert Hewitt Wolfe', 'Nicolas Cage'], 'Starring': ['Paul Blackthorne', 'Valerie Cruz', 'Terrence Mann'], 'Studio': ['Lionsgate']}\nIf you read and loved the books, you are likely to be disappointed.  But if you view this series with fresh eyes and without preconceptions, it's quite good.  Settle back and enjoy!\nTake it as a fresh look\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Dan Reed', 'Marc Jobst', 'Sarah Harding'], 'Producers': ['Chris Burt', 'Damien Timmer', 'Kate McKerrell', 'Michele Buck', 'Rebecca Eaton', 'Ted Childs'], 'Starring': ['Clare Holman', 'Kevin Whately', 'Laurence Fox'], 'Studio': ['PBS']}\nIf you liked Morse and Lewis, you will like Lewis and Hathaway.
