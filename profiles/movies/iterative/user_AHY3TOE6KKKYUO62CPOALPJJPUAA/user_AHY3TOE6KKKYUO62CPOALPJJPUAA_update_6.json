Based on the true story of how the television signal made it from the moon to all those TV sets worldwide back in July 1969 -- thanks to a wonderful facility in Parkes, Australia.

Great writing and great acting.  A vintage retrospective look at British Hong Kong at the time of the handover to China also.\nCrime in Hong Kong\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Antonia Bird'], 'Producers': ['ITV'], 'Starring': ['Robbie Coltrane', 'Barbara Flynn', 'Geraldine Somerville'], 'Studio': ['Acorn TV']}\nThis story is that of a British vet with 3 tours in Ulster under its belt.  He has lost mates and is suffering from PTSD.  The anti-American comments and moments are from his point of view.  As Fitz says, understandable but not justified.  I find the other reviewers a bit thin skinned.  If they had complained about the believability of the vet going off the rails, that would have been more valid in my opinion.\nNot that bloody awful if you watch the whole thing\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['David Carson', 'Michael Grossman', 'Michael Robison', 'Jim Contner'], 'Producers': ['David Simkins', 'Robert Hewitt Wolfe', 'Nicolas Cage'], 'Starring': ['Paul Blackthorne', 'Valerie Cruz', 'Terrence Mann'], 'Studio': ['Lionsgate']}\nIf you read and loved the books, you are likely to be disappointed.  But if you view this series with fresh eyes and without preconceptions, it's quite good.

Lewis has grown since his time with Morse and following the death of his wife.  Hathaway as the erstwhile Cambridge theologian is a wonderful foil to Lewis.

It charges quickly with the USB cable.  The instructions say it should be able to hook up with your computer if attached by the USB cable, but I have only been able to get it to connect to my aging 2008 MacBook Pro by using the Bluetooth connection.  It pairs excellently with my iPhone and iPad also.  A total treat for this Whovian.<br /><br />In a comment to another post I listed all the episodes included in the three disk set, and I am repeating this info below as it is not included in the item information by Amazon.  I am giving this only 4 stars because the DVD set arrived with the middle piece to one of the DVD holders half broken, making it impossible to securely stow one of them when not in use.
