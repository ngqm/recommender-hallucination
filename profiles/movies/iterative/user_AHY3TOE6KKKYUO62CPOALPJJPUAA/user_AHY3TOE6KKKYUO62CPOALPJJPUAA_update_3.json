Great writing and great acting.  A vintage retrospective look at British Hong Kong at the time of the handover to China also.\nCrime in Hong Kong\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Antonia Bird'], 'Producers': ['ITV'], 'Starring': ['Robbie Coltrane', 'Barbara Flynn', 'Geraldine Somerville'], 'Studio': ['Acorn TV']}\nThis story is that of a British vet with 3 tours in Ulster under its belt.  He has lost mates and is suffering from PTSD.  The anti-American comments and moments are from his point of view.  As Fitz says, understandable but not justified.  I find the other reviewers a bit thin skinned.  If they had complained about the believability of the vet going off the rails, that would have been more valid in my opinion.\nNot that bloody awful if you watch the whole thing\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['David Carson', 'Michael Grossman', 'Michael Robison', 'Jim Contner'], 'Producers': ['David Simkins', 'Robert Hewitt Wolfe', 'Nicolas Cage'], 'Starring': ['Paul Blackthorne', 'Valerie Cruz', 'Terrence Mann'], 'Studio': ['Lionsgate']}\nIf you read and loved the books, you are likely to be disappointed.
