I was on active duty in the Navy in the midst of the Cold War, which always seemed to leave us on the knife\u2019s edge between peace and war. Everyone should see this, especially the politicians, most of whom seem totally ignorant of the effects of playing chicken with nuclear weapons. This will scare the beejeezus out of you. As well it should.\nReview Title: By the time the missiles fly, it is too late....\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

He has lost mates and is suffering from PTSD.  The anti-American comments and moments are from his point of view.  As Fitz says, understandable but not justified.

It charges quickly with the USB cable.

It pairs excellently with my iPhone and iPad also.

I am giving this only 4 stars because the DVD set arrived with the middle piece to one of the DVD holders half broken, making it impossible to securely stow one of them when not in use.

And its unconventional Aussie crew and its by-the-book NASA supervisor from the U.S. have very different ideas about how to fix it.
