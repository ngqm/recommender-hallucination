Great writing and great acting.

He has lost mates and is suffering from PTSD.  The anti-American comments and moments are from his point of view.  As Fitz says, understandable but not justified.  I find the other reviewers a bit thin skinned.  If they had complained about the believability of the vet going off the rails, that would have been more valid in my opinion.\nNot that bloody awful if you watch the whole thing\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['David Carson', 'Michael Grossman', 'Michael Robison', 'Jim Contner'], 'Producers': ['David Simkins', 'Robert Hewitt Wolfe', 'Nicolas Cage'], 'Starring': ['Paul Blackthorne', 'Valerie Cruz', 'Terrence Mann'], 'Studio': ['Lionsgate']}\nIf you read and loved the books, you are likely to be disappointed.  But if you view this series with fresh eyes and without preconceptions, it's quite good.

Lewis has grown since his time with Morse and following the death of his wife.  Hathaway as the erstwhile Cambridge theologian is a wonderful foil to Lewis.

It charges quickly with the USB cable.  The instructions say it should be able to hook up with your computer if attached by the USB cable, but I have only been able to get it to connect to my aging 2008 MacBook Pro by using the Bluetooth connection.  It pairs excellently with my iPhone and iPad also.  A total treat for this Whovian.<br /><br />In a comment to another post I listed all the episodes included in the three disk set, and I am repeating this info below as it is not included in the item information by Amazon.  I am giving this only 4 stars because the DVD set arrived with the middle piece to one of the DVD holders half broken, making it impossible to securely stow one of them when not in use.

And its unconventional Aussie crew and its by-the-book NASA supervisor from the U.S. have very different ideas about how to fix it. A culture clash of cosmic proportions erupts in this fact-based tale of how the biggest televised event in history was almost not televised.

Shrouded in secrecy, the picturesque town is actually a community of scientific geniuses secretly relocated by the government to conduct top-secret research. This hit series smartly roots itself in reality, as the drama of the townsfolk stems from life's myriad of everyday challenges. But with the population's unique talents, troubled psyches and limitless resources, these small-town concerns have a way of becoming big-time problems. It is at that intersection, where human frailty and super-science collide - that Eureka begins.

It is from Germany and comes with a choice not only audio tracks in your choice of English, French, and German, but also visual subtitles that can be selected separately from the audio, that is you can watch with English audio but have subtitles in German or French or English (or none at all). And it plays great on my Sony US BluRay DVD player.<br /><br />Comes as a set of 18 disks with bonus materials.  If you would like a great series packaged in a great set, buy this one!<br /><br />Note that this takes a long while for delivery (made it two days after its latest predicted arrival) as it is sold by a third party and is shipped from Germany.\nEUREKA!!!!
