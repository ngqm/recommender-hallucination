He has lost mates and is suffering from PTSD.  The anti-American comments and moments are from his point of view.  As Fitz says, understandable but not justified.  I find the other reviewers a bit thin skinned.  If they had complained about the believability of the vet going off the rails, that would have been more valid in my opinion.\nReview Title: Not that bloody awful if you watch the whole thing\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
