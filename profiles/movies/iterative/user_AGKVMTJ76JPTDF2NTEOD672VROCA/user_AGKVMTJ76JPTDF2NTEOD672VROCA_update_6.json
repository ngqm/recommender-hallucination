Not everything goes as planned and Bond decides to investigate, independently of the MI6 agency, in order to track down the rest of the terrorist cell. Following a lead to the Bahamas, he encounters Dimitrios and his girlfriend, Solange. He learns that Dimitrios is involved with Le Chiffre, banker to the world's terrorist organizations. Secret Service intelligence reveals that Le Chiffre is planning to raise money in a high-stakes poker game in Montenegro at Le Casino Royale. MI6 assigns 007 to play against him, knowing that if Le Chiffre loses, it will destroy his organization. 'M' places Bond under the watchful eye of the beguiling Vesper Lynd. At first skeptical of what value Vesper can provide, Bond's interest in her deepens as they brave danger together--and even torture at the hands of Le Chiffre. In Montenegro, Bond allies himself with Matthis, MI6's local field agent, and Felix Leiter, who is representing the interests of the CIA. The marathon game proceeds with dirty tricks and violence, raising the stakes beyond blood money and reaching a terrifying climax.\"]\n{'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Blu-ray, AC-3, Color, Dolby, DTS Surround Sound, Dubbed, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Eva Green, Jesper Christensen, Mads Mikkelsen, Giancarlo Giannini, Ivana Milicevic, Simon Abkarian, Martin Campbell, Jeffrey Wright, Caternia Murino, Isaach De Bankol\u00e9, Judi Dench, Daniel CraigEva Green, Jesper Christensen, Mads Mikkelsen, Giancarlo Giannini, Ivana Milicevic, Simon Abkarian, Martin Campbell, Jeffrey Wright, Caternia Murino, Isaach De Bankol\u00e9, Judi Dench, Daniel Craig  See more', 'Language': 'English (DTS 5.1), French (Mono), Spanish (Mono)', 'Runtime': '2 hours and 24 minutes', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned)', 'Product Dimensions': '5.3 x 0.5 x 6.7 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Director': 'Martin Campbell', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Blu-ray, AC-3, Color, Dolby, DTS Surround Sound, Dubbed, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Run time': '2 hours and 24 minutes', 'Release date': 'October 23, 2012', 'Actors': 'Daniel Craig, Eva Green, Judi Dench, Mads Mikkelsen, Jeffrey Wright', 'Dubbed': 'French, Spanish', 'Subtitles': 'English, French, Spanish', 'Studio': 'MGM (Video & DVD)', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nGreat movie.
