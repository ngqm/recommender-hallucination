Based on a novel that\u2019s often called Japan\u2019s Gone with the Wind, this sweeping saga fictionalizes the life of the legendary seventeenth-century swordsman (and writer and artist) Musashi Miyamoto, following him on his path from unruly youth to enlightened warrior.

When the young sisters are found alive in a decrepit cabin, their uncle (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Game of Thrones) and his girlfriend (Oscar\u00ae nominee Jessica Chastain, Zero Dark Thirty) take them in.

(How many times can a little girl ferally scuttling around the edges of the frame be scary? Quite a few, actually.) Beginning with a literal Once Upon a Time, director-cowriter Andr\u00e9s Muschietti's film concerns a pair of young girls left stranded in a creepy cabin in the woods after a family tragedy. When they are miraculously found intact five years later, they credit their survival to a mysterious mother figure. As their reluctant new riot girl guardian (Chastain) soon discovers, this protective entity has a murderous case of separation anxiety. Muschietti's project (devised with his sister Barbara) had its genesis as a widely YouTubed three-minute short film, and the elongation seams do occasionally show, particularly in the third act, when characters begin appearing for the express purpose of being munched. Still, even if it doesn't all hang together,\", 'Mama', \"has no shortage of champion scary moments, expertly designed for maximum freak-out. (An early scene involving a supernatural game of tug of war hits just the right mark between nervous laughter and serious goose bump territory.)
