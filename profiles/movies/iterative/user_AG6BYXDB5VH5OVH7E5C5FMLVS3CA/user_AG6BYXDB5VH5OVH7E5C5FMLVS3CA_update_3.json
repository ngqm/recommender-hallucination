Brown, John Fife, Jim Shane, Lisa Kingston, Kevin Costner', 'Studio': 'Prism/IRC'}\nI buy all of Kevin's movies, so this one was a must buy, seeing as he is on the cover. I watched it, he is on two scenes MAX. They just have him on a cover to help sell the movie. I barely remember anything from this movie, so unless you're a fan of the kid in the movie, I wouldn't get it for Kevin Costner.\nNothing memorable\nJust My Luck\nComedy, Fantasy, Cerebral, Fantastic\n[\"Manhattanite Ashley is known to many as the luckiest woman around. After a chance encounter with a down-and-out young man, however, she realizes that she's swapped her fortune for his.\"]\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Donald Petrie'], 'Producers': ['Arnold Rifkin', 'Bruce Willis', 'Arnon Milchan'], 'Starring': ['Lindsay Lohan', 'Chris Pine', 'Samaire Armstrong']}\nSecond time I have seen this. It's predictable to some degree but cute if you like Chris or Lindsay. I've always been a fan of her as an actress and musician. Chris is just adorable and does well with Lindsay in this. Worth a rent.\ncute movie\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Kevin Altieri', 'Boyd Kirkland', 'Frank Paur', 'Dan Riba', 'Dick Sebast', 'Bruce Timm', 'Eric Radomski', 'Kent Butterworth'], 'Producers': ['Alan Burnett', 'Eric Radomski', 'Bruce Timm'], 'Starring': ['Kevin Conroy', 'Efrem Zimbalist', 'Jr.', 'Loren Lester']}\nThe only batman I watch\nFive Stars",
