The price was fair on amazon so I immediately jumped on buying a copy. I did not know much about John Paul DeJoria except he was with Paul Mitchell Hair. This dvd is well edited and very entertaining. It's about an hour, maybe a little over. John Paul's life of &#34;rags to riches&#34; and ending up a philanthropic billionaire with a heart of gold was so heart warming to see. I shared this with several people who enjoyed it as well.\nReview Title: Heart warming !\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
