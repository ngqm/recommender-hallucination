The son of Greek immigrants, born into humble beginnings in East Los Angeles, John Paul DeJoria has built a life full of good fortune and achieved vast wealth through a variety of businesses, among them John Paul Mitchell Hair Care Systems and Patron Tequila.In 1980, he partnered with Paul Mitchell to start a line of professional hair care products. They turned a $700 investment and 3 products into a wildly successful venture that today is worth more than $800 million. Proving his success wasn't just a fluke, John Paul then created the largest and the most recognizable tequila brand in the world - Patron.GOOD FORTUNE focuses on DeJoria's inspiring success story as well as his philanthropy. It's the true tale of a man who overcame obstacles and dedicates his life to giving back to those less fortunate. He ran through his early adulthood in and out of motorcycle gangs and today John Paul's quest is finding innovative ways to share his sizable fortune. DeJoria spends his life creating back-to-work programs for the homeless, fighting whale poachers in the Arctic and working on over 100 other philanthropic ventures. Along with Bill Gates and Warren Buffet DeJoria signed 'The Giving Pledge,' a formal promise to continue to contribute more than half of their wealth to philanthropy or charitable causes during their lifetime or in their will.Dan Aykroyd narrates the film spinning colorful stories with humor and wit. GOOD FORTUNE is an incredibly powerful and noble narrative that gives an informative and entertaining picture of this self-made billionaire and verifiable poster boy of the American dream.\"]\n{'Genre': 'Special Interests', 'Format': 'NTSC', 'Contributor': 'John Paul DeJoria, Josh Tickell, Dan Aykroyd, Arianna Huffington, Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin, Rebecca Harrell TickellJohn Paul DeJoria, Josh Tickell, Dan Aykroyd, Arianna Huffington, Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin, Rebecca Harrell Tickell  See more', 'Language': 'English', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 26 minutes', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'Director': 'Josh Tickell, Rebecca Harrell Tickell', 'Media Format': 'NTSC', 'Run time': '1 hour and 26 minutes', 'Release date': 'July 14, 2017', 'Actors': 'John Paul DeJoria, Dan Aykroyd, Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin, Arianna Huffington', 'Studio': 'Audio Fidelity', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nI heard about this dvd on The Garry Meier podcast out of Chicago. The price was fair on amazon so I immediately jumped on buying a copy. I did not know much about John Paul DeJoria except he was with Paul Mitchell Hair. This dvd is well edited and very entertaining. It's about an hour, maybe a little over. John Paul's life of &#34;rags to riches&#34; and ending up a philanthropic billionaire with a heart of gold was so heart warming to see. I shared this with several people who enjoyed it as well.\nHeart warming !\nDynasty\nDrama, Romance\n[\"The 9th and final season of the primetime soap begins as Alexis is comforted by Dex's solace and friendship and the two renew their passionate love for each other.

This movie stars Miley Cyrus who goes undercover as a student joining a sorority. It's a similar premise to Miss Congeniality. It's predictable and geared towards teens/college age IMO. Well cast and worth checking out for Miley or Jeremy or New Orleans. The third male lead, I forget his name, he was in the TV show Revenge.\nEntertaining\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Taylor Sheridan'], 'Producers': ['Kevin Costner', 'David Glasser', 'Art Linson'], 'Starring': ['Kevin Costner', 'Luke Grimes', 'Kelly Reilly'], 'Studio': ['PARAMOUNTTV']}\nBeautiful scenery. I'm excited to see where the rest off this series goes. Kevin Costner is a perfect older cowboy!!  Not FYI not PG /family appropriate. High amount of F word and a somewhat gratuitous sex scene. I'm not a fan of the daughter, too harsh and vulgar.<br />I watched this on Amazon. No issues.\nKevin Costner is the best!!!\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['David Steinberg'], 'Producers': ['Robinne Lee', 'Eric Hayes', 'Keetgi Kogan', 'M. Elizabeth Hughes'], 'Starring': ['Robinne Lee', 'Dule Hill', 'Gabrielle Union'], 'Studio': ['Viacom']}\nI've been watching Psych on Amazon so I saw this pop up with Dule Hill and thought I would check it out to see how he was in a different format. He was much the same in this as he is on Psych. Also I kept expecting him to be the love interest but no it's Joel from Parenthood played by Sam Jaeger. Dule has a short scene and he shares a large part of the movie cover and Sam who is  second most scenes is not even on the cover. Gabrielle Union is well known and also on he cover as is the cheating boyfriend in this movie. I am glad to see I am not the only one who noticed and commented on this misleading picture!!<br />I did enjoy this movie a lot more than I expected. Sam Jaeger is the best part of this movie and kept me watching until the end.\nbetter than expected\nDestination Wedding [DVD]\nWinona Ryder  (Actor),     Keanu Reeves  (Actor),     Victor Levin  (Director, Writer)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Comedy\n[\"The smart, witty, intimate modern romance Destination Wedding reunites two of cinema's most adored stars, Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder, as the socially awkward Frank and Lindsay.
