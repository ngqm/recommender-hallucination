  "reference_summary": "The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest (English Dubbed)\nSuspense, Drama, Biting, Gritty\n[\"THE GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNET'S NEST is the third and final film adaptation of the best-selling Millennium trilogy written by the late Swedish author, Stieg Larsson (The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and The Girl Who Played With Fire). In this last installment, Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) lies in critical condition, a bullet wound to her head, in the intensive care unit of a Swedish city hospital. She's fighting for her life in more ways than one: if and when she recovers, she'll be taken back to Stockholm to stand trial for three murders. With the help of her friend, journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist), she will not only have to prove her innocence, but also identify and denounce those in authority who have allowed the vulnerable, like herself, to suffer abuse and violence. And, on her own, she will plot revenge - against the man who tried to kill her, and the corrupt government institutions that very nearly destroyed her life. THE GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNET'S NEST brings back Noomi Rapace in the starring role of the pierced and tattooed genius computer hacker Lisbeth Salander, Michael Nyqvist as Mikael Blomkvist, the crusading journalist and publisher of the magazine Millennium, and Lena Endre (Erika Berger) the editor of the magazine and Blomkvist's occasional lover.\"]\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Daniel Alfredson'], 'Producers': ['Klaus Bassiner', 'Susann Billberg-Rydholm', 'Gunnar Carlsson', 'Anni Faurbye Fernandez', 'Wolfgang Feindt', 'Jenny Gilbertsson', 'Lone Korslund', 'Jon Mankell', 'Peter Nadermann', 'Ole S\u00f8ndberg', 'S\u00f8ren St\u00e6rmose', 'Mikael Wallen'], 'Starring': ['Michael Nyqvist', 'Noomi Rapace', 'Lena Endre']}\nThese are not the types of Movies I normally watch  - however sometimes a dose of drama, reality, and tough life are good for those of us who are unaware of this kind of suffering. I told my adult children they should watch it. I came to appreciate the great strength and struggles of Lisbet. It is important to know there are women who suffer this kind of abuse - some not so terribly violent - but still disturbing. Loved how she \"kicked butt\" in this finale.\nA necessary disturbance\n{'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Robert Stromberg'], 'Producers': ['Joe Roth'], 'Starring': ['Angelina Jolie', 'Sharlto Copley', 'Elle Fanning']}\nUnexpected\ncreative\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['James Gunn'], 'Producers': ['Kevin Feige'], 'Starring': ['Chris Pratt', 'Zoe Saldana', 'Dave Bautista'], 'Studio': ['BUENA VISTA PAY TELEVISION']}\nFun\nenjoyed",
