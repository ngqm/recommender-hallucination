Comedy superstars Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade and Rob Schneider are at their hilarious and outrageous best playing childhood friends who reunite one holiday weekend to relive the good old days. It doesn\u2019t matter that these five guys are now respectable businessmen, husbands and fathers. Once they get back together, nothing is going to stop these kids-at-heart from having the time of their adult lives. From the people who brought you', 'Click', ', comes this hilarious and heartwarming film that proves men will be boys.', 'Amazon.com', 'Adam Sandler and his frequent costars (Chris Rock, Kevin James, David Spade, and Rob Schneider) grope blindly for maturity in the genial comedy', 'Grown Ups', \". Five childhood pals are drawn back together after the death of their former basketball coach; over the course of a Fourth of July weekend, they--along with their wildly attractive wives (played by Salma Hayek, Maria Bello, Maya Rudolph) and precocious children--loosen up, try to introduce their kids to the simple pleasures of nature, air some dirty laundry, and rediscover their friendship. In other words, it's a fairly formulaic comedy that veers awkwardly from gags (ranging from slapstick to mean-spiritedness) to sentiment (ranging from sappy to not entirely sappy). Its appeal will depend entirely on your feelings about Sandler and the rest of the gang--if you like this bunch of lugs (in all their prolonged adolescent glory), then you'll like this movie. If you don't, you won't. Everyone's in relaxed but good form; affable is more the comic goal than razor sharp. Expect gags about being fat, being old, prolonged breast-feeding, ogling hot chicks, flatulence, etc. There's some role reversal: it's the women, particularly Hayek as a type-A fashion designer, who need to learn the eternal cinematic lesson that family is more important than work. Featuring guest appearances from Tim Meadows, Colin Quinn, and Steve Buscemi.\", '--Bret Fetzer']\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Comedy', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, Dubbed, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Adam Sandler, Dennis Dugan, Maria Bello', 'Language': 'English', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 42 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.85:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.55 x 5.11 x 7.75 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': '35014', 'Director': 'Dennis Dugan', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, Dubbed, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Run time': '1 hour and 42 minutes', 'Release date': 'May 3, 2011', 'Actors': 'Adam Sandler, Maria Bello', 'Dubbed': 'French', 'Subtitles': 'English, French, Spanish', 'Studio': 'Columbia Pictures', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: great\nReview Title: Five Stars\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Finding himself more comfortable with a lion than a lady, Griffin decides the only way to get the girl of his dreams is to leave the zoo and find a more glamorous job to win her over. The animals, in a panic, decide to break their time-honored code of silence and reveal their biggest secret: they can talk!

Griffin is a disaster with the ladies, as was proved by his failed marriage proposal to the self-absorbed Stephanie several years ago, but he's really good with animals. The animals have listened to Griffin pine over Stephanie for years, so when they overhear Stephanie saying that perhaps her rejection of Griffin was too hasty, they take action. They decide to help Griffin rekindle the relationship and become the alpha male that Stephanie wants him to be. The animals are masters at mating, but their plan to show Griffin how to act quickly breaks down and they inadvertently begin talking out loud to him. After his initial shock, Griffin starts to take the animals' advice seriously--from how to walk and roar to the extreme of marking his territory. Surprisingly, the animals' advice really works and Griffin is about to get everything he's ever dreamed of--or is he? There's plenty of star power in this film--from Kevin James as Griffin, to the voice talents of Sylvester Stallone as Joe the lion and Cher as his lioness, Adam Sandler as Donald the monkey, and Nick Nolte as Bernie the gorilla--but somehow they're all somewhat underwhelming. This film has more than its share of cheap laughs, often at the expense of some part of Griffin's body, and some viewers will find that just right for a night's entertainment. Those looking for a moral to the story will discover that it's wise to be careful what you wish for and that what you think you want may not be anything like what you really need.\", 'Zookeeper', \"isn't a great film destined for repeated watchings, but it's not meant to be--it's a comedy that will make you laugh a bit today and forget it the second you leave the theater.
