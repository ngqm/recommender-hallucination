An armed cadre seizes state control. Fortunately, a coup d'etat can't happen here. Or can it? A classic of suspense directed by John Frankenheimer (The Manchurian Candidate, Ronin) and written for the screen by Rod Serling (The Twilight Zone), Seven Days in May tautly explores that possibility. At odds are a popular general and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman (Burt Lancaster) and an unpopular president (Fredric March) with a pacifist agenda. At stake is the survival of the Republic. A vigilant colonel (Kirk Douglas) uncovers the scheme. But are the seven fateful days ahead enough time to derail a takeover? The clock is ticking.\"]\n{'Genre': 'Action & Adventure', 'Format': 'NTSC', 'Contributor': \"Edmond O'Brien, John Frankenheimer, Hugh Marlowe, Kirk Douglas, Fredric March, Whit Bissell, George Macready, Martin Balsam, Burt Lancaster, Ava GardnerEdmond O'Brien, John Frankenheimer, Hugh Marlowe, Kirk Douglas, Fredric March, Whit Bissell, George Macready, Martin Balsam, Burt Lancaster, Ava Gardner   See more\", 'Language': 'English', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 58 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.33:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.5 x 0.5 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Director': 'John Frankenheimer', 'Media Format': 'NTSC', 'Run time': '1 hour and 58 minutes', 'Release date': 'November 22, 2016', 'Actors': \"Burt Lancaster, Kirk Douglas, Fredric March, Ava Gardner, Edmond O'Brien\", 'Studio': 'Warner Archive Collection', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nExcellent movie.
