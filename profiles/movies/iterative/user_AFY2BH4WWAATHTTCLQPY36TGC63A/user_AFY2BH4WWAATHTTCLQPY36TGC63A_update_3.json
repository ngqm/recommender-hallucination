Add pubs, car chases, explosions, 1000 funny jokes, and you'll have the thread of this film. Pegg and Frost are on par with the great comedy teams of all time.\nA Riot\n{'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Greg Mottola'], 'Producers': ['Tim Bevan', 'Nira Park', 'Eric Fellner'], 'Starring': ['Simon Pegg', 'Nick Frost', 'Seth Rogen'], 'Studio': ['UNIVERSAL PAY TELEVISION']}\nI really enjoy these two as a comedy team. The film is very funny and has a lot of social commentary on the US.\nGreat Movie for a laugh\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Lana Wachowski', 'Tom Tykwer', 'Lilly Wachowski'], 'Producers': ['Stefan Arndt', 'Alex Boden', 'David Brown', 'John Chong', 'Jos\u00e9 Luis Escolar', 'Peter Grossman', 'Grant Hill'], 'Starring': ['Tom Hanks', 'Halle Berry', 'Jim Broadbent'], 'Studio': ['Warner Bros.']}\nGadzooks it made my head hurt trying to rationalize why I was spending time watching it.
