The Dressmaker - a film I'd likely pass by had it not been for Kate Winslet and Judy Davis being in the movie - was the best movie I've viewed so far in 2017.  It's backdrop is so depressing: a dusty forgotten town in the Australian outback from 1926 - 1951.  But from the presence of Kate arriving in town with one minute of film panning up to her face where we see her ruby red lips take a long drag of a cigarette is the &#34;tell&#34; that this is a movie like no other.  I haven't read the book and knew nothing of the unfolding of the story.  The cinematographer's use of juxtaposition (haute couture - brilliant color against the dreary town's dusty beige; the metamorphosis of Gertrude and so many other scenes I could point to. I won't say more - no spoiler review here.  Other than to say, this is a deep movie, with many subtleties of the prison's people make, regardless of their surroundings and all in their own mind.  Watch it for a fun romp into vintage 1950's couture or for a story of revenge or for the interplay between characters and the passage of time.  But watch it!\nReview Title: Great story, GREAT actors, well written and well played.  Do yourself a favor and watch this movie!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

The screen-tellling of F. Scott Fitzgerald's final (unfinished) book electrifies the viewer with both the heights of hope and the depths of despair.  The Last Tycoon is part telling of a time when the U.S. was in an ugly position in the world: the juxtaposition of Hooverville's and the glittering dreams of all things possible.  All of the relationship amongst players in the cast can be compared to that of Matt Bomer & Kelsey Grammer.  Mr. Bomer & Mr. Grammer, play their roles to perfection showing a deeper relationship and understanding than what is shown on the screen.<br />Anyone who had read about (or remembers hearing about) the time before WWII will understand the dichotomy of the characters: some &#34;never say die&#34; others always wondering why, this is truly a must see.  Add this to the list of successes of Amazon's Original Productions (or what I prefer to call &#34;amazonment&#34;), I can't wait for the next installment.  Thank you, once again, for a cinematically beautiful, intelligently written and well cast show.\nFive stars isn't enough for this beautiful story\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'Espa\u00f1ol', 'Portugu\u00eas', 'Fran\u00e7ais'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', 'Espa\u00f1ol', 'Fran\u00e7ais', 'Portugu\u00eas'], 'Directors': ['Mark Schwahn'], 'Starring': ['Alexandra Park', 'Tom Austen', 'Elizabeth Hurley'], 'Studio': ['Lionsgate']}\nLOVE LOVE LOVE this show.\nA fantastic show, wish there were more shows like this on TV.

With the exception of Elizabeth Hurley, I never seen any of the other cast members before The Royals. But am enjoying them so immensely.  Of course, it being fiction, should be viewed in that light.  Perhaps that's less easy for a Briton, I don't know.  But for me, it is a riveting story of fully developed characters, with flaws and triumphant assets both serving the storyline well.  I adore the princess for her hard edge, snarky wit and sharp edges as much as I adore her soft heart and outstanding emotionally charged dialogue.  I've always loved Elizabeth Hurley and this role allows her to show us a range she's rarely been given the chance to show.  I say bravo, Ms. Hurley.  Well done.  I could go on about Jasper, Liam, Cyrus and Robert as well as the secondary players.  But instead of turning this review into a love letter (left in a book in the library of course) I'll end by saying JUST WATCH IT.  if you become addicted, worry not.  I'm sure there will be a royals anon meeting coming to your area soon... lol.\nGREAT SHOW FOR TOO MANY REASONS TO LIST\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: Low', 'English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Jocelyn Moorhouse'], 'Producers': ['Sue Maslin'], 'Starring': ['Kate Winslet', 'Liam Hemsworth', 'Judy Davis'], 'Studio': ['Amazon Studios']}\nI'm trying to stay up on the reviews of movies which truly rivet me.
