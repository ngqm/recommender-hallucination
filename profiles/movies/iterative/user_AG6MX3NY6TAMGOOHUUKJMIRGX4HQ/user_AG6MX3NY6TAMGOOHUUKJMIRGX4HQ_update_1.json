The screen-tellling of F. Scott Fitzgerald's final (unfinished) book electrifies the viewer with both the heights of hope and the depths of despair.  The Last Tycoon is part telling of a time when the U.S. was in an ugly position in the world: the juxtaposition of Hooverville's and the glittering dreams of all things possible.  All of the relationship amongst players in the cast can be compared to that of Matt Bomer & Kelsey Grammer.  Mr. Bomer & Mr. Grammer, play their roles to perfection showing a deeper relationship and understanding than what is shown on the screen.<br />Anyone who had read about (or remembers hearing about) the time before WWII will understand the dichotomy of the characters: some &#34;never say die&#34; others always wondering why, this is truly a must see.  Add this to the list of successes of Amazon's Original Productions (or what I prefer to call &#34;amazonment&#34;), I can't wait for the next installment.  Thank you, once again, for a cinematically beautiful, intelligently written and well cast show.\nReview Title: Five stars isn't enough for this beautiful story\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
