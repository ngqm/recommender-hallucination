With the exception of Elizabeth Hurley, I never seen any of the other cast members before The Royals. But am enjoying them so immensely.  Of course, it being fiction, should be viewed in that light.  Perhaps that's less easy for a Briton, I don't know.  But for me, it is a riveting story of fully developed characters, with flaws and triumphant assets both serving the storyline well.  I adore the princess for her hard edge, snarky wit and sharp edges as much as I adore her soft heart and outstanding emotionally charged dialogue.  I've always loved Elizabeth Hurley and this role allows her to show us a range she's rarely been given the chance to show.  I say bravo, Ms. Hurley.  Well done.  I could go on about Jasper, Liam, Cyrus and Robert as well as the secondary players.  But instead of turning this review into a love letter (left in a book in the library of course) I'll end by saying JUST WATCH IT.  if you become addicted, worry not.  I'm sure there will be a royals anon meeting coming to your area soon... lol.\nReview Title: GREAT SHOW FOR TOO MANY REASONS TO LIST\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

The screen-tellling of F. Scott Fitzgerald's final (unfinished) book electrifies the viewer with both the heights of hope and the depths of despair.  The Last Tycoon is part telling of a time when the U.S. was in an ugly position in the world: the juxtaposition of Hooverville's and the glittering dreams of all things possible.  All of the relationship amongst players in the cast can be compared to that of Matt Bomer & Kelsey Grammer.  Mr. Bomer & Mr. Grammer, play their roles to perfection showing a deeper relationship and understanding than what is shown on the screen.<br />Anyone who had read about (or remembers hearing about) the time before WWII will understand the dichotomy of the characters: some &#34;never say die&#34; others always wondering why, this is truly a must see.  Add this to the list of successes of Amazon's Original Productions (or what I prefer to call &#34;amazonment&#34;), I can't wait for the next installment.  Thank you, once again, for a cinematically beautiful, intelligently written and well cast show.\nFive stars isn't enough for this beautiful story\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'Espa\u00f1ol', 'Portugu\u00eas', 'Fran\u00e7ais'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', 'Espa\u00f1ol', 'Fran\u00e7ais', 'Portugu\u00eas'], 'Directors': ['Mark Schwahn'], 'Starring': ['Alexandra Park', 'Tom Austen', 'Elizabeth Hurley'], 'Studio': ['Lionsgate']}\nLOVE LOVE LOVE this show.\nA fantastic show, wish there were more shows like this on TV.
