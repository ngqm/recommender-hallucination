They are joined by a core of original characters in a complex, frightening new narrative, where personal demons from the past can be stronger than vampires, evil spirits and immortal beasts. Relive every chilling episode of Showtime's Penny Dreadful if you dare.\"]\n{'Genre': 'Television, Horror/Television', 'Format': 'AC-3, Box set, Dolby, Dubbed, Subtitled, Widescreen, NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Eva Green, Harry Treadaway, Rory Kinnear, Reeve Carney, Timothy Dalton, Josh Hartnett, Billie Piper', 'Language': 'English', 'Number Of Discs': '9', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 9.74 Ounces', 'Media Format': 'AC-3, Box set, Dolby, Dubbed, Subtitled, Widescreen, NTSC', 'Run time': '24 hours and 22 minutes', 'Release date': 'July 18, 2017', 'Actors': 'Rory Kinnear, Josh Hartnett, Eva Green, Billie Piper, Harry Treadaway', 'Dubbed': 'Spanish', 'Subtitles': 'English', 'Studio': 'Paramount Pictures Home Entertainment', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '9'}\nExcellent series. Really scary, superb acting and scenery. Too bad season 2 was too sexually graphic.\nGood series\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Haifaa Al-Mansour'], 'Producers': ['Amy Baer', 'Alan Moloney', 'Ruth Coady'], 'Starring': ['Elle Fanning', 'Maisie Williams', 'Bel Powley'], 'Studio': ['IFC Films']}\nThis is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. I had no idea of the inspiration behind Mary Shelley's book Frankestein. It is remarkable how this intellectually gifted woman through life hardships could develop such book and character. Movie offers great depth. The actors are also remarkable\nI highly recommend it\n{'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Steven Spielberg'], 'Producers': ['Steven Spielberg', 'Amy Pascal', 'Kristie Macosko Krieger'], 'Starring': ['Meryl Streep', 'Tom Hanks', 'Sarah Paulson'], 'Studio': ['20th Century Fox']}\nA very self serving account. I read an article from the NY times debating the facts related in the movie. Nevertheless, it is a refreshing story of courage. I guess feminism is in vogue so the movie caters to it. I felt movie was very slow, making a bit boring on some portions.\nNot very impressed\nBohemian Rhapsody\nDrama, Arts, Entertainment, and Culture, Bold, Electrifying\n['Bohemian Rhapsody celebrates the band Queen, their music, and their extraordinary lead singer Freddie Mercury, who defied convention to become one of the most beloved entertainers ever.']\n{'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Bryan Singer'], 'Producers': ['Graham King', 'Jim Beach'], 'Starring': ['Rami Malek', 'Lucy Boynton', 'Gwilym Lee']}\nIt is a sanitized version of Mercury's life. Not so accurate based on some reviews but it was great fun to watch. I love Queen's music. I would watch it again\nGreat movie\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'Espa\u00f1ol', 'Portugu\u00eas', 'Fran\u00e7ais'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', 'Espa\u00f1ol'], 'Directors': ['Damien Chazelle'], 'Producers': ['Jordan Horowitz', 'Marc Platt', 'Gary Gilbert', 'Fred Berger'], 'Starring': ['Ryan Gosling', 'Emma Stone', 'Amiee Conn'], 'Studio': ['Lionsgate']}\nIt was entertaining but not Oscar worthy. I remember musicals like Chicago and the classics: Fred Astaire, Judy Garland and others. This is not one of them\nNot Oscar worthy\n{'Audio languages': ['Espa\u00f1ol'], 'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Asghar Farhadi'], 'Producers': ['Alexandre Mallet-Guy', '\u00c1lvaro Longoria'], 'Starring': ['Javier Bardem', 'Pen\u00e9lope Cruz', 'Ricardo Dar\u00edn']}\nThe acting from Penelope and her husband is great but the plot is not original. I love the setting in Spain.\nGreat acting not very original plot\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Damien Chazelle'], 'Producers': ['Damien Chazelle', 'Wyck Godfrey', 'Marty Bowen', 'Isaac Klausner'], 'Starring': ['Corey Stoll', 'Jason Clarke', 'Ciar\u00e1n Hinds'], 'Studio': ['Universal Pictures']}\nThis was a great historical account of the first moon landing. I am old enough to remember how unreal it felt. The whole world was riveted. I lived in Southamerica at the time and was just a little girl but I remember my family watching live on TV. Amazing US accomplishment\nGreat movie\nSully\nDrama, Cerebral, Inspiring, Serious\n['The story of Chesley Sullenberger, who became a hero after gliding his plane along the water in the Hudson River, saving all of his 155 passengers.']\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Clint Eastwood'], 'Producers': ['Clint Eastwood', 'Frank Marshall', 'Allyn Stewart', 'Tim Moore'], 'Starring': ['Tom Hanks', 'Aaron Eckhart', 'Laura Linney']}\nI lived this movie. Tom never disappoints. I could hardly believe that a man of such character who saved the lives of so many with sound judgement was embroiled in a review intended to show a fabricated negligence. Delighted that he was able to probe and defend his decision\nGreat movie\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['David Cronenberg'], 'Producers': ['Marc Boyman', 'Mel Brooks', 'Stuart Cornfeld', 'Kip Ohman'], 'Starring': ['Jeff Goldblum', 'Geena Davis', 'John Getz'], 'Studio': ['The Walt Disney Studios']}\nWe watched this old movie with our grandson. Even though it\u2019s old, the plot has sound scientific grounds and the fly evolution is revoltingly credible. Good movie. He loved it\nOld but so good\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Osgood Perkins'], 'Studio': ['Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)']}\nHorrible characters. Creepy and unauthentic with only aim to shock\nAwful\n{'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium', 'Italiano', 'Espa\u00f1ol', 'Portugu\u00eas', 'Fran\u00e7ais'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', 'Espa\u00f1ol', 'Fran\u00e7ais', 'Italiano', 'Portugu\u00eas', 'Svenska'], 'Directors': ['Andy Tennant'], 'Producers': ['Robert Cort', 'Rhonda Byrne', 'Paul Hanson', 'Tri-G Films', 'Joe Gelchion', 'Matthew George', 'Robert Katz'], 'Starring': ['Katie Holmes', 'Josh Lucas', \"Jerry O'Connell\"], 'Studio': ['Lionsgate']}\nNice plot but Holmes is not a good actress. Lucas is very nice.
