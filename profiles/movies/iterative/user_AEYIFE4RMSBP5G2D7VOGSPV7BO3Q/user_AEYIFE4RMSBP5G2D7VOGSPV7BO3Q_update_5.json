Really scary, superb acting and scenery.

I had no idea of the inspiration behind Mary Shelley's book Frankestein. It is remarkable how this intellectually gifted woman through life hardships could develop such book and character. Movie offers great depth. The actors are also remarkable\nI highly recommend it\n{'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Steven Spielberg'], 'Producers': ['Steven Spielberg', 'Amy Pascal', 'Kristie Macosko Krieger'], 'Starring': ['Meryl Streep', 'Tom Hanks', 'Sarah Paulson'], 'Studio': ['20th Century Fox']}\nA very self serving account. I read an article from the NY times debating the facts related in the movie. Nevertheless, it is a refreshing story of courage. I guess feminism is in vogue so the movie caters to it. I felt movie was very slow, making a bit boring on some portions.\nNot very impressed\nBohemian Rhapsody\nDrama, Arts, Entertainment, and Culture, Bold, Electrifying\n['Bohemian Rhapsody celebrates the band Queen, their music, and their extraordinary lead singer Freddie Mercury, who defied convention to become one of the most beloved entertainers ever.']\n{'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Bryan Singer'], 'Producers': ['Graham King', 'Jim Beach'], 'Starring': ['Rami Malek', 'Lucy Boynton', 'Gwilym Lee']}\nIt is a sanitized version of Mercury's life. Not so accurate based on some reviews but it was great fun to watch. I love Queen's music. I would watch it again\nGreat movie\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'Espa\u00f1ol', 'Portugu\u00eas', 'Fran\u00e7ais'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', 'Espa\u00f1ol'], 'Directors': ['Damien Chazelle'], 'Producers': ['Jordan Horowitz', 'Marc Platt', 'Gary Gilbert', 'Fred Berger'], 'Starring': ['Ryan Gosling', 'Emma Stone', 'Amiee Conn'], 'Studio': ['Lionsgate']}\nIt was entertaining but not Oscar worthy.
