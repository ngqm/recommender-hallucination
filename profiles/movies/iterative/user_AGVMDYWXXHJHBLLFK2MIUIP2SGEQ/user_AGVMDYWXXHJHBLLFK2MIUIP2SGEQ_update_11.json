The actors are wonderful, the script is fabulous, and the directing is first rate. Even my husband, who thought Breaking Bad was too dark, already loves this show. What is so impressive about it (and its predecessor) is the depth of character portrayal. You see the characters' struggles with &#34;right&#34; vs.&#34;wrong,&#34; you see the shadows as much as you see the sunlight. It's a great show.\nReview Title: No surprise how good this show is\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
