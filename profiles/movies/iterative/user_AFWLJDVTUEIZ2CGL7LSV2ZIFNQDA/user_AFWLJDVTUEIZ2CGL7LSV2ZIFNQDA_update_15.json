Brooks' hit comedy,\", 'As Good as it Gets', \". Nicholson gives a show-stopping performance as Melvin Udall, an obsessive-compulsive novelist with Manhattan's meanest mouth. But when his neighbor Simon is hospitalized, Melvin is forced to babysit Simon's dog. And that unexpected act of kindness, along with waitress Carol Connelly, helps put Melvin back in the human race.\", 'Amazon.com', 'For all of its conventional plotting about an obsessive-compulsive curmudgeon (Jack Nicholson) who improves his personality at the urging of his gay neighbor (Greg Kinnear) and a waitress (Helen Hunt) who inspires his best behavior, this is one of the sharpest Hollywood comedies of the 1990s. Nicholson could play his role in his sleep (the Oscar he won should have gone to Robert Duvall for', 'The Apostle', \"), but his mischievous persona is precisely necessary to give heart to his seemingly heartless character, who is of all things a successful romance novelist. As a single mom with a chronically asthmatic young son, Hunt gives the film its conscience and integrity (along with plenty of wry humor), and she also won an Oscar for her wonderful performance. Greg Kinnear had to settle for an Oscar nomination (while cowriter-director James L. Brooks was inexplicably snubbed by Oscar that year), but his work was also singled out in the film's near-unanimous chorus of critical praise. It's questionable whether a romance between Hunt and the much older Nicholson is entirely believable, but this movie's smart enough--and charmingly funny enough--to make it seem endearingly possible.\", '--Jeff Shannon']\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Romance, Comedy', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, Full Screen, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen, AnamorphicMultiple Formats, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, Full Screen, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen, Anamorphic   See more', 'Contributor': 'Greg Kinnear, Jesse James, Cuba Gooding Jr., Shirley Knight, Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, Harold Ramis, Old Friends Productions, Inc./Gracie, James L.

Expecting a dull evening, Chris settles down with three kids for a night of TV ... and boredom. But when her frantic friend Brenda calls and pleads to be rescued from the bus station in downtown Chicago, the evening soon explodes into an endless whirl of hair-raising adventures! Babysitter and kids leave their safe suburban surroundings and head for the heart of the big city, never imagining how terrifyingly funny their expedition will become!', 'Amazon.com', 'Way', 'before she grabbed an Oscar nomination for her searing performance as a world-weary prostitute in', 'Leaving Las Vegas', \", Elisabeth Shue was known as one of the squeaky-clean actresses of the '80s. Having made a splash in\", 'The Karate Kid', \"and the '60s-nostalgia TV series\", 'Call to Glory', ', Shue cemented her good-girl reputation with the charming but badly titled', 'Adventures in Babysitting', \". Set in the John Hughes-style suburbs of Chicago, the titular adventures follow babysitter Chris (Shue), who agrees to watch the Anderson kids (Keith Coogan and Maia Brewton) when her boyfriend cancels their anniversary date. All is quiet on the home front until Chris is called upon to rescue her best friend (Penelope Ann Miller, also doing good-girl duty) from the seedy downtown bus station. She can't leave the kids, and she can't leave her friend alone in the big bad city, so she packs everyone in the station wagon and heads into Chicago. Screwball craziness begins as they encounter car thieves, knife-wielding gangs, gun-toting truck drivers, and, worst of all, Chris's duplicitous boyfriend. It's hardly mature entertainment, but Shue makes it work; when she wins over the audience at a blues club with her improv singing, you'll be won over, too. In his directorial debut, Chris Columbus (who later went on to helm the sap-fests\", 'Mrs. Doubtfire', 'and', 'Home Alone', \") gently skewers the suburbia white-bread mindset of the main characters, and plays up the comedy over the schmaltz with a subtlety of which he now seems incapable; the near romance between Shue and Coogan is played lightly and adorably. Look for brief appearances by art-house faves Lolita Davidovich as a college party girl and Vincent D'Onofrio as an unlikely savior.\", '--Mark Englehart']\n{'Genre': 'Comedy', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Widescreen, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Closed-captioned', 'Contributor': \"Keith Coogan, George Newbern, Calvin Levels, David Simkins, Penelope Ann Miller, Lolita Davidovitch, Elisabeth Shue, Ron Canada, Maia Brewton, Allen Aarons, Bradley Whitford, Vincent  D'Onofrio, John Ford Noonan, John Chandler, Daniel Ziskie, Chris Columbus, Anthony RappKeith Coogan, George Newbern, Calvin Levels, David Simkins, Penelope Ann Miller, Lolita Davidovitch, Elisabeth Shue, Ron Canada, Maia Brewton, Allen Aarons, Bradley Whitford, Vincent  D'Onofrio, John Ford Noonan, John Chandler, Daniel Ziskie, Chris Columbus, Antho\u2026   See more\", 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround), French (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround), Unqualified', 'Number Of Discs': '1', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.85:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 0.71 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'MFR717951003300#VG', 'Director': 'Chris Columbus', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Widescreen, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Closed-captioned', 'Run time': '1 hour and 42 minutes', 'Release date': 'January 18, 2000', 'Actors': \"Elisabeth Shue, Penelope Ann Miller, Vincent  D'Onofrio, John Chandler, Keith Coogan\", 'Dubbed': 'French', 'Subtitles': 'English', 'Studio': 'TOUCHSTONE PICTURES', 'Writers': 'David Simkins', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nDeceptively simple premise delivers loads of laughs in this light-hearted misadventure!\nEntertaining Misadventure!\nDeath Becomes Her\nGoldie Hawn  (Actor),     Bruce Willis  (Actor),     Robert Zemeckis  (Director, Producer)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Comedy\n['Oscar\u00ae-winning actress Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn star with Bruce Willis in Robert Zemeckis\\' outrageously entertaining comedy about greed, vanity, sex, immortality, life\u2026and death.

Brooks' hit comedy,\", 'As Good as it Gets', \". Nicholson gives a show-stopping performance as Melvin Udall, an obsessive-compulsive novelist with Manhattan's meanest mouth. But when his neighbor Simon is hospitalized, Melvin is forced to babysit Simon's dog. And that unexpected act of kindness, along with waitress Carol Connelly, helps put Melvin back in the human race.\", 'Amazon.com', 'For all of its conventional plotting about an obsessive-compulsive curmudgeon (Jack Nicholson) who improves his personality at the urging of his gay neighbor (Greg Kinnear) and a waitress (Helen Hunt) who inspires his best behavior, this is one of the sharpest Hollywood comedies of the 1990s. Nicholson could play his role in his sleep (the Oscar he won should have gone to Robert Duvall for', 'The Apostle', \"), but his mischievous persona is precisely necessary to give heart to his seemingly heartless character, who is of all things a successful romance novelist. As a single mom with a chronically asthmatic young son, Hunt gives the film its conscience and integrity (along with plenty of wry humor), and she also won an Oscar for her wonderful performance. Greg Kinnear had to settle for an Oscar nomination (while cowriter-director James L. Brooks was inexplicably snubbed by Oscar that year), but his work was also singled out in the film's near-unanimous chorus of critical praise. It's questionable whether a romance between Hunt and the much older Nicholson is entirely believable, but this movie's smart enough--and charmingly funny enough--to make it seem endearingly possible.\", '--Jeff Shannon']\n{'Genre': 'Romance, Comedy', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, Full Screen, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen, AnamorphicMultiple Formats, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, Full Screen, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen, Anamorphic   See more', 'Contributor': 'Greg Kinnear, Jesse James, Cuba Gooding Jr., Shirley Knight, Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, Harold Ramis, Old Friends Productions, Inc./Gracie, James L.
