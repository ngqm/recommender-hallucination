As a PARIS GUIDE = 3.5 STARS. But I did enjoy it -- especially the French Cafe music!<br /><br />This is an artsy 54-minute medley of footage, stills and music. It might be years old, or just made to look that way, with its sepia tinted footage. Film is often shown with music only, no narration, and sometimes they fast forward: cars zoom around Place de la Concorde; people walk at a rapid clip making them look like Weebles.<br /><br />Narration, by a Brit named John Symes who has a most calming tone of voice, is abbreviated; he speaks only about half of the time. But he does manage to inform visitors about sightseeing highlights, including history and culture, and some practical tips, in spite of the trimmed narration.<br /><br />He begins with your arrival at CDG and suggests you take the RoissyBus. (I took it once. I found it to be inexpensive and convenient, since I was staying at a Best Western a few of blocks away from the Paris Opera Garnier.) He also mentions the train and taxis; but taxis can be expensive. One great tip is to google the bus map and print it out, since they're hard to come by. Another is to wear comfortable shoes and walk everywhere.<br /><br />&#34;Must See&#34; places: Eiffel Tower, Louvre (plan to spend a whole day), Carousel under the Louvre to buy Louvre tickets and shop for French souvenirs, Notre Dame Cathedral, Place de la Concorde, Sacre Coeur (I like his tip on watching the sunset from here and visiting Montmartre in the evening), Pompidou Center, Moulin Rouge, Invalides, Palais de Luxembourg, Pantheon (I agree -- a must see! though a bit out of the way), Tuileries Gardens, Grand Palais (the Nazis used it for their tanks during WW2 -- I didn't know this), Forum des Halles for shopping (but he really prefers Carousel), walk along the Seine, go to the theatre (but beware -- it will be in French!). They show Bourse, but don't identify it. They show the inside of Opera Garnier, but don't tell you what you're looking at.<br /><br />When he bemoans the fact that one can't get a cup of real English tea, he says it &#34;tongue in cheek,&#34; I think, and isn't really crying over the fact that English tea isn't served with milk in France, if at all. He recommends orange juice, instead. He points out that Parisians are beautiful to look at (true!), and he says about Paris: it's one of those places it would be a shame not to visit. I so agree!\nReview Title: Artsy & Relaxing With A Sketch Of The Main Sights\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

It's about a young man's great love for a city, Paris, and the illusion people have that a life different from theirs would be much better.\", 'Amazon.com', 'Paris is a city that lends itself to daydreaming, to walking the streets and imagining all sorts of magic, a quality that Woody Allen understands perfectly.', 'Midnight in Paris', \"is Allen's charming reverie about just that quality, with a screenwriter hero named Gil (Owen Wilson) who strolls the lanes of Paris with his head in the clouds and walks right into his own best fantasy. Gil is there with his materialistic fianc\u00e9e (Rachel McAdams) and her unpleasant parents, taking a break from his financially rewarding but spiritually unfulfilling Hollywood career--and he can't stop thinking that all he wants to do is quit the movies, move to Paris, and write that novel he's been meaning to finish. You know, be like his heroes in the bohemian Paris of the 1920s. Sure enough, a midnight encounter draws him into the jazzy world of Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Picasso and Dali, and an intense Ernest Hemingway, who promises to bring Gil's manuscript to Gertrude Stein for review. Gil wakes up every morning back in the real world, but returning to his enchanted Paris proves fairly easy. In the execution of this marvelous fantasia, Allen pursues the idea that people of every generation have always romanticized a previous age as golden (this is in fact explained to us by Michael Sheen's pedantic art expert), but he also honors Gil's need to find out certain truths for himself. The movie's on the side of gentle fantasy, and it has some literary/cinematic in-jokes that call back to the kind of goofy humor Allen created in\", 'Love and Death', \".The film is guilty of the slackness that Allen's latter-day directing has sometimes shown, and the underwritten roles for McAdams and Marion Cotillard are better acted than written. But the city glows with Allen's romantic sense of it, and Owen Wilson has just the right nice-guy melancholy to put the idea over.

Thanks for this one, Woody Allen, I hope you win an award and I hope this movie wins many. The first minute or two of this film, scenes of Paris with jazz music, was wonderful! (Frankly, I would have preferred classical cello music, but the visuals alone worked beautifully with their sepia overtones.)<br /><br />My favorite scene involved a surrealistic exchange among Dali, Luis Bunuel, Man Ray and our protagonist Gil where they all spoke about a rhinoceros from their individual viewpoints. (Inspired and hilarious -- loved it!) Other great philosophy came from Hemingway. And on writing, Gertrude Stein said it best.<br /><br />Brilliant cast: Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein, Adrien Brody as Salvador Dali, Tom Hiddleston as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Carla Bruni as museum guide. The part of Owen Wilson would most likely have been played by Woody Allen himself if he had been slightly younger, but Wilson does his best to affect Allen's mannerisms.<br /><br />Paris IS a most beautiful city. I've walked much of Paris in the rain and I agree with one premise of this movie: rain enhances the beauty of Paris. (One of my most invigorating days, ever, was sitting on the top level of an open-air tour bus, in the rain, umbrella open, soaring around Paris from one arrondissement to another.)<br /><br />This is a movie I will want to watch at least once a year as I do with Enchanted April, Amelie, Up At The Villa, It's A Wonderful Life and a few other classics where immeasurable love and skill went into their creation.\nLove Affair In And With Paris\nMozart in the Jungle\nComedy\n['A new Amazon Original Series: \\xa0What happens behind the curtains at the symphony is just as captivating as what happens on stage.

This 1964 film adaptation of the classic novel by Ford Madox Ford shows a young Judi Dench (Skyfall, J. Edgar) in one of her earliest screen roles. Considered by many as one of the pre-eminent literary works of the 20th-century, Parade's End follows Christopher Tietjens (Ronald Hines, Elizabeth R), a wealthy member of Edwardian England's upper class, as the country is drawn into World War One. Tietjens is at the center of a love triangle between his wife Sylvia (Jeanne Moody), a treacherous socialite who is trying to destroy him, and his suffragette mistress, Valentine (Dench). The warfare Tietjens encounters as an officer in Europe is but a backdrop to a personal battle of conflicting loyalties, hidden passions and the rigid social expectations of his day.\", ']]>', 'Amazon.com', 'This introspective adaptation of Ford Madox Ford\\'s four-book series revolves around Yorkshire statistician Christopher Tietjens (Ronald Hines, pale and prickly), a nonconformist living in stiff-upper-lip Edwardian England (screenwriter John Hopkins concentrates on the first three novels in the tetralogy). When war breaks out, Christopher does his patriotic duty, while dreaming of the day \"there will be no more parades.\" In the first part, his spiteful and snobbish wife, Sylvia (Jeanne Moody, overacting in an entertaining manner), leaves him for another man, but Christopher forgoes divorce to avoid a scandal and moves in with his Rossetti-obsessed associate, MacMaster (Fulton Mackay), the kind of arty gentleman who rolls his', 'r', '\\'s. To her mother, Sylvia explains her actions succinctly: \"I hate my husband and I hate my child.\" While she\\'s away, he meets Valentine (Judi Dench, the essence of compassion), a suffragette and pacifist. If Christopher represents the past, Valentine represents the future.', 'Sylvia eventually returns, but Christopher continues to associate with Valentine, to the consternation of his father, who believes the rumors that have been swirling around his son (most of them untrue). As Christopher\\'s brother, Mark (Ronald Leigh-Hunt), tells Valentine, he\\'s \"a fellow who never told a lie or did a dishonorable thing.\" In the next two chapters, Christopher serves as an officer in France and Belgium, loses several of his men, and suffers from posttraumatic stress disorder, which complicates his long-simmering, but unconsummated romance with Valentine.

IMHO: Best director, Best Screenplay, Best Actors, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Every Category. All interior scenes look as though they were staged by Vermeer. The casting and the portrayal of the characters by these actors is absolutely stunning!<br /><br />Set during WW1, Christopher Tietjens, one of Britain's most brilliant statisticians finds himself fighting in the trenches. He leaves two women behind: his wealthy wife, Sylvia, and Miss Wannop, a woman he has gradually come to know and love. Sylvia is a manipulative, selfish socialite, and Miss Wannop, a suffragette, is someone with a strong sense of duty (like Tietjens).<br /><br />This 1964 version is okay. It's in black and white. The script is abbreviated. But it is fun seeing Judi Dench, when she was younger, in the role of Miss Wannop.<br /><br />I bought both this DVD and the kindle book (based on the novel by Ford Madox Ford, &#34;No More Parades&#34;).
