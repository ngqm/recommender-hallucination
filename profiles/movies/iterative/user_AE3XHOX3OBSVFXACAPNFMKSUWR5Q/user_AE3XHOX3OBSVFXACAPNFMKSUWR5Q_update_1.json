Thanks for this one, Woody Allen, I hope you win an award and I hope this movie wins many. The first minute or two of this film, scenes of Paris with jazz music, was wonderful! (Frankly, I would have preferred classical cello music, but the visuals alone worked beautifully with their sepia overtones.)<br /><br />My favorite scene involved a surrealistic exchange among Dali, Luis Bunuel, Man Ray and our protagonist Gil where they all spoke about a rhinoceros from their individual viewpoints. (Inspired and hilarious -- loved it!) Other great philosophy came from Hemingway. And on writing, Gertrude Stein said it best.<br /><br />Brilliant cast: Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein, Adrien Brody as Salvador Dali, Tom Hiddleston as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Carla Bruni as museum guide. The part of Owen Wilson would most likely have been played by Woody Allen himself if he had been slightly younger, but Wilson does his best to affect Allen's mannerisms.<br /><br />Paris IS a most beautiful city. I've walked much of Paris in the rain and I agree with one premise of this movie: rain enhances the beauty of Paris. (One of my most invigorating days, ever, was sitting on the top level of an open-air tour bus, in the rain, umbrella open, soaring around Paris from one arrondissement to another.)<br /><br />This is a movie I will want to watch at least once a year as I do with Enchanted April, Amelie, Up At The Villa, It's A Wonderful Life and a few other classics where immeasurable love and skill went into their creation.\nReview Title: Love Affair In And With Paris\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
