These episodes focus on the low ranking officers on one of the Starfleet\u2019s least important ships, the U.S.S. Cerritos.

This is the second prequel to the original Star Wars trilogy takes place ten years after the events of Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace.  Nice action, great duels. Fun & exciting. Poor acting though and the CGI animation was still in the infancy stage. It was fun watching Anakin as a hot tempered impatient teenager. LoL.<br /><br />A must have DVD for your Star Wars collection.\nGreat movie. Great Star Wars scenes.\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'frightening scenes', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a)', 'Italiano', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', '\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e', 'Portugu\u00eas', 'Deutsch', 'Fran\u00e7ais'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', '\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629', '\u010ce\u0161tina', 'Dansk', 'Deutsch', '\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a)', 'Suomi', 'Filipino', 'Fran\u00e7ais', '\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea', '\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940', 'Magyar', 'Indonesia', 'Italiano', '\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e', '\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4', 'Bahasa Melayu', 'Norsk Bokm\u00e5l', 'Nederlands', 'Polski', 'Portugu\u00eas (Brasil)', 'Portugu\u00eas (Portugal)', 'Rom\u00e2n\u0103', '\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439', 'Svenska', '\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bcd', '\u0c24\u0c46\u0c32\u0c41\u0c17\u0c41', '\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22', 'T\u00fcrk\u00e7e', '\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7b80\u4f53\uff09', '\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7e41\u9ad4\uff09'], 'Directors': ['Jodie Foster', 'So Yong Kim', 'Charlie McDowell', 'Tim Mielants', 'Mark Romanek', 'Andrew Stanton', 'Dearbhla Walsh', 'Ti West'], 'Producers': ['Nathaniel Halpern', 'Matt Reeves', 'Rafi Crohn', 'Adam Kassan', 'Mark Romanek', 'Mattias Montero', 'Samantha Taylor Pickett', 'Adam Berg', 'Robert Petrovicz', 'Simon Stalenhag', 'Mark Lafferty', 'Ellen Rutter'], 'Starring': ['Rebecca Hall', 'Paul Schneider', 'Duncan Joiner']}\nSlow moving, a bit weired, sci-fi story that leaves you with some important unaswered questions. I love scifi but many films and stories just can't cut it. I thought I would not even get through the first episode. But the more I watched it the more interesting it got. Each episode is its own story, but is also connected to the people and events of all the other episodes. The last eposide really got to me and was in tears. No spoilers, watch them all. The only dislike or warning is: no true details or explanations given for many things that happen in this show. very little true back stories or explanations.<br />If you found my  review helpful, kindly vote below so I can improve my future reviews.\nSlow burn, but worth watching\nMy Spy\nYoung Adult Audience, Comedy, Charming, Optimistic\n['My Spy follows JJ, a hardened CIA operative (Dave Bautista), who has been demoted and finds himself at the mercy of a precocious 9-year old girl named Sophie (Chloe Coleman) after he is sent undercover to surveil her family.

Its a light, action, and amusing family comedy (with a bit of too much violence for younglings).<br />JJ is a hardened CIA spy that has been demoted and finds himself at the mercy of a precocious 9-year-old girl, named Sophie where he has been sent undercover begrudgingly to surveil her family. Despite his reluctance, JJ finds he is no match for Sophie's disarming charm and wit. There has been many similiar such stories before, but I found this one a bit refreshing & cute. Keeps you entertained throughout the film. I do recommend.\nFun watch for the whole family\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['David Wellington', 'Steve DiMarco', 'Peter Wellington', 'Gregory Smith', 'James Genn', 'John Fawcett', 'Kelly Makin', 'T.W.

But my wife and I were thrilled and couldnt get enough of it. I dont wont to write any details or spoilers of the story, but I do wish they would have explored a bit more about the ghost life ( why he was there, what was the purpose, etc ) as it is an important part of the storyline. Love Charlie and Alex together and Dr Shahir is very funny as well.<br />Like many shows, there isn't too much you can go with the storyline or charachters. Enjoyed it as long as it lasted.\nExcellent Show\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['David Platt', 'Constantine Makris', 'Jonathan Kaplan', 'Peter Werner', 'Donna Deitch', 'Jonathan Demme', 'Adam Bernstein', 'John David Coles', 'Eriq La Salle', 'Peter Leto'], 'Studio': ['CBS']}\nA GIFTED MAN is a drama about a brilliant, charismatic surgeon whose life changes forever when his deceased ex-wife begins teaching him the meaning of life from the \u201chereafter.\u201d Overall, a really good show and a decent limited series. To bad it didnt last into other season. If you like Ghost Whisperer, Saving Hope, and other simliar shows, you may like this one too.\nNice show, worth watching - even for one season\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Producers': ['Not Specified'], 'Starring': ['Tom Ellis', 'Lauren German', 'DB Woodside']}\nWatching Archangels intermingle with humans is quite interesting. There are so many cop shows today to choose from. Many of them are pretty simliar in style type murder.  I was a late comer to this show, but glad I started binge watching them. This series has a new Fresh twist for a crime show. The characters are amazing and there is great chemistry between Lucifer & Chloe. Tom Ellis as Lucifer is absolutely brilliant!!! His humor is infectious, and his relationships with the other characters are unique. The writers seem to deviate from the standard known text of bibles and religions and adjusts them to fit their narrative. Which I feel is a good thing. Its fun tv, not bible accuracy. Every episode comes up with an amazing plot and a moral value, which helps Lucifer learn more about human beings and of course His Dad.<br /><br />Tasteful, respectful, and charming as this show is, its most definately entertaining.<br /><br />Please click below vote if you found my review helpful to you so I may improve my other reviews  as well.\nFresh twist for a crime show\nThe Invisible Man (2020)\nScience Fiction, Suspense, Anxious, Harrowing\n['\"The Invisible Man\" stars Emmy\u00ae winner Elisabeth Moss (\"Us,\" \"The Handmaid\\'s Tale\") as a woman who fears she is being hunted by the unseen presence of her abusive ex (Oliver Jackson-Cohen).']\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Leigh Whannell'], 'Producers': ['Jason Blum', 'Kylie Du Fresne'], 'Starring': ['Elisabeth Moss', 'Aldis Hodge', 'Storm Reid']}\nThis is another remake of a 120 year old movie originally written by H.G. Wells and is nothing alike. Many have attemted to rewrite the story based on this interesting concept. Elisabeth Moss performs her part very well, as she plays the victim again just like Handmaids Tale. The beginning of the movie is a slow burn, but eventually picks up on the suspense. Very little character development with no emotional connection to the main characters to make you care what happens to them. Overall, it was entertaining to watch for free, but not if you have to rent it for top dollar.\nWas expecting at least a little more.\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'frightening scenes', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Starring': ['Sonequa Martin-Green', 'Doug Jones', 'Anthony Rapp', 'Mary Wiseman', 'David Ajala', 'Wilson Cruz'], 'Studio': ['CBS']}\nSequels and spinoffs are very dissicult to pull off. Some shows and movies did not quite hit the mark. But I feel that CBS has continued the torch for us Star Trek fans. I have been watching Star Trek since the 1970's and some spinoffs did not do it for me. Discovery Season 1 was a fresh take in the Star Trek experience and still trekking steady as she goes into its third season, with episode one done very well. I guess this story line no feels familiar a bit to Star Trek Voyager being lost in a diffrent universe or time. I have confidence that this season will continue to entertain us Trekies.<br /><br />Live long & Prosper\nCBS bodly going where no network has gone before!\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'frightening scenes', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Barry J.
