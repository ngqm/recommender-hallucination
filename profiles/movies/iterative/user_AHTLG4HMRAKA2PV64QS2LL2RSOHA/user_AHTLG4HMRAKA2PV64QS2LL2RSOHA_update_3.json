This is the second prequel to the original Star Wars trilogy takes place ten years after the events of Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace.  Nice action, great duels. Fun & exciting. Poor acting though and the CGI animation was still in the infancy stage. It was fun watching Anakin as a hot tempered impatient teenager. LoL.<br /><br />A must have DVD for your Star Wars collection.\nGreat movie. Great Star Wars scenes.\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'frightening scenes', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a)', 'Italiano', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', '\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e', 'Portugu\u00eas', 'Deutsch', 'Fran\u00e7ais'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', '\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629', '\u010ce\u0161tina', 'Dansk', 'Deutsch', '\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a)', 'Suomi', 'Filipino', 'Fran\u00e7ais', '\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea', '\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940', 'Magyar', 'Indonesia', 'Italiano', '\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e', '\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4', 'Bahasa Melayu', 'Norsk Bokm\u00e5l', 'Nederlands', 'Polski', 'Portugu\u00eas (Brasil)', 'Portugu\u00eas (Portugal)', 'Rom\u00e2n\u0103', '\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439', 'Svenska', '\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bcd', '\u0c24\u0c46\u0c32\u0c41\u0c17\u0c41', '\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22', 'T\u00fcrk\u00e7e', '\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7b80\u4f53\uff09', '\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7e41\u9ad4\uff09'], 'Directors': ['Jodie Foster', 'So Yong Kim', 'Charlie McDowell', 'Tim Mielants', 'Mark Romanek', 'Andrew Stanton', 'Dearbhla Walsh', 'Ti West'], 'Producers': ['Nathaniel Halpern', 'Matt Reeves', 'Rafi Crohn', 'Adam Kassan', 'Mark Romanek', 'Mattias Montero', 'Samantha Taylor Pickett', 'Adam Berg', 'Robert Petrovicz', 'Simon Stalenhag', 'Mark Lafferty', 'Ellen Rutter'], 'Starring': ['Rebecca Hall', 'Paul Schneider', 'Duncan Joiner']}\nSlow moving, a bit weired, sci-fi story that leaves you with some important unaswered questions. I love scifi but many films and stories just can't cut it. I thought I would not even get through the first episode. But the more I watched it the more interesting it got. Each episode is its own story, but is also connected to the people and events of all the other episodes. The last eposide really got to me and was in tears. No spoilers, watch them all. The only dislike or warning is: no true details or explanations given for many things that happen in this show. very little true back stories or explanations.<br />If you found my  review helpful, kindly vote below so I can improve my future reviews.\nSlow burn, but worth watching\nMy Spy\nYoung Adult Audience, Comedy, Charming, Optimistic\n['My Spy follows JJ, a hardened CIA operative (Dave Bautista), who has been demoted and finds himself at the mercy of a precocious 9-year old girl named Sophie (Chloe Coleman) after he is sent undercover to surveil her family.
