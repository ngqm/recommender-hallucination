Lewis and Laura are a couple. It was a long time coming, but worth the suspense. This is the last season on my watchlist, but I hope it isn't the end of the series. Will Hathaway really resign? Will Lewis really retire? Too many questions are left unanswered. There has to be more seasons of this great series. I am too hooked for it to be the end. Masterpiece Theater has some of the best shows on TV. I will keep watching in hopes of seeing all my favorites again.\nReview Title: Fantastic Series!!!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
