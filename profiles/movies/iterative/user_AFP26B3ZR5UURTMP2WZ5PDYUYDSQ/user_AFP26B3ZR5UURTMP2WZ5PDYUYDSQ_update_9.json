The scenery is fantastic of the English towns and countryside. The acting is superb. The plots are well executed and thought out. Love the character studies and watching how the relationships between the main characters develop over time. Just a great mystery series if you are a mystery buff.\nGreat Whodunit British series!\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Bill Anderson', 'Bille Eltringham', 'Dan Reed', 'Maurice Phillips', 'Richard Spence', 'Stuart Orme'], 'Producers': ['Chris Burt', 'Damien Timmer', 'Michele Buck', 'Rebecca Eaton', 'Ted Childs'], 'Starring': ['Clare Holman', 'Kevin Whately', 'Laurence Fox'], 'Studio': ['PBS']}\nGreat production with fantastic actors and acting.

It is so well directed and written. The acting is superb, and I love the locale. The way the plot is interwoven with all of the character studies always keeps me guessing who dunnit. Can't wait to see each time how the relationship between Lewis and Laura evolves. Overall, it is just a great entertaining series for mystery buffs.\nFantastic Series!\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Brian Kelly', \"David O'Neill\", 'Nicholas Renton', 'Tim Fywell'], 'Producers': ['Chris Burt', 'Damien Timmer', 'Michele Buck', 'Rebecca Eaton'], 'Starring': ['Clare Holman', 'Kevin Whately', 'Laurence Fox']}\nAnother great season of mystery and mayhem. Great directing, acting and writing on this show. Love the scenery and characterizations. Love seeing Lewis and Dr. Hobson taking their relationship to the next level, even though it is slow and steady. I hate it when each season ends. I can't get enough of this series.\nGreat Series\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Brian Kelly', 'Daniel Reed', 'Tim Fywell'], 'Producers': ['Chris Burt', 'Damien Timmer', 'Michele Buck', 'Rebecca Eaton'], 'Starring': ['Charlie Cox', 'Clare Holman', 'Kevin Whately'], 'Studio': ['PBS']}\nFinally! Lewis and Laura are a couple. It was a long time coming, but worth the suspense. This is the last season on my watchlist, but I hope it isn't the end of the series. Will Hathaway really resign? Will Lewis really retire? Too many questions are left unanswered. There has to be more seasons of this great series. I am too hooked for it to be the end. Masterpiece Theater has some of the best shows on TV. I will keep watching in hopes of seeing all my favorites again.\nFantastic Series!!!\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Logan Thomas'], 'Producers': ['Aric Cushing', 'Logan Thomas'], 'Starring': ['Aric Cushing', 'Juliet Landau', 'Dale Dickey'], 'Studio': ['Ascent Releasing Entertainment']}\nI thought this was a very well directed and suspenseful movie. The acting was good and the locale was a good choice. I wasn't really sure of what was going on until near the end, which was a plus for me.\nThe acting was good and the locale was a good choice\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': [\"Sloane U'Ren\"], 'Producers': ['Antony Neely', \"Sloane U'Ren\"], 'Starring': ['Henry Lloyd-Hughes', 'Camilla Rutherford', 'Patrick Godfrey'], 'Studio': ['GoDigital']}\nVery well acted and directed time travel film.\nFour Stars\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'frightening scenes', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Michael Rymer', 'Guillermo Navarro', 'Vincenzo Natali', 'David Slade', 'Tim Hunter', 'John Dahl', 'Peter Medak', 'James Foley', 'David Semel', 'Marc Jobst']}\nExcellent series!
