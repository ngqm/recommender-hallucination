But the chaos in the Seireitei is just one part of Muramasa\u2019s plan. His true objective lies in the World of the Living, and Ichigo is the key to his achieving it!', ']]>', 'Amazon.com', 'The 17th set of the hit fantasy-adventure', 'Bleach', 'comprises the second half of the \"Zanpakuto Unknown Tales Arc\" (episodes 230 to 265), an anime-only storyline. The Zanpakuto is both the weapon of a Soul Reaper and the mirror of his personality and strength. The appearance of the Zanpakuto as independent warriors threw the Soul Society into chaos in the first half of the adventure, but a series of unexpected revelations throws new light on those events. Ichigo and the Soul Reaper Captains continue their battle against Muramasa, the leader of the revolt. Centuries ago, this eerie, serpentine manifestation was the Zanpakuto of Koga, an extraordinarily powerful member of the Kuchiki clan, the family Rukia and Byakuya belong to. But Koga fell prey to arrogance, and the punishment for his crimes has stretched over the ages to the present day, threatening Ichigo and his friends in both the Seireitei and Karakura Town. Although the unexpected shifts in the plot give an added frisson of excitement to the battles, many of these episodes feel padded. The challenges, declarations, and boasts that precede the duels, while an essential part of', 'Bleach', '(and historic samurai culture), get a bit repetitious in the first episodes. And in the later ones, the viewer begins to wonder just how much killing Muramasa takes. The story concludes with a declaration of the singular bond between a Soul Reaper and a Zanpakuto that transcends even a samurai\\'s link to his swords. For once, Ichigo and Zangetsu, Byakuya, and Senbonzakura agree. After this adventure, director Noriyuki Abe and his crew returned to the storyline of Tite Kubo\\'s original manga with the 50-episode \"Arrancar: Downfall\" arc.
