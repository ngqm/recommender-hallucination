He is conflicted and obviously very torn between the love his has for monsters ( his slaver klancestors)  vs his struggle for white enlightenment about racism.<br />There were a few times wherein he described doing and saying racist things but \"unaware they were racists\".. the old \"unconscious racism\" line .. they attempt to cast whiteness in a light of \"well meaning.. just misguided\" light..<br /><br />Quite obviously whites who tell n** jokes and regarding others as \"lessors\" are WELL aware of their racism.. They just don't care... Another aspect is the constant use of thr word :slave.  Africans were never slaves.. They were free people who were \"enslaved\". Saying someone \"owned slaves\" takes culpability from the slaver..  Nobody is inherently a slave..it is an attempt to remove the humanity from the human being.<br /><br />The cringe moments were the lectures.. the white male lecturing on atrocities endured by Black people as if this were something new and just discovered. The sad reality is the white audience are more likely to take the accounts as \"legitimate\" from a white mans mouth.. vs when Black Americans speak on the history.. they are oft dismissed as \" complainers\" who need to \"move on\".<br /><br />white racists today are no different than their predecessors.. Today you hear them make a \"both sides\" argument.. about slavery.. Its like German Nazis making a \"both sides\" argument about the Holocaust\nReview Title: A duality of white Terrorism &  white Liberal naiveite\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

The white \"just-us\" system rounding up Black citizenry to \"work on state owned plantations\" ...... resulting in whites subjecting Black Americans to ugly savagery \"because they can\" and \"because it maintains their white wealth\" ..\"just for the sake of sadistic cruelty\" ..... is truly nothing short of parasitic barbarism.<br /><br />Hearing how a white woman allowed the feral white males in her family to repeatedly rape/ abuse a 5yr old girl (then \"wash away\" the evidence.) as her mother is raped a well.. literally made me sick and enraged.. Constantly beating these people and making them work around the clock.. all points to the question ..
