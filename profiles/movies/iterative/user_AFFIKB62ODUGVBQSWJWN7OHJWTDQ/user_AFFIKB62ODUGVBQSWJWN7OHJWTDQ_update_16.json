They are the Green Lantern Corps. When a new enemy called Parallax threatens to destroy the Universe, their fate and the fate of Earth lie in the hands of the Corps' newest recruit, the first human ever selected: Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds).

Much like', 'Thor', \", it isn't afraid to loosen up on the inner turmoil of its hero and go macro. Based on comic writer Geoff Johns's retrofitting of the title character, the story follows Hal Jordan (Reynolds), an impulsive test pilot whose encounter with a dying alien leaves him with an energy ring capable of weaponizing his imagination. While struggling to master his will-based powers, he must deal with threats both earthbound (a hilariously nebbishy Peter Saarsgard, who may be the first supervillain to rock a hoodie) and galactic. Martin Campbell, a director who specializes in more down-to-earth heroics (\", 'Casino Royale', ',', 'The Mask of Zorro', '), brings a pleasing matter-of-fact baseline to the proceedings, an approach that makes the increasingly outlandish effects truly feel special when they occur.', 'Green Lantern', 'has its debits, certainly--the lack of a memorable theme, a second act that hems and haws before getting to the action, the standard origin story shoehorning in too many secondary plots--but its final scenes succeed on a Gigantor, cosmic level where most superhero movies fear to tread.

The trio's performances in front of and behind the camera seem to indicate their wish for\", 'Spirit of Vengeance', 'to be regarded not as a sequel to the wan 2007', 'Ghost Rider', \"film, but rather an entity unto itself, and in truth, the picture does work overtime to distance itself from its predecessor, from its fast-and-loose origin rewrite at the picture's opening to its tonal shift towards darker, meaner territory. That doesn't entirely translate into a better film: though the script, based on a story by David S. Goyer (\", 'Blade', ',', 'Batman Begins', \"), bears greater resemblance to its comic book origins than its predecessor, its story, which sends the Ghost Rider on a mission to protect the son of Satan (Ciar\u00e1n Hinds), is unable to thread its diverse elements, which include a listless rendition of veteran heel Blackout (Johnny Whitworth), po-faced, high-tech monks led by Christopher Lambert, and Idris Elba's fighting priest, along with assorted exorcisms, rituals, and come-and-go powers, into a cohesive and believable film. That, of course, may make no difference to viewers who have come for the sheer spectacle, which, in spite of a greatly reduced budget, is provided in spades by Neveldine/Taylor's caffeinated direction and Cage's by-now trademark acting excesses (in his most unfettered moments, Cage approaches Klaus Kinski/Timothy Carey levels of scenery consumption). In doing so, they inject a sense of breakneck fun into the proceedings, regardless of its absurd elements, sorely lacking from the previous\", 'Ghost Rider', \"adventure.
