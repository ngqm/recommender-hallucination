I have many of the episodes taped, but as any avid &quot;tapers&quot; will notice, over the years they get fuzzy, jumpy, etc.  I am so THRILLED that they have finally put these jewels on DVD!  I love the clean storytelling, and I love the new twist on the old west story.  Season One really starts the story line off with Dr. Mike and Sully, as well as shows Micheala's knack at being a mother.  I can watch these shows a million times, and I'm crossing my fingers that they release the rest of the seasons!\nReview Title: Mad about Medicine Woman!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
