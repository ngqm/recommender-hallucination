What we don't know, is the possible agony that might have led her to her tales of love.<br /><br />This movie is beautiful and tragic all at the same time.  I loved the movie, but found myself hopelessly sad for the rest of the evening.  If you are single, please beware--this movie will leave you a little down, and not even a bowl of pasta can cure it's haunting message!  I highly recommend this movie, but want any woman who is hopelessly in love with love to beware!  You will most likely leave with cheeks wet, and eyes glistening with still to be shed tears.  Just know what you're getting yourself into!\nReview Title: Singletons--BEWARE\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I have many of the episodes taped, but as any avid &quot;tapers&quot; will notice, over the years they get fuzzy, jumpy, etc.  I am so THRILLED that they have finally put these jewels on DVD!  I love the clean storytelling, and I love the new twist on the old west story.  Season One really starts the story line off with Dr. Mike and Sully, as well as shows Micheala's knack at being a mother.  I can watch these shows a million times, and I'm crossing my fingers that they release the rest of the seasons!\nMad about Medicine Woman!\nBecoming Jane\nAnne Hathaway  (Actor),     James McAvoy  (Actor),     Julian Jarrold  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Studio Specials, Miramax Home Entertainment, All Titles\n['Anne Hathaway (The Devil Wears Prada, The Princess Diaries) gives a radiant performance as a young, love-struck Jane Austen in the witty and engaging romantic comedy Becoming Jane from Miramax Films.
