While things changed during this season, and you can sense it over the first seven to eight episodes, things finally seem to settle in to give you the full range of these characters we've all come to love.  As I watched the final episode, I felt content.  In a way, I felt as though there was more to come for both Rory and Lorelai, but they were all good things.  I guess you could say that even with things hanging a little, you knew these characters were just beginning a new chapter in their lives as well, and I was ready to wish them good luck!  If you love previous seasons, you'll get into these sooner or later and feel part of Stars Hollow and the Gilmore lives once again.\nReview Title: Ends Just Right\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I have many of the episodes taped, but as any avid &quot;tapers&quot; will notice, over the years they get fuzzy, jumpy, etc.  I am so THRILLED that they have finally put these jewels on DVD!  I love the clean storytelling, and I love the new twist on the old west story.  Season One really starts the story line off with Dr. Mike and Sully, as well as shows Micheala's knack at being a mother.  I can watch these shows a million times, and I'm crossing my fingers that they release the rest of the seasons!\nMad about Medicine Woman!\nBecoming Jane\nAnne Hathaway  (Actor),     James McAvoy  (Actor),     Julian Jarrold  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Studio Specials, Miramax Home Entertainment, All Titles\n['Anne Hathaway (The Devil Wears Prada, The Princess Diaries) gives a radiant performance as a young, love-struck Jane Austen in the witty and engaging romantic comedy Becoming Jane from Miramax Films.

I loved the movie, but found myself hopelessly sad for the rest of the evening.
