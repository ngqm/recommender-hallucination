When a young girl catches her sister in a passionate embrace with a childhood friend, her jealousy drives her to tell a lie that will irrevocably change the course of all their lives forever. Academy Award nominee Keira Knightley and James McAvoy lead an all-star cast in the film critics are hailing \"the year\\'s best picture\" (Thelma Adams, US Weekly).Bonus Content:', 'Deleted Scenes with Commentary by Director Joe Wright', 'Deleted Scenes with Commentary by Director Joe Wright', 'The Making of Atonement', 'The Making of Atonement', 'Novel to the Screen', 'Novel to the Screen', 'Feature Commentary with Director Joe Wright', 'Feature Commentary with Director Joe Wright', 'Amazon.com', 'Director Joe Wright (', 'Pride and Prejudice', ') gives Ian McEwan\\x92s bestselling novel a sumptuous treatment for the screen that should come to be regarded as one of the defining films of the epic romantic drama. Indeed, everything about this film stems from those three words: there is little here that is not epic, romantic, and dramatic, and', 'Atonement', 'is a film that masterfully expresses the overarching sense of adventure and emotion that such stories are meant to convey. In this instance, the story centers around the love story of highborn Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightley) and housekeeper\\x92s son Robbie Turner (James McAvoy, in a star-making turn), in England shortly before World War II. Despite their class differences, they are powerfully attracted to each other, and just as their relationship begins Robbie is tragically forced away due to false accusations from Cecilia\\x92s younger sister Briony (Saoirse Ronan). She has a crush on Robbie, too, and after reading a private letter he sent to Cecilia, and then witnessing the first expression of their mutual love but mistaking it for mistreatment, her resentment grows until it leads to her telling the lie that will send Robbie away. Soon World War II breaks out; Robbie enlists and is posted to France, Cecilia is a nurse in London, and Briony, now age 18 and aware of what she has done, tries to atone for her actions--but none of them will be able to get back what they have lost. Knightley and McAvoy are perfectly cast as the young star crossed lovers, and the young Ronan is particularly impressive, but it\\x92s clear that the real star of this film is the director. Wright allows', 'Atonement', 'to revel in every moment of its story and each scene is compelling in its own way, but that now famous extended shot with Robbie on the beach at Dunkirk--filmed in one take and sure to be considered one of the great long tracking shots in film history--is the most memorable moment in this remarkable film.', 'Atonement', 'is an excellent example of what can happen when a great book meets great filmmaking.

The cinematography alone in this great movie sold me on the way that visual images captured the emotion behind the message.  While Atonement, the movie, is about the tragic separation of two socially mismatched characters who fall in love (Keira's character is upper class, while James's character is the caretaker), the real message lies in the difficulty in explaining complicated, natural emotions and communication between mature adults.  I think that the artistic representation of how natural, human sexuality develops between two consenting adults can be misconstrued by children who are not yet prepared for it.  I think it is a reminder to us that while sexuality is natural and normal, that it is complicated and full of emotions that are much too complicated for children who are unable to process them.<br /><br />This is a beautiful film, and one that I will readily say that I loved every bit as much as the novel!\nBrilliant Complication of Life\nRobin Hood: The Complete Series\nJonas Armstrong  (Actor),     Richard Armitage  (Actor),     Alex Pillai  (Director),     Ciaran Donnelly  (Director)    &                   1                  more   Rated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, BBC, All BBC Titles\n['The complete series of the fantasy smash hit', 'Robin Hood', '--now in one gift set!

The acting is pretty good and the tension between Maid Marian and Robin Hood is keen in this series, which kept me watching!  While it didn't feel as heavy handed and dark as some recreations of this tale, it still had plenty of action and fighting sequences, with a storyline that built on itself from episode to episode.<br /><br />One side note.  Guy Gisborne is played by Richard Armitage, the amazing and talented actor from the BBC production of North and South.  His Guy Gisborne is so complex, dark, and brooding that you somehow manage to feel sorry for him a time or two.  If you're a fan of Robin Hood or British television, I would give this series a try.<br /><br />Packaging note:  This came in a boxed set, but each season is individually included in the box.
