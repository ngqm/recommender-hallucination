I have seen most of the other versions of Pride and Prejudice and read the book; but this version is the 'best'.  It follows the book closely.  Every member of the cast is 'perfect.  I never get tired of seeing it again.\nI love it.\nThe Swan (Remaster)\nGrace Kelly  (Actor),     Alec Guinness  (Actor),     Charles Vidor  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, MGM Home Entertainment, All MGM Titles\n[\"Grace Kelly is gloriously, glamorously regal in this retelling of Ferenc Molnar's romantic fable about a shy princess whose head tells her to wed a worldly Crown Prince (Alec Guinness), but whose heart is drawn to a dashing commoner (Louis Jourdan). Garbed in dreamy Helen Rose gowns, surrounded by Mittel-European opulence, the leading lady dances, duels, flirts, falls in love and makes even the most jaded moviegoer want to believe in fairy tales. And just to prove that fairy tales can come true, Kelly became a real-life princess as The Swan went into release, marrying Prince Rainier of Monaco in a magnificent royal wedding that captured the world's imagination.\"]\n{'Genre': 'Comedy', 'Format': 'Full Screen, NTSC, Original recording remastered', 'Contributor': 'Alec Guinness, Grace Kelly, Charles Vidor, Agnes Moorehead, Van Dyke Parks, Estelle Winwood, Louis Jourdan, Jessie Royce Landis, Brian Aherne, Leo G.
