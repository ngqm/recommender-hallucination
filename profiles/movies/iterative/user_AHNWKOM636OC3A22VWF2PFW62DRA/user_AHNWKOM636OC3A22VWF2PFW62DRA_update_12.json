Mr. Gameau was able to put together the story of sugar in a way that is interesting and horrifying at the same time.  As someone who was recently diagnosed as diabetic, I wish I had seen this a long time ago. Perhaps I would have made different choices and avoided this disease altogether.\nReview Title: Great documentary!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
