His performance suffers on all fronts. The film isn't a disaster, but it's safe to predict completist fans will make up most of its viewers. In the earlier film, Prince (known as the Kid) was fighting for his place on stage. This time he's fighting to keep his club safe from the money-grubbing hands of his musical rival, the Time's Morris Day, now a nightclub mogul. Day embodies spiritual, sexual, and economic corruption, while the Kid stands for salvation through music and a more redemptive form of lust.\", 'The graffiti bridge conceit--a metaphor for a place of rejuvenation and artistic inspiration--is intriguing.
