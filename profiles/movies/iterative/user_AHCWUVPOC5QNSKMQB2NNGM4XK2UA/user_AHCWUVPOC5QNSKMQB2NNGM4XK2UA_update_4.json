And many refer to it as a Fairy Tale and yet for me, personally, I viewed it as something very real, and THAT is what made it magical.<br />For I have experienced, or known of, many things that many may find unbelievable, or coincidental, or magical and yet they were the Orchestration (pun intended) beyond our own thinking.<br /><br />And that magical wonder; that purposeful Orchestration is there all the time..all we have to do is listen.\nReview Title: My heart was pounding and I gripped my armchair much of the time\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I had no idea what was even out there or what I would like to watch!<br />I had a plane trip coming up and wanted to get some for the trip as well as to have with me to view so I didn't want anything that would be offensive to anyone near me on the plane.<br /><br />Yes, it's sad, but so are lots of things in life but this is a different kind of sadness. It's a sadness that also comes with great joy because it reached its full cycle and you felt that fulfillment. You also felt its purpose, and the love.<br /><br />I think for some to comment that it was 'predictable' miss the point. Much in life is predictable. For me, I don't care that some things are predictable; or simplified, or maybe not even 'realistic'. I can get reality in the day to day. To watch a movie is to become involved deeply with so many levels of the movie and to glean from it whatever message you are receiving at that time.<br /><br />I enjoyed Morgan's wife in the movie and the relationship he had with her. Of course she is going to get mad at him; be frustrated, concerned and then absolutely shocked and bewildered when he announced his plans. But, she also showed great trust, and love and knew that whatever he was needing to do, it's what he needed to do and let it go. Let him go. I enjoyed those intimate scenes. People need to see great strength and trust between two people.<br /><br />I also found myself hanging on the edge of my seat when Morgan was at the bar and the beautiful lady came up and sat next to him. I found myself thinking that if MORGAN (the actor - not even the character!) 'gave in', then I would change how I felt about him (however irrational since it was his character, not him). I held my breath in anticipation...<br />Now, whether Morgan had any say so on the outcome of that scene or whether that was how the script was written anyway, it made a world of difference to me. And if Morgan did have a say so, well, all the more reason why I esteem him so highly.<br /><br />I thought it was a wonderful movie and am so glad I got to see it.\nTwo of my favorites together for an unforgettable movie\nGran Torino\nClint Eastwood  (Actor, Director),     Brian Haley  (Actor)    Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Studio Specials, Warner Home Video, All Titles\n[\"A disgruntled Korean War vet, Walt Kowalski (Eastwood), sets out to reform his neighbor, a young Hmong teenager, who tried to steal Kowalski's prized possession: his 1972 Gran Torino.\"]\n{'Aspect Ratio': '1.33:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.25 x 0.5 inches; 3.2 Ounces', 'Director': 'Clint Eastwood', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, Full Screen, NTSC', 'Run time': '1 hour and 56 minutes', 'Release date': 'June 9, 2009', 'Actors': 'Clint Eastwood, Brian Haley, Christopher Carley, Geraldine Hughes', 'Studio': 'Warner Home Video', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nI hadn't seen in a movie in..drum roll please..six years.

I had no idea what was even out there or what I would like to watch!<br />I had a plane trip coming up and wanted to get some for the trip.<br />When I went to Amazon's DVD page, Gran Torino was showing and of course, since I'm a huge Clint Eastwood fan, it was my choice.<br />I'm stunned as to what to say and I can't really add anything that other reviewers have not already said. BTW, I concur completely with Robert Crawford's absolutely beautiful review as that says it all so well.<br /><br />The unfolding of the layers to this crotchety, bitter man is what is so special and yet at the same time so sad that this is what his sons will never know, never experience is one that hit the 'closest to home' for me and much of the sadness that I did feel in this movie. The loss. The waste.<br /><br />I also want to comment on how much I enjoyed the actress who played Sue - the girl next door. She was a fabulous actress and you adored her instantly. Conversely, I had a bit more of a difficult time 'believing' the character of the boy until much more into the movie.<br /><br />Clint is still so very handsome - one scene where he puts on a nice jacket and has a close shave and no matter his age, he's still 'got it'.<br /><br />Yes, the old man thought long and hard and came up with the winning solution to a very real and very gruesome problem. And along with that, he buried the demons haunting his heart and mind for all those years.<br /><br />The movie is sad? Yes, but the saddest part of all is that it's a reality that is a part of so many peoples' lives all the time.\nleft me feeling utterly distraught\nAugust Rush\nKirsten Sheridan  (Director),     Freddie Highmore  (Actor),     Keri Russell  (Actor)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Musicals & Performing Arts, Musicals\n['Product Description', 'August Rush (WS/FS/DVD)', 'Separated by events they could not control but bound by love and by music, three people search for what they lost and what will make their lives complete ... each other.
