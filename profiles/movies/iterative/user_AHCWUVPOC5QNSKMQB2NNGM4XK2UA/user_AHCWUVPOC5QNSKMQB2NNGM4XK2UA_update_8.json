I'm also glad to really like the lead actor, Titus Welliver, in this role. This is a great role for him. So often you see him play a character that you just hate, but not this time - I LOVE Bosch. What a great detective! The added interest of his past makes him all the more intriguing and this series has captured my full attention.<br />Great job!\nReview Title: So far, so fabulous!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

It's a sadness that also comes with great joy because it reached its full cycle and you felt that fulfillment. You also felt its purpose, and the love.<br /><br />I think for some to comment that it was 'predictable' miss the point. Much in life is predictable. For me, I don't care that some things are predictable; or simplified, or maybe not even 'realistic'. I can get reality in the day to day. To watch a movie is to become involved deeply with so many levels of the movie and to glean from it whatever message you are receiving at that time.<br /><br />I enjoyed Morgan's wife in the movie and the relationship he had with her. Of course she is going to get mad at him; be frustrated, concerned and then absolutely shocked and bewildered when he announced his plans. But, she also showed great trust, and love and knew that whatever he was needing to do, it's what he needed to do and let it go. Let him go. I enjoyed those intimate scenes. People need to see great strength and trust between two people.<br /><br />I also found myself hanging on the edge of my seat when Morgan was at the bar and the beautiful lady came up and sat next to him. I found myself thinking that if MORGAN (the actor - not even the character!) 'gave in', then I would change how I felt about him (however irrational since it was his character, not him). I held my breath in anticipation...<br />Now, whether Morgan had any say so on the outcome of that scene or whether that was how the script was written anyway, it made a world of difference to me. And if Morgan did have a say so, well, all the more reason why I esteem him so highly.<br /><br />I thought it was a wonderful movie and am so glad I got to see it.\nTwo of my favorites together for an unforgettable movie\nGran Torino\nClint Eastwood  (Actor, Director),     Brian Haley  (Actor)    Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Studio Specials, Warner Home Video, All Titles\n[\"A disgruntled Korean War vet, Walt Kowalski (Eastwood), sets out to reform his neighbor, a young Hmong teenager, who tried to steal Kowalski's prized possession: his 1972 Gran Torino.\"]\n{'Aspect Ratio': '1.33:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.25 x 0.5 inches; 3.2 Ounces', 'Director': 'Clint Eastwood', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, Full Screen, NTSC', 'Run time': '1 hour and 56 minutes', 'Release date': 'June 9, 2009', 'Actors': 'Clint Eastwood, Brian Haley, Christopher Carley, Geraldine Hughes', 'Studio': 'Warner Home Video', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nI hadn't seen in a movie in..drum roll please..six years.

I had no idea what was even out there or what I would like to watch!<br />I had a plane trip coming up and wanted to get some for the trip.<br />When I went to Amazon's DVD page, Gran Torino was showing and of course, since I'm a huge Clint Eastwood fan, it was my choice.<br />I'm stunned as to what to say and I can't really add anything that other reviewers have not already said. BTW, I concur completely with Robert Crawford's absolutely beautiful review as that says it all so well.<br /><br />The unfolding of the layers to this crotchety, bitter man is what is so special and yet at the same time so sad that this is what his sons will never know, never experience is one that hit the 'closest to home' for me and much of the sadness that I did feel in this movie. The loss. The waste.<br /><br />I also want to comment on how much I enjoyed the actress who played Sue - the girl next door. She was a fabulous actress and you adored her instantly. Conversely, I had a bit more of a difficult time 'believing' the character of the boy until much more into the movie.<br /><br />Clint is still so very handsome - one scene where he puts on a nice jacket and has a close shave and no matter his age, he's still 'got it'.<br /><br />Yes, the old man thought long and hard and came up with the winning solution to a very real and very gruesome problem. And along with that, he buried the demons haunting his heart and mind for all those years.<br /><br />The movie is sad? Yes, but the saddest part of all is that it's a reality that is a part of so many peoples' lives all the time.\nleft me feeling utterly distraught\nAugust Rush\nKirsten Sheridan  (Director),     Freddie Highmore  (Actor),     Keri Russell  (Actor)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Musicals & Performing Arts, Musicals\n['Product Description', 'August Rush (WS/FS/DVD)', 'Separated by events they could not control but bound by love and by music, three people search for what they lost and what will make their lives complete ... each other.

August is a child prodigy who excels beyond even the wildest expectations and earns the opportunity of a lifetime--a chance to perform in front of an enormous audience in New York\\'s Central Park. The question is; can his performance possibly reach the audience August really craves?

What began as just needing something to watch (and for free streaming) ended up as an absolute obsession.<br />In the beginning of Season 1, it took a few episodes before deciding if it was worth my time. Was David Giuntoli just another pretty face or did this show have any possibility?<br />First, let me tell you that as Season 1 wrapped up and I got wrapped up in Season 2, not only did the star, Nick, played by David Giuntoli prove to be a terrific actor - but the actors together do a superb job. I really like Hank, played by Russell Hornsby all the more once he was &#34;in the loop&#34; as to the real goings-on; and the development of the Captain's character was a nice turn of events. The character, Monroe, played by Silas W. Mitchell is the real maker of the show, because without him, it would be missing the element of humor and charm. And I love the addition of Rosalee! She's superb. The only character that's flawed is Juliette, who I found not only annoying, but her acting is sub-par and took away from the show. Everyone else made up for it though.<br />The writing, storyline, acting, makeup, special effects and scenery make this Season 2 of Grimm the best. I stayed up late last night to watch three in a row if that tells you anything!<br />(I do not recommend for children - let it be for adults only, in my opinion)\nWhat started as just needing something (free) to watch grew into an obsession and one of my all-time faves!\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Kristi Jacobson', 'Lori Silverbush'], 'Producers': ['Julie Goldman', 'Ryan Harrington', 'Kristi Jacobson', 'Lori Silverbush'], 'Starring': ['Jeff Bridges', 'Tom Colicchio'], 'Studio': ['Magnolia Pictures']}\nCompletely missed the mark - didn't show the real problems nor the real solutions and threw in enough truth to grab your emotions while enough political bulls*t to be a complete turnoff.<br />I would love to have a one-on-one conversation with Jeff Bridges to show him the real problems and some real solutions. The Government is not the answer, nor should it be. I agree that the Government is certainly a part of the PROBLEM - no doubt.<br />Becoming more self reliant and sustainable and returning to more the 'natural' human is where the answer lies. Read Michael Bunker's book, &#34;Surviving Off Off-Grid&#34; for starters.<br />I myself have taught a 2 hr class on sprouting - for ULTIMATE NUTRITION for only pennies a day, which can be done in any living situation. Victoria Boutenko (see her books here on Amazon), as an individual, has traveled the world over, to some of the most 3rd world countries where  people truly ARE starving, and where they have no resources and showed them how to grow the most NUTRITIOUS foods on the planet for very little cost and effort and to provide enough for their village - not just to survive and get by, but to THRIVE in good health and to be enough for them ALL.<br /><br />This movie missed the mark. While I do recommend that people see it to understand some things - though NOT the things mentioned in the movie - but to basically see the MISCONCEPTIONS and how things are being skewed, I do recommend that people know just how many people in this country are facing these issues. I simply see the issues as being completely different than what is presented in this film\nI would love to have a one-on-one conversation with Jeff Bridges to ...\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium', 'Espa\u00f1ol', 'Deutsch'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', 'Deutsch', 'Espa\u00f1ol'], 'Directors': ['Alex Zakrzewski', 'Ernest R.
