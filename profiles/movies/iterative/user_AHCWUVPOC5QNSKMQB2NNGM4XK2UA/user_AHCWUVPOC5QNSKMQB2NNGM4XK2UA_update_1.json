ANY movie.<br />As I bought myself a portable DVD player for Christmas for business use and for travel, I of course needed to get some movies!<br />AHHHH!!!!!!!! I had no idea what was even out there or what I would like to watch!<br /><br />I had a plane trip coming up and wanted to get some for the trip as well as to have with me to view so I didn't want anything that would be offensive to anyone near me on the plane and I wanted to be sure to order some clean-cut family type ones for visiting once I got there.<br /><br />I read all the reviews on this one and was not disappointed. As the others have said, the scenery, the actors, the warmth and beauty of it as well as the story made it all worthwhile.\nReview Title: Really enjoyed it and would recommend\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
