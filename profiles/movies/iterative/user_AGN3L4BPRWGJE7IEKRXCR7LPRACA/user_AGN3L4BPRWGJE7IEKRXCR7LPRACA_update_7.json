(2001, Best Animated Short Film, FOR THE BIRDS), it\\'s FINDING NEMO, a hilarious adventure where you\\'ll meet colorful characters that take you into the breathtaking underwater world of Australia\\'s Great Barrier Reef. Nemo, an adventurous young clownfish, is unexpectedly taken to a dentist\\'s office aquarium. It\\'s up to Marlin (Albert Brooks), his worrisome father, and Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a friendly but forgetful regal blue tang fish, to make the epic journey to bring Nemo home. Their adventure brings them face-to-face with vegetarian sharks, surfer dude turtles, hypnotic jellyfish, hungry seagulls, and more. Marlin discovers a bravery he never knew, but will he be able to find his son?

A good place to start is the filmmakers\\' jolly commentary track, which branches off into 31 minutes of behind-the-scene stuff, deleted scenes, and curious anecdotes (they can also be watched separately). Pixar\\'s first making-of documentary is a most concise and interesting 25-minute examination that also sheds light on how the company works. With a digital-to-digital transfer, the film looks great and is available in widescreen or reformatted to full screen. The \"Family Fun\" disc includes another Pixar made-for-the-DVD gem, the 7-minute \"Exploring the Reef\" with Jean-Michel Cousteau (Jacques\\'s son) being upstaged by Dori and Marlin; it\\'s a hoot and teaches a fact or two you will remember about reefs.
