Famine is widespread, and all of mankind\\'s resources are now dedicated to farming in a desperate fight for survival. A former NASA pilot and engineer named Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) has become a homesteader in order to support his teenage son Tom (Timothee Chalamet) and 10-year-old daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy). Unfortunately, even that begins to look like a futile endeavor after a sandstorm ravages their close-knit community. Meanwhile, a seemingly supernatural mystery begins to unfold when the \"ghost\" that dwells in Murph\\'s room sends her a mysterious set of coordinates - which lead the curious father/daughter duo to a clandestine underground base housing the remnants of NASA. There, renowned physicist Professor Brand (Michael Caine) has been working with a team of astronauts and scientists to find a new planet capable of sustaining human life. Brand quickly persuades Cooper to pilot a mission that will hopefully carry the seeds of human life to a habitable planet in another galaxy. Cooper is soon bound for space with Brand\\'s daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway) and researchers Doyle (Wes Bentley) and Romilly (David Gyasi).']\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 2.72 Ounces', 'Item model number': '43381941', 'Media Format': 'NTSC', 'Run time': '2 hours and 48 minutes', 'Release date': 'January 7, 2020', 'Actors': 'Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Matthew McConaughey, Michael Caine, Ellen Burstyn', 'Dubbed': 'French, Spanish', 'Studio': 'PARAMOUNT', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: Great movie.....but then again.....how many times is a Matthew McConaughey movie a flop?\nReview Title: Great movie\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
