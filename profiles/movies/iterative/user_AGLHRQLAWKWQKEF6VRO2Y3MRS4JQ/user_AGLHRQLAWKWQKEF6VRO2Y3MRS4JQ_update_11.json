At one point everyone jumped.  It was great.<br />The plot was delightful.<br />The humor was on point, with most of the audience laughing aloud.

If you actually respect him, avoid this film at all costs.  If Christ's life prior to the crucifixion is missing, then the story is pointless.  His great lessons are missing.  The sermon on the mount is reduced to one line.  And the most important point is missing -- CHRIST CHOSE THE CROSS.  Here, he is portrayed as a victim, dragged around by the jew-mob (there isn't a character there, just a mass-mob) completely unable to do a thing.  The focus isn't on Christ's message, love, pacificm, or teachings, it's a sensationalist view of his suffering, which doesn't fit well with the Christ story.\nAn affront to Christ\nYu-Gi-Oh! // Movie - Capsule Monsters / Part 1 [DVD]\n*  (Actor, Director)    Rated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Science Fiction, Animation\n['Saving the world from destruction week after week is not an easy task, so when Joey wins an exotic trip for four, Yugi and his friends decide to take a much needed vacation\\x85or so they think!

The pacing is perfect.  The story is perfect.  The characters--well you know the characters.  The puzzles are great.  The only tiny thing missing was Kaiba.  As much as the original series was super fantastic wonderful, this one takes it up a notch.  I rented it and now I'm buying two copies.  I'm floored by what a good job they did.  The theatrical release has nothing on this.  This is what should have been in the movies.  This is good.  Buy it.  Watch it a dozen times.

He wants to train to fight dragons himself, but he's a skinny little boy, barely suited to the task.<br /><br />When he finally does get his chance to kill a dragon, he learns very little is what it first seems, and that is true of himself as much as it is true about the dragons.<br /><br />Thematically, this is about acceptance, and self-acceptance.  It's about using one's unique skills to succeed.  It's about looking deaper for the truth.<br /><br />In tone, it's hillarious.  One character, on speaking of why they're going to hunt dragons, says \"We're vikings.  It's an occupational hazzard.\"  It's suited to small children, even sensitive small children.

Shot in a picturesque garden overlooking the Pacific Ocean, the standing Burn & Firm program is designed to elevate your heart rate as is tones your upper body, lifts your seat, shapes your legs and strengthens your core. It starts with isometric conditioning using small controlled movements and then layers on larger low impact moves designed to build heat with a vigorous flow. This combination will help increase your energy level and sculpt the slim, well-proportioned physique (or silhouette) of a dancer. The Lengthen & Strengthen program is a dynamic combination of standing bare work and floor work focused on tightening and toning very precisely targeted areas to create a balanced body that is long, strong and lean.']\n{'Genre': 'Exercise & fitness - barre method, Exercise & fitness - barre method', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Sadie Lincoln, Andrea Ambandos', 'Language': 'English', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 9 minutes', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'Unrated (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 2.08 Ounces', 'Audio Description': 'English', 'Item model number': '28125333', 'Director': 'Andrea Ambandos', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Run time': '1 hour and 9 minutes', 'Release date': 'December 3, 2013', 'Actors': 'Sadie Lincoln', 'Studio': 'Lionsgate', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nThere are two workouts on this video.  Burn and Firm is focused on conditioning the body through a tightly controlled isometric workout.  You won't find complex choreography work here.  You won't find &#34;tie yourself in a human knot&#34; type yoga poses.  You will find a really solid workout that leaves you feeling it the next day.  Each of the workouts automatically adjusts itself to your level as your form improves.  Lengthen and Strengthen reminds me of dance class more than yoga.  It is focused on improving both flexibility and balance.<br /><br />These are good for the beginner, as well as those returning to yoga or dance.\nStraightforward and effective workouts\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Yoshitomo Yonetani'], 'Producers': ['Kazutaka Akimoto', 'K\u00f4ichi Inaba', 'Tokio Inoue', 'Kazumi Kawashiro', 'Muneyuki Kii', 'Joshua Lopez', 'Chika Matsui', 'Yasuo Miyakawa', 'Masayuki Ozaki']}\nI get this was true to the series and the franchise. The voice actors are the same, and great as always.<br /><br />Tiger is again the underestimated clown who wins more by grit and determination than raw power. Barnaby is still the cool, collected one who has more heart than he shows.<br /><br />Bison is played the fool a little more in this one, taking a role once reserved for Origami Cyclone, who in turn has shown tremendous growth as a result of the events of the first series. Dragon Kid and Blue Rose are a little underused -- fair enough given it's a movie, with the tune limits that implies. Fire Emblem gets some intense moments. He has a wonderful line, &#34;If a man is made of courage and a woman is made of love, gay people must be invincible.&#34; This might have been more impressive if he weren't knocked flat moments later.<br /><br />I really hope this means they're relaunching the series.

He trains.  The Z-fighters train.  They come together in an exceedingly predictable fight and kick the snot out of each other.<br /><br />And it is so much fun.  Beerus is a trip the entire time.  Vegeta is at the top of his form, so much better than the last movie, Goku is that crazy combination of serious and funny that makes him so delightful and Krillian kicks it old school.  This is the movie for a grab a beer and shut of the brain night after a hard day of work.  This is pure fun, total brain candy, and absolutely worth it.
