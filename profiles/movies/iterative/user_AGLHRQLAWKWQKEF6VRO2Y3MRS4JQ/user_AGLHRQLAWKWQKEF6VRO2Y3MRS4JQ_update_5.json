Burn and Firm is focused on conditioning the body through a tightly controlled isometric workout.  You won't find complex choreography work here.  You won't find &#34;tie yourself in a human knot&#34; type yoga poses.  You will find a really solid workout that leaves you feeling it the next day.  Each of the workouts automatically adjusts itself to your level as your form improves.  Lengthen and Strengthen reminds me of dance class more than yoga.  It is focused on improving both flexibility and balance.<br /><br />These are good for the beginner, as well as those returning to yoga or dance.\nReview Title: Straightforward and effective workouts\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

If you actually respect him, avoid this film at all costs.  If Christ's life prior to the crucifixion is missing, then the story is pointless.  His great lessons are missing.  The sermon on the mount is reduced to one line.  And the most important point is missing -- CHRIST CHOSE THE CROSS.  Here, he is portrayed as a victim, dragged around by the jew-mob (there isn't a character there, just a mass-mob) completely unable to do a thing.  The focus isn't on Christ's message, love, pacificm, or teachings, it's a sensationalist view of his suffering, which doesn't fit well with the Christ story.\nAn affront to Christ\nYu-Gi-Oh! // Movie - Capsule Monsters / Part 1 [DVD]\n*  (Actor, Director)    Rated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Science Fiction, Animation\n['Saving the world from destruction week after week is not an easy task, so when Joey wins an exotic trip for four, Yugi and his friends decide to take a much needed vacation\\x85or so they think!

The pacing is perfect.  The story is perfect.  The characters--well you know the characters.  The puzzles are great.  The only tiny thing missing was Kaiba.  As much as the original series was super fantastic wonderful, this one takes it up a notch.  I rented it and now I'm buying two copies.  I'm floored by what a good job they did.  The theatrical release has nothing on this.  This is what should have been in the movies.  This is good.  Buy it.  Watch it a dozen times.

He wants to train to fight dragons himself, but he's a skinny little boy, barely suited to the task.<br /><br />When he finally does get his chance to kill a dragon, he learns very little is what it first seems, and that is true of himself as much as it is true about the dragons.<br /><br />Thematically, this is about acceptance, and self-acceptance.  It's about using one's unique skills to succeed.  It's about looking deaper for the truth.<br /><br />In tone, it's hillarious.  One character, on speaking of why they're going to hunt dragons, says \"We're vikings.  It's an occupational hazzard.\"  It's suited to small children, even sensitive small children.  Adults will enjoy it too.\nGreat fun for kids and adults\nElement: Barre Conditioning\nSadie Lincoln  (Actor),     Andrea Ambandos  (Director)    Rated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Exercise & Fitness\n['Grace meets athleticism in these two innovative workouts.
