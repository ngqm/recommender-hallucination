The pacing is perfect.  The story is perfect.  The characters--well you know the characters.  The puzzles are great.  The only tiny thing missing was Kaiba.  As much as the original series was super fantastic wonderful, this one takes it up a notch.  I rented it and now I'm buying two copies.  I'm floored by what a good job they did.  The theatrical release has nothing on this.  This is what should have been in the movies.  This is good.  Buy it.  Watch it a dozen times.  If you like Yu-Gi-Oh you will love this.\nReview Title: Anime Perfection\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

If you actually respect him, avoid this film at all costs.  If Christ's life prior to the crucifixion is missing, then the story is pointless.  His great lessons are missing.  The sermon on the mount is reduced to one line.  And the most important point is missing -- CHRIST CHOSE THE CROSS.  Here, he is portrayed as a victim, dragged around by the jew-mob (there isn't a character there, just a mass-mob) completely unable to do a thing.  The focus isn't on Christ's message, love, pacificm, or teachings, it's a sensationalist view of his suffering, which doesn't fit well with the Christ story.\nAn affront to Christ\nYu-Gi-Oh! // Movie - Capsule Monsters / Part 1 [DVD]\n*  (Actor, Director)    Rated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Science Fiction, Animation\n['Saving the world from destruction week after week is not an easy task, so when Joey wins an exotic trip for four, Yugi and his friends decide to take a much needed vacation\\x85or so they think!
