If you actually respect him, avoid this film at all costs.  If Christ's life prior to the crucifixion is missing, then the story is pointless.  His great lessons are missing.  The sermon on the mount is reduced to one line.  And the most important point is missing -- CHRIST CHOSE THE CROSS.  Here, he is portrayed as a victim, dragged around by the jew-mob (there isn't a character there, just a mass-mob) completely unable to do a thing.  The focus isn't on Christ's message, love, pacificm, or teachings, it's a sensationalist view of his suffering, which doesn't fit well with the Christ story.\nReview Title: An affront to Christ\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
