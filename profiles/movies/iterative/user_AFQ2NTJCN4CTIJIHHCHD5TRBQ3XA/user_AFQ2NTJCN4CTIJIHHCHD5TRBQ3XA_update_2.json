Speeding a Maserati through Paris, seducing women and paragliding over the Alps is just the beginning, as Driss turns the often humorous world of upper-class Parisian society upside-down. As this unlikely duo overcome adversity of every flavor in this true story, they also shatter their preconceptions of love, life and each other. Based on the #1 international best-selling book, \u201cYou Changed My Life.\u201d', 'Amazon.com', \"Driss (Omar Sy), a Senegalese man living in a Paris slum, applies for a job as caretaker to a wealthy quadriplegic, but all he wants is to get his paper stamped so he can get benefits. Despite his lack of qualifications, he lands the job because of his attitude: Philippe (Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet), the quadriplegic, wants a caretaker who will look at him without pity. As Driss reluctantly learns to move, feed, and clean Philippe, the two men discover a blunt but vital humor that not only bridges the cultural and class divide between them, but gives Philippe a renewed joy in life. It's easy to see what made\", 'The Intouchables', \"such a massive success in France; the movie has the sweet sincerity and uplifting conclusion that make for a classic feel-good experience. The chemistry between the two leads is undeniable, and Sy--who won the French equivalent of the Oscar for his role--is a dynamic and charismatic performer, while Cluzet's understated performance conveys Philippe's frustrations. The movie doesn't dig too deeply into the struggles of life as a quadriplegic or the struggles of life among the inner-city poor, so when\", 'The Intouchables', \"ends it's not likely to leave a lasting impression, but that doesn't get in the way of its immediate charm and warmth.\", '--Bret Fetzer']\n{'Genre': 'Drama, Comedy', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Omar Sy, Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet, Cyril Mendy, Eric Toledano, Olivier Nakache, Anne Le Ny, Salimata Kamate, Jos\u00e9phine de Meaux, Absa Diatou Toure, Dominique Daguier, Gr\u00e9goire Oestermann, Audrey Fleurot, Clotilde Mollet, Alba Ga\u00efa Kraghede BellugiOmar Sy, Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet, Cyril Mendy, Eric Toledano, Olivier Nakache, Anne Le Ny, Salimata Kamate, Jos\u00e9phine de Meaux, Absa Diatou Toure, Dominique Daguier, Gr\u00e9goire Oestermann, Audrey Fleurot, Clotilde Mollet, Alba Ga\u00efa Kraghede Bellugi  See more', 'Language': 'French (Dolby Digital 5.1)', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 52 minutes', 'Digital Copy Expiration Date': 'December 31, 2017', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.85:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 2.47 Ounces', 'Item model number': '26256632', 'Director': 'Eric Toledano, Olivier Nakache', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Run time': '1 hour and 52 minutes', 'Release date': 'March 5, 2013', 'Actors': 'Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet, Omar Sy, Anne Le Ny, Audrey Fleurot, Jos\u00e9phine de Meaux', 'Subtitles': 'Spanish', 'Studio': 'Sony Pictures Home Entertainment', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nOne of the absolutly best movies that I have ever seen.
