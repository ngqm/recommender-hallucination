No one who cares at all about the film should ever need to watch the original version again. Well, maybe the impatient and the squeamish will still prefer the theatrical version, because the extended edition makes a long film 30 minutes longer and there's a bit more violence (though both versions are rated PG-13). But the changes--sometimes whole scenes, sometimes merely a few seconds--make for a richer film. There's more of the spirit of J.R.R. Tolkien, embodied in more songs and a longer opening focusing on Hobbiton. There's more character development, and more background into what is to come in the two subsequent films, such as Galadriel's gifts to the Fellowship and Aragorn's burden of lineage.

If you were confused a bit by the movie since they did leave a lot of the explainatory backround out, then you will have a better understanding after watching this. The opening scene is extended, they give more information, the added scenes are amazing. It is like watching a whole new movie. I recommend that everyone if not watch this but own it!
