The ideals and the struggles this man goes through and how he has to work in the end to be himself, despite he never needed to work at all. I love the whole cast, the soundtrack everything. This is one of my favourite movies. I was surprised with how good it was.

No one who cares at all about the film should ever need to watch the original version again. Well, maybe the impatient and the squeamish will still prefer the theatrical version, because the extended edition makes a long film 30 minutes longer and there's a bit more violence (though both versions are rated PG-13). But the changes--sometimes whole scenes, sometimes merely a few seconds--make for a richer film. There's more of the spirit of J.R.R. Tolkien, embodied in more songs and a longer opening focusing on Hobbiton. There's more character development, and more background into what is to come in the two subsequent films, such as Galadriel's gifts to the Fellowship and Aragorn's burden of lineage. And some additions make more sense to the plot, or are merely worth seeing, such as the wood elves leaving Middle-earth or the view of Caras Galadhon (but sorry, there's still no Tom Bombadil). Extremely useful are the chapter menus that indicate which scenes are new or extended.\", 'Of the', 'four', \"commentary tracks, the ones with the greatest general appeal are the one by Jackson and cowriters Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, and the one by 10 cast members, but the more technically oriented commentaries by the creative and production staff are also worth hearing. The bonus features (encompassing two complete DVDs) are far superior to the largely promotional materials included on the theatrical release, delving into such matters as script development, casting, and visual effects. The only drawback is that the film is now spread over two discs, with a somewhat abrupt break following the council at Rivendell, due to the storage capacity required for the longer running time, the added DTS ES 6.1 audio, and the commentary tracks. But that's a minor inconvenience.

If you were confused a bit by the movie since they did leave a lot of the explainatory backround out, then you will have a better understanding after watching this.

However this one was surprisingly good. There are 3 rules and Frank - the transporter manages to break all of them on just one transport. The acting is okay. The fight scenes are originally but in some poorly choreographed, however the originality of it all makes up for anything the movie itself lacked.\nSurprisingly Good.\nBig Eden\nArye Gross  (Actor),     Eric Schweig  (Actor),     Thomas Bezucha  (Director, Writer)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Comedy\n['Product Description', 'Big Eden tells a truly original tale of a thirty-something gay guy, Henry Hart (Arye Gross, Ellen, Six Feet Under) who returns to his childhood Montana home to confront his unrequited passion for his high school best friend.
