Celtic rivals Kerra (Kelly Reilly) and Antedia (Zo\u00eb Wanamaker) must face the oncoming Roman invasion led by Aulus Plautius (David Morrissey) as it seeks to dismantle the Celtic Resistance.']\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['CHRISTOPH SCHREWE'], 'Producers': ['VERTIGO FILMS', 'NEAL STREET PRODUCTIONS'], 'Starring': ['DAVID MORRISSEY', 'KELLY REILLY', 'NIKOLAJ LIE KAAS']}\nI kept getting recommendations to watch this, and I honestly thought it was going to low budget and semi comedic spoof based on the production still. I never read video reviews, before watching because I don't want spoilers, and they are always so distorted in a way that is inaccurate, unfair, misleading, or simply not helpful to me. I very much enjoyed this story-line, and once again I was glad I hadn\u2019t read negative reviews before watching. I only started reading after watching the season to determine if there will be more to come. As for history, I wouldn't ever get my facts from a show to write a research paper. Productions like this are driven by people who want it to do well and hook viewers. These types of shows are loosely based on history, and I appreciate the effort to add a bit of historical precision to adaptations. I'm not looking for a history lesson, I want entertainment. History buffs should go make their own movie --then complain about another\u2019s. I love how critics claim ownership of historical \u201cfacts\u201d like they have a Tardis and were actually there at the time. I dream of an internet where people would FIRST make their own movie or whatever product they go online to malign. Then I might respect their opinion when comparing products. I'd enjoy seeing how people type about their work compared with another work. Perhaps they would not be so quick to judge, because they would better appreciate and fully understand why decisions are made. Alas, all the expertise they deem worthy is having a keyboard, an internet connection, and a presumption. If you look, you'll find MOST critics haven't actually written historical works of their own, nor have they ever made their own product, movie, or show about anything they claim to be such experts on. If they were truly erudite and passionate, you would have made their own adaptations by now.\nSo glad I finally watched this and did not read the negative reviews!\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Starring': ['Kristen Bell', 'Ted Danson', 'William Jackson Harper'], 'Studio': ['NBC']}\nI like the writing in the show, but I sure wish each episode was double the runtime. 20 minutes goes by too fast! I'm sure it makes it easier on the cast and production to do these type of short episodes though, so as long as they keep making the show I'll be happy.\nEnjoyable to follow\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Starring': ['Kenny Florian', 'Chris Rose']}\nThis seasons episodes are great and I love the extras!\nWOW!
