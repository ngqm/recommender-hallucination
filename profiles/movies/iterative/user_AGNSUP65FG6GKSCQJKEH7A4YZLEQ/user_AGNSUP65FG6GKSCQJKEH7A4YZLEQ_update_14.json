This collects the first two, and the best two stories of the tetralogy.<br /><br />THE HOUSE WITHOUT A CHRISTMAS TREE is the first story about Addie Mills, a spirited (and slightly bossy) 10-year-old who loves school and dreams of growing up to be an artist. Her mother died when she was a few months old, and she has been raised by her loving, slightly offbeat grandmother, and her taciturn, brooding father, who doesn't seem to have much love to give to his only daughter. He forbids a Christmas tree in the house during the holidays, and Addie, who desperately wants one, thinks it's because he's so &#34;parsimonious&#34; (that's one of her school vocabulary words). When she wins a tree, she will withstand an explosion of emotion that will shake her to her core.<br /><br />THIS IS JUST ONE OF THE BEST CHRISTMAS STORIES EVER. Addie isn't the usual cute little girl character so nauseatingly passed on by every sitcom and drama of the day: she's bright, not girly, determined, but of course has her faults. Lisa Lucas plays her to a T. Mildred Natwick glows as the supportive grandmother and a great supporting cast is included, but the star of this film is Jason Robards, who provides a stunning performance as the embittered father James Mills. He could have been a soulless bastard but instead Robards permits you see this man's internal pain even as you are startled at his bitterness and anger. The late 1940s atmosphere of the story is well done--the kids even say the Pledge to the Flag correctly--and it was filmed in rural Canada to try to come as close to the setting (rural Nebraska) as possible.<br /><br />THE THANKSGIVING TREASURE is a little more routine. While out getting air for her bike tires, Addie meets for the first time &#34;Old Man&#34; Rhenquist, a crotchety elderly man who is feuding with her dad over non-payment for James Mills' digging a pond for him. A curious Addie, under cover of cutting cattails and fall plants with her best friend, discovers Rhenquist has a horse, the one thing Addie has always wanted. She persuades her best friend Carla Mae to bring the old codger some Thanksgiving dinner after hearing her teacher lecture about the Pilgrims' first Thanksgiving feast, hoping to make friends (and of course get near the horse!).  However, it's Rhenquist Addie comes to treasure; he's becomes like a grandfather to her, telling her tales about &#34;the old days.&#34; The whole plot could have been terribly clich&eacute;, but Bernard Hughes as Rhenquist and Lisa Lucas as Addie rise above the clich&eacute; and make it worth watching. Again, Canadian landscape standing in for Nebraska countryside makes this look very authentic and the kids even do a radio play to cement the story in the late 1940s. Once again, the story is filmed on videotape, giving it that &#34;soap opera&#34; effect, but at the same time it gives it an immediacy as if you are really standing on the sidelines watching these folks.<br /><br />A super addition to anyone's holiday film library.\nReview Title: Two Classic Made-for-TV Movies\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Set in the swinging late 1960s, the Mothers-In-Law centers on the laugh-filled misadventures of longtime neighbors in suburban Los Angeles who become related to each other when their children suddenly get married. Legendary actress Eve Arden (Our Miss Brooks, Grease) stars as Eve Hubbard, the sophisticated wife of straight-laced lawyer Herb Hubbard (Herbert Rudley). Veteran comedienne Kaye Ballard plays Kaye Buell, the outspoken wife of bombastic television writer Roger Buell (Roger C. Carmel and Richard Deacon). to the dismay of their hapless husbands, the strong-willed mothers are determined to meddle in the lives of newlyweds Jerry (Jerry Fogel) and Suzie Hubbard (Deborah Walley).\", 'Amazon.com', 'The Mothers-in-Law', 'is one of those \"You had to be there\" shows, best appreciated by those who dimly but fondly remember this short-lived series. This was Desi Arnaz\\'s last TV series as a producer. As a swan song, it\\'s more \"We\\'re Having a Baby, My Baby and Me\" than \"Cuban Pete,\" but for a show that was hopelessly square even back in 1967 (as witness the cringe-worthy episode featuring the one-hit wonder band the Seeds, who perform said one hit, \"Pushin\\' Too Hard\"), it rates as a found treasure thanks to the crack timing and expert clowning of its stars. Show biz troupers Eve Arden and Kaye Ballard star as reserved and sophisticated Eve Hubbard and histrionic and overly emotional Kaye Buell. They are neighbors with an odd-couple friendship whose lives become further bound when their children, Eve\\'s daughter Susie (Deborah Walley) and Kaye\\'s son Jerry (Jerry Fogel), get married and move in to the Hubbards\\' garage. Arnaz did not attempt to reinvent the wheel with', 'The Mothers-in-Law', '. Created and written primarily by', 'I Love Lucy', 'scribes Bob Carroll Jr. and Madelyn Davis, the series takes several pages from the', 'Lucy', \"playbook. Arden and Ballard have a Lucy-Ethel chemistry. Arnaz, who directed many of the episodes, deftly stages the ladies' slapstick shenanigans. And just as Lucy never stopped plotting to get into husband Ricky's act, so do Eve and Kaye insist on meddling in their children's lives, much to the eye-rolling annoyance of their long-suffering husbands (Herbert Rudley and Roger C. Carmel). Several episodes also manage to work in comical production numbers to showcase the cast's talents.

In season 2, Carmel left the show in a salary dispute and was replaced Darrin-style with Richard Deacon, and not even the addition of grandchildren to the family mix could save the series. The extras on this eight-disc set are impressive. Baby boomers will get a nostalgic kick out of seeing the NBC peacock unfurl its feathers in \"living color,\" as well as period commercials.

Carmel's departure from the show. Richard Deacon did his usual good job, but he basically played Roger Buell the same way he played Mel Cooley, which completely changed Roger's personality and his relationship with wife Kaye. Ballard and Arden are quite funny together and some of the best episodes have an old-time radio flavor with delightful wordplay, such as the episode where the kids have a fight and eventually the entire group isn't speaking to each other. I enjoyed that episode so much I made an audio tape of it, and it held up quite well as an audio presentation.<br /><br />Everyone likens this series to I LOVE LUCY and it has certain LUCY riffs, but I also think of it as being a bit like the British series THE GOOD LIFE (a.k.a. GOOD NEIGHBORS) if the Ledbetters and the Goods had had children who married. The more conventional Hubbards are like the Ledbetters, and the Buells are as odd in their own way as the Goods.<br /><br />I hope some of the more classic 1960s and 1970s series will come to DVD, including the brillant HE AND SHE and MY WORLD AND WELCOME TO IT. I've heard a rumor that the 1975 ELLERY QUEEN series may be due out soon as well. These would be a great tonic to the \"reality show\" trend that infests our network broadcasts these days.\nPerhaps Not a \"Classic,\" But Still a Funny Series\nThe Horse Without A Head\nJean-Pierre Aumont  (Actor),     Herbert Lom  (Actor),     Don Chaffey  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment, All Disney Titles\n['When a kindly junk dealer gives a group of poor French children a headless toy horse, the kids dub themselves \"The Knights Of The Headless Horse.\" The broken toy becomes their only source of fun as they race down the narrow streets of their village.

Five poor children have only one toy, a large wooden headless hobbyhorse that the eldest boy's father found in an abandoned house. The children use it as sort of a \"thrill-ride\" down the steep streets of their town. In the meantime, a gang of thieves are planning to steal a bank shipment from the train that must slow down on a nearby curve, enlisting the help of a local peddler, who hides the key to the place the loot is stashed in the kids' horse. When they discover this, the thieves steal the horse and of course the children try to find it. Jean Pierre Aumont co-stars as the good-natured police inspector trying to find the thieves and the cash. The highlight of this movie is Pamela Franklin, who plays Marion. Marion has a special way with dogs; she cares for any stray she finds, then gives them homes, but before they leave her, they are taught to respond to her whistle. Needless to say, whenever the kids are in trouble, Marion's whistle brings a rescue pack of dogs in some very funny sequences. Franklin is bright and ingenuous in the role, foreshadowing her future lively performance in THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE.<br /><br />The film was based on a book by Paul Berna, and three sequels were written about the characters.\nFive Kids, a Hobbyhorse...and, Oh Yes, the Dogs!\nMercy Mission/Nowhere to Land [DVD]\nScott Bakula  (Actor),     Robert Loggia  (Actor),     Roger Young  (Director),     Armand Mastroianni  (Director)    &                   1                  more   Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Action & Adventure\n['Nowhere to Land, A pilot must safely land a 747 on which deadly nerve gas has been planted.

I have been wanting this movie on professional DVD for some years now, having relied on a VHS copy for so many years. This has been a Christmas favorite at our home since it was broadcast on NBC. However, don't worry, it doesn't contain cute elves, warm Santas, or bathotic family reunions; it just takes place at Christmas.<br /><br />Jay Parkins is a young pilot to whom flying takes first place, even to his responsibilities at home and his pregnant wife. After he's fired from a job for deliberately annoying the client, he and a fellow pilot agree to fly two crop dusting planes to Norfolk Island, deep in the Pacific Ocean. The plane his friend is flying malfunctions as they leave Pago Pago, but Jay continues, knowing he will need the fee for ferrying the plane when his son is born. Unfortunately his navigation equipment fouls, leaving him with no idea where he is, alone with the vast Pacific below. A nearby Air New Zealand commercial flight offers to help find him.<br /><br />If this all sounds tedious, it isn't. Scott Bakula as Parkins and Robert Loggia as senior Air New Zealand pilot Gordon Vette brilliantly carry this tense film, as Vette uses all his aviation wiles to locate Parkins' tiny plane, and both men form an emotional bond via anxious radio calls. Supporting characters such as Vette's cockpit crew, the head stewardess, Parkins' flying partner, and a planeful of New Zealanders returning from holiday all enhance the story and the tension until the gripping conclusion. If you like good character pieces this film is highly recommended; aviation buffs will probably love it, too.\nA Small Plane, A Large Ocean, and a Determined Pilot\nGalaxy Quest [Blu-ray]\nTim Allen  (Actor),     Sigourney Weaver  (Actor),     Dean Parisot  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG    Format: Blu-ray\nMovies & TV, Blu-ray, Movies\n['For four years, the courageous crew of the NSEA protector - \"Commander Peter Quincy Taggart\" (Tim Allen), \"Lt.

It is representative of fandom for any popular cultural icon, going back to when 19th century \"fan fiction\" sequels were written to Jane Austen novels, girls re-enacted memorable romantic poetry scenes (think the \"Lady of Shalott\" sequence in ANNE OF GREEN GABLES), and radio listeners sent baby booties and wedding gifts whenever a birth or marriage happened on their favorite soap opera.<br /><br />The characters, of course, are strong TREK/SF archetypes: the stalwart commander (who in real life is a ham actor who realizes how much of his present life is a shambles), the genius alien, the miraculous engineer who can fix anything, the obligatory sex symbol, the precocious kid, and the nervous extra who realizes that if life imitates art his life is forfeit.<br /><br />Tim Allen lends a poignant note to Jason Nesmith when he realizes his has-been status, and does a creditable turn as an (albeit bumbling) action hero. Alan Rickman is perfect as the exasperated Brit whose alien character is beloved, but who always will be second fiddle to Nesmith's charisma, and Sigourney Weaver fun as the \"eye candy\" crewman who wishes she had had more intelligent things to do on the ship but flash her boobs and talk to the computer. Robin Sachs, the creepy \"Ethan\" on the BUFFY series, turns in a bravura performance as the menacing Sarris. Daryl Mitchell as the grown-up child actor and Sam Rockwell as the gonzo extra Guy Fleegman also turn in great performances, Enrico Colatoni is delightful as Mathazar, leader of the alien Thermians pleading for help from Nesmith and his crew, Justin Long had the right combination of smarts and geekiness as the fannish Brandon, but my favorite character in this hilarious sendup is Fred Kwan, played by Tony Shaloub. He never loses his cool (well, except once), and faces ray guns, space ships, and aliens (even one with tentacles and a big smile) with phlegmatic aplomb.<br /><br />This film was the reason we went out and bought our original DVD player, and now the Blu-Ray version of GALAXY QUEST is better than ever, stunning, crisp picture and even better sound than was on the original DVD release. This film is a must for every SF fan, or even for anyone who's found himself as part of any fandom.\n\"Never Give Up!

The dictatorial director?), and an irresistible challenge to viewers to \"match wits with Ellery Queen and see if you can guess whodunit.\" Before revealing the killer, Ellery breaks the fourth wall to ask if we amateur sleuths at home have the mystery figured out, offering last-minute clues such as, \"Once you figure out how, you\\'ll know who.\" As with', \"Burke's Law\", ', each episode of', 'Ellery Queen', 'is packed with enough Hollywood legends, venerable character actors, and TV faves to fill', 'The Love Boat', '. \"The Adventure of Veronica\\'s Veils\" features George Burns as the victim (\"I didn\\'t die of natural causes,\" he announces via a filmed presentation following his demise), William Demarest, Don Porter, comedian Jack Carter, Hayden Rorke (Dr. Bellows on', 'I Dream of Jeannie', '), and John Hillerman in his recurring role as radio detective Simon Brimmer, forever trying to one-up Queen.

As a 1940s and OTR buff, this series was tailor-made for me, not to mention that one of my favorite character actors, David Wayne, was portraying Inspector Richard Queen. Jim Hutton, who I was familiar with from THE GREEN BERETS and THE HORIZONTAL LIEUTENANT, played a loveable, absent-minded, but sharp Ellery. (I found out later that the Dannay/Lee families said that Hutton's portrayal was very close to the actual personality of one of the authors.) Week after week I would \"match wits\" with Ellery and try to guess the identity of the murderer. (I even kept score in my journal; alas, in the end Ellery \"out-sleuthed\" me.) I liked best the stories where knowing a certain word or concept would give you the clue to the killer's identity.<br /><br />The guest cast was filled with delightful character actors, from the 1970s regulars of the \"Universal Studios repertory group\" as I called them, to veteran performers who went back to radio and vaudeville, like George Burns, William Frawley, Eve Arden, and Eddie Bracken, and all the 1940s settings and references were equally delightful. Along the way QUEEN satirized a number of subjects, such as Hollywood changing writers' scripts and the movie scene; addressed hot subjects of the 1940s, such as the early payola scandals and war crimes; and even presaged the comic book violence controversy of the 1950s.<br /><br />A particular delight of the series was John Hillerman's portrayal of Simon Brimmer, an unctious radio mystery story star who fancied himself a sleuth. Brimmer would somehow always come up with the wrong suspect, only to be corrected by Ellery in the climactic scene. Indeed, radio stories played a part in several of the mysteries, and many times the wordplay of the structure of the episodes themselves harked back to radio. Ken Swofferd is also fun as Frank Flannigan, a bombastic hack reporter.<br /><br />This is a nice, solid release of the series which includes the pilot film TOO MANY SUSPECTS. The episodes are sharp and crisp, with typical television sound of the time, which is not unpleasant. Definitely for classic mystery fans who don't mind a bit of whimsy, 1940s fans, and those who enjoy classic radio mystery stories.\nOne of the Best Series of the 1970s Comes to DVD\nLittle Women\nMeredith Baxter Birney  (Actor),     Susan Dey  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Studio Specials, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, All Sony Pictures Titles\n['The classic LITTLE WOMEN, which is based on the novel by Louisa May Alcott, follows four sisters who live in New England during the Civil War.

This 1970s version is clearly 70s vintage: the look, the music, the way the girls wander about, just like in LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE, with their hair streaming down their backs instead of in braids, or braided and coiled when older. (Speaking of hair, why does Jo's never grow back?) Events that happen singly in the book are doubled up in the miniseries, so that Jo's story publication, Marmee's letter saying Father is better, and Beth getting sick all happen pell-mell in a single scene; Meg's \"dressing up\" happens at the same party where Jo and Laurie first meet, and the news of Mr. March's illness arrives in summer rather than November, smack in the middle of Laurie's picnic, where Amy is suddenly old enough to be flirting with Fred Vaughn.<br /><br />Little things are irritating: the March girls clearly wear 1970s rubber boots, lines are read in a stilted manner in many scenes, the house is much too upscale for the impoverished Marches. The opening 40 minutes of the story seem to take place in a couple of days immediately after Christmas, then suddenly it's two years later. The Hummels are added in as an afterthought just before Marmee leaves for Washington, DC, as the whole famous Yuletide opening of the story where the girls forgo their own gifts to buy ones for Marmee and then give up their breakfast for the poor Hummels, is completely omitted. The overwrought minute or two where everyone thinks Beth has died is a froth of tears and overly loud, irritatingly plaintive violin music. (And where the heck did Amy come from? Wasn't she sequestered at Aunt March's house?)<br /><br />Worst of all is Ann Dusenberry, who begins to improve as Amy ages, but her portrayal of young Amy is startlingly bad. To play spoilt Amy in the earliest part of the story, she seems to spend almost every scene with her upper lip humped up like a disturbed rabbit. The literary Amy is a pest at that point, but Dusenberry turns her into a witch. You almost wish Jo and Laurie had let her drown. The later adult Amy returns to being very unpleasant. I couldn't put my finger on why she was so unlikeable in the first part, but by the second part I understood. In the book, Amy has her moments of brattiness, as when she burns Jo's manuscript, and silliness, when she uses ridiculous vocabulary to make herself sound older, but she is determined to be a well-bred lady and, as she ages, tries to cultivate herself that way, to be gracious and polite, with a soft voice and a pleasant manner. Dusenberry's Amy is, in Benjamin Franklin's words in 1776, a Boston fishwife. Her diction is often coarse and loud. And she's still doing that rabbit thing with her upper lip.<br /><br />The brightest spot in the story is Greer Garson as Aunt March. She plays the imperious old woman for all she's worth. Dorothy Maguire is a perfect Marmee and Robert Young is very charming as Mr.  Laurence. Susan Dey really did do a nice job as Jo, and in this version they did show the affecting sequence where Jo takes Beth to the seashore, which played very well.<br /><br />Many people love this version because they show some of the scenes that are usually left out of the other films for time, like the seashore sequence. This version also includes the episode where Meg pays $50 for silk material for a dress and then sends it back so John can buy a new overcoat. In the book, this is part of a longer sequence where Meg has to adhere to a budget and complains to John about being poor, but all that is omitted, so the dress/overcoat sequence has little meaning. In another interesting sequence not in the book, Mr. March and John Brooke salute the birth of the twins with wine. Except it's very clear in the book that the Marches are teetotalers. Jo even makes Laurie promise not to drink at college.<br /><br />William Shatner's Professor Bhaer is...interesting. He has the fun inherent in the part, and thankfully doesn't take Jo to the opera or kiss her on the neck; instead he tries to teach her German, as in the book (if later on they did climb trees together). But again, no one ever casts Bhaer as he is written, in his late thirties, already greying, stout, and with a beard, except for the very static and stagy British television production from the 1970s.<br /><br />Amy and Laurie's romance is unbelievably truncated. Jo refuses Laurie's proposal, he goes to Europe. Amy finds out he is there and asks him to visit. He turns up, drunk, in her room the night before she is leaving, and she tells him off for his condition. He goes to Vienna to study music, realizes he hasn't the talent to be a composer, and returns to Amy when he learns of Beth's death. All of a sudden he is in love with her, she with him, with no chance to be together and fall in love as they do in the book, and they get married.<br /><br />The miniseries moves full-circle and, as it concludes, once again it is Christmas. The \"under the umbrella\" scene with Jo and Professor Bhaer thus not only occurs at Christmas, but it quits raining and of course starts snowing (since it snows everywhere on television on Christmas Eve). Another clich&eacute; heard from.<br /><br />There is one really odd thing about this version. In the book, two of Mr. Laurence's children are mentioned. One is a girl who died when she was young. It is her piano that is given to Beth. The other child is Laurie's father, who chafed under his father's strict ways, went to Italy, and married an Italian concert pianist. This is why he objected to Laurie's piano-playing. In this mini-series version, the daughter who loved music and died is combined as a character with Laurie's mother, who married an Italian concert pianist. Laurie tells Jo that his real name is \"Theodore Laurence Cerrito\" (I think that was the name) and his grandfather won't let him use it. Very strange!<br /><br />Good points: Dey and the older members of the cast, scenes from the book not in other productions.<br /><br />Bad points: 1970s production values, Ann Dusenberry, yet another ho-hum Laurie.<br /><br />Summary: some very touching moments, but definitely not the best LITTLE WOMEN ever made.\nA Version from--and For--the 1970s\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Robert Scheerer'], 'Producers': ['Perry Lafferty'], 'Starring': ['Danny Kaye', 'Mary Tyler Moore', 'Nat King Cole'], 'Studio': ['Inception Media Group']}\nThey don't make 'em like this anymore. An episode of Kaye's variety show broadcast on Christmas Day 1963 (remember when TV networks had first-run programming on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day?), a year when some levity was very much needed in the US (President Kennedy had been assassinated only one month earlier). Great to see Mary Tyler Moore and Nat \"King\" Cole, the latter singing his classic version of \"The Christmas Song.\" Later, watch young Harvey Korman and Jamie Farr open a spoof of comic operettas.<br /><br />I've seen some reviewers complaining about these older programs because not all of the music is Christmas-oriented. Surprise! That's how it was done in those days--about half the show would be Christmas songs and the other half would be current hits or popular songs. The guest star might sing his or her latest hit, and there would be skits not having to do with Christmas. I saw one review that complained and then said to watch the Andy Williams special. The special you see on DVD is a compilation of several years of shows. The actual Andy Williams Christmas specials would have had non-Christmas content, too.<br /><br />This is the real thing: no fancy graphics, no frenetic editing, just talented people performing in a low-key, friendly manner.

Please do not let that stop you from buying them, because anything about Addie is better than no Addie at all!<br /><br />In THE EASTER PROMISE, twelve year old Addie Mills is thrilled to learn that Constance Payne, a famous stage actress, is returning to Clear River to sell her late mother's house and is eager to meet her because of the glamour associated with her being on stage. She and her friends take the woman flowers to welcome her home. But Constance Payne has problems that the girls don't understand and Addie will have the friendship tested by the end of the story. I do love the sleepover scene with Addie and her friends (and the subsequent scenes when they are decorating the Easter eggs and teasing Terry, and the humorous parts of the Style Show), and also the scene on the worksite where Addie brings her dad the cake and lemonade and they talk about Constance's father.<br /><br />One of the bigger disappointments is the setting itself. In the first two specials CBS also allowed the story to be filmed &#34;on location,&#34; if not in Nebraska, at least on the prairies, the Canadian prairies, and in a little town in Ontario, Uxbridge, that looked a lot like Nebraska must have looked back then. You didn't have the LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE effect with &#34;Minnesota&#34; looking like the southern California hills and it lent much to the verisimilitude of the story. The exteriors for THE EASTER PROMISE are filmed on a stage set and it shows very, very badly on videotape, especially a scene where Addie arrives when James and Grandma are working in the vegetable garden and also in the scenes where Constance's house is visited. The situation which has been so carefully crafted previously is jolted by the glaring sets and for me, at least, the illusion was ruined. One scene has Addie visiting James on the job and he is using his crane near a wooden bridge that has been used in so many television shows that it sticks out like that proverbial sore thumb in the background.<br /><br />They couldn't even be bothered to try to duplicate the &#34;Clear River&#34; scenes of the first two stories and it diverges wildly from Addie's original opening narration to HOUSE WITHOUT A CHRISTMAS TREE where she declares that Clear River is so small there are no buildings over three stories tall and the town has no traffic light because none is needed. The closing scene clearly shows a downtown that is a lot larger (and taller) than Addie described.<br /><br />Every time I watch ADDIE AND THE KING OF HEARTS I am disappointed that the series of stories ended on such a low note. Everything in the story is by-the-numbers: Addie's jealousy, her crush, James' involvement with a woman totally unlike his first wife, the handsome teacher who encourages Addie but turns out to be engaged to be married. No one seems to have his/her heart in the performance, especially Jason Robards, who was so magnificent as the grieving man of the first story. This touches on a lot of emotional issues with Addie reacting to her dad paying attention to another woman after thirteen years and her very real and eventually hurtful crush on her substitute teacher, but none of the emotions seem real. Diane Ladd's performance is the most lively, but slightly overdone. I wish they had used the story the way the book arranged it--except for including Irene's story of her past from the television version, which was superior to the book version, and also the corsage scene from the television version--and recast the roles of Cora Sue and Billy Wild (especially since Addie seemed at a loss without a best friend to bounce her emotions off). And the sets look cheap; if you notice, the door to the living room is always half-closed because they never rebuilt the actual room, and even the school cloakroom lacks the richness of the one in the first story. Not the best send-off for an otherwise excellent set of films.\nMore Addie Tales\n23 Paces to Baker Street [Blu-ray]\nVan Johnson  (Actor),     Vera Miles  (Actor),     Henry Hathaway  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    NR    Format: Blu-ray\nMovies & TV, Blu-ray, Movies\n['Van Johnson, Vera Miles.

Most of the low reviews you see for this film are due to 20th Century Fox's previous releases of this beautifully shot Cinemascope movie in pan-and-scan unrestored versions. Please note that this review is for the February 2017 Blu-Ray full HD release.<br /><br />Taking place in 1950s England, the story concerns Philip Hannon, an embittered playwright living in a London flat and completing minor revisions to his hit US play for the British stage. Hannon was blinded some time before the film begins (the details are never specified), but although he gets around quite well with the help of a cane and certain other aids for the blind (a chiming watch, a tape recorder to dictate his plays), he has let the accident change him and break up his romance with his secretary Jean Lennox. For day-to-day ordinary tasks he has hired a factotum, Bob Matthews, an older man who silently accepts Hannon's bad attitude as &#34;part of the job.&#34; One day Jean visits; while Hannon initially seems interested, he is eventually dismissive of her because he's no longer a &#34;whole man.&#34; To walk off his frustration, he goes to a nearby pub, and while nursing a drink overhears some, but not all, of a conversation from the Ladies' Bar behind him, and what he hears galvanizes him enough for him to call the police: it sounds as if the man and the woman in the next room are planning to kidnap a child!<br /><br />Since the police listen to his recreation of the conversation with little interest, Hannon begins to inquire into the possible crime himself, with Jean and a reluctant Bob as his allies, using the overheard conversation and the scent of a distinctive perfume used by the woman at the pub to guide him. What the police refuse to believe, however, really is going to take place, and by inquiring Hannon sets himself up for a great deal of danger.<br /><br />This is not an action movie, but initially slow-moving and then more desperate as time progresses, like an early Hitchcock film or a British-made Agatha Christie presentation, with several instances of great peril to certain characters. The exteriors were filmed in London to add verisimilitude to the story and the Cinemascope lends itself to beautiful vistas of the Thames from Hannon's windows and the spooky lengths of fog-shrouded streets. The starring cast fits their roles well: Van Johnson as the moody Hannon, who comes alive when he realizes a blind man might be able to make a difference; Vera Miles as steadfast Jean, who throws herself into the investigation, happy to see that Hannon has found a purpose; and Cecil Parker as pragmatic Bob, who has an absolutely wonderful comic scene where he returns dripping wet from following a suspect and proceeds to give Hannon his report while pointedly commenting on the drenching he received during the surveillance.<br /><br />I can't comment in audiophile terms about the soundtrack; it's Dolby 5.1, I believe, and to these old ears sounds crisp and clean, if perhaps the opening theme being a bit loud. The picture is GORGEOUS; I doubt it looked that good in some of the old-style movie theaters which hurriedly converted their screens for widescreen presentation in the 1950s. The color is so bright and crisp that I made out details in scenes I'd never noticed before and the panorama shots of the Thames are beautiful.<br /><br />There is a commentary track by film historian Kent Jones, who undoubtedly knows his Henry Hathaway films and other classic movies as well; many interesting facts are presented, but his presentation is very dry, and his voice rather soft. While I'm glad it was included, I probably won't listen to it again. Pity that some remarks could not have been gleaned from Ms. Miles, but as she is in her late 80s, I have no idea if her health would have even allowed her to do so.<br /><br />If you are a fan of this film and have never seen it in widescreen, you are indeed in for a treat! This is the release we've all been dreaming of. Indeed, the only bad thing about it is the cover, which portrays a scene that never happens in the movie: no woman in a low-cut red gown is ever grabbed from behind!\nThe Release We Dreamed Of!\n1776 [Blu-ray]\nWilliam Daniels  (Actor),     Howard DaSilva  (Actor),     Peter Hunt  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    NR    Format: Blu-ray\nMovies & TV, Featured Categories, Blu-ray, Musicals\n['1776', 'is a musical celebration of the founding of the United States of America based on the award-winning Broadway production.

Yes, many liberties are taken (Martha Jefferson did not come to Philadelphia, Richard Henry Lee was not a grinning buffoon), but the idea was to show the public that the signers of the Declaration were not 2-dimensional gods who signed a historic piece of paper, but just ordinary men who loved, lusted, ate to excess, argued, philosophized, and debated. There are some rousing good songs like &#34;The Lees of Old Virginia&#34; and &#34;The Egg,&#34; the sentimental and prophetic &#34;He Plays the Violin,&#34; and the showstopper &#34;Molasses to Rum to Slaves&#34; which chillingly reminds us of the dreadful &#34;Triangle Trade&#34; in slaves.

Some of the reviews of this product seem to reflect that homework was not done. I have a multi-region player, so that doesn't bother me.<br /><br />Now that THAT'S out of the way, I must say how I love this series, which I saw for the first time many years ago on PBS. William and Hester are a middle-aged British couple; he works in a bank, and she's just gotten their last child out of the house. When he gets home, William just wants to have his supper and relax. but Hester is a go-getter and she's trying to find the perfect way to fill her time now that the nest is empty. She loves to cook and in the course of the series finds several cooking jobs, but of course this is a comedy and something always goes wrong.<br /><br />I love this show because William and Hester look like ordinary people, not the gorgeous mannequin types you often find on television, and the humor is gentle and funny, not annoyingly big and raucous with boob jokes and insults. Plus it's obvious the couple still love each other and, offscreen, still take a great deal of delight in their private life.<br /><br />The second series, FRENCH FIELDS, involves their adventures in moving to France after William takes a job with a French bank. They have to get used to the French lifestyle (especially driving on the other side of the road), a cleaning lady who doesn't speak English, a snooty British couple next door, and the local head of the neighborhood, genially portrayed by DOCTOR WHO's Nicholas Courtney. It's not quite as funny as the original, but still always good for laughs.\nGood-Hearted, Pleasant British Comedy in the Vein of THE GOOD LIFE\nThe War Between Men and Women\nJack Lemmon  (Actor),     Barbara Harris  (Actor)    Rated:    PG    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Comedy\n[\"Opposites attract, fight, and fall in love in THE WAR BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN.

NBC ran it for one year, planned to renew it, and then dropped it (even after it won two Emmy awards) in favor of Red Skelton, who was leaving CBS. Skelton tanked terribly on NBC and thus we lost one of the most amusing and inventive sitcoms of all time. Sadly, it is not on DVD to recommend (dudes, why not???). Suffering from Thurber deprivation after the 1970 cancellation, I naturally gravitated toward this film.<br /><br />Sadly, it's not up to MY WORLD standards, but grafts 70s mores onto a Thurberesque character. Peter Wilson, full time curmudgeon hater of dogs and children and cynical of women, is at a visit to the eye doctor when he meets Terry Koslenko, divorcee with...guess what...three kids and a dog. After a wild night of monkey sex (this was the 70s after all), Peter finds himself falling for Terry, despite the kids, the dog, and her prominent photojournalist ex-husband, who the kids adore, and eventually marries her. As always, &#34;wackiness ensues.&#34; And Peter is keeping a deep, dark secret from Terry: he's going blind.<br /><br />But I still like it. It was a Thurber oasis, and Jack Lemmon is actually a little sweet as grumpy Peter softened by the very things he eschews, even though it's a terrible cliche. And I like Lemmon, and Jason Robards plays Terry's ex, and, as a bonus, Lisa Gerritsen, who played Lydia Monroe, John's daughter, in MY WORLD, is Terry's middle kid, who adores her warts-and-all father and who suffers with a stammer. (For the record, there's also Caroline, the stereotypical 70s rebellious teen, and David, played by the 70s-ubiquitous Moosie Drier, the little boy so traumatized by his parents' divorce that he sleeps in front of his mother's bedroom door and is afraid of everything.)<br /><br />However, it uses Thurber's anti-war parable &#34;The Last Flower&#34; at the end, which saves it a lot in my eyes. Very 70s, and at least one of those stars is a &#34;just because it's me.&#34;\nThurber Can't Save It, But a Favorite Nonetheless\nLifetime Holiday 4-Film Collection [The Christmas Consultant/Holiday Spin/The March Sisters At Christmas/Holly's Holiday]\nRated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Holidays & Seasonal, Christmas, Comedy\n[\"This delightful Christmas package of Lifetimer Original Movies has everything you could ever wish for.

I probably won't watch any of the other films.<br /><br />THE MARCH SISTERS AT CHRISTMAS is a modern (and adult) take on LITTLE WOMEN, and mostly I liked what I saw. I thought they translated the characters well to the 21st century--some people were upset that John and Meg had sex (and on Marmee's bed, too!) and that the girls held parties where alcohol was drunk, but these are modern mores, not Alcott's 19th century children's book guidelines: Jo, a talented writer, is making a living keeping up Twitter accounts for celebrities; Meg is an attorney; Beth is a shy music college graduate who isn't pushing herself enough for Meg's taste (Meg always was a little bossy, but the thought of the real Meg pushing the real Beth like this is kinda over the top), and Amy is an aspiring actress and a bit of a wild child. All the young women are horrified when they find out Marmee is going to sell their beloved old house, so while she is away nursing her war-injured husband (Mr. March in this is a photojournalist who was injured on the job), they decide to spruce up the place so she will change her mind.<br /><br />The female cast is pretty good; the younger male cast...eh. I don't see Laurie (known as &#34;Teddy&#34; to everyone, not just to Jo in this outing) as a jock, and John Brooke is this wild-haired sad sack. However, John Shea makes a terrific Mr. Lawrence (here he's Teddy's uncle, not grandfather) and there's also Marcus Bhaer, who's older than Jo, but definitely not portly and grey.<br /><br />Based on the reviews, not to everyone's taste, but I found it an enjoyable update.\nNot Your Mother's LITTLE WOMEN\nHoliday Family Classics: The Thanksgiving Treasure / The House Without A Christmas Tree\nJason Robards  (Actor),     Lisa Lucas  (Actor)    Rated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Paramount Home Entertainment, Drama\n['Celebrate the holiday season with two all-American family classics based on the beloved novels by Gail Rock!

This collects the first two, and the best two stories of the tetralogy.<br /><br />THE HOUSE WITHOUT A CHRISTMAS TREE is the first story about Addie Mills, a spirited (and slightly bossy) 10-year-old who loves school and dreams of growing up to be an artist. Her mother died when she was a few months old, and she has been raised by her loving, slightly offbeat grandmother, and her taciturn, brooding father, who doesn't seem to have much love to give to his only daughter. He forbids a Christmas tree in the house during the holidays, and Addie, who desperately wants one, thinks it's because he's so &#34;parsimonious&#34; (that's one of her school vocabulary words). When she wins a tree, she will withstand an explosion of emotion that will shake her to her core.<br /><br />THIS IS JUST ONE OF THE BEST CHRISTMAS STORIES EVER. Addie isn't the usual cute little girl character so nauseatingly passed on by every sitcom and drama of the day: she's bright, not girly, determined, but of course has her faults. Lisa Lucas plays her to a T. Mildred Natwick glows as the supportive grandmother and a great supporting cast is included, but the star of this film is Jason Robards, who provides a stunning performance as the embittered father James Mills. He could have been a soulless bastard but instead Robards permits you see this man's internal pain even as you are startled at his bitterness and anger. The late 1940s atmosphere of the story is well done--the kids even say the Pledge to the Flag correctly--and it was filmed in rural Canada to try to come as close to the setting (rural Nebraska) as possible.<br /><br />THE THANKSGIVING TREASURE is a little more routine. While out getting air for her bike tires, Addie meets for the first time &#34;Old Man&#34; Rhenquist, a crotchety elderly man who is feuding with her dad over non-payment for James Mills' digging a pond for him. A curious Addie, under cover of cutting cattails and fall plants with her best friend, discovers Rhenquist has a horse, the one thing Addie has always wanted. She persuades her best friend Carla Mae to bring the old codger some Thanksgiving dinner after hearing her teacher lecture about the Pilgrims' first Thanksgiving feast, hoping to make friends (and of course get near the horse!).  However, it's Rhenquist Addie comes to treasure; he's becomes like a grandfather to her, telling her tales about &#34;the old days.&#34; The whole plot could have been terribly clich&eacute;, but Bernard Hughes as Rhenquist and Lisa Lucas as Addie rise above the clich&eacute; and make it worth watching. Again, Canadian landscape standing in for Nebraska countryside makes this look very authentic and the kids even do a radio play to cement the story in the late 1940s. Once again, the story is filmed on videotape, giving it that &#34;soap opera&#34; effect, but at the same time it gives it an immediacy as if you are really standing on the sidelines watching these folks.<br /><br />A super addition to anyone's holiday film library.\nTwo Classic Made-for-TV Movies",
