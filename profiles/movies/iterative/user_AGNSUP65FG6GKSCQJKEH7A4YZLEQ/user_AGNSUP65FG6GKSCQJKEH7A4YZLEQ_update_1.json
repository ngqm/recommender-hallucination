Carmel's departure from the show. Richard Deacon did his usual good job, but he basically played Roger Buell the same way he played Mel Cooley, which completely changed Roger's personality and his relationship with wife Kaye. Ballard and Arden are quite funny together and some of the best episodes have an old-time radio flavor with delightful wordplay, such as the episode where the kids have a fight and eventually the entire group isn't speaking to each other. I enjoyed that episode so much I made an audio tape of it, and it held up quite well as an audio presentation.<br /><br />Everyone likens this series to I LOVE LUCY and it has certain LUCY riffs, but I also think of it as being a bit like the British series THE GOOD LIFE (a.k.a. GOOD NEIGHBORS) if the Ledbetters and the Goods had had children who married. The more conventional Hubbards are like the Ledbetters, and the Buells are as odd in their own way as the Goods.<br /><br />I hope some of the more classic 1960s and 1970s series will come to DVD, including the brillant HE AND SHE and MY WORLD AND WELCOME TO IT. I've heard a rumor that the 1975 ELLERY QUEEN series may be due out soon as well. These would be a great tonic to the \"reality show\" trend that infests our network broadcasts these days.\nReview Title: Perhaps Not a \"Classic,\" But Still a Funny Series\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
