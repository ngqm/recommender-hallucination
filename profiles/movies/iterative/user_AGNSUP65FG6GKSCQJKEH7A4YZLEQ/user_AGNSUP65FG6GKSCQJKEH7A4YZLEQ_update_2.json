Five poor children have only one toy, a large wooden headless hobbyhorse that the eldest boy's father found in an abandoned house. The children use it as sort of a \"thrill-ride\" down the steep streets of their town. In the meantime, a gang of thieves are planning to steal a bank shipment from the train that must slow down on a nearby curve, enlisting the help of a local peddler, who hides the key to the place the loot is stashed in the kids' horse. When they discover this, the thieves steal the horse and of course the children try to find it. Jean Pierre Aumont co-stars as the good-natured police inspector trying to find the thieves and the cash. The highlight of this movie is Pamela Franklin, who plays Marion. Marion has a special way with dogs; she cares for any stray she finds, then gives them homes, but before they leave her, they are taught to respond to her whistle. Needless to say, whenever the kids are in trouble, Marion's whistle brings a rescue pack of dogs in some very funny sequences. Franklin is bright and ingenuous in the role, foreshadowing her future lively performance in THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE.<br /><br />The film was based on a book by Paul Berna, and three sequels were written about the characters.\nReview Title: Five Kids, a Hobbyhorse...and, Oh Yes, the Dogs!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Set in the swinging late 1960s, the Mothers-In-Law centers on the laugh-filled misadventures of longtime neighbors in suburban Los Angeles who become related to each other when their children suddenly get married. Legendary actress Eve Arden (Our Miss Brooks, Grease) stars as Eve Hubbard, the sophisticated wife of straight-laced lawyer Herb Hubbard (Herbert Rudley). Veteran comedienne Kaye Ballard plays Kaye Buell, the outspoken wife of bombastic television writer Roger Buell (Roger C. Carmel and Richard Deacon). to the dismay of their hapless husbands, the strong-willed mothers are determined to meddle in the lives of newlyweds Jerry (Jerry Fogel) and Suzie Hubbard (Deborah Walley).\", 'Amazon.com', 'The Mothers-in-Law', 'is one of those \"You had to be there\" shows, best appreciated by those who dimly but fondly remember this short-lived series. This was Desi Arnaz\\'s last TV series as a producer. As a swan song, it\\'s more \"We\\'re Having a Baby, My Baby and Me\" than \"Cuban Pete,\" but for a show that was hopelessly square even back in 1967 (as witness the cringe-worthy episode featuring the one-hit wonder band the Seeds, who perform said one hit, \"Pushin\\' Too Hard\"), it rates as a found treasure thanks to the crack timing and expert clowning of its stars. Show biz troupers Eve Arden and Kaye Ballard star as reserved and sophisticated Eve Hubbard and histrionic and overly emotional Kaye Buell. They are neighbors with an odd-couple friendship whose lives become further bound when their children, Eve\\'s daughter Susie (Deborah Walley) and Kaye\\'s son Jerry (Jerry Fogel), get married and move in to the Hubbards\\' garage. Arnaz did not attempt to reinvent the wheel with', 'The Mothers-in-Law', '. Created and written primarily by', 'I Love Lucy', 'scribes Bob Carroll Jr. and Madelyn Davis, the series takes several pages from the', 'Lucy', \"playbook. Arden and Ballard have a Lucy-Ethel chemistry. Arnaz, who directed many of the episodes, deftly stages the ladies' slapstick shenanigans. And just as Lucy never stopped plotting to get into husband Ricky's act, so do Eve and Kaye insist on meddling in their children's lives, much to the eye-rolling annoyance of their long-suffering husbands (Herbert Rudley and Roger C. Carmel). Several episodes also manage to work in comical production numbers to showcase the cast's talents. Fan-favorite episodes include those in which Arnaz guest stars as matador Raphael Del Gado from Barcelona. Other memorable guest stars include Don Rickles, Ozzie Nelson, Paul Lynde, and a pre-\", 'All in the Family', \"Rob Reiner.

In season 2, Carmel left the show in a salary dispute and was replaced Darrin-style with Richard Deacon, and not even the addition of grandchildren to the family mix could save the series. The extras on this eight-disc set are impressive. Baby boomers will get a nostalgic kick out of seeing the NBC peacock unfurl its feathers in \"living color,\" as well as period commercials. There is a newly filmed interview with the gracious Ms. Ballard, the original unaired pilot featuring Kay Cole as Susie, two failed Arnaz series pilots for', 'The Carol Channing Show', 'and', 'Lands End', ', and solo variety show performance clips featuring Arden and Ballard.

Carmel's departure from the show. Richard Deacon did his usual good job, but he basically played Roger Buell the same way he played Mel Cooley, which completely changed Roger's personality and his relationship with wife Kaye. Ballard and Arden are quite funny together and some of the best episodes have an old-time radio flavor with delightful wordplay, such as the episode where the kids have a fight and eventually the entire group isn't speaking to each other. I enjoyed that episode so much I made an audio tape of it, and it held up quite well as an audio presentation.<br /><br />Everyone likens this series to I LOVE LUCY and it has certain LUCY riffs, but I also think of it as being a bit like the British series THE GOOD LIFE (a.k.a. GOOD NEIGHBORS) if the Ledbetters and the Goods had had children who married. The more conventional Hubbards are like the Ledbetters, and the Buells are as odd in their own way as the Goods.<br /><br />I hope some of the more classic 1960s and 1970s series will come to DVD, including the brillant HE AND SHE and MY WORLD AND WELCOME TO IT. I've heard a rumor that the 1975 ELLERY QUEEN series may be due out soon as well. These would be a great tonic to the \"reality show\" trend that infests our network broadcasts these days.\nPerhaps Not a \"Classic,\" But Still a Funny Series\nThe Horse Without A Head\nJean-Pierre Aumont  (Actor),     Herbert Lom  (Actor),     Don Chaffey  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment, All Disney Titles\n['When a kindly junk dealer gives a group of poor French children a headless toy horse, the kids dub themselves \"The Knights Of The Headless Horse.\" The broken toy becomes their only source of fun as they race down the narrow streets of their village.
