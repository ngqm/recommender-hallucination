(The show had begun with the Hardys rotating with episodes featuring Nancy Drew, but she was quietly erased for this final season.) Shaun Cassidy and Parker Stevenson play Joe and Frank Hardy, whose adventures in crime fighting take a new twist when they\\'re recruited to join their dad as US secret agents. There\\'s a lot of globetrotting involved, although stock-footage establishing shots of London, Greece, Hawaii, etc., take the place of actual location shooting. The two-part opening episode sees Joe go after the killers of his fianc\u00e9e, a trauma that is mostly forgotten by episode three. The stories are serviceable, but frankly the season is most notable for its cascade of incredible \\'70s style and its wild gimmicks: government-trained killer sharks at a secret California beach? Bring it on! Stevenson and Cassidy (who enjoyed/endured a phase of teenybopper stardom at this time) boast the kind of hair that belongs in a Smithsonian exhibit on what was notable about the 1970s, and if you remember the soft-rock band Bread, be advised that group leader David Gates and the band are featured in another two-part episode that features lots of Bread songs and also Cold War defection espionage (\"Bread isn\\'t the only thing on the menu tonight,\" Stevenson notes at a suspense-filled concert). The season lasted only 10 episodes, and given the shoddy production values and the mostly subpar writing, that is no surprise. Future blockbuster screenwriter Steven E. de Souza worked on the series, and the guest cast is the usual collection of \\'70s regulars: Nehemiah Persoff, Edd \"Kookie\" Byrnes, June Lockhart, Dana Andrews, Dane Clark, etc. Don\\'t go for quality, but if you have a weakness for Smiley Face camp, this does the job.', '--Robert Horton']\nAverage Rating: 4.6\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Television, Television/Crime', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Box set, Color, NTSC, Closed-captioned', 'Contributor': 'Parker Stevenson, Joseph Pevney, Shaun Cassidy', 'Language': 'English', 'Number Of Discs': '3', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 4.8 Ounces', 'Director': 'Joseph Pevney', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Box set, Color, NTSC, Closed-captioned', 'Run time': '8 hours and 30 minutes', 'Release date': 'February 12, 2013', 'Actors': 'Shaun Cassidy, Parker Stevenson', 'Studio': 'Shout Factory', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '3'}\nReview Text: Although the 3rd season may not be everyone's favorite season since it means that the series was drawing to a close, I was still happy to see it finally released on DVD.\nReview Title: Long awaited 3rd season\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Diagnosis Murder - Season 4\nFormat: DVD\nMovies & TV, First to Know, Television\n{'Media Format': 'NTSC', 'Studio': 'Paramount'}\nI agree with the other person whose review is going on a year old! Please Amazon, if you have any clout with Paramount TV, get them to release the rest of the Diagnosis Murder series. I couldn't find how to sign up to be notified of any new DM DVDs so I thought I'd just write this review in the hopes that someone at Amazon will see it and realize we DM fans just want the rest of our show on DVD. Pretty much everything else I like is already making good progress on DVDs such as House, Bones, and some of the newer ones. Please light a fire under the powers that be so that the rest of DM can be released soon! Season 4 is awesome, I remember from watching it first time around and from my tapes that I have to rely on if I want anything past season 3.\nDiagnosis Starved Here!\nThe Hardy Boys: Season 3\nShaun Cassidy  (Actor),     Parker Stevenson  (Actor),     Joseph Pevney  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Boxed Sets, Television\n['Product Description', 'Follow the clues to adventure as the Hardy Boys: The Final Season comes to DVD for the first time!
