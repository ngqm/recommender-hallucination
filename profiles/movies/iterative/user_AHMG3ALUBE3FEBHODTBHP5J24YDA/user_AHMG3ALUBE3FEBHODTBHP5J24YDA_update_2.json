Entirely enjoyable and a marvelously acted piece, my entire family loved this movie.  We had been expecting another biblical mish mash eliciting merely yawns, but were startled to see such a wonderful movie.<br />Martin Landau (Jacob) gave a fantastic performance, as did Ben Kingsley(Potiphar), Paul Mercurio(Joseph) (which bumps STRICTLY BALLROOM out of #1 on my Paul Mercurio list of favorite performances), Leslie-Anne Down was good as Potiphar's wife, and the 11 brothers of Joseph were fabulous.  The supporting cast was excellent.<br />The sensitive and well rounded way in which this story was handled was fresh, creative, yet took no liberties in veering from the original story.  Although it is not as spectacular in production as THE TEN COMMANDMENTS and other such movies, this movie was more like it &quot;really&quot; would have happened complete with humanity in all of its misery and magnificence.<br />I can not speak highly enough of this movie.  What a pleasant surprise.  We even got a chuckle out of it now and then!\nReview Title: AMAZING!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

The cover looked so racy that we just passed it by wanting to see it first, before wasting our money on another sleazy canned dancing movie. (Had we seen Romeo and Juliet or Moulin Rouge first, we probably would never have looked twice at it).<br />After renting a copy and seeing it, we were so thrilled that we raced down to the store to grab the copy for sale, but it was gone.<br />The very beginning of this movie is fresh, new, and brilliantly put together.  The humor in the movie has the zaniness of British humor with the hard edged Aussie flair.  From the very first few minutes, we found ourselves laughing, clapping, and feeling overall wonderful about the beautifully done story that many can relate to.<br />A struggling &quot;invisible girl&quot; rather ignored and looked down upon takes a risk and ends up with the self-confident hero.  The costuming is gorgeous, the dance scenes beautiful, and the characters are PERFECTLY done - very different and lots of fun.<br />This movie is certainly a family movie-despite the racy cover.  What we particularly loved about this movie was that FRAN, the lead character ended up on top, but did not have to become a sleaze to do it.  She keeps her modesty and class and still comes out ahead.  The movie is pretty wholesomely done (be warned that there are a few swear words and one implied scene with a few characters-however very tame).<br />Dance scenes are not like so many other dance movies which are rather annoying.  On the contrary, they make you feel like you are involved.  All kinds of people, with all kinds of abilities dance in the movie- not just the stars.<br />I watch this movie several times a year, as does my mom who hesitated to buy a copy when I told her about it.  It is reminiscent of quirky Hyacinth Bucket character types (from BBC'c KEEPING UP APPEARANCES) with many new originals added.<br />This Aussie film is not only a delight, but the characters are believable, and many who we know find themselves watching it over and over again- greatly brightens one's mood.  I'm purchasing the DVD soon to replace the video, now worn.<br />SIDE NOTE:  I find it rather interesting that Paul Mercurio, who is a definite delight as the male lead and extremely appealing, does not like this film and wants to distance himself from the whole dancing thing (although he danced for some time before his role in the movie).  It is too bad, because this movie is one of the best movies of all time.
