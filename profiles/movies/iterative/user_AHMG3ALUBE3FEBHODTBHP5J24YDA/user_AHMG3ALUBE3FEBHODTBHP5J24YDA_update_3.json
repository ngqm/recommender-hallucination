When it got to the idiocy of Max and Tess and a baby, well, I stopped watching the show.  It infuriated me that they could desecrate such a decent storyline with such mucky inconsistent lousy sci fi writing.  The team of writers played too much handball with the characters' personalities.<br /><br />When I got to see this collection of shows again one after the other, I could see the inconsistencies and overall bad writing shifts even more glaringly.  It was not until I saw the show's finale that I even wanted to own the last two seasons.<br /><br />Having said that, would I still buy this series again?  The answer is YES if nothing else for the spectacular Christmas episode.  Next to Blind Date (and a few others from season one), it was one of the series' best episodes.  Seems like a full length movie even though it is just about 40 minutes long.<br /><br />The rest of this season is unnecessarily dark, in my opinion.  The plots zig zag and contradict themselves through the season, leaving some ends completely loose that never get explained or resolved.  The writing is too choppy, almost like they were trying to achieve certain things with each episode (more sex, wider audience, better ratings, etc) rather than let the original writers flow with the show, which is what made it so good to begin with.<br /><br />Few shows do well over a several seasons, but the struggling character developement in the second season of Roswell is what carries it through.  It seems like they constantly changed writers because of the gross fluctuations in out-of-character behavior through the second season.  The writing styles of the scripts varied so much that it made the season like an annoying bumpy road that you just wish would be smooth.<br /><br />The best episode of this season which echoes the first season that so many fans loved the show for is the Christmas episode.  That is one of the very few Christmas episodes of any show that we hold dear and want to watch every Christmas.  It was deep, meaningful and the characters gave us a glimpse of what made them to dear to fans in the first season.<br /><br />There are a couple of other episodes in this season that are enjoyable, but there are many that are the kind of dark writing that completely ruined Buffy, which was delightful in the beginning as well, but mutated the show completely.<br /><br />Is this season worth owning?  Yes.  Despite all that I do not enjoy about it, the characters are still strong enough to warrant following the series all of the way through to the end.  The quirky mannerisms and personalities of the characters somehow manage to hang on through all of this and keep us endeared to them through the season.<br /><br />To put it in the words of my mother who is seeing the series for the first time, and is working through season 2, \"Each episode is so dark and sometimes so disoriented that you just want to stop watching it, but then you just have to see what happens to the characters, so you watch one more episode.\"<br /><br />The fact that the series ended in the same manner that it began makes it worth while.  The last few episodes bring us back to the type of show that Roswell started out to be.<br /><br />I call the Second Season of Roswell, the \"tunnel season\".  It is dark, you really don't want to be there, but hope that there will be light at the end keeps you walking through instead of giving up.<br /><br />The music changes are barely noticeable unless you are addicted to particular songs and watched videos of the TV shows repeatedly.  I think that they did a great job of substituting the music in the DVD's so far.  The show still is just as good as it was when it was on television.  In fact, I find the music less intrusive than on the TV show.<br /><br />I do wish that the DVD's were packed into a case that you could secure them in, they fall out constantly, and that is frustrating for everyone I know that has any of the seasons in this series.\nReview Title: I Would Buy This Only For the Christmas Episode\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

The cover looked so racy that we just passed it by wanting to see it first, before wasting our money on another sleazy canned dancing movie. (Had we seen Romeo and Juliet or Moulin Rouge first, we probably would never have looked twice at it).<br />After renting a copy and seeing it, we were so thrilled that we raced down to the store to grab the copy for sale, but it was gone.<br />The very beginning of this movie is fresh, new, and brilliantly put together.  The humor in the movie has the zaniness of British humor with the hard edged Aussie flair.  From the very first few minutes, we found ourselves laughing, clapping, and feeling overall wonderful about the beautifully done story that many can relate to.<br />A struggling &quot;invisible girl&quot; rather ignored and looked down upon takes a risk and ends up with the self-confident hero.  The costuming is gorgeous, the dance scenes beautiful, and the characters are PERFECTLY done - very different and lots of fun.<br />This movie is certainly a family movie-despite the racy cover.  What we particularly loved about this movie was that FRAN, the lead character ended up on top, but did not have to become a sleaze to do it.  She keeps her modesty and class and still comes out ahead.  The movie is pretty wholesomely done (be warned that there are a few swear words and one implied scene with a few characters-however very tame).<br />Dance scenes are not like so many other dance movies which are rather annoying.  On the contrary, they make you feel like you are involved.  All kinds of people, with all kinds of abilities dance in the movie- not just the stars.<br />I watch this movie several times a year, as does my mom who hesitated to buy a copy when I told her about it.  It is reminiscent of quirky Hyacinth Bucket character types (from BBC'c KEEPING UP APPEARANCES) with many new originals added.<br />This Aussie film is not only a delight, but the characters are believable, and many who we know find themselves watching it over and over again- greatly brightens one's mood.  I'm purchasing the DVD soon to replace the video, now worn.<br />SIDE NOTE:  I find it rather interesting that Paul Mercurio, who is a definite delight as the male lead and extremely appealing, does not like this film and wants to distance himself from the whole dancing thing (although he danced for some time before his role in the movie).  It is too bad, because this movie is one of the best movies of all time.

Entirely enjoyable and a marvelously acted piece, my entire family loved this movie.  We had been expecting another biblical mish mash eliciting merely yawns, but were startled to see such a wonderful movie.<br />Martin Landau (Jacob) gave a fantastic performance, as did Ben Kingsley(Potiphar), Paul Mercurio(Joseph) (which bumps STRICTLY BALLROOM out of #1 on my Paul Mercurio list of favorite performances), Leslie-Anne Down was good as Potiphar's wife, and the 11 brothers of Joseph were fabulous.  The supporting cast was excellent.<br />The sensitive and well rounded way in which this story was handled was fresh, creative, yet took no liberties in veering from the original story.  Although it is not as spectacular in production as THE TEN COMMANDMENTS and other such movies, this movie was more like it &quot;really&quot; would have happened complete with humanity in all of its misery and magnificence.<br />I can not speak highly enough of this movie.  What a pleasant surprise.  We even got a chuckle out of it now and then!\nAMAZING!\nRoswell - The Complete Second Season\nShiri Appleby  (Actor),     Jason Behr  (Actor),     Allan Kroeker  (Director),     Bill L.
