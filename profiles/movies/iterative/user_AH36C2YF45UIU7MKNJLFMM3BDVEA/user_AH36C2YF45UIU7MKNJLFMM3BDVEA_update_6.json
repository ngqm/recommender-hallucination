Well, got a start on it, anyway, with this 2011 release of', 'Part One', \"(of three). The sprawling novel is necessarily telescoped down to size, and the focus is on railroad magnate Dagny Taggart (Taylor Schilling) and her intricate strategies involving a piece of real estate in Colorado, an ongoing economic collapse, and the rugged individualist, Hank Rearden (Grant Bowler), whose new metal alloy might come in handy for laying new track. Of course, the real issue in Rand's scenario is not metal alloy but the fact that government regulation and a misguided sense of collectivism and altruism is strangling the elite members of society, something the movie reminds us of with grim regularity. As a kind of boardroom-plotting movie,\", 'Atlas Shrugged', 'isn\\'t incompetent, and if director Paul Johansson hasn\\'t devised a way to make these heavy-handed discussions come to life, at least it keeps moving along. If you like Rand\\'s objectivist philosophy, you\\'ll bask in the glow of having those ideas reaffirmed, and if you\\'re uninitiated, well, they certainly are laid out there in stark fashion. (And if you find Rand\\'s ideas absurd, you\\'ll find this movie a little like watching a cult meeting.)

Esai Morales is nicely on his game, and he gets to deliver the explanation of the title--which, like so much else here, is spelled out in laborious fashion.
