It is quite challenging and you'll be pouring sweat after just a few minutes. I've made it through all four levels, though I've only done level 4 once. I'd say that level 1 done with 8lb handweights is the best overall workout on the DVD. If you're looking for an intense 30-min workout that hits all the right places, this is the one for you.\nReview Title: Best Jillian workout yet!!!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
