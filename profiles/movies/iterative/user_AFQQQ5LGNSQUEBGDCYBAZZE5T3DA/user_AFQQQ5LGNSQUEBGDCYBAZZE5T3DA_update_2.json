It is quite challenging and you'll be pouring sweat after just a few minutes. I've made it through all four levels, though I've only done level 4 once. I'd say that level 1 done with 8lb handweights is the best overall workout on the DVD. If you're looking for an intense 30-min workout that hits all the right places, this is the one for you.\nBest Jillian workout yet!!!\nX-TrainFit: Circuit Burnout 30 Day Fat Shred- 5-Disc set\nFormat: DVD\nMovies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Exercise & Fitness\n['LOSE WEIGHT AT HOME WITH MONIQUE ST.PIERRE', 'Looking to scorch fat but have limited time each day?
