Based on true events and laced with wry humor, STILL MINE tells the heartfelt tale of Craig Morrison (Academy Award(R) nominee Cromwell), who comes up against the system when he sets out to build a more suitable house for his ailing wife Irene (Academy Award(R) nominee Genevieve Bujold). Although Morrison uses the same methods his father, an accomplished shipbuilder, taught him, times have changed. He quickly gets blindsided by local building codes and bureaucratic officials. As Irene becomes increasingly ill - and amidst a series of stop-work orders - Craig races to finish the house. Hauled into court and facing jail, Craig takes a final stance against all odds in a truly inspirational story.']\nAverage Rating: 4.6\nProduct Details: {'Aspect Ratio': '1.85:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 2.72 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'FOX2294981DVD', 'Media Format': 'AC-3, Multiple Formats, Dolby, NTSC, Color, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Run time': '1 hour and 43 minutes', 'Release date': 'May 6, 2014', 'Actors': 'James Cromwell, Genevieve Bujold, Campbell Scott, Still Mine', 'Subtitles': 'Spanish, English', 'Studio': '20th Century Fox', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: great movie, recieved when expected\nReview Title: Five Stars\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
