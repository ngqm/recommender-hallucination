Meanwhile, thinking they have the house all to themselves, the kids get into mega-mischief -- never guessing their pint-sized parents are watching their every move! With amazing special effects and nonstop excitement, HONEY, WE SHRUNK OURSELVES is a hilarious, heartwarming, hugely entertaining adventure for the entire family!|Wayne Szalinksi is back, and this time when his notorious shrink machine misfires, it\\'s the adults who are shrunk. Believing their parents have left them home alone for the weekend, the kids take advantage of their newfound unsupervised freedom by filling up on junk food, Rollerblading in the house, playing loud music, and throwing a party for their friends. While desperately trying to get the kids to notice them, since they are only three quarters of an inch tall, the adults are able to learn a few things about their offspring. The film was extremely complicated to produce, with almost 400 composite shots totaling approximately 40 minutes of screen time. Dream Quest Images, which produced the visual effects, had the advantage of new technologies that were not available when the first film in the series was made.']\n{'Genre': 'ACTION, Comedy, LIVE', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Closed-captioned, Color, NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Dean Cundey, Nell Scovell, Allison Mack, Raymond N.
