The writers are good and I can actually see myself as one of this group. More, please.\nI enjoyed and want more.\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Starring': ['Helen Mirren', 'Jeremy Irons', 'Hugh Dancy'], 'Studio': ['HBO']}\nThis is based on a historic novel by Alison Weir, who usually writes factual biographies and so is in the spirit of accuracy. Nice visually. Helen Mirren and Jeremy Irons are of course wonderful.

Great chemistry between the two.\nHilarious and quirky smart\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Anna Foerster'], 'Producers': ['Tom Rosenberg', 'Gary Lucchesi', 'Len Wiseman', 'Richard S.

It could almost be the Aliens pre-pre sequel. Loved it. Ryan Reynolds is always hot. Jake Gyllenhaal is soulful. Rebecca Ferguson had a Sandra Bullock moment (that's good).  LOVED IT.\nCalvin and the Prometheus creature are cousins\n{'Audio languages': ['Polski'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Marek Klosowicz', 'Wojtek S\u0142ota'], 'Producers': ['Pawe\u0142 Potoroczyn'], 'Starring': ['Reinhold Messner', \"Wojciech 'Voytek' Kurtyka\", 'Marian Bala'], 'Studio': ['Adam Mickiewicz Institute']}\nGreat film about Polish climbers contribution to the sport.

Next to Miss Marple, definitely a top five favorite. I am slowly making my way through all the new things to watch on Acorn.tv and britbox channels.
