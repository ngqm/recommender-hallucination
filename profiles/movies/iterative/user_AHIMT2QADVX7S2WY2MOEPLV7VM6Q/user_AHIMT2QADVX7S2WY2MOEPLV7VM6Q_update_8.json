More, please.\nI enjoyed and want more.\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Starring': ['Helen Mirren', 'Jeremy Irons', 'Hugh Dancy'], 'Studio': ['HBO']}\nThis is based on a historic novel by Alison Weir, who usually writes factual biographies and so is in the spirit of accuracy.
