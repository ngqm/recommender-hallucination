  "reference_summary": "{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Jay Chandrasekhar'], 'Producers': ['Jay Chandrasekhar', 'Mike Nelson', 'Colin Bates'], 'Starring': ['Jay Chandrasekhar', 'Sarah Chalke', 'Selma Blair']}\nI love the cast. The writers are good and I can actually see myself as one of this group. More, please.\nI enjoyed and want more.\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Starring': ['Helen Mirren', 'Jeremy Irons', 'Hugh Dancy'], 'Studio': ['HBO']}\nThis is based on a historic novel by Alison Weir, who usually writes factual biographies and so is in the spirit of accuracy. Nice visually. Helen Mirren and Jeremy Irons are of course wonderful. I've watched this five times or more.\nWatch this\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Ben Taylor'], 'Producers': ['Rob Delaney', 'Sharon Horgan', 'Richard Allen-Turner', 'Kara Baker', 'Jon Thoday'], 'Starring': ['Sharon Horgan', 'Rob Delaney']}\nHilarious and quirky smart and that all on the first episode. She is English and he is American which creates opportunity for witty back-and-forth dialog. Great chemistry between the two.\nHilarious and quirky smart\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Anna Foerster'], 'Producers': ['Tom Rosenberg', 'Gary Lucchesi', 'Len Wiseman', 'Richard S. Wright', 'David Kern'], 'Starring': ['Kate Beckinsale', 'Theo James', 'Tobias Menzies']}\nTheo James as David, Bradley James as Varga and Tobias Menzies as Marius makes a hot cast. Very nice from a visual perspective. Lovely.\nExcellent cast from a female point of view\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Tim Miller'], 'Producers': ['Simon Kinberg', 'Ryan Reynolds', 'Lauren Shuler Donner'], 'Starring': ['Ryan Reynolds', 'Morena Baccarin', 'Ed Skrein']}\nSuch a witty and fun movie. I hope there is more to come.\nI want more\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Daniel Espinosa'], 'Producers': ['David Ellison', 'Dana Goldberg', 'Bonnie Curtis', 'Julie Lynn'], 'Starring': ['Ryan Reynolds', 'Jake Gyllenhaal', 'Rebecca Ferguson']}\nThis was so comparable to the Prometheus creature, right down to the tickle, tickle, SO cute little thing moment. It could almost be the Aliens pre-pre sequel. Loved it. Ryan Reynolds is always hot. Jake Gyllenhaal is soulful. Rebecca Ferguson had a Sandra Bullock moment (that's good).  LOVED IT.\nCalvin and the Prometheus creature are cousins\n{'Audio languages': ['Polski'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Marek Klosowicz', 'Wojtek S\u0142ota'], 'Producers': ['Pawe\u0142 Potoroczyn'], 'Starring': ['Reinhold Messner', \"Wojciech 'Voytek' Kurtyka\", 'Marian Bala'], 'Studio': ['Adam Mickiewicz Institute']}\nGreat film about Polish climbers contribution to the sport.  Wanda R. is a heroine of mine. I did have subtitles on mine when they were needed.\nSimon Callow narrated film about Polish mountain climbers\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Sandy Johnson', 'Keith Washington', 'Marcus Mortimer', 'Richard Holthouse', 'Christine Gernon', 'David Renwick', 'David Sant'], 'Producers': ['David Renwick', 'Verity Lambert', 'Jonathan Paul Llewellyn', 'Peter Thornton'], 'Studio': ['BritBox']}\nA very quirky series of mystery shows. Next to Miss Marple, definitely a top five favorite. I am slowly making my way through all the new things to watch on Acorn.tv and britbox channels. This was one I've watched every episode and also read anything about it online.  By a Texas nurse who wishes she lived in the UK.\nNew favorite British mystery/suspense show\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Jesper W. Nielsen', 'Karl Neilson'], 'Producers': ['Christine Healy', 'Elizabeth Kilgarriff', 'Richard Mewis', 'Vicky Wharton', 'Dominic Treadwell-Collins', \"Patrick O'Donoghue\"]}\nI am enjoying this series set in Ireland. Fionnula Flanagan has been a favorite actress of mine since 'The Others' with Nicole Kidman - she plays a villainous role very well. Maria Doyle Kennedy I've admired since she played Mary Tudor. The dynamics if this family are tortured and have beautiful scenery as a counterbalance.\nWell acted and written.\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Damon Thomas', 'Tom Shankland'], 'Producers': ['Howard Overman', 'Chris Carey'], 'Starring': ['Stephan Mangan', 'Darren Boyd'], 'Studio': ['ITV Studios']}\nI was laughing so hard before the opening credits. That takes a very special bit of writing, but more so, a brilliant actor. Texas girl loves this Brit show.\nWatch it, or else.\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Jason Ensler', 'Randall Einhorn', 'Roger Kumble', 'Danny Leiner', 'Jason Winer', 'Robert Berlinger', 'Gail Mancuso', 'Phil Traill', 'Ken Whittingham'], 'Producers': ['All3Media']}\nI o n ly get season 4 episode 9 with acorn tv - let me see the rest!\nFunny, sophomoric, but funny",
