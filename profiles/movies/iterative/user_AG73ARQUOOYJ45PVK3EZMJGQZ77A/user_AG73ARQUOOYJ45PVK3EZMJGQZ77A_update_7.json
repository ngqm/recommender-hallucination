  "reference_summary": "{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Rob Pritts'], 'Producers': ['Robert Simonds'], 'Starring': ['Chris Kattan', 'Peter Berg', 'Chris Penn']}\nWell, as the title would imply, I rented this movie as this hot/crazy Albanian chick loves this movie for whatever ungodly reasons. Needless to say, the mixture of Chris Kattan and alcohol cause her to be overwhelmed by hormones and ended up procreating several times. Great movie.\nRented this to get laid- success.\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Bill Duke'], 'Producers': ['Frank Mancuso Jr.', 'Bill Duke', 'Helen Sugland', 'Laurence Fishburne'], 'Starring': ['Laurence Fishburne', 'Tim Roth', 'Vanessa Williams'], 'Studio': ['MGM Domestic Television Distri']}\nWell, this was like American gangster, but not good.\nEh- just watch American gangster instead.\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Patricia Riggen'], 'Producers': ['Mike Medavoy', 'Robert Katz', 'Edward McGurn'], 'Starring': ['Antonio Banderas', 'Rodrigo Santoro', 'Juliette Binoche'], 'Studio': ['WARNER BROS.']}\nWhile understanding there are of course items in this movie which were dramatized for effect, the movie was fantastic.  The story of what happened to these men and how so may came together for the rescue attempt is nothing short of a miracle.\nHave tissues nearby.\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English', 'English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['James Bobin'], 'Producers': ['Joe Roth', 'Suzanne Todd', 'Jennifer Todd', 'Tim Burton'], 'Starring': ['Johnny Depp', 'Anne Hathaway', 'Mia Wasikowska'], 'Studio': ['Walt Disney Pictures']}\nWell, the old lady wanted to watch, so I obliged hoping to get some action in return...we were both so turned off by this movie that we not only didn't finish more than 35 minutes of it, but we went to the movies to see a good one instead.\nI can't believe I paid to rent this...\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Paul Greengrass'], 'Producers': ['Frank Marshall', 'Jeffrey M. Weiner', 'Ben Smith', 'Matt Damon', 'Paul Greengrass', 'Gregory Goodman'], 'Starring': ['Matt Damon', 'Tommy Lee Jones', 'Alicia Vikander']}\nGlad this followed up after the Jeremy Renner failure.<br /><br />Matt Damon is even more badass in this movie than his previous bourne exploits. I highly recommend this movie.\nHighly recommend.\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['David Yates'], 'Producers': ['Jerry Weintraub', 'David Barron'], 'Starring': ['Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd', 'Samuel L. Jackson', 'Margot Robbie'], 'Studio': ['WARNER BROS.']}\nThe old lady wanted to watch this movie(obvious reasons), so I obliged surely knowing that it was only a matter of time. Ended up actually watching the whole movie, and it was far better than I had expected.\nWatched it for the girlfriend, and I think I liked it more.\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Adam McKay'], 'Producers': ['Brad Pitt', 'Dede Gardner', 'Jeremy Kleiner', 'Arnon Milchan'], 'Starring': ['Christian Bale', 'Steve Carell', 'Ryan Gosling'], 'Studio': ['Paramount']}\nIf you like drugs and loosely based behaviors of individuals highly involved in the financial industry, then look no further than this as a perfect follow up to wolf of wallstreet.\nYou won't be disappointed.
