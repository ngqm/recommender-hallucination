If you do like the Three Stooges, you'll love this show. It is the same old slip on a banana peel, pie in the face, and fall flat on your butt stuff, but it is hard not to laugh - it is genuinely funny.\nReview Title: Goofy slapstick, but funny!\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Now, I'm paying for season two and have found that like someone else once noted, Zoe has become less likeable while Lemon has become much more likeable (whoulda thunket?). I will continue to watch Hart and follow the (great) cast through their trials and tribulations and enjoy every minute of it. I guess you could say &#34;I'm hooked.&#34;\nIt's the only \"soap\" I've ever watched\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Sheree Folkson'], 'Producers': ['Robert Bernstein', 'Douglas Rae', 'Paul Ritchie'], 'Starring': ['Alice Eve', 'Kelly Macdonald', 'David Tennant']}\nI really didn't expect much from this little bit of &#34;fluff,&#34; just thought I'd watch it while I ate. But, surprisingly, it had a few little twists and turns that made it unusual and kinda &#34;sweet.&#34; All in all, though off the beaten track, it turned out to be enjoyable.\nPretty good\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['J.
