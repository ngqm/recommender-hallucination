  "reference_summary": "{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['David Paymer', 'Tim Matheson', 'James Hayman', 'Joe Lazarov', 'Janice Cooke', 'Patrick R. Norris', 'Bethany Rooney', 'Jeremiah S. Chechik', 'Ron Lagomarsino', 'Michael Schultz'], 'Producers': ['Not Specified'], 'Starring': ['Rachel Bilson', 'Jaime King', 'Wilson Bethel']}\nI'm a guy and as such, have never been one to &#34;waste my time on the soaps,&#34; however I made the mistake of watching the first couple of Hart of Dixie, season 1 episodes, as freebies, and I guess I got hooked. Now, I'm paying for season two and have found that like someone else once noted, Zoe has become less likeable while Lemon has become much more likeable (whoulda thunket?). I will continue to watch Hart and follow the (great) cast through their trials and tribulations and enjoy every minute of it. I guess you could say &#34;I'm hooked.&#34;\nIt's the only \"soap\" I've ever watched\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Sheree Folkson'], 'Producers': ['Robert Bernstein', 'Douglas Rae', 'Paul Ritchie'], 'Starring': ['Alice Eve', 'Kelly Macdonald', 'David Tennant']}\nI really didn't expect much from this little bit of &#34;fluff,&#34; just thought I'd watch it while I ate. But, surprisingly, it had a few little twists and turns that made it unusual and kinda &#34;sweet.&#34; All in all, though off the beaten track, it turned out to be enjoyable.\nPretty good\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['J. Rupert Thompson'], 'Producers': ['Matt Kunitz', 'Trice Barto', 'Ian Busch', 'Cece Pleasants', 'Scott Larsen', 'Matt Kaye', 'Hilary Liberman Shields', 'Matthew Muchka', 'Keith Geller'], 'Studio': ['ABC']}\nIf you don't laugh at people's physical misfortunes, you won't like this show. If you do like the Three Stooges, you'll love this show. It is the same old slip on a banana peel, pie in the face, and fall flat on your butt stuff, but it is hard not to laugh - it is genuinely funny.\nGoofy slapstick, but funny!\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Antoine Fuqua'], 'Producers': ['Gerard Butler'], 'Starring': ['Gerard Butler', 'Morgan Freeman', 'Dylan McDermott'], 'Studio': ['FilmDistrict Distribution', 'LLC']}\nI liked it. You do have to take it with a pinch of salt, but as long as you don't take it TOO seriously, you can appreciate it for what it is: an entertaining action movie with a somewhat plausible plot and respectable acting. I've liked Gerard Butler ever since &#34;Law Abiding Citizen&#34; and I thought that he did a good job in his hero-save-the-day role. The best two compliments I could give this movie is that it was worth the $5.00 I paid to watch it, and I'll watch it again when it's on my subscription TV..\nGood movie - action filled and enjoyable for me\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'Fran\u00e7ais (Canada)', '\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a)', '\u092e\u0930\u093e\u0920\u0940', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', 'Portugu\u00eas', '\u0c24\u0c46\u0c32\u0c41\u0c17\u0c41', 'Fran\u00e7ais (France)', '\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bcd'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', '\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a)', 'Fran\u00e7ais', 'Indonesia', 'Bahasa Melayu', 'Nederlands', 'Portugu\u00eas (Brasil)', 'Portugu\u00eas (Portugal)', '\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22', 'T\u00fcrk\u00e7e', 'Ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t', '\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7b80\u4f53\uff09'], 'Directors': ['Robert Schwentke'], 'Producers': ['Lorenzo di Bonaventura', 'Mark Vahradian'], 'Starring': ['Julian McMahon', 'James Remar', 'Ernest Borgnine'], 'Studio': ['Lionsgate']}\nI really liked this movie, liked all of the actors - casting was spot on. It's a little bit romantic comedy, a little bit action/adventure, and a little bit conspiracy spy thriller - a little something for everybody. Don't take it too seriously and you'll enjoy it. Be aware that there's lots of violence, but it's light-hearted violence, no blood and guts. It's worth watching!\nA light-hearted CIA spy thriller\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Gary Fleder'], 'Producers': ['Sylvester Stallone', 'Kevin King Templeton', 'John Thompson'], 'Starring': ['Jason Statham', 'James Franco', 'Winona Ryder'], 'Studio': ['OPEN ROAD']}\nI like Jason Statham, primarily because I enjoy seeing the bad guys getting their butts kicked - and he does it well. This movie isn't perfection, but if you like Statham movies, it's worth the time. Acting is pretty good, his daughter's part was well played and the story line was pretty good too. All in all, if you like action movies, you'll like Homefront.\nWorth a watch\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'frightening scenes', 'alcohol use', 'smoking'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Peter Jackson'], 'Producers': ['Peter Jackson', 'Fran Walsh', 'Zane Weiner', 'Carolynne Cunningham'], 'Starring': ['Ian McKellen', 'Martin Freeman', 'Richard Armitage'], 'Studio': ['WARNER BROS.']}\nThough flush with great graphics, I found the storyline to be disjointed and lacking in transition and continuity. With the tons of bucks undoubtedly spent on production values, costumes, sets, etc. I expected more.\nA disappointment\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Edwin L. Marshall'], 'Producers': ['Lydia Fleming', 'Edwin L. Marshall', 'Pastor Shepherd', 'James Swisher', 'Danny Trejo', 'Zander Villayne'], 'Starring': ['Pastor Shepherd', 'Danny Trejo'], 'Studio': ['Green Apple Entertainment', 'Inc.']}\nI watched this strictly because of Danny Trejo, well it turns out that he has a bit part and he can't help this garbage from ending up where it belongs - at the bottom of the porcelain convenience.\nDon't waste your time\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Paul McGuigan'], 'Producers': ['Chris Roberts'], 'Starring': ['Bruce Willis', 'Josh Hartnett', 'Lucy Liu']}\nI thought it was great!\nGreat movie!\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Andrew McCarthy', 'Michael W.

Thorin Jr.', 'Cort Hessler', 'Christine Gee', 'Christine Moore', \"Terrence O'Hara\"], 'Producers': ['John Davis', 'John Fox', 'Jon Bokenkamp', 'John Eisendrath'], 'Studio': ['NBC Network']}\nWhile I wouldn't call it &#34;flawless,&#34; the series was well acted and contained enough action and suspense to keep me entertained. I was sorry to see the 22 episode package end.\nSorry to see it end.\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Michael Rauch', 'Matthew Penn', 'Jay Chandrasekhar', 'Emile B.
