Griffith brought the same common sense and friendly, laconic style to his new role, but Police Chief Sam McNeill has something more challenging than Mayberry's town drunk to deal with: life-and-death mystery. The ski resort Sam protects is the target of a serial killer who leaves no clues except taunting messages spray-painted next to the bodies of his -- or her -- victims.
