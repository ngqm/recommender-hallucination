Along for the ride on this five-time Emmy-winning series are such stellar guest stars as Rob Reiner, Louis Gossett Jr., Linda Evans, Isaac Hayes and Dick Butkus.

Season two highlights include the two-part \"Gearjammers,\" in which Rockford discovers his dad\\'s secret life, \"Chicken Little Is a Little Chicken,\" in which Rockford helps Angel fake his death, and \"The Hammer of C Block,\" with Isaac \"Shaft\" Hayes as a former cellmate who just can\\'t get his name straight\\x97he thinks it\\'s \"Rockfish.\" (The Oscar-winning Hayes also contributes an original number called \"Gandy\\'s Theme.\") Even when the episodes are less memorable, Garner\\'s easygoing Oklahoma charm and potent chemistry with his co-stars, including lawyer/ex-girlfriend girlfriend Beth (Gretchen Corbett), makes each one worth watching. Like most Stephen J. Cannell programs (', 'Baretta', ',', '21 Jump Street', ', etc.),', 'The Rockford Files', 'never had any difficulty attracting famous (and soon-to-be-famous) guests.
