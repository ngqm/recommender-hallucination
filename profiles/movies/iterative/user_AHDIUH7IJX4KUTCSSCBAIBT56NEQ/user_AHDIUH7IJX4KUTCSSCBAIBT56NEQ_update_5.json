Smart.  In your face law of attraction.  They say: Think, feeeel, daydream, act as if and it will be true.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus does exactly that as Ellen, a soon to be empty-nester fantasizing, living life large in her imagined romantic, enriched, joy de vivre in Paris.<br /><br />The night before they are to catch their flight, her husband takes a different exit and Ellen has a head-on collision with her dream.  She goes to Paris anyway, but finds it void, flat, and unpoetic. She trudges day to day anyway, waiting for the tightly closed vision to bloom.<br /><br />Finally a facebook message with great news!  She will cook dinner; find the finest ingredients in Paris; select the perfect wine; and she\u2019ll buy the scarf with the way-too-high price-tag to accessorize the  completely romantic evening that has just come into town.  You can smell the cooking.  Taste the wine.  Feel the warmth of the candles.  Ellen looks stunning and her soul is radiating. Then.  He. Is. Late.  And he is later.  And later.  He finally shows.<br /><br />The next morning, with bile still in her throat, she settles into the patio caf\u00e9 seat that virtually has her name on it from the days she has spent there waiting for the helium to inflate her gay Paris.  The waiter who has watched her become a fixture throws her a bone and tells her of his favorite place in the city.  The city floats again, just a little, enough to give hope. At last, there is romance in Paris.<br /><br />This is where you might want to brace yourself for a turn that is nothing compared to the exit her husband took the night before the flight.  Turns out there is the perfect P\u00e2t\u00e9.  Life is about passion, and joy de vivre is about surfing whatever comes with lightheartedness, vivaciousness, and confidence.  Ellen has found her joy and, well, law of attraction has come through after all.\nThe perfect P\u00e2t\u00e9: This movie will develop its fullest flavor after a few days of chilling\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a)', 'Italiano', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', 'Polski', '\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e', 'Portugu\u00eas', 'Deutsch', 'Fran\u00e7ais'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', '\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629', '\u010ce\u0161tina', 'Dansk', 'Deutsch', '\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a)', 'Suomi', 'Filipino', 'Fran\u00e7ais', '\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea', '\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940', 'Magyar', 'Indonesia', 'Italiano', '\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e', '\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4', 'Bahasa Melayu', 'Norsk Bokm\u00e5l', 'Nederlands', 'Polski', 'Portugu\u00eas (Brasil)', 'Portugu\u00eas (Portugal)', 'Rom\u00e2n\u0103', '\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439', 'Svenska', '\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bcd', '\u0c24\u0c46\u0c32\u0c41\u0c17\u0c41', '\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22', 'T\u00fcrk\u00e7e', '\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430', 'Ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t', '\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7b80\u4f53\uff09', '\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7e41\u9ad4\uff09'], 'Directors': ['Paul Weitz', 'Adam Brooks', 'Jason Schwartzman', 'Roman Coppola', 'Tricia Brock'], 'Producers': ['Paul Weitz', 'Roman Coppola', 'Jason Schwartzman', 'Alex Timbers'], 'Starring': ['Lola Kirke', 'Saffron Burrows', 'Bernadette Peters'], 'Studio': ['Amazon Studios']}\nGood entertainment\nFive Stars\n{'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Richard Starzak', 'Christopher Sadler', 'Jay Grace', 'Lee Wilton', 'Seamus Malone', 'Jean-Philippe Vine', 'Richard Webber', 'Will Becher', 'Mike Mort', 'Dave Osmand'], 'Starring': ['John Sparkes', 'Justin Fletcher', 'Kate Harbour'], 'Studio': ['Aardman Animations']}\nClever, fun, perfect length for pure enjoyment!\npure enjoyment!\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Norman Jewison'], 'Producers': ['Patrick J.
