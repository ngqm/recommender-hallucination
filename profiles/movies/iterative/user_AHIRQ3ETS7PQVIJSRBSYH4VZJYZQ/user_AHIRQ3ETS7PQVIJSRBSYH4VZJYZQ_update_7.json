But the action is fast and discreet so save movie until you are ready to really watch it closely. Both lead actors put in exceptional performances to say the least. Be sure to keep an eye on the gruffy old bouncer too.

The movie version rocks and the broadway version in comparision suxs.<br /><br />Thus having painfully sat through this remake of the broadway version I will rate it a tedious and un-interesting if not embarrassing.  Additionally the audio mix in the new one is terrible (or the lead has a very weak voice) and the stage is poor.<br /><br />Overall nothing in this new version sparkles...I would rate it lower that a typical high school drama club presentation of Fiddler on the Roof...except here I no children I am related to to compele me to attend.
