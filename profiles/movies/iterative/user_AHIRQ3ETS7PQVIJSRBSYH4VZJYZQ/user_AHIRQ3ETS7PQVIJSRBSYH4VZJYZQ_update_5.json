The movie version rocks and the broadway version in comparision suxs.<br /><br />Thus having painfully sat through this remake of the broadway version I will rate it a tedious and un-interesting if not embarrassing.  Additionally the audio mix in the new one is terrible (or the lead has a very weak voice) and the stage is poor.<br /><br />Overall nothing in this new version sparkles...I would rate it lower that a typical high school drama club presentation of Fiddler on the Roof...except here I no children I am related to to compele me to attend.  And I am sorry I did.\nPoor at best...\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]', '\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940', '\u092e\u0930\u093e\u0920\u0940', '\u0c24\u0c46\u0c32\u0c41\u0c17\u0c41', 'Fran\u00e7ais', '\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bcd'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', 'Fran\u00e7ais', '\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940', 'Indonesia', '\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4', 'Bahasa Melayu', '\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22', 'Ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t', '\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7b80\u4f53\uff09'], 'Directors': ['Gary Ross'], 'Producers': ['Nina Jacobson', 'Jon Kilik'], 'Starring': ['Jennifer Lawrence', 'Josh Hutcherson', 'Liam Hemsworth'], 'Studio': ['SciFi and Fantasy']}\nI have to guess that I missed something.<br /><br />Despite all the hype over this, I was just underwhelmed.<br /><br />A very small story told even smaller.\nVery ordinary movie?\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Charles Beeson', 'Jeffrey G.
