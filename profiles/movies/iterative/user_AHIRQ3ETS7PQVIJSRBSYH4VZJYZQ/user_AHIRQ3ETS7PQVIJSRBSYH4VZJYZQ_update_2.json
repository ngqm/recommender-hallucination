The movie version rocks and the broadway version in comparision suxs.<br /><br />Thus having painfully sat through this remake of the broadway version I will rate it a tedious and un-interesting if not embarrassing.  Additionally the audio mix in the new one is terrible (or the lead has a very weak voice) and the stage is poor.<br /><br />Overall nothing in this new version sparkles...I would rate it lower that a typical high school drama club presentation of Fiddler on the Roof...except here I no children I am related to to compele me to attend.
