Very easy to follow with instructions that are visually reinforced. Even a guy with two left feet, like me, can learn to be the dance king. I taught my wife a few simple steps and we became the hit of the wedding party as we foxtrotted and waltzed all over the floor. Comments I got were, \"Where did you learn to dance like that?\" and \"I didn\\'t know you could dance like that!\". One hint, though: Get this video early - don\\'t wait until the week before your wedding like I did. You need at least a month of practice for all of the steps to become easy. If you apply yourself just a half hour each night, you can really get the basics down pat. Enjoy. Make Fred and Ginger envious. --Bernd VanderSchuur, Verified PurchaseThis DVD provided several hours of laughter while my daughter and her fianc\u00e9, my daughter and I, and my wife and I learned some basic steps and prepared to dance at the daughter\\'s wedding last May. Certainly none of us rivaled Fred and Ginger, but just the confidence of knowing _something_ about dance made all the difference in the world. DEFINITELY buy this if you\\'ve got an event coming up, and you want to do more that just sway back and forth on the dance floor. --D.
