This is one of them (The Perfect Human Diet is another). Sometimes funny, very informative and  well done, you'll learn about the politics of food and nutrition as decided by politicians, Big Ag, the USDA, and self-appointed interest groups  backed by opinion rather than science.  This is not only entertaining, but you'll want to share it with others you love because it's an eye opener.  Like the little boy in the tale \"The Emperor's New  Clothes\", the voice of reason and common sense rarely makes headlines, or when it does, it's met with derision.  In other words if you eat like a human you  will be swimming upstream in today's river of  diet disasters like vegetarian,  veganism and the biggest fad of all, the low fat highly processed carb diet - the Standard American Diet.

  "reference_summary": "Baron Baptiste's Power Yoga Level 2\nRated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Exercise & Fitness\n['A great yoga training DVD']\n{'Genre': 'Exercise & Fitness', 'Format': 'NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Baptiste, Baron', 'Language': 'English', 'Publication Date': 'August 5, 2003', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'Unrated (Not Rated)', 'Package Dimensions': '7.1 x 5.42 x 0.58 inches; 2.88 Ounces', 'Media Format': 'NTSC', 'Release date': 'August 5, 2003', 'Actors': 'Baptiste, Baron', 'Studio': 'Good Times Video'}\nI purchased this because I had viewed the PBS Journey Into Power program and was intrigued.  The DVD is a Goodtimes production and the first  part of the &quot;program&quot; is a commercial for their other products. You can't just skip to the workout, which I found annoying. The actual practice begins with Baron explaining how yoga will improve your life,etc. Again, you can't skip ahead here, either. When the practice actually starts, it turns out to be a set, with everyone ( all under 25 yrs. and very fit)  in white Danskin yoga-gear.  The music is eighties - ish and as loud as Baron is, so it's distracting. No one appears to be doing any modifications so those just beginning may injure themselves trying to keep up.<br /> If  you're looking for a 'power yoga'  practice that you can grow with, I highly recommend David Swenson's Short Forms tape or DVD (also available at amazon) as the best to begin with. It has three workouts that are suitable for the beginner and the advanced practitioner, and a great guided relaxation. His book is a must have, too. The Flow series, featuring Tracey Rich and Ganga White, is also an excellent production that is beautifully produced, can be tailored to your level and never gets 'old'.\nDifficult to view and practice with.\nPlanet Earth: The Complete BBC Series\nDavid Attenborough  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, BBC, All BBC Titles\n['Product Description', 'Planet Earth: The Complete Collection (DVD)', 'With an unprecedented production budget of $25 million, and from the makers of', 'Blue Planet: Seas of Life', \", comes the epic story of life on Earth. Five years in production, over 2,000 days in the field, using 40 cameramen filming across 200 locations, shot entirely in high definition, this is the ultimate portrait of our planet. A stunning television experience that captures rare action, impossible locations and intimate moments with our planet's best-loved, wildest and most elusive creatures. From the highest mountains to the deepest rivers, this blockbuster series takes you on an unforgettable journey through the daily struggle for survival in Earth's most extreme habitats. Planet Earth takes you to places you have never seen before, to experience sights and sounds you may never experience anywhere else.\", ']]>', 'Amazon.com', 'As of its release in early 2007,', 'Planet Earth', 'is quite simply the greatest nature/wildlife series ever produced. Following the similarly monumental achievement of', 'The Blue Planet: Seas of Life', ', this astonishing 11-part BBC series is brilliantly narrated by Sir David Attenborough and sensibly organized so that each 50-minute episode covers a specific geographical region and/or wildlife habitat (mountains, caves, deserts, shallow seas, seasonal forests, etc.) until the entire planet has been magnificently represented by the most astonishing sights and sounds you\\'ll ever experience from the comforts of home. The premiere episode, \"From Pole to Pole,\" serves as a primer for things to come, placing the entire series in proper context and giving a general overview of what to expect from each individual episode. Without being overtly political, the series maintains a consistent and subtle emphasis on the urgent need for ongoing conservation, best illustrated by the plight of polar bears whose very behavior is changing (to accommodate life-threatening changes in their fast-melting habitat) in the wake of global warming--a phenomenon that this series appropriately presents as scientific fact. With this harsh reality as subtext, the series proceeds to accentuate the positive, delivering a seemingly endless variety of natural wonders, from the spectacular mating displays of New Guinea\\'s various birds of paradise to a rare encounter with Siberia\\'s nearly-extinct Amur Leopards, of which only 30 remain in the wild.', 'That\\'s just a hint of the marvels on display. Accompanied by majestic orchestral scores by George Fenton, every episode is packed with images so beautiful or so forcefully impressive (and so perfectly photographed by the BBC\\'s tenacious high-definition camera crews) that you\\'ll be rendered speechless by the splendor of it all. You\\'ll see a seal struggling to out-maneuver a Great White Shark; swimming macaques in the Ganges delta; massive flocks of snow geese numbering in the hundreds of thousands; an awesome night-vision sequence of lions attacking an elephant; the Colugo (or \"flying lemur\"--not really a lemur!) of the Philippines; a hunting alliance of fish and snakes on Indonesia\\'s magnificent coral reef; the bioluminescent \"vampire squid\" of the deep oceans... these are just a few of countless highlights, masterfully filmed from every conceivable angle, with frequent use of super-slow-motion and amazing motion-controlled time-lapse cinematography, and narrated by Attenborough with his trademark combination of observational wit and informative authority. The result is a hugely entertaining series that doesn\\'t flinch from the predatory realities of nature (death is a constant presence, without being off-putting), and each episode ends with 10-minute \"Planet Earth Diaries\" (exclusive to this DVD set) that cover a specific aspect of production, like \"Diving with Pirahnas\" or \"Into the Abyss\" (the latter showing the rigors of filming the planet\\'s most spectacular caves, including the last filming ever officially permitted in the \"Chandelier Ballroom,\" a crystal-encrusted cavern found over a mile deep in New Mexico\\'s treacherous Lechuguilla, the deepest cave in the continental United States.)', \"With so many of Earth's natural wonders on display, it's only fitting that the final DVD in this five-disc set is devoted to\", 'Planet Earth: The Future', \", a separate three-part series in which a global array of experts is assembled to discuss issues of conservation, protection of delicate ecosystems, and the socio-economic benefits of understanding nature as a commodity that returns trillions of dollars in value at no cost to Earth's human population. At a time when the multiple threats of global warming should be obvious to all, let's give Sir David the last word, from the closing of\", 'Planet Earth', '\\'s final episode: \"We can now destroy or we can cherish--the choice is ours.\"', '--Jeff Shannon', 'Stills from', 'Planet Earth', '(click for larger image)']\n{'Genre': 'Documentary', 'Format': 'Anamorphic, Box set, Closed-captioned, Subtitled', 'Contributor': 'David Attenborough', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1), Unqualified', 'Number Of Discs': '5', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.78:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '7 x 5.5 x 1.25 inches; 14.22 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'E2938', 'Media Format': 'Anamorphic, Box set, Closed-captioned, Subtitled', 'Run time': '2 hours and 30 minutes', 'Release date': 'April 24, 2007', 'Actors': 'David Attenborough', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish, French', 'Studio': 'BBC Home Entertainment', 'Number of discs': '5'}\nSometimes - maybe all the time, we humans forget that we're not the only earthlings. And like ants on a counter top, we are unable to take in the diversity and power of the life and geology around us. Planet Earth has taken on the challenge to awaken our senses, treat our eyes and ears and, explode our personal myths of the dominance of \"man\". The production and photography are amongest the best! Stunning, magnificent and breathtaking don't do the film justice. We have been glued to our seats as we've been introduced to animals and plants we've never seen and the familiar are even more amazing thanks to the tireless and often risky business of photography in the wilds. This production will become a classic because every aspect of the film has been carefully thought out - serendipity, not withstanding. You may not need to own this but you must see it.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the producers just had to gratuitously throw in the most over done wildlife episodes seen on almost every wildlife program - the wildebeast crossing with the crocodiles, the wolf hunt, dog hunt, lion hunt, the shark \"attack\", etc., etc.  These could have been left out as everyone with access to a Tv has probably seen these ad nauseum.\nOne of the best!\nAmerica's Test Kitchen Season 6\nRated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, TV\n['Twenty-six episodes (the complete 6th season) on four discs, Color, Not Rated.

The plot sets in motion when Sophie (Amanda Seyfried,', 'Mean Girls', \"), daughter of Donna (Streep), sends a letter to three men, inviting them to her wedding--because after reading her mother's diary, she suspects that one of them is her father. When all three arrive at the Greek island where Donna runs a hotel, Donna flips out and finds that passions she thought she'd laid aside are coming back to life. But let's face it, the plot is not the point--it's a ridiculous contrivance that provides an excuse for the characters to sing the massive hits of ABBA.
