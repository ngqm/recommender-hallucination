Following the similarly monumental achievement of', 'The Blue Planet: Seas of Life', ', this astonishing 11-part BBC series is brilliantly narrated by Sir David Attenborough and sensibly organized so that each 50-minute episode covers a specific geographical region and/or wildlife habitat (mountains, caves, deserts, shallow seas, seasonal forests, etc.) until the entire planet has been magnificently represented by the most astonishing sights and sounds you\\'ll ever experience from the comforts of home. The premiere episode, \"From Pole to Pole,\" serves as a primer for things to come, placing the entire series in proper context and giving a general overview of what to expect from each individual episode. Without being overtly political, the series maintains a consistent and subtle emphasis on the urgent need for ongoing conservation, best illustrated by the plight of polar bears whose very behavior is changing (to accommodate life-threatening changes in their fast-melting habitat) in the wake of global warming--a phenomenon that this series appropriately presents as scientific fact. With this harsh reality as subtext, the series proceeds to accentuate the positive, delivering a seemingly endless variety of natural wonders, from the spectacular mating displays of New Guinea\\'s various birds of paradise to a rare encounter with Siberia\\'s nearly-extinct Amur Leopards, of which only 30 remain in the wild.', 'That\\'s just a hint of the marvels on display.

And like ants on a counter top, we are unable to take in the diversity and power of the life and geology around us. Planet Earth has taken on the challenge to awaken our senses, treat our eyes and ears and, explode our personal myths of the dominance of \"man\". The production and photography are amongest the best! Stunning, magnificent and breathtaking don't do the film justice. We have been glued to our seats as we've been introduced to animals and plants we've never seen and the familiar are even more amazing thanks to the tireless and often risky business of photography in the wilds. This production will become a classic because every aspect of the film has been carefully thought out - serendipity, not withstanding. You may not need to own this but you must see it.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the producers just had to gratuitously throw in the most over done wildlife episodes seen on almost every wildlife program - the wildebeast crossing with the crocodiles, the wolf hunt, dog hunt, lion hunt, the shark \"attack\", etc., etc.  These could have been left out as everyone with access to a Tv has probably seen these ad nauseum.\nReview Title: One of the best!\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Baron Baptiste's Power Yoga Level 2\nRated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Exercise & Fitness\n['A great yoga training DVD']\n{'Genre': 'Exercise & Fitness', 'Format': 'NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Baptiste, Baron', 'Language': 'English', 'Publication Date': 'August 5, 2003', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'Unrated (Not Rated)', 'Package Dimensions': '7.1 x 5.42 x 0.58 inches; 2.88 Ounces', 'Media Format': 'NTSC', 'Release date': 'August 5, 2003', 'Actors': 'Baptiste, Baron', 'Studio': 'Good Times Video'}\nI purchased this because I had viewed the PBS Journey Into Power program and was intrigued.  The DVD is a Goodtimes production and the first  part of the &quot;program&quot; is a commercial for their other products. You can't just skip to the workout, which I found annoying. The actual practice begins with Baron explaining how yoga will improve your life,etc. Again, you can't skip ahead here, either. When the practice actually starts, it turns out to be a set, with everyone ( all under 25 yrs. and very fit)  in white Danskin yoga-gear.  The music is eighties - ish and as loud as Baron is, so it's distracting. No one appears to be doing any modifications so those just beginning may injure themselves trying to keep up.<br /> If  you're looking for a 'power yoga'  practice that you can grow with, I highly recommend David Swenson's Short Forms tape or DVD (also available at amazon) as the best to begin with. It has three workouts that are suitable for the beginner and the advanced practitioner, and a great guided relaxation. His book is a must have, too. The Flow series, featuring Tracey Rich and Ganga White, is also an excellent production that is beautifully produced, can be tailored to your level and never gets 'old'.\nDifficult to view and practice with.\nPlanet Earth: The Complete BBC Series\nDavid Attenborough  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, BBC, All BBC Titles\n['Product Description', 'Planet Earth: The Complete Collection (DVD)', 'With an unprecedented production budget of $25 million, and from the makers of', 'Blue Planet: Seas of Life', \", comes the epic story of life on Earth.
