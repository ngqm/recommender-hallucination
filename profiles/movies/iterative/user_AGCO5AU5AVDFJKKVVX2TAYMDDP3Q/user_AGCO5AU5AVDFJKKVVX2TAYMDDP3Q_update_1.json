The DVD is a Goodtimes production and the first  part of the &quot;program&quot; is a commercial for their other products. You can't just skip to the workout, which I found annoying. The actual practice begins with Baron explaining how yoga will improve your life,etc. Again, you can't skip ahead here, either. When the practice actually starts, it turns out to be a set, with everyone ( all under 25 yrs. and very fit)  in white Danskin yoga-gear.  The music is eighties - ish and as loud as Baron is, so it's distracting. No one appears to be doing any modifications so those just beginning may injure themselves trying to keep up.<br /> If  you're looking for a 'power yoga'  practice that you can grow with, I highly recommend David Swenson's Short Forms tape or DVD (also available at amazon) as the best to begin with. It has three workouts that are suitable for the beginner and the advanced practitioner, and a great guided relaxation. His book is a must have, too. The Flow series, featuring Tracey Rich and Ganga White, is also an excellent production that is beautifully produced, can be tailored to your level and never gets 'old'.\nReview Title: Difficult to view and practice with.\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
