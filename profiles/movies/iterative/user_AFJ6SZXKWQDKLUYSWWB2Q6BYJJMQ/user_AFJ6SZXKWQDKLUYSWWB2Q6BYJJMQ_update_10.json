It is so easy to empathize with the men in this movie, and their animosity towards Ward's wife. It is difficult to conceive of anyone who would want to be close to Ward's wife, or who would agree with her values and actions. It is a great light summer movie, where you don't have to look too far to understand the characters. Depth there is not, but it is a light-hearted movie.\nReview Title: I wouldn't want to have to live with Ward's wife--not in this lifetime...or ever\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I do wish that Piper would wear her hair up as she did in the beginning, as it was so graceful and elegant, but she is probably representing a harder working-in the trenches-type of woman now.

While my mathematical knowledge is nowhere near the level used in this show, I do have some background in statistics, and the types of analysis with which I am familiar with are used appropriately within the context of this show. From now on I will have a renewed appreciation for ANOVA (analysis of variance) and multiple regression equations, thanks to this show. Kudus to the writers for integrating mathematical analysis into a crime drama, and for bringing this show to life.  The actors are also great in bringing these episodes to life, and from taking an otherwise potentially boring approach to criminal analysis to life in an exciting way!  I am enjoying a Numb3rs marathon viewing of my own, and while enjoying the episode I am viewing, I always look forward to the next episode. I am never disappointed.\nIn the context of murder mysteries, statistical analyses comes to life!\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Ken Sanzel', 'Rod Holcomb', 'Alex Zakrzewski', 'Dennis Smith', 'Ralph Hemecker', 'Stephen Gyllenhaal', 'Julie H\u00e9bert', 'Gwyneth Horder-Payton', 'Rob Morrow:Nicolas Falacci'], 'Producers': ['Ridley Scott', 'Tony Scott', 'Ken Sanzel', 'David W.

The academic setting was also quite appreciated; was it provided a context that was much more refined and interesting than a comparable program without higher level thinking skills functioning as a foundation for interplay among the major characters,\nNever enough Numb3rs--more episodes please!\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Armando Iannucci', 'Tristram Shapeero', 'Christopher Morris'], 'Starring': ['Julia Louis-Dreyfus', 'Anna Chlumsky', 'Tony Hale'], 'Studio': ['HBO']}\nThis is a hysterically funny comedy, and gives a very interesting view of politics and how one's intentions may never be fulfilled.
