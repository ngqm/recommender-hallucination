I didn't realize there was so much of it because it is edited out when watching these on network TV.  I so enjoy the action and comedy between the two characters.  Too bad it is ruined by the cursing.  I only got through Rush Hour, and that with great difficulty.\nI miss the language editing for TV\n{'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Richard Starzak', 'Christopher Sadler', 'Jay Grace', 'Lee Wilton', 'Seamus Malone', 'Jean-Philippe Vine', 'Richard Webber', 'Will Becher', 'Mike Mort', 'Dave Osmand'], 'Starring': ['John Sparkes', 'Justin Fletcher', 'Kate Harbour'], 'Studio': ['Aardman Animations']}\nSomething light and enjoyable to watch.

Unfortunately, it doesn't seem very true to life as far as the damaging effects would go, and somehow there is plenty of food for everyone to eat.  As the season moves on, it becomes more of a typical soap opera.

Brought back memories of the ride in Disneyland.  Yeah, that was a long time ago.  This is an interesting concept of miniaturization with some biology thrown in.
