I didn't realize there was so much of it because it is edited out when watching these on network TV.  I so enjoy the action and comedy between the two characters.  Too bad it is ruined by the cursing.  I only got through Rush Hour, and that with great difficulty.\nReview Title: I miss the language editing for TV\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
