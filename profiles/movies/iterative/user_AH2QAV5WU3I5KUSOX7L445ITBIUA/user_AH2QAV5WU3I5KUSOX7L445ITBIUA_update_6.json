I didn't realize there was so much of it because it is edited out when watching these on network TV.  I so enjoy the action and comedy between the two characters.  Too bad it is ruined by the cursing.  I only got through Rush Hour, and that with great difficulty.\nI miss the language editing for TV\n{'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Richard Starzak', 'Christopher Sadler', 'Jay Grace', 'Lee Wilton', 'Seamus Malone', 'Jean-Philippe Vine', 'Richard Webber', 'Will Becher', 'Mike Mort', 'Dave Osmand'], 'Starring': ['John Sparkes', 'Justin Fletcher', 'Kate Harbour'], 'Studio': ['Aardman Animations']}\nSomething light and enjoyable to watch.
