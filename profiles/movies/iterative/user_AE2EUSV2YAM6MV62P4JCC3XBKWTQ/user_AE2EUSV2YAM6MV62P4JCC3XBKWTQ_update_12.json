Today that notion of the essential goodness of America is under attack, replaced by another story in which theft and plunder are seen as the defining features of American history--from the theft of Native American and Mexican lands and the exploitation of African labor to a contemporary foreign policy said to be based on stealing oil and a capitalist system that robs people of their 'fair share.' Gerald Molen, the Academy Award-winning producer of SCHINDLER'S LIST, Dinesh D'Souza, the New York Times best-selling author and creator of 2016, and director John Sullivan invite you on a journey of discovery that will bring you face-to-face with America's most compelling contemporary critics along with the heroes who built America, in the times in which they lived, bled, and sacrificed in order to build a great nation.
