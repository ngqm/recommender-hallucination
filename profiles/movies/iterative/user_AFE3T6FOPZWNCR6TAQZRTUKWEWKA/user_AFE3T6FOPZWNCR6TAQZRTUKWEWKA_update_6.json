Ranked by', 'TV Guide', 'among the top five greatest series ever,', 'The Sopranos', 'justified its eleven-month hiatus with some of its best, and most hotly debated, episodes that continue the saga of the New Jersey mob boss juggling the pressures of his often intersecting personal and professional lives. The third season garnered 22 Emmy nominations, earning Lead Actor and Actress honors for James Gandolfini and Edie Falco for their now-signature roles as Tony and his increasingly conflicted wife, Carmela.', 'The Sopranos', 'continued to upend convention and defy audience expectations with a deliberately paced, calm-before-the-storm season opener that revolves around the FBI\\'s attempts to bug the Soprano household, and a season finale that (for some) frustratingly leaves several plot lines unresolved. The second episode, \"Proshai, Livushka,\" confronts the death of the venerable Nancy Marchand, who capped her career with perhaps her greatest role as malignant matriarch Livia. A jarring scene between Tony and Livia that uses pre-existing footage is a distraction, but Carmela\\'s unsparing smackdown of Livia at the wake redeems the episode. \"Employee of the Month,\" in which Dr. Melfi is raped and considers whether to exact revenge by telling Tony of her attack, earned Emmys for its writers, and is perhaps Emmy nominee Lorraine Bracco\\'s finest hour. The darkly comic \"Pine Barrens\"--another memorable episode, directed by Steve Buscemi--strands Paulie (Tony Sirico) and Christopher (Michael Imperioli) in the forest with a runaway corpse. Other story arcs concern the rise of the seriously unstable Ralph Cifaretto (Joe Pantoliano) and Tony\\'s affair with \"full-blown loop-de-loo\" Gloria (Emmy nominee Annabella Sciorra). Plus, there is Tony\\'s estrangement from daughter Meadow (Jamie Lynn Sigler), his wayward delinquent son Anthony, Jr. (Robert Iler), Carmela\\'s crisis of conscience, bad seed Jackie Jr., and the FBI--which, as the season ends, assigns an undercover agent to befriend an unwitting figure in the Soprano family\\'s orbit.

Other indelible moments include Christopher\\'s girlfriend Adriana\\'s projectile reaction to discovering that her new best friend is an undercover FBI agent in the episode \"No Show,\" Janice giving Ralph a shove out of their relationship in \"Christopher,\" and the classic \"Quasimodo/Nostradamus\" exchange in the season-opener, which garnered HBO\\'s highest ratings to date.

A rival is behind bars. A marital crisis has been resolved. A rat has been exterminated. So what does Tony Soprano have to be worried about? Everything. It's time to turn up the heat for the first half of Season Six of 'The Sopranos!' This Emmy(R)-winning drama series takes a darkly humorous look at a New Jersey crime boss (James Gandolfini) whose numerous problems continue to send him to his psychiatrist (Lorraine Bracco) for therapy. In Season 6A, several crises threaten Tony and his crew: for starters, rival boss Johnny 'Sack' Sacramoni is in prison, and the always-tense relations between the New Jersey and New York families are strained through the unpredictable behavior of Sack's surrogates. Then there are the inevitable power struggles that ensue when certain family members are eliminated, by natural and other causes.\", ']]>', 'Amazon.com', 'The Sopranos, Season 6, Part 1', 'is the most contentious release yet in the acclaimed series\\' history. While many fans think it jumped the shark at the exact moment Vito said \"I love you, Johnny Cakes\" , this season also contains some of the series finest moments and plumbs new depths of character, while continuing to add to the body count. Things get started with a bang, literally, that unexpectedly sends Tony (James Gandolfini) to the hospital and into a coma where he experiences an alternate reality while in limbo. At one point he awakes and asks \"Who am I? Where am I going?\" encapsulating this season\\'s central theme in a moment of desperation wrapped in a fever dream. But it\\'s not all existentialism. With Tony and Uncle Junior both of the picture, the capos in the Soprano crew try to take advantage of the situation and begin jockeying for position while a reluctant Silvio (Steve Van Zandt), acting in Tony\\x92s place, struggles to keep everyone in check. Things aren\\x92t going much better for Tony\\x92s family, as A.J. (Robert Iler) confesses to Carmela (Edie Falco) that he flunked out of school, and while at Tony\\x92s bedside, swears revenge for his injury. The stress of the situation finally gets to Carmela, who takes up Dr. Melfi\\x92s (Lorraine Bracco) offer to help and finds herself in the strange position of confiding in her husband\\x92s therapist, revealing for once that she feels some guilt over making the kids complicit in how Tony makes his living\\x97plus there\\x92s the issue of whether she really loves him. Christopher (Michael Imperioli) continues to provide much of the comic relief for the series, culminating in one of this season\\x92s best episodes when he flies out to L.A. in a bumbling attempt to get Ben Kingsley to sign on for his fledgling movie (', 'Saw', 'meets', 'The Godfather', '), and ends up mugging Lauren Bacall for her goodie basket at an awards ceremony. Sowing further discord in the ranks, Vito (Joseph Gannoscoli) finally gets outed as homosexual, and is forced to flee for his life up to New Hampshire where he meets \"Johnny Cakes.\" Finally, even with New York boss Johnny \"Sack\" Sacramoni (Vince Curatola) in prison, Phil Leotardo (Frank Vincent) makes plays against Tony and eventually sets in motion a hit against someone on Tony\\x92s crew, and now a larger war with Johnny Sack\\'s crew seems to be looming.', 'Series creator David Chase seems to be saying with this season that character is destiny. If so, then Season Six, Part 1 is taking the necessary time to flesh out who these people really are, and is leaving the destiny part up for Part 2.

That said, this season of', 'The Sopranos', \"does deserve some of the criticism it's received: the Vito storyline would have been better served by resolving it in fewer episodes, and the season ending is the most unsatisfying one yet, leaving many fans wanting more.
