Ranked by', 'TV Guide', 'among the top five greatest series ever,', 'The Sopranos', 'justified its eleven-month hiatus with some of its best, and most hotly debated, episodes that continue the saga of the New Jersey mob boss juggling the pressures of his often intersecting personal and professional lives. The third season garnered 22 Emmy nominations, earning Lead Actor and Actress honors for James Gandolfini and Edie Falco for their now-signature roles as Tony and his increasingly conflicted wife, Carmela.', 'The Sopranos', 'continued to upend convention and defy audience expectations with a deliberately paced, calm-before-the-storm season opener that revolves around the FBI\\'s attempts to bug the Soprano household, and a season finale that (for some) frustratingly leaves several plot lines unresolved. The second episode, \"Proshai, Livushka,\" confronts the death of the venerable Nancy Marchand, who capped her career with perhaps her greatest role as malignant matriarch Livia. A jarring scene between Tony and Livia that uses pre-existing footage is a distraction, but Carmela\\'s unsparing smackdown of Livia at the wake redeems the episode. \"Employee of the Month,\" in which Dr. Melfi is raped and considers whether to exact revenge by telling Tony of her attack, earned Emmys for its writers, and is perhaps Emmy nominee Lorraine Bracco\\'s finest hour. The darkly comic \"Pine Barrens\"--another memorable episode, directed by Steve Buscemi--strands Paulie (Tony Sirico) and Christopher (Michael Imperioli) in the forest with a runaway corpse. Other story arcs concern the rise of the seriously unstable Ralph Cifaretto (Joe Pantoliano) and Tony\\'s affair with \"full-blown loop-de-loo\" Gloria (Emmy nominee Annabella Sciorra). Plus, there is Tony\\'s estrangement from daughter Meadow (Jamie Lynn Sigler), his wayward delinquent son Anthony, Jr. (Robert Iler), Carmela\\'s crisis of conscience, bad seed Jackie Jr., and the FBI--which, as the season ends, assigns an undercover agent to befriend an unwitting figure in the Soprano family\\'s orbit.

The sluggish economy hasn't been good for the family business...and the ducks aren't coming back anytime soon. HBO presents Season Four of this hit drama series that follows the life and times of the New Jersey mob boss. In addition to taking a hit from the downturn in the economy--which has had an adverse impact on his supposedly recession-proof businesses--Tony finds himself dealing with a wife who is constantly on his case and increasingly unhappy with their marriage; the absence of trusted capo Paulie (he's in jail) and ascension of nephew Christopher as acting family capo; the impending RICO trial of his Uncle Junior; the continued irritations caused by his sister Janice; and the ongoing growing pains of his daughter Meadow and son Anthony Jr. James Gandolfini heads up the superb ensemble cast.\", ']]>', 'Amazon.com', 'Carmela to Tony: \"Everything comes to an end.\" True enough, Mrs. Sope, but on', 'The Sopranos', ', the end comes sooner for some than others. Though for some the widely debated fourth season contained too much yakking instead of whacking, and an emphasis on domestic family over business Family, what critic James Agee once said of the Marx Brothers applies to', 'The Sopranos', ': \"The worst thing they might ever make would be better worth seeing than most other things I can think of.\" And in most respects,', 'The Sopranos', 'remains television\\'s gold standard. The fourth season garnered 13 Emmy nominations, and subsequent best actor and actress wins for James Gandolfini and Edie Falco as Tony and Carmela, whose estrangement provides the season with its most powerful drama, as well as a win for Joe Pantoliano\\'s psychopath Ralph. The season finale, \"Whitecaps,\" was a long-time-coming episode, in which Carmela at last stands up to \"toxic\" Tony, and \"Whoever Did This\" was the season\\'s--and one of the series\\'--most shocking episodes.', 'Other narrative threads include Christopher\\'s (Emmy nominee Michael Imperioli) descent into heroin addiction, Uncle Junior\\'s (Dominic Chianese) trial, an unrequited and potentially fatal attraction between Carmela and Tony\\'s driver Furio, and a rude joke about Johnny Sack\\'s wife that has potentially fatal implications. Other indelible moments include Christopher\\'s girlfriend Adriana\\'s projectile reaction to discovering that her new best friend is an undercover FBI agent in the episode \"No Show,\" Janice giving Ralph a shove out of their relationship in \"Christopher,\" and the classic \"Quasimodo/Nostradamus\" exchange in the season-opener, which garnered HBO\\'s highest ratings to date. Freed from the understandably high expectations for the fourth season, heightened by the 16-month hiatus, these episodes can be better appreciated on their own considerable merits. They are pivotal chapters in television\\'s most novel saga.', '--Donald Liebenson']\n{'Genre': 'Drama', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Anamorphic, Box set, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, Dubbed, NTSC, Subtitled, WidescreenMultiple Formats, AC-3, Anamorphic, Box set, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, Dubbed, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen  See more', 'Contributor': 'Edie Falco, Tim Van Patten, Allen Coulter, Dominic Chianese, Michael Imperioli, Steve van Zandt, Tony Sirico, James GandolfiniEdie Falco, Tim Van Patten, Allen Coulter, Dominic Chianese, Michael Imperioli, Steve van Zandt, Tony Sirico, James Gandolfini  See more', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1), English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround), French (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo), Unqualified, Spanish (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo)', 'Number Of Discs': '4', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.78:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 11.2 Ounces', 'Item model number': '99081', 'Director': 'Dominic Chianese, Tim Van Patten, Allen Coulter', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Anamorphic, Box set, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, Dubbed, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Run time': '13 hours and 20 minutes', 'Release date': 'February 12, 2008', 'Actors': 'James Gandolfini, Edie Falco, Michael Imperioli, Tony Sirico, Steve van Zandt', 'Dubbed': 'French, Spanish', 'Subtitles': 'English, French, Spanish', 'Studio': 'HBO Studios', 'Number of discs': '4'}\nMy collection is now  complete!
