The Laurie Berkner Band, comprised of Laurie Berkner on vocals and guitar, Brian Mueller on bass and vocals, and Susie Lampert on keyboard and vocals (joined sporadically by Bob Golden on drums and additional instruments), is an accomplished group of musicians who create and perform whimsical, catchy children\\'s songs in a folksy rock style. From the playful rhymes that declare Tuesday \"snooze day\" in \"I\\'m Gonna Catch You\" to the absurd image of fish taking showers and brushing their teeth in \"The Goldfish,\" Laurie Berkner\\'s songs celebrate a child\\'s love of the ridiculous. The uninhibited trio performs live onstage (\"Under a Shady Tree\") or within simply animated scenes (\"Bumblebee--Buzz, Buzz, Buzz\") and the songs are undisputedly catchy--so catchy that many parents sheepishly admit to humming or even singing Laurie Berkner\\'s songs full voice even when their children aren\\'t around. In these days of splashy animation and over-thought, overly-glitzy children\\'s music videos, it\\'s a real treat to enjoy a simple production that features songs that kids love performed by musicians who appear to be having just as much fun as their young audiences.

Some are jabs at Coppola's version of\", 'Dracula', \", but most are attached to classic Dracula films. If any real pleasure comes from the movie it's thanks to the efforts of the cast. Peter MacNicol plays the crazed Renfield to the letter, Steven Weber has a good time as the tight British Harkin, and Lysette Anthony charms as the doomed Lucy. Brooks and Nielsen ham it up just fine. There's even a surprisingly controlled performance by Harvey Korman (a character spoofing Anthony Hopkins's role in the misfire\", 'The Road to Wellville', \"). As with Brooks's period comedies, the film looks better than it needs to and includes a few tricky special effects for good measure. This has nothing to do with the audience laughing--we need bigger jokes. And when you double over laughing in one scene--involving a stake through the heart and a bucket of blood--you want the movie to achieve Brooks's days of glory, when hearty laughter was the norm, not an isolated moment.\", '--Doug Thomas']\n{'Genre': 'Horror, Comedy', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Clive Revill, Leslie Nielsen, Amy Yasbeck, Harvey Korman, Gregg Binkley, Lysette Anthony, Steven Weber, Steve Haberman, Avery Schreiber, Mel Brooks, Mark Blankfield, Peter MacNicol, Cherie Franklin, Anne Bancroft, Megan Cavanagh, Chuck McCann, Bram Stoker, Matthew Porretta, Peter Schindler, Rudy De LucaClive Revill, Leslie Nielsen, Amy Yasbeck, Harvey Korman, Gregg Binkley, Lysette Anthony, Steven Weber, Steve Haberman, Avery Schreiber, Mel Brooks, Mark Blankfield, Peter MacNicol, Cherie Franklin, Anne Bancroft, Megan Cavanagh, Chuck McCann, Bram Stoker, Ma\u2026   See more', 'Initial release date': '2006-02-14', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround), Unqualified', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.85:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'false', 'MPAA rating': 'PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned)', 'Product Dimensions': '5.31 x 7.56 x 0.75 inches; 2.12 Ounces', 'Item model number': '2228569', 'Director': 'Mel Brooks', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Run time': '1 hour and 30 minutes', 'Release date': 'February 14, 2006', 'Actors': 'Leslie Nielsen, Peter MacNicol, Steven Weber, Amy Yasbeck, Mel Brooks', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish, French', 'Producers': 'Peter Schindler, Mel Brooks', 'Studio': 'Studio Distribution Services', 'Writers': 'Mel Brooks, Rudy De Luca, Steve Haberman', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nI love this movie, and had a hard time finding it!
