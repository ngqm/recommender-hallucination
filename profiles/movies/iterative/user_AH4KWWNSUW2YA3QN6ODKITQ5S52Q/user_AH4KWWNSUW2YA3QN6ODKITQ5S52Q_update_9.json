The Laurie Berkner Band, comprised of Laurie Berkner on vocals and guitar, Brian Mueller on bass and vocals, and Susie Lampert on keyboard and vocals (joined sporadically by Bob Golden on drums and additional instruments), is an accomplished group of musicians who create and perform whimsical, catchy children\\'s songs in a folksy rock style. From the playful rhymes that declare Tuesday \"snooze day\" in \"I\\'m Gonna Catch You\" to the absurd image of fish taking showers and brushing their teeth in \"The Goldfish,\" Laurie Berkner\\'s songs celebrate a child\\'s love of the ridiculous. The uninhibited trio performs live onstage (\"Under a Shady Tree\") or within simply animated scenes (\"Bumblebee--Buzz, Buzz, Buzz\") and the songs are undisputedly catchy--so catchy that many parents sheepishly admit to humming or even singing Laurie Berkner\\'s songs full voice even when their children aren\\'t around. In these days of splashy animation and over-thought, overly-glitzy children\\'s music videos, it\\'s a real treat to enjoy a simple production that features songs that kids love performed by musicians who appear to be having just as much fun as their young audiences.

Protectors Karsh (Pat Kelly) and Ileana (this time played by Leslie Seiler) interrupt their nuptial planning to bring the girls back to Coventry at Miranda's command, but Camryn and Alex find themselves questioning their mother's decision to deprive her people of their magical powers as well as her insistence that the girls perform a spell to vanquish the darkness in two days time. Even more confusing is Alex's inexplicable conviction that her father Aron (Kevin Jubinville) is alive and residing in the very Shadow lands her and Camryn are set to destroy. In the end, Camryn and Alex must find a way to collaboratively use their powers to preserve Coventry without sacrificing their own convictions.
