The stunning film (real film) photography no longer in vogue today and the bright clear colors only film can provide, the special effects (not computer enhanced), the writer's vision of future technology and how it wasn't so far off...so many things to enjoy.  The plot?  Fundamentally absurd but a fun romp into a scheme that might have worked in 1964.  The whole thing was supposed to be fun, actually.  I don't know if it was ever meant to be as popular as it has become, but sit down with ice tea and a bowl of popcorn and pretend it isn't 2016.  I think you'll be glad you did.\nReview Title: A lot to enjoy!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Philip Martin'], 'Producers': ['Simon Moseley'], 'Starring': ['Kenneth Branagh', 'Sarah Smart', 'Jeany Spark']}\nWallender is an interesting, introspective and clever (not to overlook moody) detective who investigates tragic and often gruesome murders.  It is well written, well photographed, generally believable and worth watching.  You should begin to connect with the character by the third episode.\nNot disappointing\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Producers': ['Kris Greengrove', 'Susan Holden', 'Steve Oakes', 'David Starr', 'Richard Winkler', 'Soo Kim', 'Jennifer Twomey', 'Marcy Pritchard', 'Amy Steinberg', 'Max Goodman'], 'Starring': ['Donovan Patton', 'P.T. Walkley', 'Ethan Kempner'], 'Studio': ['NICKELODEON']}\nGreat teaching program.  Well done and easy to follow.\nLet your kids watch it...\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Arna Selznick'], 'Producers': ['Jack Chojnacki', 'Lou Gioia', 'Carole MacGillvray', 'Robert Unkel', 'Michael Hirsh', 'Patrick Loubert', 'Clive Smith'], 'Starring': ['Mickey Rooney', 'Georgia Engel'], 'Studio': ['Orion']}\nGood for kids.\nNice!\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'Espa\u00f1ol'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', 'Espa\u00f1ol [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Justin Zackham'], 'Producers': ['Clay Pecorin', 'Harry Ufland', 'Justin Zackham', 'Richard Salvatore', 'Anthony Katagas'], 'Starring': ['Robert De Niro', 'Katherine Heigl', 'Diane Keaton']}\nVery silly and shallow as a puddle.  Looked to me like a bunch of actors needed to earn some money so they took a pointless script and plodded along making a movie of it.  Occasionally they took a swing at humor but missed by a mile.  Makes me wonder if Hollywood has run out of ideas.  Save your time.  There are far better romantic comedies out there.\nBig Wedding certainly isn't a big success...\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Rob Reiner'], 'Producers': ['Rob Reiner', 'Lori McCreary', 'Salli Newman', 'Nicolas Chartier', 'Alan Greisman', 'David Valdes'], 'Starring': ['Morgan Freeman', 'Virginia Madsen'], 'Studio': ['Magnolia Pictures']}\nI expected much more and I think you will also.  This is as bland as cream of potato soup.\nNo magic here...\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Producers': ['Kris Greengrove', 'Susan Holden', 'Steve Oakes', 'David Starr', 'Richard Winkler', 'Soo Kim', 'Jennifer Twomey', 'Marcy Pritchard', 'Amy Steinberg', 'Max Goodman']}\nNicely done with good educational messages.\nLearn while you're entertained\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': [\"Darragh O'Connell\", 'Timothy Bj\u00f6rklund'], 'Producers': ['Kate Boutilier', 'Eryk Casemiro', 'Patricia Resnick', 'Cathal Gaffney', 'Gillian Higgins', 'Karen Ialacci', 'Megan Laughton', 'Diana Manson'], 'Starring': ['Olivia']}\nPleasant and good for children.  A nice message.\nFun and pleasant...\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Tony Goldwyn'], 'Producers': ['Lynda Obst'], 'Starring': ['Ashley Judd', 'Greg Kinnear', 'Hugh Jackman']}\nA cute movie which goes nowhere and has little (if any) story line whatsoever.  A pity as some good talent was wasted here.<br />It wasn't horrible and might be ok on a rainy afternoon when you have no book to read.\nNot much here...\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Joseph L. Mankiewicz'], 'Producers': ['Darryl F. Zanuck'], 'Starring': ['Cary Grant', 'Jeanne Crain', 'Finlay Currie'], 'Studio': ['Fox']}\nThis timeless and well-written story is exactly the sort of movie that should be still made today...but sadly isn't.  It combines mystery, intrigue, comedy, romance, turns of plot, redemption and optimism.  Grant and Crain are exceptional in their roles and Shunderson's put down of Rodney Elwell (Hume Cronyn's character) is hilarious and spot-on.  I can't think many people would be disappointed in this one.\nPlease watch this one...\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Ethan Coen', 'Joel Coen'], 'Producers': ['Mike Lobell', 'Andrew Bergman', 'Ethan Coen', 'Brian Grazer', 'Sean Daniel', 'James Jacks'], 'Starring': ['George Clooney', 'Catherine Zeta-Jones', 'Billy Bob Thornton']}\nwrong.  A romantic comedy?  Hmm.  Very little romance and possibly less comedy.  We kept watching this movie certain it would get better...but it didn't.  To our shock and dismay it only sank lower into the hole of boredom, stupidity and silliness it began furiously digging at the start.  At least they titled it correctly.  I can imagine people on a plane from here to Paris with only this movie to watch thinking it was indeed intolerable cruelty.\nSometimes a movie gets it all...\nGoldfinger\nSuspense, Adventure, Intense, Thrilling\n['The third installment in the 007 series finds uberspy James Bond (Sean Connery) trying to thwart baddie Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe) and his elaborate gambit to corner the gold market by contaminating Fort Knox.']\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Guy Hamilton'], 'Producers': ['Albert R.
