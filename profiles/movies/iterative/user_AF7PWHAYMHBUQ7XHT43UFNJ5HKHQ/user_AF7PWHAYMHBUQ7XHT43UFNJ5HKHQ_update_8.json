  "reference_summary": "{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Philip Martin'], 'Producers': ['Simon Moseley'], 'Starring': ['Kenneth Branagh', 'Sarah Smart', 'Jeany Spark']}\nWallender is an interesting, introspective and clever (not to overlook moody) detective who investigates tragic and often gruesome murders.  It is well written, well photographed, generally believable and worth watching.  You should begin to connect with the character by the third episode.\nNot disappointing\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Producers': ['Kris Greengrove', 'Susan Holden', 'Steve Oakes', 'David Starr', 'Richard Winkler', 'Soo Kim', 'Jennifer Twomey', 'Marcy Pritchard', 'Amy Steinberg', 'Max Goodman'], 'Starring': ['Donovan Patton', 'P.T. Walkley', 'Ethan Kempner'], 'Studio': ['NICKELODEON']}\nGreat teaching program.  Well done and easy to follow.\nLet your kids watch it...\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Arna Selznick'], 'Producers': ['Jack Chojnacki', 'Lou Gioia', 'Carole MacGillvray', 'Robert Unkel', 'Michael Hirsh', 'Patrick Loubert', 'Clive Smith'], 'Starring': ['Mickey Rooney', 'Georgia Engel'], 'Studio': ['Orion']}\nGood for kids.\nNice!\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'Espa\u00f1ol'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', 'Espa\u00f1ol [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Justin Zackham'], 'Producers': ['Clay Pecorin', 'Harry Ufland', 'Justin Zackham', 'Richard Salvatore', 'Anthony Katagas'], 'Starring': ['Robert De Niro', 'Katherine Heigl', 'Diane Keaton']}\nVery silly and shallow as a puddle.  Looked to me like a bunch of actors needed to earn some money so they took a pointless script and plodded along making a movie of it.  Occasionally they took a swing at humor but missed by a mile.  Makes me wonder if Hollywood has run out of ideas.  Save your time.  There are far better romantic comedies out there.\nBig Wedding certainly isn't a big success...\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Rob Reiner'], 'Producers': ['Rob Reiner', 'Lori McCreary', 'Salli Newman', 'Nicolas Chartier', 'Alan Greisman', 'David Valdes'], 'Starring': ['Morgan Freeman', 'Virginia Madsen'], 'Studio': ['Magnolia Pictures']}\nI expected much more and I think you will also.  This is as bland as cream of potato soup.\nNo magic here...\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Producers': ['Kris Greengrove', 'Susan Holden', 'Steve Oakes', 'David Starr', 'Richard Winkler', 'Soo Kim', 'Jennifer Twomey', 'Marcy Pritchard', 'Amy Steinberg', 'Max Goodman']}\nNicely done with good educational messages.\nLearn while you're entertained\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': [\"Darragh O'Connell\", 'Timothy Bj\u00f6rklund'], 'Producers': ['Kate Boutilier', 'Eryk Casemiro', 'Patricia Resnick', 'Cathal Gaffney', 'Gillian Higgins', 'Karen Ialacci', 'Megan Laughton', 'Diana Manson'], 'Starring': ['Olivia']}\nPleasant and good for children.  A nice message.\nFun and pleasant...\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Tony Goldwyn'], 'Producers': ['Lynda Obst'], 'Starring': ['Ashley Judd', 'Greg Kinnear', 'Hugh Jackman']}\nA cute movie which goes nowhere and has little (if any) story line whatsoever.
