The fun and camaraderie of Season One was destroyed with slipshod writing and the introduction of the useless character of Lori Weston. Where I used to look forward to Monday nights to get my 5-0 fix, now I DVR the show and fast-forward through all the scenes that feature Lori. It's a shame, as I had initially planned to own all seasons as soon as they became available. Am sincerely hoping the writers do away with the Weston character in Season Three, and that the show regains its former greatness.\nWon't Be Buying Season Two\nStolen Women, Captured Hearts\nJanine Turner  (Actor),     Patrick Bergin  (Actor),     Jerry London  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Drama\n[\"Anna (Janine Turner), a beautiful young woman, allows her brother to arrange her marriage. She travels west to marry Daniel (Patrick Bergin), a man whom she has never met, but on the way is taken prisoner by the Sioux Indians. Their leader, the handsome warrior Tokalah (Michael Greyeyes), is set to kill Anna, until he realizes she is the woman who has come to him repeatedly in his dreams. He spares Anna's life and she continues to travel to Fort Hays where she meets and marries Daniel, the ordinary man her brother has chosen for her. After only one night with her new husband, Anna and her friend Sarah (Jean Louisa Kelly) are taken hostage by a tribe of Sioux warriors led by Tokolah. They are forced to live like the Sioux, learning their language, dressing like them and adapting to their customs. During this time Tokalah and Anna spend together, they give in to their emotions and, regardless of the consequences, they fall in love. After a year, the U.S. Cavalry and the Indians are at war and the women are rescued by General Custer. But Anna's heart still longs to be with Tokalah. Will she choose to follow her heart or obey the rules of convention?\"]\n{'Aspect Ratio': '1.33:1', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.5 x 0.5 inches; 3.5 Ounces', 'Audio Description': 'English', 'Item model number': 'CBMO46338DVD', 'Director': 'Jerry London', 'Media Format': 'NTSC', 'Run time': '1 hour and 31 minutes', 'Release date': 'June 17, 2013', 'Actors': 'Janine Turner, Patrick Bergin, Jean Louisa Kelly, Michael Greyeyes, Rodney A Grant', 'Subtitles': 'German, Italian, English', 'Producers': 'Vanessa Greene', 'Studio': 'CBS Home Entertainment', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nI always loved this movie, and was thrilled that it is available on DVD. What's not to love about the handsome Michael Greyeyes? Is it historically accurate? No. The real Anna Brewster Morgan's story is utterly tragic. But this film is a wonderful romantic escape. It would have been lovely if the real Anna's story had ended as this movie did.\nA Favorite\nColumbo: The Complete Series\nPeter Falk  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Today's Deals, Editor's Picks\n['Legendary Peter Falk is a four-time Primetime Emmy Award-winner for his iconic role as the beloved, trenchcoat-wearing Police Lieutenant Columbo. Columbo is the landmark series that inspired a genre. And now, for the first time ever, all 69 episodes from its seven seasons and all 24 television movies are together in this 34-disc anthology. Every criminal, every innocent victim (and some not-so-innocent ones), and every wily deduction are here in one definitive collection. Seemingly befuddled but always brilliant, the cigar-chomping detective will have you following the clues and asking \"just one more thing\" until the last case is cracked.
