The fun and camaraderie of Season One was destroyed with slipshod writing and the introduction of the useless character of Lori Weston. Where I used to look forward to Monday nights to get my 5-0 fix, now I DVR the show and fast-forward through all the scenes that feature Lori. It's a shame, as I had initially planned to own all seasons as soon as they became available.

But when Johnny plans a holiday for the two to enjoy life while they are still young, his fianc\u00e9e has other plans - she wants Johnny to work in her father's bank! As he tries to decide whether to follow his head or his heart, Johnny can rely on at least one Seton in his corner. She's Linda Seton (Katherine Hepburn), the down-to-earth younger sister of his soon-to-be-wife, and she likes Johnny just the way he is.\", 'Amazon.com', \"This absolutely charming, wholly engaging romantic comedy is the hidden gem of the four collaborations of Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant. Most everyone's seen\", 'The Philadelphia Story', \", but few know of this unorthodox, hilarious comedy of life among the rich and privileged, though both were Broadway hits by playwright Philip Barry. Grant plays the happy-go-lucky Johnny Case, a self-made man with a dream in his heart of making just enough money to retire on and then traveling around the world. Johnny proposes to the lovely Julia (Doris Nolan) in Lake Placid, but it isn't until he comes to pay her a visit in New York that he discovers she's the daughter of a wealthy industrialist. Although his nonconformity ruffles the feathers of Julia's stuffy father, he's soon won over the whole family--most notably, Julia's rebellious sister Linda (Hepburn), who in becoming Johnny's greatest advocate finds herself irresistibly drawn to him. There's more going on here than a spiffy, surface romance, with Johnny's free-spirit determination going up against rock-hard establishment values, and director George Cukor plays up the social politics of the story just as well as the wonderful, exquisite romance. Hepburn and Grant, as always, are perfectly paired, and given able support by Lew Ayres as the black sheep of Hepburn's family, and Edward Everett Horton and Jean Dixon as Grant's longtime pals. Filmed previously in 1930; Hepburn understudied the role of Linda on Broadway and used a scene from the play in her first screen test. --\", 'Mark Englehart', 'Stills from', 'Holiday', '(click for larger image)']\n{'Genre': 'Drama Classic, Comedy', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Black & White, Full Screen, NTSC, Subtitled', 'Contributor': 'Henry Kolker, Lew Ayres, Katharine Hepburn, Columbia Pictures Corporation, Binnie Barnes, Cary Grant, Doris Nolan, George Cukor, Edward Everett Horton, Everett Riskin, Jean DixonHenry Kolker, Lew Ayres, Katharine Hepburn, Columbia Pictures Corporation, Binnie Barnes, Cary Grant, Doris Nolan, George Cukor, Edward Everett Horton, Everett Riskin, Jean Dixon  See more', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono), Unqualified', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 36 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.33:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.75 x 5.25 x 0.5 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': '2227111', 'Director': 'George Cukor', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Black & White, Full Screen, NTSC, Subtitled', 'Run time': '1 hour and 36 minutes', 'Release date': 'December 5, 2006', 'Actors': 'Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, Doris Nolan, Lew Ayres, Edward Everett Horton', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Korean', 'Producers': 'Everett Riskin', 'Studio': 'Sony Pictures Home Entertainment', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nThis is a charming, delightful, quirky, witty movie.
