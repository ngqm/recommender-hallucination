As Christmas gets closer, however, Cate gets used to small town life, and she begins to realize her family, friends, and hunky local sheriff Hank (Ty Olsson) are making her rethink her priorities, and a crime-free Christmas in Comfort might be just what she needs this year.']\nAverage Rating: 4.6\nProduct Details: {'Aspect Ratio': '1.75:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG (Parental Guidance Suggested)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 0.7 x 5.4 inches; 2.72 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'FLP-12469', 'Director': 'David Winkler', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Run time': '1 hour and 28 minutes', 'Release date': 'October 28, 2008', 'Actors': 'Shannen Doherty, Ty Olsen', 'Subtitles': 'Spanish', 'Language': 'Unqualified', 'Studio': 'Alchemy / Millennium', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: It\u2019s not one of the greatest Christmas movies, but it\u2019s pleasant enough.

The fun and camaraderie of Season One was destroyed with slipshod writing and the introduction of the useless character of Lori Weston. Where I used to look forward to Monday nights to get my 5-0 fix, now I DVR the show and fast-forward through all the scenes that feature Lori. It's a shame, as I had initially planned to own all seasons as soon as they became available. Am sincerely hoping the writers do away with the Weston character in Season Three, and that the show regains its former greatness.\nWon't Be Buying Season Two\nStolen Women, Captured Hearts\nJanine Turner  (Actor),     Patrick Bergin  (Actor),     Jerry London  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Drama\n[\"Anna (Janine Turner), a beautiful young woman, allows her brother to arrange her marriage.

Their leader, the handsome warrior Tokalah (Michael Greyeyes), is set to kill Anna, until he realizes she is the woman who has come to him repeatedly in his dreams. He spares Anna's life and she continues to travel to Fort Hays where she meets and marries Daniel, the ordinary man her brother has chosen for her. After only one night with her new husband, Anna and her friend Sarah (Jean Louisa Kelly) are taken hostage by a tribe of Sioux warriors led by Tokolah. They are forced to live like the Sioux, learning their language, dressing like them and adapting to their customs. During this time Tokalah and Anna spend together, they give in to their emotions and, regardless of the consequences, they fall in love. After a year, the U.S. Cavalry and the Indians are at war and the women are rescued by General Custer. But Anna's heart still longs to be with Tokalah.
