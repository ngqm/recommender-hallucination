Though our family has watched it yearly  since it first came out, we never tire of it, all of our emotions as if we were watching it for the first time. It is an excellent movie.

This is meant for the twenty something guy crowd. It was disgusting and embarrassing. The reviews said it was about a boy and his grandfather.  I never even got that far, it was so horrid.  I am too embarrassed to say how the movie even begins. My husband stared at me in disbelief. It is definitely not a family movie.  I guess I should have turned it off as soon as I saw &#34;Jackass Presents...&#34; I am in the dark, but not anymore.  Leave this for the guys and their immature minds.\nIt was disgusting and embarrassing\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Nancy Meyers'], 'Producers': ['Nancy Meyers', 'Suzanne Farwell', 'Scott Rudin'], 'Starring': ['Robert De Niro', 'Anne Hathaway', 'Rene Russo']}\nWhat a sweet and loving movie.
