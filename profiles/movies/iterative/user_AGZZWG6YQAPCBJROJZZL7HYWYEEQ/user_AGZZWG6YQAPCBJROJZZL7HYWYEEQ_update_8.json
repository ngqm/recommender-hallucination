What a terrific story. I learned so much about the period and times.  It also made me become aware why I, as a female for the college newspaper, never got a by-line. I needed these ladies to wake up my eyes to the horrid discrimination between genders. I knew about pay, but did not know how women did the work and the men got the glory. Please, please watch this.  Though it is a fictional in dialogue, the story behind it is part of our history and how women were not looked at as having intelligence in the field.  What a disgrace. Yes, yes, watch this!\nReview Title: It's about time to recognize the issue!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

This is meant for the twenty something guy crowd. It was disgusting and embarrassing. The reviews said it was about a boy and his grandfather.  I never even got that far, it was so horrid.  I am too embarrassed to say how the movie even begins. My husband stared at me in disbelief. It is definitely not a family movie.  I guess I should have turned it off as soon as I saw &#34;Jackass Presents...&#34; I am in the dark, but not anymore.  Leave this for the guys and their immature minds.\nIt was disgusting and embarrassing\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Nancy Meyers'], 'Producers': ['Nancy Meyers', 'Suzanne Farwell', 'Scott Rudin'], 'Starring': ['Robert De Niro', 'Anne Hathaway', 'Rene Russo']}\nWhat a sweet and loving movie.

Though our family has watched it yearly  since it first came out, we never tire of it, all of our emotions as if we were watching it for the first time. It is an excellent movie. Tom Hanks is extraordinary as the conductor, and the children are marvelous in their parts. The artistry and creativity of this film is magnificent. Place it in your video library, beside \"It's A Wonderful Life\" and \"Miracle on 34th Street,\" movies that will please you and future viewers in all of the years to come.\nA Tradition\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a)', 'Italiano', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', 'Polski', '\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e', 'Portugu\u00eas', 'Deutsch', 'Fran\u00e7ais'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', '\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629', '\u010ce\u0161tina', 'Dansk', 'Deutsch', '\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a)', 'Suomi', 'Filipino', 'Fran\u00e7ais', '\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea', '\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940', 'Magyar', 'Indonesia', 'Italiano', '\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e', '\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4', 'Bahasa Melayu', 'Norsk Bokm\u00e5l', 'Nederlands', 'Polski', 'Portugu\u00eas (Brasil)', 'Portugu\u00eas (Portugal)', 'Rom\u00e2n\u0103', '\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439', 'Svenska', '\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bcd', '\u0c24\u0c46\u0c32\u0c41\u0c17\u0c41', '\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22', 'T\u00fcrk\u00e7e', '\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430', 'Ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t', '\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7b80\u4f53\uff09', '\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7e41\u9ad4\uff09'], 'Directors': ['Paul Weitz', 'Adam Brooks', 'Jason Schwartzman', 'Roman Coppola', 'Tricia Brock'], 'Producers': ['Paul Weitz', 'Roman Coppola', 'Jason Schwartzman', 'Alex Timbers'], 'Starring': ['Lola Kirke', 'Saffron Burrows', 'Bernadette Peters'], 'Studio': ['Amazon Studios']}\nThis has been a fun and exciting series to watch.
