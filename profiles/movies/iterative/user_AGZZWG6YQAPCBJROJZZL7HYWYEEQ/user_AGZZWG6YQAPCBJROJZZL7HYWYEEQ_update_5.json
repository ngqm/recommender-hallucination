Now, I can't wait to watch the next episode. I love the acting, the scenery the costumes and the in-depth story line.

This is meant for the twenty something guy crowd. It was disgusting and embarrassing. The reviews said it was about a boy and his grandfather.  I never even got that far, it was so horrid.  I am too embarrassed to say how the movie even begins. My husband stared at me in disbelief. It is definitely not a family movie.  I guess I should have turned it off as soon as I saw &#34;Jackass Presents...&#34; I am in the dark, but not anymore.  Leave this for the guys and their immature minds.\nIt was disgusting and embarrassing\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Nancy Meyers'], 'Producers': ['Nancy Meyers', 'Suzanne Farwell', 'Scott Rudin'], 'Starring': ['Robert De Niro', 'Anne Hathaway', 'Rene Russo']}\nWhat a sweet and loving movie.
