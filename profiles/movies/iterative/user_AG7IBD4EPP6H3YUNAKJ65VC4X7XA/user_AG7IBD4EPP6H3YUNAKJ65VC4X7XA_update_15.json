As a visual artist myself, I enjoyed hearing Perlman's more conceptual experiences with the violin that translate well to other art forms. I particularly enjoyed the bits where he talked about what kind of teacher was best for him; I enjoyed when he talked with Alan Alda about how the decision of how to act out a piece of music comes from actually doing it, first; and I enjoyed when he talked about how music moves him emotionally. It was good to understand a bit about his emotional relationship to music. And I wish the documentary had come in many parts. Very well done!

The film follows the life journey of the eldest son, Jack, through the innocence of childhood to his disillusioned adult years as he tries to reconcile a complicated relationship with his father (Brad Pitt). Jack (played as an adult by Sean Penn) finds himself a lost soul in the modern world, seeking answers to the origins and meaning of life while questioning the existence of faith. Through Malick's signature imagery, we see how both brute nature and spiritual grace shape not only our lives as individuals and families, but all life.\"]\n{'Format': 'Color, Blu-ray, Multiple Formats, Digital_copy', 'Contributor': 'Brad Pitt, Jessica Chastain, Hunter McCracken, William Pohlad, Sean Penn, Dede Gardner, Sarah Green, Fiona Shaw, Grant Hill, Terrence MalickBrad Pitt, Jessica Chastain, Hunter McCracken, William Pohlad, Sean Penn, Dede Gardner, Sarah Green, Fiona Shaw, Grant Hill, Terrence Malick  See more', 'Language': 'English', 'Runtime': '3 hours and 1 minute', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.6 x 5.4 x 6.7 inches; 4.8 Ounces', 'Item model number': '227493', 'Director': 'Terrence Malick', 'Media Format': 'Color, Blu-ray, Multiple Formats, Digital_copy', 'Run time': '3 hours and 1 minute', 'Release date': 'October 11, 2011', 'Actors': 'Brad Pitt, Sean Penn, Jessica Chastain, Hunter McCracken, Fiona Shaw', 'Dubbed': 'Spanish', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish', 'Producers': 'Brad Pitt, Dede Gardner, Sarah Green, Grant Hill, William Pohlad', 'Studio': 'Fox Searchlight', 'Writers': 'Terrence Malick', 'Number of discs': '3'}\nA beautiful and otherworldly film.

Loved it.\nThe Red Turtle\nAnimation, Drama, Sweet, Serious\n['In this animated film without words, a castaway trapped on a tropical island must face a mysterious red turtle in order to escape \u2013 or embrace all that life has to offer.']\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Michael Dudok De Wit'], 'Producers': ['Toshio Suzuki', 'Vincent Maraval', 'Pascal Caucheteux', 'Gr\u00e9goire Sorlat'], 'Starring': ['Emmanuel Garijo', 'Tom Hudson']}\nMy family loves anime. We were looking forward to this film a great deal; my kids aged 12 and 14. The animation is gorgeous. The characters are interesting. But the story just seems a little lacking in poignancy or depth. There is a powerful moment when the boy mistreats a turtle, and then the turtle becomes a woman. My kids were disappointed that the boy didn't really seem to comprehend his own cruelty, or to learn from it. And so, there is something incomplete about the story. That dissatisfaction is maybe a reality of life, itself, but a fairy tale, as this film is, usually gives spiritual choices (selfishness or cruelty, for example, as in this case) a deeper examination.\nBeautifully created with a somewhat unsatisfying storyline\nOnly Yesterday\nDaisy Ridley  (Actor),     Dev Patel  (Actor),     Jamie Simone  (Director),     Isao Takahata  (Director, Writer)    &                   1                  more   Rated:    PG    Format: Blu-ray\nMovies & TV, Blu-ray, Movies\n[\"Having lived her whole life in the city, 27-year-old Taeko (Daisy Ridley, Star Wars: The Force Awakens) decides to visit her relatives in the countryside. As she travels, memories of her youth resurface and after meeting young farmer Toshio (Dev Patel, Slumdog Millionaire), she wonders if she's been true to the dreams of her childhood self. Deftly switching between past and present, Only Yesterday is a masterpiece of time and tone, rich with humor and stirring emotion, and beautifully animated by Studio Ghibli, one of the world's most revered animation studios.

She's just beginning to get into less child-focused films, and this is a good bridge. She felt the story was a little bit &#34;pointless&#34; and &#34;boring&#34; when the main character's child life was continually examined. While the whole story is charming and the animation beautiful, I agree with my daughter somewhat about this.\nGood story, sweetly executed\nStrictly Dumpling\nComedy, Drama, Special Interest, Romance\n[\"Guide Mike Chen takes you on a tour of China's most delicious dishes in this series.

Unexpected insights into parenting, and the universal in babies and human nature. Gorgeous scenery from each of the four regions filmed: Namibia, Mongola, Japan, and the USA. One of the best documentaries I haver ever seen. These are happy babies with happy families. I wish there were more documentaries with the gentle eye of these film-makers, offering insight to other cultures and ideals of family life. -- Specific scenes and ideas struck me that maybe did not strike others, given that the film has no narrator and is open. First, the USA and Japan is far more hygienic and \"clean\" compared to other cultures, and this maybe removes a baby from sensory experiences and depths other cultures offer: deeper engagement with nature and animals, insects and earth. Also, because there is no narration, I was struck by the quiet and the sounds that babies are exposed to in different regions: how the sounds of the adults speaking and natural sounds surround all infants. Thirdly but not conclusively, the personalities of these babies are gently brought to focus, so I felt close to the families and wanted more when the film was done.\nLovely!
