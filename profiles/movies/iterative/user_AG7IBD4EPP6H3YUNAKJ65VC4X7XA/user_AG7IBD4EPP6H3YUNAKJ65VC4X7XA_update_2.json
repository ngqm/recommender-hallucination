We were looking forward to this film a great deal; my kids aged 12 and 14. The animation is gorgeous. The characters are interesting. But the story just seems a little lacking in poignancy or depth. There is a powerful moment when the boy mistreats a turtle, and then the turtle becomes a woman. My kids were disappointed that the boy didn't really seem to comprehend his own cruelty, or to learn from it. And so, there is something incomplete about the story. That dissatisfaction is maybe a reality of life, itself, but a fairy tale, as this film is, usually gives spiritual choices (selfishness or cruelty, for example, as in this case) a deeper examination.\nReview Title: Beautifully created with a somewhat unsatisfying storyline\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

The film follows the life journey of the eldest son, Jack, through the innocence of childhood to his disillusioned adult years as he tries to reconcile a complicated relationship with his father (Brad Pitt). Jack (played as an adult by Sean Penn) finds himself a lost soul in the modern world, seeking answers to the origins and meaning of life while questioning the existence of faith. Through Malick's signature imagery, we see how both brute nature and spiritual grace shape not only our lives as individuals and families, but all life.\"]\n{'Format': 'Color, Blu-ray, Multiple Formats, Digital_copy', 'Contributor': 'Brad Pitt, Jessica Chastain, Hunter McCracken, William Pohlad, Sean Penn, Dede Gardner, Sarah Green, Fiona Shaw, Grant Hill, Terrence MalickBrad Pitt, Jessica Chastain, Hunter McCracken, William Pohlad, Sean Penn, Dede Gardner, Sarah Green, Fiona Shaw, Grant Hill, Terrence Malick  See more', 'Language': 'English', 'Runtime': '3 hours and 1 minute', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.6 x 5.4 x 6.7 inches; 4.8 Ounces', 'Item model number': '227493', 'Director': 'Terrence Malick', 'Media Format': 'Color, Blu-ray, Multiple Formats, Digital_copy', 'Run time': '3 hours and 1 minute', 'Release date': 'October 11, 2011', 'Actors': 'Brad Pitt, Sean Penn, Jessica Chastain, Hunter McCracken, Fiona Shaw', 'Dubbed': 'Spanish', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish', 'Producers': 'Brad Pitt, Dede Gardner, Sarah Green, Grant Hill, William Pohlad', 'Studio': 'Fox Searchlight', 'Writers': 'Terrence Malick', 'Number of discs': '3'}\nA beautiful and otherworldly film.
