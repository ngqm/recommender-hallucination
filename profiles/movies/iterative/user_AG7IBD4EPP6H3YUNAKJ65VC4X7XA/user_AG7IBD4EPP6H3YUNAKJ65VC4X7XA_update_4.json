  "reference_summary": "The Tree of Life (Three-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)\nBrad Pitt  (Actor, Producer),     Sean Penn  (Actor),     Terrence Malick  (Director, Writer)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG-13    Format: Blu-ray\nMovies & TV, Blu-ray, Movies\n[\"From Terrence Malick, the acclaimed director of such classic films as BADLANDS, DAYS OF HEAVEN and THE THIN RED LINE, THE TREE OF LIFE is the impressionistic story of a Midwestern family in the 1950's. The film follows the life journey of the eldest son, Jack, through the innocence of childhood to his disillusioned adult years as he tries to reconcile a complicated relationship with his father (Brad Pitt). Jack (played as an adult by Sean Penn) finds himself a lost soul in the modern world, seeking answers to the origins and meaning of life while questioning the existence of faith. Through Malick's signature imagery, we see how both brute nature and spiritual grace shape not only our lives as individuals and families, but all life.\"]\n{'Format': 'Color, Blu-ray, Multiple Formats, Digital_copy', 'Contributor': 'Brad Pitt, Jessica Chastain, Hunter McCracken, William Pohlad, Sean Penn, Dede Gardner, Sarah Green, Fiona Shaw, Grant Hill, Terrence MalickBrad Pitt, Jessica Chastain, Hunter McCracken, William Pohlad, Sean Penn, Dede Gardner, Sarah Green, Fiona Shaw, Grant Hill, Terrence Malick  See more', 'Language': 'English', 'Runtime': '3 hours and 1 minute', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.6 x 5.4 x 6.7 inches; 4.8 Ounces', 'Item model number': '227493', 'Director': 'Terrence Malick', 'Media Format': 'Color, Blu-ray, Multiple Formats, Digital_copy', 'Run time': '3 hours and 1 minute', 'Release date': 'October 11, 2011', 'Actors': 'Brad Pitt, Sean Penn, Jessica Chastain, Hunter McCracken, Fiona Shaw', 'Dubbed': 'Spanish', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish', 'Producers': 'Brad Pitt, Dede Gardner, Sarah Green, Grant Hill, William Pohlad', 'Studio': 'Fox Searchlight', 'Writers': 'Terrence Malick', 'Number of discs': '3'}\nA beautiful and otherworldly film.

Loved it.\nThe Red Turtle\nAnimation, Drama, Sweet, Serious\n['In this animated film without words, a castaway trapped on a tropical island must face a mysterious red turtle in order to escape \u2013 or embrace all that life has to offer.']\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Michael Dudok De Wit'], 'Producers': ['Toshio Suzuki', 'Vincent Maraval', 'Pascal Caucheteux', 'Gr\u00e9goire Sorlat'], 'Starring': ['Emmanuel Garijo', 'Tom Hudson']}\nMy family loves anime. We were looking forward to this film a great deal; my kids aged 12 and 14. The animation is gorgeous. The characters are interesting. But the story just seems a little lacking in poignancy or depth. There is a powerful moment when the boy mistreats a turtle, and then the turtle becomes a woman. My kids were disappointed that the boy didn't really seem to comprehend his own cruelty, or to learn from it. And so, there is something incomplete about the story. That dissatisfaction is maybe a reality of life, itself, but a fairy tale, as this film is, usually gives spiritual choices (selfishness or cruelty, for example, as in this case) a deeper examination.\nBeautifully created with a somewhat unsatisfying storyline\nOnly Yesterday\nDaisy Ridley  (Actor),     Dev Patel  (Actor),     Jamie Simone  (Director),     Isao Takahata  (Director, Writer)    &                   1                  more   Rated:    PG    Format: Blu-ray\nMovies & TV, Blu-ray, Movies\n[\"Having lived her whole life in the city, 27-year-old Taeko (Daisy Ridley, Star Wars: The Force Awakens) decides to visit her relatives in the countryside. As she travels, memories of her youth resurface and after meeting young farmer Toshio (Dev Patel, Slumdog Millionaire), she wonders if she's been true to the dreams of her childhood self. Deftly switching between past and present, Only Yesterday is a masterpiece of time and tone, rich with humor and stirring emotion, and beautifully animated by Studio Ghibli, one of the world's most revered animation studios. From Academy Award-nominated director Isao Takahata (The Tale of The Princess Kaguya) and General Producer Hayao Miyazaki (Spirited Away), this critically acclaimed film has never before been released in North America until now\u2013in celebration of its 25th anniversary.Bonus Content:\", 'Feature Length Storyboards', 'Feature Length Storyboards', 'The Making of Only Yesterday', 'The Making of Only Yesterday', 'Behind the Scenes with the Voice Cast', 'Behind the Scenes with the Voice Cast', 'Interview with the English Dub Team', 'Interview with the English Dub Team', 'Foreign Trailers and TV Spots', 'Foreign Trailers and TV Spots', 'U.S. Trailer', 'U.S. Trailer']\n{'Aspect Ratio': '1.85:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG (Parental Guidance Suggested)', 'Product Dimensions': '6.75 x 5.5 x 0.75 inches; 3.84 Ounces', 'Item model number': '35486012', 'Director': 'Jamie Simone, Isao Takahata', 'Media Format': 'Animated, Color, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Run time': '2 hours', 'Release date': 'July 5, 2016', 'Actors': 'Daisy Ridley, Dev Patel, Alison Fernandez', 'Subtitles': 'English, French', 'Producers': 'Geoffrey Wexler, Toshio Suzuki', 'Language': 'Japanese (DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0), English (DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0), Japanese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround), English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround)', 'Studio': 'Universal Pictures Home Entertainment', 'Writers': 'David Freedman, Isao Takahata', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '2'}\nMy 14 year old daughter enjoyed this. She's just beginning to get into less child-focused films, and this is a good bridge. She felt the story was a little bit &#34;pointless&#34; and &#34;boring&#34; when the main character's child life was continually examined. While the whole story is charming and the animation beautiful, I agree with my daughter somewhat about this.\nGood story, sweetly executed\nStrictly Dumpling\nComedy, Drama, Special Interest, Romance\n[\"Guide Mike Chen takes you on a tour of China's most delicious dishes in this series.
