And this is one of the least well done historical reality series. But I do think historical reality shows are good, for bringing focus to a certain historical period. And this is the only period piece on the Mayflower landing. What struck me most is that there was a question of allowing a religious leader, an academic leader, and later with the cape magistrate, a venture capitalist or business management leader. Which type gets elected as leader by the people has something to do with the times and the values of those people, but also the personalities of those individual leaders. I found in this series and setting I had most respect for the business-style leadership skills. The question of being an atheist in those times is interesting as it is offered in this series. But I don't think it makes much sense to test modern religious freedom with laws and values of that era. It would be better for this series to bring a set of \"like minded\" invididuals together, as the Puritans would have been, and then follow the group as they learned to develop a community-minded approach to survival. Another problem is that while Puritans would have had incentive to pay back the colonial investors, there was no incentive for this group to work hard to pay back their debt. Some sort of incentive should have been built into the series in order to make the situation more \"real\". I think the program is insightful for understanding what makes group cohesion stronger, and what breaks down that sense of community. I was surprised and found it made sense, in this series, that the servants at times had more power than the freed people, when their ideas were more in line with the values of the community as a whole. But on the other hand, allowing men to participate in the law and management roles put women and servants very much in the back seat of power, no matter what their strengths or efforts. And it created a real divide that makes no sense to a modern viewer.\nReview Title: A great idea\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

The film follows the life journey of the eldest son, Jack, through the innocence of childhood to his disillusioned adult years as he tries to reconcile a complicated relationship with his father (Brad Pitt). Jack (played as an adult by Sean Penn) finds himself a lost soul in the modern world, seeking answers to the origins and meaning of life while questioning the existence of faith. Through Malick's signature imagery, we see how both brute nature and spiritual grace shape not only our lives as individuals and families, but all life.\"]\n{'Format': 'Color, Blu-ray, Multiple Formats, Digital_copy', 'Contributor': 'Brad Pitt, Jessica Chastain, Hunter McCracken, William Pohlad, Sean Penn, Dede Gardner, Sarah Green, Fiona Shaw, Grant Hill, Terrence MalickBrad Pitt, Jessica Chastain, Hunter McCracken, William Pohlad, Sean Penn, Dede Gardner, Sarah Green, Fiona Shaw, Grant Hill, Terrence Malick  See more', 'Language': 'English', 'Runtime': '3 hours and 1 minute', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.6 x 5.4 x 6.7 inches; 4.8 Ounces', 'Item model number': '227493', 'Director': 'Terrence Malick', 'Media Format': 'Color, Blu-ray, Multiple Formats, Digital_copy', 'Run time': '3 hours and 1 minute', 'Release date': 'October 11, 2011', 'Actors': 'Brad Pitt, Sean Penn, Jessica Chastain, Hunter McCracken, Fiona Shaw', 'Dubbed': 'Spanish', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish', 'Producers': 'Brad Pitt, Dede Gardner, Sarah Green, Grant Hill, William Pohlad', 'Studio': 'Fox Searchlight', 'Writers': 'Terrence Malick', 'Number of discs': '3'}\nA beautiful and otherworldly film.

We were looking forward to this film a great deal; my kids aged 12 and 14. The animation is gorgeous. The characters are interesting. But the story just seems a little lacking in poignancy or depth. There is a powerful moment when the boy mistreats a turtle, and then the turtle becomes a woman. My kids were disappointed that the boy didn't really seem to comprehend his own cruelty, or to learn from it. And so, there is something incomplete about the story. That dissatisfaction is maybe a reality of life, itself, but a fairy tale, as this film is, usually gives spiritual choices (selfishness or cruelty, for example, as in this case) a deeper examination.\nBeautifully created with a somewhat unsatisfying storyline\nOnly Yesterday\nDaisy Ridley  (Actor),     Dev Patel  (Actor),     Jamie Simone  (Director),     Isao Takahata  (Director, Writer)    &                   1                  more   Rated:    PG    Format: Blu-ray\nMovies & TV, Blu-ray, Movies\n[\"Having lived her whole life in the city, 27-year-old Taeko (Daisy Ridley, Star Wars: The Force Awakens) decides to visit her relatives in the countryside. As she travels, memories of her youth resurface and after meeting young farmer Toshio (Dev Patel, Slumdog Millionaire), she wonders if she's been true to the dreams of her childhood self. Deftly switching between past and present, Only Yesterday is a masterpiece of time and tone, rich with humor and stirring emotion, and beautifully animated by Studio Ghibli, one of the world's most revered animation studios.

She's just beginning to get into less child-focused films, and this is a good bridge. She felt the story was a little bit &#34;pointless&#34; and &#34;boring&#34; when the main character's child life was continually examined. While the whole story is charming and the animation beautiful, I agree with my daughter somewhat about this.\nGood story, sweetly executed\nStrictly Dumpling\nComedy, Drama, Special Interest, Romance\n[\"Guide Mike Chen takes you on a tour of China's most delicious dishes in this series.

Unexpected insights into parenting, and the universal in babies and human nature. Gorgeous scenery from each of the four regions filmed: Namibia, Mongola, Japan, and the USA. One of the best documentaries I haver ever seen. These are happy babies with happy families. I wish there were more documentaries with the gentle eye of these film-makers, offering insight to other cultures and ideals of family life. -- Specific scenes and ideas struck me that maybe did not strike others, given that the film has no narrator and is open. First, the USA and Japan is far more hygienic and \"clean\" compared to other cultures, and this maybe removes a baby from sensory experiences and depths other cultures offer: deeper engagement with nature and animals, insects and earth. Also, because there is no narration, I was struck by the quiet and the sounds that babies are exposed to in different regions: how the sounds of the adults speaking and natural sounds surround all infants. Thirdly but not conclusively, the personalities of these babies are gently brought to focus, so I felt close to the families and wanted more when the film was done.\nLovely!

As a visual artist myself, I enjoyed hearing Perlman's more conceptual experiences with the violin that translate well to other art forms. I particularly enjoyed the bits where he talked about what kind of teacher was best for him; I enjoyed when he talked with Alan Alda about how the decision of how to act out a piece of music comes from actually doing it, first; and I enjoyed when he talked about how music moves him emotionally. It was good to understand a bit about his emotional relationship to music. And I wish the documentary had come in many parts. Very well done!
