I saw Tara on You Tube and loved her style.<br /><br />All 4 of the DVD's are excellent.  These are recorded in various venues.  The atmospheres are minimalistic and there is no backgound music.  Tara directs you through the poses in her earthy approach to yoga.  She is beautiful, talented, and humble.<br /><br />She studied ballet in her youth and it shows.  She is so graceful.  Thanks Tara for your beautiful Diva style of yoga!<br /><br />She has a studio in NYC, if you live there or  travel it would be fun to drop in for a class.  She has lots of videos on You Tube, so check her out and get this DVD set if you like her style.\nReview Title: Tara is the Diva of earthbound yoga with minimal ego\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
