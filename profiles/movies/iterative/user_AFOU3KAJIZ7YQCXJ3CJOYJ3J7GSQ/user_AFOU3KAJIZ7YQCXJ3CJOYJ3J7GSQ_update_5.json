MM is a perfectionist and attends to every single detail in his performances.  You gotta love that in any performer.<br /><br />Great editing from MM concerts worldwide on the Guns, God, Govt tour into one wonderful unique concert for this DVD.  The sound is great, so plan on cranking it up LOUD.<br /><br />I loved seeing the entire band play with reckless abandon.  They all poured 110% into their performances.  The costumes were great, lighting was perfect, special effects were terrific!<br /><br />The Death Parade film is a behind the scenes look at the band which was fun, except I could have done without the temper tantrums.<br /><br />I have watched this twice already this week, and I will be watching it many more times.  WAY too much fun!  LOVED IT&#62;<br /><br />BTW: This DVD is a &#34;Must Have&#34; for any MM fan!\nReview Title: Wild reckless FUN!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I saw Tara on You Tube and loved her style.<br /><br />All 4 of the DVD's are excellent.  These are recorded in various venues.  The atmospheres are minimalistic and there is no backgound music.  Tara directs you through the poses in her earthy approach to yoga.  She is beautiful, talented, and humble.<br /><br />She studied ballet in her youth and it shows.  She is so graceful.  Thanks Tara for your beautiful Diva style of yoga!<br /><br />She has a studio in NYC, if you live there or  travel it would be fun to drop in for a class.  She has lots of videos on You Tube, so check her out and get this DVD set if you like her style.\nTara is the Diva of earthbound yoga with minimal ego\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Betty Thomas'], 'Producers': ['Ivan Reitman'], 'Starring': ['Howard Stern', 'Robin Quivers', 'Mary McCormack'], 'Studio': ['Paramount Pictures']}\nI must confess that I get a huge kick out of Howard, and I loved this movie.  This is the real deal, a slice of how Howard got to be the King of All Media.<br /><br />Even if you are not a big fan of Howard, you might still like seeing how he had to fight his way to the top of the pile against mainstream media and the FCC.<br /><br />But if you are a fan of Howard, you will love this movie.  His ex-wife Alison stars as herself, Robin as herself, Babbabooie as himself, and the very talented Fred as himself.  The NBC exec (aka Pig Vomit) is very well done by Paul Giamotti.<br /><br />You will get to see the very personal sensitive side of Howard on screen.  Too fun, and too funny!<br /><br />Although this is a 1997 film, it is still relevant today.  A good slice of the 80's and how we listen to radio today.<br /><br />I also bought the soundtrack because I love the Rob Zombie song The Great American Nightmare that starts off Howard's show.  Here is the link, it is loads of fun too.<br />http://www.amazon.com/Private-Parts-Album-1997-Film/dp/B000002NCO/ref=cm_cr_pr_pb_t\nHilarious from beginning to end\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Anthony C.
