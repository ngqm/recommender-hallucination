I couldn't even make it past the first 20mins. It was fine until this lady offered (Guy Pierce) to have sex with a young teenage boy. The way she said it was enough to make you want to puke. I will not be finishing this film.\nDisgusting!\nDreams From My Real Father: A Story of Reds and Deception\nDocumentary\n[\"Dreams from My Real Father chronicles Barack Obama's life journey in socialism starting with evidence that Obama's real father was Frank Marshall Davis, a Communist Party USA propagandist who indoctrinated Obama into a Marxist ideology during his formative years.

It really focused on how the FDA could play a vital role in saving lives, but instead is chooses to let people suffer. It's hard to believe that our country is so heartless and where the line blurs from helpful to harmful. This is a great documentary for everyone to watch, it really will open your eyes to how the government would rather let drugs that will save or help people sit forever instead of taking a stand to work with these families.\nA MUST WATCH!
