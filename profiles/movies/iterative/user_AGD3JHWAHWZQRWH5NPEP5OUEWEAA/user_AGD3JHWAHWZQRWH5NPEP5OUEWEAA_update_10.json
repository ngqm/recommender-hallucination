It really focused on how the FDA could play a vital role in saving lives, but instead is chooses to let people suffer. It's hard to believe that our country is so heartless and where the line blurs from helpful to harmful. This is a great documentary for everyone to watch, it really will open your eyes to how the government would rather let drugs that will save or help people sit forever instead of taking a stand to work with these families.\nReview Title: A MUST WATCH!
