To keep populations stable and sustainable on public lands, thousands of these magnificent creatures are taken from their herds each year and trained, sold, or put out to pasture. Some of the horses end up in the Wild Horse Inmate Program, through which inmates at the East Canon Correctional Complex (East Canon, CO) learn the non-coercive methods of horse whisperers to tame and train the horses for adoption. THE WILD HORSE REDEMPTION traces the incredible stories of both the horses and the inmates, masterfully intertwining their parallel fates and their mutual struggle towards rehabilitation. The inmates' progress with their horses depends upon their ability to cultivate patience, fortitude, and empathy; interestingly, too, it is through the recognition of themselves in these wild animals that they better understand their own lives. The most stirring moments of this film capture the intimacy forged between beast and man in the dramatic space of the training ring, where both undergo extraordinary transformations. Beautifully shot in the rugged foothills and big skies of southern Colorado, THE WILD HORSE REDEMPTION takes viewers on an intimate and uplifting journey of freedom, discipline, and redemption.\"]\n{'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.53 x 5.35 x 7.47 inches; 2.72 Ounces', 'Item model number': '4314155', 'Director': 'John Zaritsky', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, NTSC', 'Run time': '1 hour and 31 minutes', 'Release date': 'November 18, 2008', 'Actors': 'Various', 'Language': 'Unqualified', 'Studio': 'Docurama', 'Number of discs': '1'}\ngreat movie\nFive Stars\n{'Content advisory': ['Foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Carrie Schrader', 'Charlene Fisk'], 'Producers': ['Charlene Fisk'], 'Starring': ['Louise Suggs', 'Marilynn Smith', 'Shirley Spork'], 'Studio': ['Bossa Nova Productions', 'Inc. dba Level 33 Entertainment']}\ngreat\nnice flic\n{'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Josh Gordon', 'Will Speck'], 'Producers': ['Scott Stuber', 'Guymon Casady', 'Daniel Rappaport', 'Josh Gordon', 'Will Speck', 'Beau Bauman', 'Richard Vane', 'Matthew Hirsch'], 'Starring': ['Jason Bateman', 'Olivia Munn', 'T.J.
