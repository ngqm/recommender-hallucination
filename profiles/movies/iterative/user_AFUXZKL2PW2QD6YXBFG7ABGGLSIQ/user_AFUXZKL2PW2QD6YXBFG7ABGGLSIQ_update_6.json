When Elaine Marshall (Jean Smart) catches her husband and his lover in a hotel room, her anger quickly turns to shock as she discovers that Jim's paramour is a young man. What ensues is painful soul-searching for Jim, Elaine, and their family.Her Desperate Choice - Despite allegations of sexual abuse against her ex-husband, Jody (Faith Ford) has lost a custody battle for Samantha (Hanna Hall) and faces a choice of turning her daughter over to him, or taking flight and risking kidnapping charges. Pursued by both the FBI and a private detective, Jody and Samantha become hunted animals, fleeing from town to town with the help of an Underground Railroad set up to help women and children escape from abuse.The Truth About Jane - Jane's mom (Stockard Channing) assumes her daughter is just like every other sixteen-year-old girl - a little confused about growing up. Jane (Ellen Muth) figures her mom is just like every other mom - a little too protective, but loving. They figure they have a good relationship, until Jane falls in love with the new girl at school. Jane knows she is gay but her mom is completely unwilling to accept this fact. Their mother-daughter relationship is broken unless they can find a way to remember how much they love each other.\"]\n{'Format': 'NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Lee Rose, Stockard Channing, Faith Ford, Jean Smart, Michael Scott, Arvin Brown', 'Runtime': '4 hours and 32 minutes', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.5 x 0.5 inches; 2.93 Ounces', 'Director': 'Arvin Brown, Michael Scott, Lee Rose', 'Media Format': 'NTSC', 'Run time': '4 hours and 32 minutes', 'Release date': 'March 14, 2012', 'Actors': 'Stockard Channing, Jean Smart, Faith Ford', 'Studio': 'Fisher Klingenstein Films', 'Number of discs': '3'}\nnice combo\nFive Stars\nThe West Side Waltz\nAlvarez, George  (Actor),     Bates, Kathy  (Actor)    Rated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Drama\n{'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, Full Screen, NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Grey, Jennifer, MacLaine, Shirley, Rose, William Lawrence, Bates, Kathy, Gilliland, Richard, Schellenberg, August, Harris, Estelle, Saviola, Camille, Chin, Tsai, Gleason, Mary Pat, Davenport, Mark, Reicheg, Richard, Thompson, Ernest, Williams, Hal, Mosley, Irvin, Scott, Lorna, Alvarez, George, Pastorelli, Robert, Cerullo, Alfred, Minnelli, LizaGrey, Jennifer, MacLaine, Shirley, Rose, William Lawrence, Bates, Kathy, Gilliland, Richard, Schellenberg, August, Harris, Estelle, Saviola, Camille, Chin, Tsai, Gleason, Mary Pat, Davenport, Mark, Reicheg, Richard, Thompson, Ernest, Williams, Hal, Mosley, Irvin, Scott, Lo\u2026   See more', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo)', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 30 minutes', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'Unrated (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.25 x 5.75 x 0.5 inches; 0.71 Ounces', 'Director': 'Thompson, Ernest', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, Full Screen, NTSC', 'Run time': '1 hour and 30 minutes', 'Release date': 'May 1, 2003', 'Actors': 'Alvarez, George, Bates, Kathy, Cerullo, Alfred, Chin, Tsai, Davenport, Mark', 'Studio': 'Allumination', 'Number of discs': '1'}\ngreat flick\nFive Stars",
