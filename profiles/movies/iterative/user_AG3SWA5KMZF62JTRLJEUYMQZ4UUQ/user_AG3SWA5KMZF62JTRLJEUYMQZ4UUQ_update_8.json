Directed by Otto Preminger.\", 'Amazon.com', 'Laura', 'will always be director Otto Preminger\\'s most beloved movie, but he gets closer to the essence of film noir in this fascinatingly slippery item about a psychiatrist\\'s wife whose weakness for kleptomania makes her prey to an oily hypnotist, con artist, and manipulator par excellence. The fashion-plate wife (dresses, robes, and peignoirs by Oleg Cassini) is played by Laura herself, Gene Tierney. The mellifluous conniver is Jose Ferrer, coming off like the illegitimate son of Waldo Lydecker (\"I\\'m so glad you\\'re here--you make Tina\\'s party seem an almost human event\"). Among other things, Ferrer would probably like to get Tierney into bed, and a good many people--including Richard Conte as the caring husband--come to believe he has. But that\\'s not the extent of his ambitions, and before long Tierney has been framed for a murder of convenience to clear up another bit of messiness in the cad\\'s career.', 'Whirlpool', \"'s mise-en-sc\u00e8ne has a sinuous fluidity and subtle play of light and shadow (it was among the last films shot by that master of black-and-white, Arthur C. Miller), and the complexly structured screenplay--by Ben Hecht and Andrew Solt--takes us by surprise in reel after reel. There's nothing redeeming about Ferrer's character (except how much pleasure his villainy affords), but Preminger doesn't really side with any of the characters or permit our facile identification with anyone. Different parts of the movie are dominated by each of the key figures, including police detective Charles Bickford, and we keep learning there's more to each of them than we initially assumed.\", 'Whirlpool', \"'s a good title for it.

When you listen to the commentary the film is much more interesting.  Just watching it, well, it is not a very interesting or exciting film.  I was curious because I had not heard of it or seen it.  If I had seen it before, I may not have purchased it.

Friendless and lonely, she\\'s an easy target for her boozed-up madam (Kay Medford) and sadistic pimp (John Kerr) until a compassionate doctor (Lloyd Nolan) helps her unlock the secrets of her past and gain a sense of self-worth.

If you are a fan of film from this circa, you will enjoy this.  Great performance from Anne Francis...an underrated actress.  Worthy of an Academy Award nomination if not a win.  She walks away with this film.  Beautiful, sympathetic, no over acting...which could happen in this kind of role.

When Palance and Grahame plot to get her fortune, the evil scheme backfires with ironically twisted results. Palance has no idea how much his wife truly loves him, and she has no idea how sinister he truly is.

Great camera work, authentic locations.  Good story...a middle-aged woman who, although extremely bright, is completely deceived by Jack Palance's character...he is, after all, an actor.  Love Gloria Grahame...but I would watch anything she was in.  The DVD sound is inferior.  But I am grateful...I never see this film on TV...cannot understand why.  Have not seen this film since it came out and I was a very, young girl.  Glad to have it.

Everyone turns in a good performance; Anne Baxter dominates the screen; she is so watchable.  Watching these old movies has made me familiar with all the players/cast members.<br /><br />Had the privilege of seeing Ruth Warrick in person many years ago...she was already maturing.  She did a reading of &#34;Love Letters&#34;...I think that was the name.  She was the most beautifully groomed woman I have every seen, and I surmised she was very serious about acting.  Should also be remembered for Citizen Kane.<br /><br />This movie is entertaining, I am so glad it is available on Amazon Prime.  Love the sets with the period furniture.  The older ways of doing things: dressmakers, etc.  Have already watched it more than once.\nVintage Entertainment\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: Low', 'English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a)', 'Italiano', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', '\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e', 'Portugu\u00eas', 'Deutsch', 'Fran\u00e7ais'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', '\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629', 'Deutsch', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a)', 'Fran\u00e7ais', '\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940', 'Indonesia', 'Italiano', '\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e', '\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4', 'Nederlands', 'Polski', 'Portugu\u00eas', '\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439', 'T\u00fcrk\u00e7e', '\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7b80\u4f53\uff09', '\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7e41\u9ad4\uff09'], 'Directors': ['Tim Blake Nelson', 'Mike Barker', 'Neasa Hardiman', 'Minkie Spiro', 'Wash Westmoreland'], 'Producers': ['Antonia Elli', 'Christina Ricci', 'Christine Vachon', 'Dawn Prestwich', 'Ian Deithman Kristin', 'Kathy Ciric', 'Lydia Woodward', 'Mike Barker', 'Minkie Spiro', 'Neasa Hardiman', 'Nicole Yorkin', 'Pamela Koffler', 'Rusk Robinson', 'Theresa Anne Fowler', 'Tim Blake Nelson', 'Wash Westmoreland'], 'Starring': ['Christina Ricci', 'David Hoflin'], 'Studio': ['Amazon Studios']}\nI am hooked.
