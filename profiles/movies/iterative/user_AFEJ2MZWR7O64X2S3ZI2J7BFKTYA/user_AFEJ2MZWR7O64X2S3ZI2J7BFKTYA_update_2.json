Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is the best there is at extraction: stealing valuable secrets inside the subconscious during the mind\u2019s vulnerable dream state. His skill has made him a coveted player in industrial espionage but also has made him a fugitive and cost him dearly. Now he may get a second chance if he can do the impossible: inception, planting an idea rather than stealing one. If they succeed, Cobb and his team could pull off the perfect crime. But no planning or expertise can prepare them for a dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy only Cobb could have seen coming.', 'Review', \"In terms of sheer originality, ambition and achievement, Inception is the movie of the summer, the movie of the year and the movie of our dreams --Pete Hammond, Boxoffice MagazineAs engrossing and logic-resistant as the state of dreaming it seeks to replicate, Christopher Nolan's audacious new creation demands further study to fully absorb the multiple, simultaneous stories Nolan finagles into one narrative experience. --Lisa Schwarzbaum, Entertainment WeeklyThis is a deeply felt work of art in the form of a big, brassy movie-movie. --Shawn Levy, Portland Oregonian\"]\n{'Genre': 'Science Fiction & Fantasy, Action & Adventure', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Blu-ray, AC-3, Color, Dolby, Widescreen, Subtitled, DTS Surround Sound', 'Contributor': 'Marion Cotillard, Christopher Nolan, Leonardo DiCaprio, Michael Caine, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Tom BerengerMarion Cotillard, Christopher Nolan, Leonardo DiCaprio, Michael Caine, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger  See more', 'Language': 'French (Dolby Digital 5.1), English (DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1), Unqualified (DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1), Spanish (Dolby Digital 5.1)', 'Runtime': '2 hours and 28 minutes', 'Digital Copy Expiration Date': 'November 20, 2014', 'Aspect Ratio': '2.40:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned)', 'Product Dimensions': '6.75 x 5.3 x 0.5 inches; 5.6 Ounces', 'Director': 'Christopher Nolan', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Color, Dolby, Widescreen, Subtitled, Blu-ray, DTS Surround Sound', 'Run time': '2 hours and 28 minutes', 'Release date': 'December 7, 2010', 'Actors': 'Leonardo DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page', 'Subtitles': 'English, French, Spanish', 'Studio': 'WarnerBrothers', 'Number of discs': '2'}\nGREAT MOVIE!\nFive Stars\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['John Dahl'], 'Starring': ['Hugh Dancy', 'Mads Mikkelsen', 'Caroline Dhavernas'], 'Studio': ['Lionsgate']}\nHannibal is the Best!\nFive Stars",
