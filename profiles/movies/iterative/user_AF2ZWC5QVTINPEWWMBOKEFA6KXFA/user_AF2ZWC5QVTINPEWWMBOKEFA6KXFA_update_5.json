Toye', 'Carl Franklin', 'Anthony Hemingway'], 'Starring': ['Noah Wyle', 'Moon Bloodgood', 'Will Patton']}\nHow I missed this series for two years is beyond me, and I really have to thank Amazon Prime because I would have never known about it without them.  Earth has been invaded by aliens and they are attempting to destroy our race and enslave our children.  Hands down the best Sci-Fi series I've seen since Lost.  The characters are amazing enough that even those that don't like the action in a series, will fall in love with it because of the underlying human drama element. I watched the entire two years in less than two weeks if that tells you how blown away I was by this series.\nFalling Skies is Phenomenal\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Ernest Dickerson', 'Billy Gierhart', 'Guy Ferland', 'Greg Nicotero'], 'Producers': ['Glen Mazzara', 'Robert Kirkman', 'Gale Anne Hurd', 'David Alpert'], 'Starring': ['Andrew Lincoln', 'Sarah Wayne Callies', 'Laurie Holden']}\nCan't say enough great things about this show!  Definitely hooked!  Season three was incredible, just as I knew it would be.\nLove This Show!\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Joe Chappelle', 'Brad Anderson', 'Frederick E.O. Toye', 'Jeannot Szwarc', 'Charles Beeson', 'Dennis Smith', 'Akiva Goldsman', 'Jeffrey G. Hunt', 'David Straiton', 'Paul A. Edwards'], 'Producers': ['Not Specified'], 'Starring': ['Anna Torv', 'Joshua Jackson', 'Lance Reddick'], 'Studio': ['IMDB Freedive']}\nThis show is absolutely amazing, and my only regret is I just found it in 2012.  The characters are incredible, the plot will blow your mind and it will definitely leave you wanting to see the next season and the next and the next!  Conspiracy theory folks, Sci-Fi or simple people who just love a good love story will all enjoy this show.  It actually made me start researching science again!  Don't miss out on Fringe!\nThere Should Be More STARS for Rating!\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Joe Chappelle', 'Brad Anderson', 'Frederick E.O.

Edwards'], 'Producers': ['Alex Kurtzman', 'Roberto Orci', 'Akiva Goldsman'], 'Starring': ['Anna Torv', 'Joshua Jackson', 'John Noble']}\nI can't say enough about this incredible series, and my only negative comment is there won't be more shows to watch!  I fell in love with the characters, story line, and became obsessed studying fringe science because of this show.\nFringe is hands down the best show ever!\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Shawn Piller', 'T.W.
