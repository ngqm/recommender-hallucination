Toye', 'Carl Franklin', 'Anthony Hemingway'], 'Starring': ['Noah Wyle', 'Moon Bloodgood', 'Will Patton']}\nReview Text: How I missed this series for two years is beyond me, and I really have to thank Amazon Prime because I would have never known about it without them.  Earth has been invaded by aliens and they are attempting to destroy our race and enslave our children.  Hands down the best Sci-Fi series I've seen since Lost.  The characters are amazing enough that even those that don't like the action in a series, will fall in love with it because of the underlying human drama element. I watched the entire two years in less than two weeks if that tells you how blown away I was by this series.\nReview Title: Falling Skies is Phenomenal\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
