Every day is a struggle just to survive. For the loggers, wedged on a mountainside with behemoth trees, 60-ton machines, and razor-sharp chainsaws, the slightest miscalculation can spell disaster. The ice road truckers, steering gigantic 16-wheelers over frozen roads, face the specter of crashing through the surface, frostbite, or worse. And residents of the forbidding, icy north battle weather and unforgiving terrain just to eke out an existence. They all need every bit of ingenuity, grit, and know-how they can muster just to stay alive at least until the next gig.This adrenaline-pumping collection from HISTORY includes over 20 hours of action from Ax Men, Tougher in Alaska, and the record-breaking series Ice Road Truckers.

I was very happy with the result. I was sweaty, did my own stretching additional to warm up after the workout. I have been looking for a video like this to help advance me. I have prior experience with kettlbells and I can appreciate the instructors vision/ideals into this video.  I have had pain in the past from using higher weights and high reps and after doing these videos and the stretching I seriously feel good. I don't give this review lightly. I don't find it boring either as I add on to my other workouts and excited to have a video to use my heavier bells in. I thought there wasn't a way for me to advance past using a 25 pound bell but this dvd helped. My heavier ones 35 pound ones are in use now. I usually dead lifted my 25 pound bell. With this video I dared to dead lift 70 pounds when I weigh 130 and no pain feels awesome!
