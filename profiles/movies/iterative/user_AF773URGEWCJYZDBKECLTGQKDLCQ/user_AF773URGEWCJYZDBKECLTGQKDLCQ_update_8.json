I was very happy with the result. I was sweaty, did my own stretching additional to warm up after the workout. I have been looking for a video like this to help advance me. I have prior experience with kettlbells and I can appreciate the instructors vision/ideals into this video.  I have had pain in the past from using higher weights and high reps and after doing these videos and the stretching I seriously feel good. I don't give this review lightly. I don't find it boring either as I add on to my other workouts and excited to have a video to use my heavier bells in. I thought there wasn't a way for me to advance past using a 25 pound bell but this dvd helped. My heavier ones 35 pound ones are in use now. I usually dead lifted my 25 pound bell. With this video I dared to dead lift 70 pounds when I weigh 130 and no pain feels awesome!  It makes me think I could go even heavier eventually as I build up tolerance.\nReview Title: Lauren Brooks' The Kettlebell Body DVd\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Every day is a struggle just to survive. For the loggers, wedged on a mountainside with behemoth trees, 60-ton machines, and razor-sharp chainsaws, the slightest miscalculation can spell disaster. The ice road truckers, steering gigantic 16-wheelers over frozen roads, face the specter of crashing through the surface, frostbite, or worse. And residents of the forbidding, icy north battle weather and unforgiving terrain just to eke out an existence. They all need every bit of ingenuity, grit, and know-how they can muster just to stay alive at least until the next gig.This adrenaline-pumping collection from HISTORY includes over 20 hours of action from Ax Men, Tougher in Alaska, and the record-breaking series Ice Road Truckers. You'll be awed as you watch these ordinary-seeming men face the kind of daily challenges most of us can't even imagine.Programs per disc:DISC 1: Ice Road Truckers S1, Vol 1: episodes 1-4DISC 2: Ice Road Truckers S1, Vol 2: episodes 5-8DISC 3: Ice Road Truckers S1, Vol 3: episodes 9-10 / bonus materialsDISC 4: Ice Road Truckers: On and Off The IceDISC 5: Dangerous Missions: Suicide Missions of D-Day / Marine Raiders / Forward Observers / PathfindersDISC 6: Dangerous Missions: Rescue Swimmers / Merrill's Marauders / Assault on Iwo Jima / Hostage NegotiatorsDISC 7: Ax Men S1, Vol 1: Man vs. Mountain / Risk and Reward / Storm Season Strikes / The Big HitDISC 8: Ax Men S1, Vol 2: Market Meltdown / Reversal of Fortune / The Close Call / Loggers Under FireDISC 9: Ax Men S1, Vol 3: A Logger's Thanksgiving / Black Friday / Storm of the CenturyDISC 10: Ax Men S1, Vol 4: The Toughest Season / Picking Up The Pieces / The Final HaulDISC 11: Tougher in Alaska S1, Vol 1: Episodes 1-4DISC 12: Tougher in Alaska S1, Vol 2: Episodes 5-7DISC 13: Tougher in Alaska S1, Vol 3: Episodes 8-10DISC 14: Tougher in Alaska S1, Vol 4: Episodes 11-13\"]\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'Unrated (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '8 x 5.75 x 2.25 inches; 1.5 Pounds', 'Director': 'History', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, NTSC', 'Run time': '37 hours and 36 minutes', 'Release date': 'May 26, 2009', 'Actors': 'Various', 'Language': 'Unqualified (DTS ES 6.1)', 'Studio': 'A&E Home Video', 'Number of discs': '14'}\nThe shows work great and liked the value package to see other shows I haven't.
