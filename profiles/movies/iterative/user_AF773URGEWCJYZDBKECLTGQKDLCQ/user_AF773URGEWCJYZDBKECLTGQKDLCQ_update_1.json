Every day is a struggle just to survive. For the loggers, wedged on a mountainside with behemoth trees, 60-ton machines, and razor-sharp chainsaws, the slightest miscalculation can spell disaster. The ice road truckers, steering gigantic 16-wheelers over frozen roads, face the specter of crashing through the surface, frostbite, or worse. And residents of the forbidding, icy north battle weather and unforgiving terrain just to eke out an existence. They all need every bit of ingenuity, grit, and know-how they can muster just to stay alive at least until the next gig.This adrenaline-pumping collection from HISTORY includes over 20 hours of action from Ax Men, Tougher in Alaska, and the record-breaking series Ice Road Truckers.
