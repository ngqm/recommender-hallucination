The name Otorten translates as 'Don't go there' in the local Mansi language. One of the skiers fell ill and returned. The remaining nine lost their way and ended up on another mountain slope known as Kholat Syakhl (translated as 'Mountain of the Dead' due to the previous deaths that occurred there). On the night of 1 February 1959 something or someone caused the skiers to flee their tent in terror by using knives to slash their way out rather than leaving by the entrance. When they failed to return, search parties were sent out and their bodies were found, some with massive internal injuries but with no external marks on them. The autopsy stated the violent injuries were caused by 'an unknown compelling force'. The area was sealed off for years by the authorities and the deaths and events of that night remain unexplained. Benefitting from original research carried out in Russia, this book attempts to explain what happened to the nine skiers who lost their lives on the 'Mountain of the Dead', in what has come to be known as the 'Dyatlov Pass Incident'. ...The Dyatlov Pass Incident (2013) ( Devil's Pass )\"]\nAverage Rating: 4.2\nProduct Details: {'Aspect Ratio': '1.78:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'Unrated (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '5.51 x 6.69 x 0.79 inches; 3.74 Ounces', 'Director': 'Renny Harlin', 'Media Format': 'Import', 'Run time': '96 minutes', 'Release date': 'September 3, 2013', 'Actors': 'Gemma Atkinson, Matt Stokoe, Richard Reid, Holly Goss, Luke Albright', 'Producers': \"The Dyatlov Pass Incident (2013) ( Devil's Pass ), The Dyatlov Pass Incident (2013), Devil's Pass\", 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 2.0)', 'Studio': 'IMPORTS', 'Country of Origin': 'United Kingdom', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: While I didn't expect much, this was really pretty well done.

The first few minutes of John Carpenter's\", 'Vampires', '--in which James Woods\\'s vampire killer leads a dawn raid on a New Mexico \"goon nest\" of bloodsuckers--not only suggests a horror movie that will not pull any punches, it even evokes some of the more disturbing dream-memories of American Westerns. Muscular and uncompromised, the sequence suggests a new Carpenter classic unraveling before one\\'s eyes. Well, dream on. Things don\\'t quite work out that way, but this is still a film to reckon with. There are a few serious (and surprising) misjudgments on the director\\'s part, particularly a mishandling of Sheryl Lee\\'s role as a prostitute poisoned by the bite of a \"master vampire\" (who pretty much wiped out Woods\\'s team of goon terminators). But aside from some weaknesses, the action is jolting, the suggested complicity of the Catholic Church in destroying monsters is provocative, and the traces of Howard Hawks\\'s continuing influence on Carpenter\\'s storytelling are in evidence.', '--Tom Keogh']\n{'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Full Screen, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, NTSC', 'Contributor': 'James Woods, John Steakley, Mark Boone Junior, Tim Guinee, Don Jakoby, John Carpenter, Maximilian Schell, Thomas Ian Griffith, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, Henry Kingi, Sheryl Lee, Thomas Rosales Jr., Daniel Baldwin, David Rowden, Gregory SierraJames Woods, John Steakley, Mark Boone Junior, Tim Guinee, Don Jakoby, John Carpenter, Maximilian Schell, Thomas Ian Griffith, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, Henry Kingi, Sheryl Lee, Thomas Rosales Jr., Daniel Baldwin, David Rowden, Gregory Sierra  See more', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1), Unqualified, English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround), French (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround)', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 48 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.33:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 0.7 x 5.4 inches; 3.2 Ounces', 'Item model number': '43396030640', 'Director': 'John Carpenter', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Full Screen, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, NTSC', 'Run time': '1 hour and 48 minutes', 'Release date': 'February 9, 1999', 'Actors': 'James Woods, Daniel Baldwin, Sheryl Lee, Thomas Ian Griffith, Maximilian Schell', 'Dubbed': 'French', 'Subtitles': 'English, French', 'Studio': 'Sony Pictures Home Entertainment', 'Writers': 'Don Jakoby, John Steakley', 'Number of discs': '1'}\n&#34;Hey Padre, got a little wood?&#34;.
