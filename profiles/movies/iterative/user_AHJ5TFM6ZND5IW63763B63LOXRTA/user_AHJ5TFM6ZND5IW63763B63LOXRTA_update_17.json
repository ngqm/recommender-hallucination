Simpson', 'Norman Pardo', 'Wendy Williams']}\nI actually found this interesting and perspective as to the dealings and sealing of evidence that has never been turned over or opened by Garcetti.  - interesting investigation sealings - interesting relationships exposed.  It was a perspective from a man that was inside and these facts never came up in the media reports.  The man doing life, Danny Wacsz I think was his name and his letter.  The relationships between Nicole and Kris Kardashian-Jenner and the friendship between Kardashian and OJ.  Very informative details bravely told.  What does it all mean, not much.  But it was worth watching, I fell asleep during it as it was sort of repeating itself and somewhat disconnecting so that a few details could be made long enough to drag into a movie length.  I don't think Kardashian should have been able to use his legal license to prevent questions due to the length of his license being inactive and his close relationship with OJ and the fact that he had been accused of hiring a hitman for OJ to kill Nicole.  Also the information that Kris had a long running open marriage with sexual relationships with OJ - has this even been proven?  But it did explain why people keep saying Khloe is OJ's child. I had not heard this before that there was cross overs in the pairs, I guess they call it \"swinging\"; but during the time that type as is today, very popular among couples so it's not unbelievable, it is just information that probably unless you were in the room, can't be verified.  Given that young Rob Kardashian has texted about his ability to take down others, and has been sued for threats founded or unfounded??? through various groups it does raise brows to question the dynamics of this family's history.  Whatever the case, Nicole and Ron are deceased and I hope they are at peace in their souls and whomever was responsible has to live with it forever.  Drugs were involved, that was made clear and dangerous criminal types and anger, rage and jealousy.  Never a winning recipe.\nInteresting details never before told\nThe Farmer's Wife: A David Sutherland Film\nTalk Show and Variety\n[\"Step inside the passionate, troubled lives of Juanita and Darrel Buschkoetter as they cling to family and farm.

How often was I called a sow, a pig, a heffer before I said, NO MORE - after 34 years, he still counts the years I am gone.  But sometimes - you learn to act a monster and the men laugh - but you cry at night for what you lost. Ain't no joke in abusive marriages or suffering or telling someone who washes your dirty clothes - there's the door, my way or the highway.  Sometimes, they may just take you up on your offer.
