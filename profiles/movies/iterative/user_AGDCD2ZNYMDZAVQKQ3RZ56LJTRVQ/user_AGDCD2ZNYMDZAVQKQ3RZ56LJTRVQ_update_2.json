This is the worst produced DVD ever in the history of the world.  The audio quality is horrible, and the video isn't much better.  For gosh sakes this is LAS VEGAS in the super showroom built to house Ms Dion for five years, you know they've got the very best sound and video available, but this DVD is just a bad afterthought.  It's a shame, because Ms Midler has always been captured best live on camera, and she has a whole catalogue of HBO shows that were extremely well done (but apparently aren't available today).<br /><br />I've loved Bette Midler her entire career, but this DVD is absolutely a piece of crap.  Do not bother.  It is an insult to one of the great talents of all time.\nReview Title: Even die-hard fans, don't bother\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
