Leo DiCaprio seems to ONLY do top notch work in top notch movies nowadays, and for some years now.  He not only tackles major issues & biopics/biographical in his cinematic masterpieces in the last several years, BUT now he has become a believable, yet vulnerable while flawed protagonist.  Who knew this kid would kid would go on to work so hard at his craft after his first few offerings as a teen heart throb.  He first won me over as \"The Aviator,\" and not as Romeo nor as Cameron's dying 'king of the world' in those icy waters either.  While I don't usually go for the main character dying at the end of the movie, as it kind of breaks from the traditional \"Hollywood Formula:\"  One of his best performances to be sure was in \"Blood Diamond,\" and it worked very well being a most impressive performance as well.  Inception is one that you will certainly NOT mind seeing again and again from time to time - as it has many layers, on the action, story, and human levels!  And that is a direct result of tremendous writing, acting, directing, and not too over-used CGIas well.  Word has it he is very hard working on the set, not a prima donna, helping to making the final product a synergistic tour de force.  He is surely one to watch as he grows with the industry.  His volunteer and activism is impressive as well, putting his resources to work for GOOD.  I think more actors would be more grounded (and stay a little more outa trouble if they followed in his example).  Young people wouldn't do too bad to continue to look up to his better facets.  Nicely done, kid!  \"Inception\" - we'd like to see more like this one.\nReview Title: Perfect Condition, best movie I've seen in months to years!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
