Yes there are some &#34;adult&#34; themes but it was very refreshing to watch a entertainer that wasn't dropping a F bomb and words related to it every 5 minutes.

That is why I gave it the rating I did.

She's put on a team with three other standard-issue young women: spoiled, self-assured Weiss Schnee; intellectual Blake Belladonna, who hides a dark past; and enthusiastic, supportive Yang Xiao Long.

Secondary characters appear as black silhouettes and important actions often take place off camera or behind a screen of dust.
