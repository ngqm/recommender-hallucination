Yes there are some &#34;adult&#34; themes but it was very refreshing to watch a entertainer that wasn't dropping a F bomb and words related to it every 5 minutes.  Not that I find that kind of language offensive but to have a comedian not rely on those words to be funny...

That is why I gave it the rating I did.

Ruby Rose is an eager, weapon-wielding 15-year-old who's about to enter the Beacon Academy to train to become a huntress, a warrior who fights the evils that plague the world of Remnant. She's put on a team with three other standard-issue young women: spoiled, self-assured Weiss Schnee; intellectual Blake Belladonna, who hides a dark past; and enthusiastic, supportive Yang Xiao Long. The uneasy quartet and their friends from other teams are soon training to handle weapons, carry out missions, slay monsters, and function as a team. As\", 'RWBY', 'was created for the web on an obviously limited budget, the animation and designs are minimal at best. Secondary characters appear as black silhouettes and important actions often take place off camera or behind a screen of dust. The episodes only last 16 minutes, including the opening and closing titles, which may be a more awkward length to direct than the standard half-hour. Sometimes too much action is crowded into too short a space; other episodes end before the story reaches a satisfactory conclusion.
