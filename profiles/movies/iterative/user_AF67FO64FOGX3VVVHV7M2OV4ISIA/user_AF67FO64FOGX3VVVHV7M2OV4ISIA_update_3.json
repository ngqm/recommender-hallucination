Yes there are some &#34;adult&#34; themes but it was very refreshing to watch a entertainer that wasn't dropping a F bomb and words related to it every 5 minutes.  Not that I find that kind of language offensive but to have a comedian not rely on those words to be funny... I'll be buying the DVD...\nReview Title: Funny, Funny, Funny!\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

It will leave you guessing until the end, all the performances are really well done.  The special effects are still holding up but are showing their age, but all in all it's a very good story and isn't that what makes a good movie?\nWorth it!\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Egami'], 'Starring': ['Gabriel Iglesias'], 'Studio': ['Egami']}\nStand up comedy at it's finest!
