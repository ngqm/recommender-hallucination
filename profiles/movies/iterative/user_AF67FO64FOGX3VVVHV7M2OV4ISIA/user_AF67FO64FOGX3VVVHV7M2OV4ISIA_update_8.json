It will leave you guessing until the end, all the performances are really well done.  The special effects are still holding up but are showing their age, but all in all it's a very good story and isn't that what makes a good movie?\nWorth it!\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Egami'], 'Starring': ['Gabriel Iglesias'], 'Studio': ['Egami']}\nStand up comedy at it's finest!  Yes there are some &#34;adult&#34; themes but it was very refreshing to watch a entertainer that wasn't dropping a F bomb and words related to it every 5 minutes.  Not that I find that kind of language offensive but to have a comedian not rely on those words to be funny... I'll be buying the DVD...\nFunny, Funny, Funny!\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['KOBUN'], 'Producers': ['Shinsaku Tanaka', 'Ryuji Sekine', 'Hisato Usui', 'Takuro Hatakeyama'], 'Starring': ['Aoi Yuki', 'Daisuke Hirakawa', 'Rie Kugimiya'], 'Studio': ['A-Net Digital']}\nThe animation is different than the majority of the anime out there which is a plus, but since the \"censorship\" ink splashes detract from the visual which in this case has didn't really impact the storyline but did detract from the flow of the visuals.  That is why I gave it the rating I did.  Additionally since I am over 21 and live in a locality in which I am not prohibited in the viewing of adult images either of a sexual nature or of a violent nature I find that not having the option of choosing which version to watch rather distasteful\nMixed Bag\nMythbusters\nUnscripted, Documentary, Kids, Special Interest\n['Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman are at it again--getting to the bottom of popular myths one experiment at a time by combining science, curiosity, and inventiveness.

Your either a fan or your not. Since I'm a fan.. It's really cool how science and entertainment can come to together in such a way that can be imitated but never replicated\nMythbusters..
