Yes there are some &#34;adult&#34; themes but it was very refreshing to watch a entertainer that wasn't dropping a F bomb and words related to it every 5 minutes.

Ruby Rose is an eager, weapon-wielding 15-year-old who's about to enter the Beacon Academy to train to become a huntress, a warrior who fights the evils that plague the world of Remnant. She's put on a team with three other standard-issue young women: spoiled, self-assured Weiss Schnee; intellectual Blake Belladonna, who hides a dark past; and enthusiastic, supportive Yang Xiao Long. The uneasy quartet and their friends from other teams are soon training to handle weapons, carry out missions, slay monsters, and function as a team.

Secondary characters appear as black silhouettes and important actions often take place off camera or behind a screen of dust. The episodes only last 16 minutes, including the opening and closing titles, which may be a more awkward length to direct than the standard half-hour.
