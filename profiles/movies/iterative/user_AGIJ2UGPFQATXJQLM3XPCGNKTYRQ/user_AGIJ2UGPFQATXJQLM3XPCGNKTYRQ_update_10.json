While all mention Ub Iwerks, he is usually given only \"byline\" status.  This is a wonderful biography about a man who was not only an artist, but a remarkable engineer as well.  IF you watch this, keep in mind throughout that Mr. Iwerks was forced to quit school at the age of 14.  Disney, himself a determined genius, must have recognized that Mr. Iwerks was also his intellectual and creative equal and much like him.  I'm glad his granddaughter has given him a place among the Disney family and it is no less than fitting that he deserves to be recognized.\nReview Title: Masterful documentary and a must for all Disney fans\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "The Mystery of Edwin Drood\nDrama\n['Acclaimed screenwriter Gwyneth Hughes brings to life this unfinished tale of obsessive love and betrayal, the last story Charles Dickens would ever write before his death.']\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Diarmuid Lawrence'], 'Producers': ['BBC'], 'Starring': ['Matthew Rhys (\"Brothers & Sisters\")', 'Julia MacKenzie (\"Miss Marple\")']}\nGreat drama!  Don't miss this.\nWOW!  Great drama.\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Vince Gilligan', 'Thomas Schnauz', 'Peter Gould', 'Michael Morris', 'Adam Bernstein', 'Michelle MacLaren', 'Colin Bucksey', 'John Shiban', 'Larysa Kondracki', 'Terry McDonough'], 'Producers': ['Melissa Bernstein', 'Mark Johnson', 'Vince Gilligan', 'Peter Gould'], 'Studio': ['American Movie Classics (AMC)']}\nLOVE this and so does my 85-year-old-mother.  Right now, she is ill and this series makes her laugh and take her mind off her pains.  I know the writers have already thought of this, but I can't wait for the episode when Howard OR Chuck needs James's help so we can see what kind of a person James really is.  Let him show up the other two jerks.  TWO THUMBS UP.  Thanks for not dragging a romance into what should be kept an interesting comedy.  Kim is lovely, but I hope that part stays platonic.  GOOD LUCK WITH SEASON 2.\nGives my ailing mother a reprieve from her illness.  We both LOVE JIMMY\n{'Content advisory': ['Alcohol use', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Vince Gilligan', 'Thomas Schnauz', 'Peter Gould', 'Michael Morris', 'Adam Bernstein', 'Michelle MacLaren', 'Colin Bucksey', 'John Shiban', 'Larysa Kondracki', 'Terry McDonough'], 'Producers': ['Thomas Schnauz', 'Melissa Bernstein', 'Mark Johnson', 'Vince Gilligan', 'Peter Gould'], 'Studio': ['American Movie Classics (AMC)']}\nThis is the ONLY THING WORTH WATCHING on TV and has been the only thing for both seasons.  Unfortunately, I now must wait for season 3.  I'll have to go through the next 10 months without it.  KEEP up the good work, Jonathan, Bob, and Rhee.  I also like the other characters, the acting is very good, but I don't like the kind of characters they represent.  Howard is a p---k.  So is Chuck.  Both are great actors.\nKEEP up the good work, Jonathan\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Vince Gilligan', 'Thomas Schnauz', 'Peter Gould', 'Michael Morris', 'Adam Bernstein', 'Michelle MacLaren', 'Colin Bucksey', 'John Shiban', 'Larysa Kondracki', 'Terry McDonough'], 'Producers': ['Gennifer Hutchison', 'Thomas Schnauz', 'Melissa Bernstein', 'Mark Johnson', 'Vince Gilligan', 'Peter Gould']}\nAs everyone knows, this show is ADDICTIVE and once you watch it, there's no going back.  Even my 87-year-old mother watches it and tries to out-guess what is going to happen.  One question I would have:  Why didn't Kim hire Jimmy to be her paralegal?  In that role, he wouldn't be practicing.  But, it would destroy his attempt to get rid of his air time on TV.  GREAT JOB by all actors.  The writers are to be commended also.  We love those characters we are supposed to love and hate the ones we are supposed to (namely Hector, Chuck and Howard.)  But they still do a great job of acting.  In Episode 9, you almost (ALMOST) have to feel sorry for Chuck.  As brilliant an attorney as he is, he is turning into a truly pathetic creature, which is strange, now that he has licked his anti-electricity problem.\nWARNING !!!  ADDICTIVE !!!\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Kenneth Branagh'], 'Producers': ['Ridley Scott', 'Mark Gordon', 'Simon Kinberg', 'Kenneth Branagh', 'Judy Hofflund', 'Michael Schaefer'], 'Starring': ['Kenneth Branagh', 'Pen\u00e9lope Cruz', 'Johnny Depp'], 'Studio': ['Kinberg Genre;The Mark Gordon Company;Scott Free']}\nCompared to the 1974 version, the actors and their dialogues seemed somewhat anemic.  The 1974 version had meatier depths of character for all the travelers.  The photography was beautiful.  I found it more comical than a drama, mostly because of Branagh's overly long mustache.  Hard to make Poirot believable.  He is usually a fine actor and is taken seriously as an actor.  What was he thinking?  It was a humorous distraction.\nThe photography was beautiful.

Her many nominations by The Academy speak for itself.\nThis was very entertaining, but in real life, ...\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Jim Sheridan'], 'Producers': ['Noel Pearson', 'Rob Quigley'], 'Starring': ['Rooney Mara', 'Vanessa Redgrave', 'Eric Bana'], 'Studio': ['Vertical Entertainment']}\nPoignant, deep character development, played superbly by Redgrave (masterful performance) along with Rooney Mara (the young and long-suffering, misaligned woman who, through no fault of her own, was persecuted by not only the church, but the small-minds of her village.  As a result, she was made to waste her life in a madhouse, with the staff believing she had killed her baby.  After 50 years, the tale is finally revealed in a truth that could have given her a joyful life...but didn't until the very end.\nWonderful plot, portrayed by acting in which each character had a deeply developed character and personality.\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Kenneth Branagh'], 'Producers': ['Ridley Scott', 'Mark Gordon', 'Simon Kinberg', 'Kenneth Branagh', 'Judy Hofflund', 'Michael Schaefer'], 'Starring': ['Kenneth Branagh', 'Pen\u00e9lope Cruz', 'Johnny Depp'], 'Studio': ['Kinberg Genre;The Mark Gordon Company;Scott Free']}\nWhat can I say.  When compared to the Albert Finney version a few decades ago, this one doesn't leave the starting gate.  For starters, the Finney version built a depth of atmosphere within the first five minutes.  When Branagh appears, and although he is a fine actor, I had to laugh at his handlebar mustache, it was that comical.  None of the other actors in this version have the verve of the first one.  Sorry I paid to buy this to keep in my Amazon Video Library, but I was curious -- and sadly disappointed.\nDon't bother unless you are prepared to be unimpressed.\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Producers': ['Gennifer Hutchison', 'Thomas Schnauz', 'Melissa Bernstein', 'Mark Johnson', 'Vince Gilligan', 'Peter Gould'], 'Studio': ['American Movie Classics (AMC)']}\nI realize the writers have to lay a foundation and that's what they are doing.  The acting has not diminished.  I love all the characters, even Howard, who tends to be a jerk, but you have to have a bad guy, otherwise there is no tension.  I felt sorry for Jimmy when he heard Howard reading all of Chuck's outstanding accomplishments, his schooling, community service, debate team, etc.  I'm sure that made Jimmy feel pretty small in contrast.\nSeason 4, Episode 1 a little slow moving\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Leslie Iwerks'], 'Producers': ['Leslie Iwerks'], 'Starring': ['Kelsey Grammer', 'Roy Disney', 'Chuck Jones'], 'Studio': ['Walt Disney Pictures']}\nI have read several books and bios about Walt Disney and watched many filmed biographies of him.
