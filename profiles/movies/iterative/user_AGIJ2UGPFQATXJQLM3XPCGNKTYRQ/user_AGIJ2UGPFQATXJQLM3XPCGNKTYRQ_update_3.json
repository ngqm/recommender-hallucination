Unfortunately, I now must wait for season 3.  I'll have to go through the next 10 months without it.  KEEP up the good work, Jonathan, Bob, and Rhee.  I also like the other characters, the acting is very good, but I don't like the kind of characters they represent.  Howard is a p---k.  So is Chuck.  Both are great actors.\nReview Title: KEEP up the good work, Jonathan\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Right now, she is ill and this series makes her laugh and take her mind off her pains.  I know the writers have already thought of this, but I can't wait for the episode when Howard OR Chuck needs James's help so we can see what kind of a person James really is.  Let him show up the other two jerks.  TWO THUMBS UP.  Thanks for not dragging a romance into what should be kept an interesting comedy.  Kim is lovely, but I hope that part stays platonic.  GOOD LUCK WITH SEASON 2.\nGives my ailing mother a reprieve from her illness.  We both LOVE JIMMY\n{'Content advisory': ['Alcohol use', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Vince Gilligan', 'Thomas Schnauz', 'Peter Gould', 'Michael Morris', 'Adam Bernstein', 'Michelle MacLaren', 'Colin Bucksey', 'John Shiban', 'Larysa Kondracki', 'Terry McDonough'], 'Producers': ['Thomas Schnauz', 'Melissa Bernstein', 'Mark Johnson', 'Vince Gilligan', 'Peter Gould'], 'Studio': ['American Movie Classics (AMC)']}\nThis is the ONLY THING WORTH WATCHING on TV and has been the only thing for both seasons.
