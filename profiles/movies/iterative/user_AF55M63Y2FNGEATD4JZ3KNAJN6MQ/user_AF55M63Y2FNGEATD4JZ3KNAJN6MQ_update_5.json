Set in Ontario, Canada, the story centers on Victoria and Patrick McChesney, whose decision to adopt an orphaned Catholic girl ignites controversy in their Protestant community. Patrick is accused of using the adoption to appeal to Catholic voeters and advance his political career. Victoria contends with self-righteous whispers about the child's out-of-wedlock birth. And an event in the child's past leads to a fear-mongering change that she is a pyromaniac. Passions and accusations rage. But like a ship plying stormy seas, the McChesney' love for each other and their child will prevail.\"]\n{'Genre': 'Drama', 'Format': 'NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Linda Greer, Jean Negulesco, Agnes Moorehead, Walter Pidgeon, Archer MacDonald, Al Ferguson, Maudie Prickett, Eugene Bordon, Donna Corcoran, Patricia Tiernan, Nolan Leary, Margalo Gillmore, John Lupton, Robert Ross, Warren Farlow, George Davis, Max Willenz, Peter Roman, Philip Ober, Wayne Farlow, Matt Moore, Jack Bonigul, Tony Taylor, Gary Lee Jackson, Wilton Graff, Roger Moore, Howard Negley, Joann Arnold, Greer Garson, Ivan Triesault, Jill Martin, Owen McGiveney, Claude Guy, Michael Pate, Rudy Lee, Earl Lee, Alex Frazer, Philip Tonge, Ivis Goulding, Coral Hammond, Ida Moore, Rhys Williams, Perdita Chandler, Charles Watts, Vicki Joy Ereutzer, Kathleen Hartnagel, John Sherman, Ian Wolfe, Walter Baldwin, Arthur Shields, Victor Wood, Edwin H.
