Helping to define America's view of New Yorkers, the series gained endless fans over its nine season run. Though it wasn't the first show to assert the rudeness of Gotham's citizens, its characters are selfish to a fault--not that there's anything wrong with that. Self-obsessed comedian Jerry Seinfeld is joined in the cast by his neurotic ex-girlfriend, Elaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus); his chronically lazy pal, George (Jason Alexander); and Cosmo Kramer (Michael Richards), who takes the sitcom cliche of the weird neighbor to impressive new heights. Despite their faults (or perhaps because of them), they're some of the most hilariously watchable characters in television history. The entire series is presented here.\"]\n{'Genre': 'TV', 'Format': 'Box set, Closed-captioned, Color, DVD, Subtitled, NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Ruth Cohen, Michael Richards, Jerry Stiller, Estelle Harris, Heidi Swedberg, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Larry David, Norman Brenner, Jason Alexander, Jerry Seinfeld, Wayne Knight, Tom Cherones, Liz SheridanRuth Cohen, Michael Richards, Jerry Stiller, Estelle Harris, Heidi Swedberg, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Larry David, Norman Brenner, Jason Alexander, Jerry Seinfeld, Wayne Knight, Tom Cherones, Liz Sheridan  See more', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1), Unqualified', 'Number Of Discs': '33', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.33:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '11 x 7.5 x 3.75 inches; 5.88 Pounds', 'Director': 'Tom Cherones', 'Media Format': 'Box set, Closed-captioned, Color, DVD, Subtitled, NTSC', 'Run time': '68 hours and 41 minutes', 'Release date': 'November 6, 2007', 'Actors': 'Jerry Seinfeld, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Michael Richards, Jason Alexander, Ruth Cohen', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish, French, Portuguese', 'Studio': 'Sony Pictures Home Entertainment', 'Writers': 'Jerry Seinfeld, Larry David', 'Number of discs': '33'}\nI've been watching this show for years and have still never seen every episode, so it was a must have for me. Currently the price for this box set is too high, but I was lucky enough to score it on a lightning deal which definitely made it worth it.<br /><br />This is the best made box set I have seen/own. Not only is it sturdy (And extremely heavy) it doesn't do like most collector's sets and give you a nice box and crappy DVD cases, or vice versa. It also comes with a book about the show.

I grew up on the classics and felt that anything new would be horrid (ie Little Mermaid 2, Lady and the Tramp 2, etc). Because of that it took me months to even entertain the idea of watching this.<br /><br />With the nonsense background aside, I am in love with this movie. I've had it about two weeks and I've watched it probably 4 times, if not more. I don't often find movies I enjoy this much and can stand to watch this often, but it's definitely one of them. It's a fantastic movie, with what I thought was a very good plot and cast. I definite must, especially if you enjoy Nicholas Cage.\nA great live action Disney!\nRob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory: Season 5\nRob Dyrdek  (Actor),     Chris \"Drama\" Pfaff  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Sports\n['The death-defying comedy genius of Rob Dyrdek reaches unprecedented levels of inspiration and laughter in the fifth season of Rob Dyrdeks Fantasy Factory, along with familiar faces Chris Drama Pfaff, Christopher Big Black Boykin, Scott The Big Cat Pfaff, Chanel West Coast, and his Ridiculousness co-host Sterling Steelo Brim. Dyrdek shocks the world in the Season 5 premier when he dubs himself \"Supersonic Rob\" and attempts a car stunt achieved by few men in daredevil history: The Corkscrew Flip -- a literal 360 degree \"kickflip\" car jump. Rob\\'s other adventures include: inviting Johnny Knoxville and Chris Pontius (Jackass) to train Drama in the fine art of getting \"mowed down\" by an angry bull, becoming an ordained minister in order to marry his sister to her boyfriend, and creating Dyrdek Day -- an official Los Angeles City-certified holiday celebrating kindness, hugs, and random charity toward everyone. Rob also reinvents his pop icon alter-ego Bobby Light as an overweight superstar named \"Blobby\" Light, emerging from retirement to record a new single with Big Black and company titled, Chunky as Charged -- a celebration of all big people.

What I got from it, other than an awesome plot, is a crazy love for Lee Byung Hun. He's such an amazing actor and I never pass up the chance to see him in anything now. If you're going to watch it, watch it for him, or the fact that the plot is fantastic because you won't see T.O.P much. It's totally worth it though, great drama!\nLove this series!\nJay Park Concert: Live in Seoul\nFormat: DVD\nMovies & TV, Movies\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.56 x 5.51 x 0.87 inches; 11.99 Ounces', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Import, NTSC', 'Release date': 'May 7, 2013', 'Actors': 'Park, Jay', 'Studio': 'Ais', 'Number of discs': '2'}\nNot only do I have a copy of this for myself, but I also got one for my friend who tries to refute her love for Jay Park and loses at every turn. I do wish it were longer and the songs are all chopped together which is relatively annoying--I hate when a song I love comes on and oh hey sorry, it's over. If he had other concert DVDs out I probably would've chosen one of those over this due to that, but as it is, he doesn't. It's worth the purchase if you're a Jay Park fan.\nShe Loved It!\nFuturama: The Complete Series\nBilly West  (Actor),     Katey Sagal  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Studio Specials, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, All Fox Titles\n['As vast and hilarious as the universe itself, behold the utterly complete collection of FUTURAMA, the gravity defying, Emmy Award winning animated series from The Simpsons creator Matt Groening.

I don't personally buy box sets for extra features/just because it's a collector's item or pretty. I just like being able to get everything in a series for a decent price and that was definitely accomplished with this box set. I'll probably end up taking the cases out of the large box anyways as our movie shelf isn't built for the dimensions of the series box.\nGreat show!\nSherlock: Season 3\nBenedict Cumberbatch  (Actor),     Martin Freeman  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Special Interests\n['Sherlock: Season Three (BBC/DVD)', 'The question on everyone\u2019s lips is finally answered as the hugely popular Sherlock returns in three brand new action-packed adventures.
