I grew up on the classics and felt that anything new would be horrid (ie Little Mermaid 2, Lady and the Tramp 2, etc). Because of that it took me months to even entertain the idea of watching this.<br /><br />With the nonsense background aside, I am in love with this movie. I've had it about two weeks and I've watched it probably 4 times, if not more. I don't often find movies I enjoy this much and can stand to watch this often, but it's definitely one of them. It's a fantastic movie, with what I thought was a very good plot and cast. I definite must, especially if you enjoy Nicholas Cage.\nReview Title: A great live action Disney!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Helping to define America's view of New Yorkers, the series gained endless fans over its nine season run. Though it wasn't the first show to assert the rudeness of Gotham's citizens, its characters are selfish to a fault--not that there's anything wrong with that. Self-obsessed comedian Jerry Seinfeld is joined in the cast by his neurotic ex-girlfriend, Elaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus); his chronically lazy pal, George (Jason Alexander); and Cosmo Kramer (Michael Richards), who takes the sitcom cliche of the weird neighbor to impressive new heights. Despite their faults (or perhaps because of them), they're some of the most hilariously watchable characters in television history. The entire series is presented here.\"]\n{'Genre': 'TV', 'Format': 'Box set, Closed-captioned, Color, DVD, Subtitled, NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Ruth Cohen, Michael Richards, Jerry Stiller, Estelle Harris, Heidi Swedberg, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Larry David, Norman Brenner, Jason Alexander, Jerry Seinfeld, Wayne Knight, Tom Cherones, Liz SheridanRuth Cohen, Michael Richards, Jerry Stiller, Estelle Harris, Heidi Swedberg, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Larry David, Norman Brenner, Jason Alexander, Jerry Seinfeld, Wayne Knight, Tom Cherones, Liz Sheridan  See more', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1), Unqualified', 'Number Of Discs': '33', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.33:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '11 x 7.5 x 3.75 inches; 5.88 Pounds', 'Director': 'Tom Cherones', 'Media Format': 'Box set, Closed-captioned, Color, DVD, Subtitled, NTSC', 'Run time': '68 hours and 41 minutes', 'Release date': 'November 6, 2007', 'Actors': 'Jerry Seinfeld, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Michael Richards, Jason Alexander, Ruth Cohen', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish, French, Portuguese', 'Studio': 'Sony Pictures Home Entertainment', 'Writers': 'Jerry Seinfeld, Larry David', 'Number of discs': '33'}\nI've been watching this show for years and have still never seen every episode, so it was a must have for me. Currently the price for this box set is too high, but I was lucky enough to score it on a lightning deal which definitely made it worth it.<br /><br />This is the best made box set I have seen/own. Not only is it sturdy (And extremely heavy) it doesn't do like most collector's sets and give you a nice box and crappy DVD cases, or vice versa. It also comes with a book about the show.
