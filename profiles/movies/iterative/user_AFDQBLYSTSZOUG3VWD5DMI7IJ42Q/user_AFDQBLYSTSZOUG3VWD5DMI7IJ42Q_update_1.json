Helping to define America's view of New Yorkers, the series gained endless fans over its nine season run. Though it wasn't the first show to assert the rudeness of Gotham's citizens, its characters are selfish to a fault--not that there's anything wrong with that. Self-obsessed comedian Jerry Seinfeld is joined in the cast by his neurotic ex-girlfriend, Elaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus); his chronically lazy pal, George (Jason Alexander); and Cosmo Kramer (Michael Richards), who takes the sitcom cliche of the weird neighbor to impressive new heights. Despite their faults (or perhaps because of them), they're some of the most hilariously watchable characters in television history. The entire series is presented here.\"]\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'TV', 'Format': 'Box set, Closed-captioned, Color, DVD, Subtitled, NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Ruth Cohen, Michael Richards, Jerry Stiller, Estelle Harris, Heidi Swedberg, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Larry David, Norman Brenner, Jason Alexander, Jerry Seinfeld, Wayne Knight, Tom Cherones, Liz SheridanRuth Cohen, Michael Richards, Jerry Stiller, Estelle Harris, Heidi Swedberg, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Larry David, Norman Brenner, Jason Alexander, Jerry Seinfeld, Wayne Knight, Tom Cherones, Liz Sheridan  See more', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1), Unqualified', 'Number Of Discs': '33', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.33:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '11 x 7.5 x 3.75 inches; 5.88 Pounds', 'Director': 'Tom Cherones', 'Media Format': 'Box set, Closed-captioned, Color, DVD, Subtitled, NTSC', 'Run time': '68 hours and 41 minutes', 'Release date': 'November 6, 2007', 'Actors': 'Jerry Seinfeld, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Michael Richards, Jason Alexander, Ruth Cohen', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish, French, Portuguese', 'Studio': 'Sony Pictures Home Entertainment', 'Writers': 'Jerry Seinfeld, Larry David', 'Number of discs': '33'}\nReview Text: I've been watching this show for years and have still never seen every episode, so it was a must have for me. Currently the price for this box set is too high, but I was lucky enough to score it on a lightning deal which definitely made it worth it.<br /><br />This is the best made box set I have seen/own. Not only is it sturdy (And extremely heavy) it doesn't do like most collector's sets and give you a nice box and crappy DVD cases, or vice versa. It also comes with a book about the show. I can't wait until I have a chance to sit down and watch the entire series!\nReview Title: A must for Seinfeld fans!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
