Willie Stark (Penn) is an ordinary man from a rural town, demanding that crooked politicians and shady businessmen in Lousiana be held accountable for the collapse of a poorly built school. Urged to run for Governor by a dubious political advisor, Tiny Duffy (three-time Emmy(r) Award winner\", 'Amazon.com', 'Sean Penn gives another powerhouse performance in', \"All the King's Men\", \", leading a topnotch cast in writer-director Steven Zaillian's underrated adaptation of the\", 'Pulitzer prize-winning 1946 novel', 'by Robert Penn Warren. When you consider that the previous', '1949 film version', \"earned well-deserved Academy Awards for director Robert Rossen and actors Broderick Crawford and Mercedes McCambridge, it's no surprise that Zaillian's film was expected to earn similar acclaim, but lukewarm critical reception and disappointing box-office gave it the stigma of a noble failure. And while the film (which moves Warren's story from the Depression-era '30s to the early 1950s) suffers from uneven pacing, partial miscasting, and an occasional lack of dramatic tension, it still qualifies as a first-class production that resonates with the timeless relevance of Warren's piercing political classic. Like Broderick before him, Penn is riveting as Louisiana governor Willie Stark, an upstart political dynamo (freely inspired by controversial real-life Louisiana governor Huey P. Long) whose rise to power is ultimately doomed by corruption and betrayal.\", \"Jude Law costars as political reporter Jack Burden, our firsthand witness to Stark's rise and inevitable fall; his orbit of political insiders includes a corrupt judge (Anthony Hopkins) with a dark secret to hide; a longtime friend (Mark Ruffalo) and former lover (Kate Winslet) who fall victim to Stark's influence; and political staffers (James Gandolfini, Patricia Clarkson) who remain powerless against Stark's ill-fated populist juggernaut.

This outrageous comedy begins with a series of fake previews, each introducing one of the main characters in the film-proper (not that there\\'s anything proper about this film) and each bearing the familiar logo of a different motion picture studio: Universal, DreamWorks SKG, et al. Such playing fast and loose with corporate talismans verges on sacrilege, but it\\'s an index of how much le tout Tinseltown endorses the movie as a demented valentine to itself.

If you knew my mom you would know this is not her normal behavior. I had a feeling she would like it, but I didn't think she would ask to watch it this much. I really liked it too. I thought the acting was perfect. I loved the scenery and music in the start of the film. Yes it is not Green Gables but it never claimed to be. If you look on the cover you can figure that out.\nMy mom loved this!!!\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English'], 'Directors': ['---'], 'Studio': ['Line Upon Line Productions']}\nI want to recommend the movie The Bible vs The Book of Mormon.
