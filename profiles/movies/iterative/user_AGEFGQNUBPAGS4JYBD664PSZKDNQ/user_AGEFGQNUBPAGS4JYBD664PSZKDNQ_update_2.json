Both versions are worth seeing.\", \"Star Justine Waddell gives Tess more pluck and less innocence than Natassja Kinski does. She makes Tess a character to root for, which can lead to your own tragedy when working through Hardy's tale. The film doesn't have the drop-dead gorgeousness of Polanski's version but is quite beautiful. Director Ian Sharp keeps in line with Hardy's affection for rural settings and vistas.
