Palmer', 'Sofia Olsson Olsen'], 'Studio': ['Free To Choose Media']}\nWhat this movie tells us is the American political system is bogged down in politics and not working to improve our country. They, for the most part, those career politicians have lost sight of real life in America. They may never have known reality. They are not solving problems or issues. It's too slow and cumbersome. We need more control to the States and to non Government solutions. Let's start with school vouchers.\nHits on all the important points of economics\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Luke McManus'], 'Producers': ['Pierce Boyce', 'Eileen Seoighe'], 'Studio': ['Janson Media']}\nLove it and learned a great deal.\nVery interesting and unique\nCall of the Forest: The Forgotten Wisdom of Trees\nSpecial Interest, Documentary, Feel-good, Sweet\n['Take a walk in the woods with acclaimed Irish-Canadian scientist and author, Diana Beresford-Kroeger, as she reveals our profound human connection to the ancient & sacred northern forests and the essential role that they play in sustaining the health of our planet.

To understand the connection between the Forest and all living things is so important for all of us. To think about how areas have been completely ravaged of their forests is horrible. I will plant a tree or two every year. We must restore our planet. It does not matter what you believe as far as climate change. We cannot live with a destroyed planet and it starts with our forests.\nFantastic and sad at the same time. Please watch and learn. Share it too.\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium', 'Espa\u00f1ol', 'Fran\u00e7ais'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', 'Espa\u00f1ol', 'Fran\u00e7ais'], 'Directors': ['Julie Taymor'], 'Producers': ['Julie Taymor', 'Lynn Hendee'], 'Starring': ['Julianne Moore', 'Alicia Vikander', 'Timothy Hutton'], 'Studio': ['Roadside Attractions']}\nTrue to life as many of us in the movement did not support abortion as one of the principles. Women's health and birth control yes, but not abortion. I thank the writers for capturing this important point.  Abortion at the time was seen as an absolute LAST resort. Things need to be reevaluated now and provide far improved supports for women who choose life. Pro-life IS Pro Women.\nI enjoyed this movie because it really caught the essence of the movement\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Michael Pack'], 'Producers': ['Michael Pack'], 'Starring': ['Clarence Thomas', 'Joe Biden', 'Anita Hill'], 'Studio': ['Blue Fox Entertainment']}\nMuch better than expected.

More like a reality show than a documentary.
