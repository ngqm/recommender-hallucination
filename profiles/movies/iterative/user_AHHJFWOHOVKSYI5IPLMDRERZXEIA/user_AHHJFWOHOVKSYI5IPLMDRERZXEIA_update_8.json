To understand the connection between the Forest and all living things is so important for all of us. To think about how areas have been completely ravaged of their forests is horrible. I will plant a tree or two every year. We must restore our planet. It does not matter what you believe as far as climate change. We cannot live with a destroyed planet and it starts with our forests.\nReview Title: Fantastic and sad at the same time. Please watch and learn.
