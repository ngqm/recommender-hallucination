Casting a giant shadow over all is a blood-soaked king, Gem Saloon owner Al Swearengen (Ian McShane), possibly the best, most complex, and mesmerizing villain seen on TV in years. Each of these characters, and many others, will forge alliances and feuds, cope with disasters (such as smallpox), and move--almost invisibly but inexorably--toward some semblance of order and common cause. Making it all worthwhile is Milch's masterful dialogue--often profane, sometimes courtly and civilized, never perfunctory--and the brilliant acting of the aforementioned performers plus others.\", '--Tom Keogh']\n{'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Box set, Widescreen, Subtitled, Closed-captioned, Color, NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Ian McShane, Timothy Olyphant', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1), French (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo), Spanish (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo), Unqualified', 'Number Of Discs': '19', 'Runtime': '33 hours and 26 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.78:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.75 x 2 inches; 2 Pounds', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Box set, Widescreen, Subtitled, Closed-captioned, Color, NTSC', 'Run time': '33 hours and 26 minutes', 'Release date': 'December 9, 2008', 'Actors': 'Ian McShane, Timothy Olyphant', 'Subtitles': 'English', 'Studio': 'HBO Studios', 'Number of discs': '19'}\nThe Deadwood tv serial was a tremendous hit and we loved every episode so much that we jumped on the opportunity to own the entire series\nlove this\nThe Great Outdoors [DVD]\nDan Aykroyd  (Actor),     John Candy  (Actor),     Howard Deutch  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Action & Adventure\n['When an unannounced, uninvited and unwelcome family of fun-loving misfits converge upon a lakeside resort to join their relatives for a summer of relaxation, the result is anything but restful in this raucous comedy starring Dan Aykroyd and John Candy.It\\'s a vacationer\\'s worst nightmare, as wheeler-dealer Aykroyd, his sexually repressed wife and eerie twin daughters \"join\" the easygoing Candy and his straight-laced clan for a season of \"fun\" in the sun.
