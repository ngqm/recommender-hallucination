Cringely', 'Bill Fernandez'], 'Studio': ['PBS']}\nThis informative and interesting documentary of Steve Jobs was well worth the viewing. The interviews with his friends and associates offered a enlightening perspective on the man and his genius.  Particularly interesting was his relationship with Bill Gates, a genius as well.  From this doc's perspective, they enjoyed mutual respect and a kind of affection. The adversarial is not always liked, but Gates appeared to find a way around \"like\" and get to the more of Jobs.\nInformative and interesting!\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Rob Reiner'], 'Producers': ['Rob Reiner', 'Lori McCreary', 'Salli Newman', 'Nicolas Chartier', 'Alan Greisman', 'David Valdes'], 'Starring': ['Morgan Freeman', 'Virginia Madsen'], 'Studio': ['Magnolia Pictures']}\nEnjoyed the feel-good film.
