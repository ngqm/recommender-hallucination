  "reference_summary": "{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': [\"Mimi O'Connor\"], 'Producers': ['Ian Lynch', 'John Coffey', 'Jonathan Challis', 'Robert Strange', 'Stuart Carter', 'Susan Crook'], 'Starring': ['Dean Hovey', 'Robert X. Cringely', 'Bill Fernandez'], 'Studio': ['PBS']}\nThis informative and interesting documentary of Steve Jobs was well worth the viewing. The interviews with his friends and associates offered a enlightening perspective on the man and his genius.  Particularly interesting was his relationship with Bill Gates, a genius as well.  From this doc's perspective, they enjoyed mutual respect and a kind of affection. The adversarial is not always liked, but Gates appeared to find a way around \"like\" and get to the more of Jobs.\nInformative and interesting!\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Rob Reiner'], 'Producers': ['Rob Reiner', 'Lori McCreary', 'Salli Newman', 'Nicolas Chartier', 'Alan Greisman', 'David Valdes'], 'Starring': ['Morgan Freeman', 'Virginia Madsen'], 'Studio': ['Magnolia Pictures']}\nEnjoyed the feel-good film.  Sadly, most of these films don't include subtitles.  For folks who suffer a hearing impairment, Amazon is not the best place to rent films. Maybe subtitles are available but don't know how to get them. ???\nMorgan Freeman -- Oh Yeah!\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Ritesh Batra'], 'Producers': ['Shahnaab Alam', 'Marc Baschet', 'Benny Drechsel', 'Nina Lath Gupta', 'Arun Rangachari', 'Anurag Kashyap', 'Guneet Monga'], 'Starring': ['Irrfan Khan', 'Nimrat Kaur', 'Denzil Smith']}\nSlow moving but most interesting.
