  "reference_summary": "{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Daniel Sackheim', 'Peter Markle', 'David Straiton', 'Elodie Keene', 'Adam Arkin', 'Paul McCrane', 'John Behring', 'Frederick King Keller', 'John Dahl', 'David Semel'], 'Studio': ['NBC']}\nThe Life series was one of those quirky shows that allowed Damian Lewis to hone his skills. Skills which have proven to be superb in Homeland and Band of Brothers just to name two. Sadly Life only lasted 2 seasons, but it did give us two excellent actors in Lewis and Shahi. We can still enjoy both on the small screen today.\nLife and then some\nTotal Recall\nScience Fiction, Suspense, Compelling, Tense\n['A factory worker (Colin Farrell) becomes a hunted man after a procedure goes awry that would convert his dreams of life as a spy into real memories.']\n{'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Len Wiseman'], 'Producers': ['Neal H. Moritz', 'Toby Jaffe', 'Neal Moritz'], 'Starring': ['Colin Farrell', 'Leigh Folsom', 'Brian T. Delaney']}\nEnjoyed the twists that were different from the original and the Special Effects were excellent. The acting was so so but so was the acting in the original.\nGood Special effects sub-par acting\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['David Nutter', 'Alan Taylor', 'Alex Graves', 'Miguel Sapochnik', 'Mark Mylod', 'Jeremy Podeswa', 'Daniel Minahan', 'Alik Sakharov', 'Michelle MacLaren', 'Brian Kirk'], 'Producers': ['Mark Huffam', 'Carolyn Strauss', 'Joanna Burn', 'Frank Doelger', 'Guymon Casady', 'George R.R. Martin', 'Ralph Vicinanza', 'Vince Gerardis'], 'Starring': ['Sean Bean', 'Mark Addy', 'Peter Dinklage'], 'Studio': ['Discovery Global']}\nWas pleasantly surprised at the good flow of the movie story line in conjunction with the book. The gritty nature of the filming gave validity to the real nature of the times and made the story that much more compelling. Looking forward to the rest of the episodes in season 1.\nVery good at bringing the books to life\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Euros Lyn', 'Paul McGuigan'], 'Producers': ['Sue Vertue', 'Beryl Vertue', 'Steven Moffat', 'Mark Gatiss', 'Rebecca Eaton', 'Bethan Jones'], 'Starring': ['Benedict Cumberbatch', 'Martin Freeman'], 'Studio': ['BBC America']}\nIt is always hard to re-do a classic especially when your attempting to bring classic characters into the twenty first century. Sherlock succeeds in all aspects. It is a role attempted by many and grasped by few. Cumberbatch joins the few who really grasp the Baker Street sleuth's persona.\nExcellent series with quality actors\n{'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['John Moore'], 'Producers': ['Alex Young', 'Wyck Godfrey'], 'Starring': ['Bruce Willis', 'Jai Courtney', 'Sebastian Koch'], 'Studio': ['Fox']}\nThe special effects were as advertised, but the story was weak to the extreme. The movie was more for the action junkie than for the thoughtful viewer. I hope for the sake of Mr. Willis' career that he graciously turns down any producer that wants to do another installment.\nThe end of the road?\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Philip Martin'], 'Producers': ['Simon Moseley'], 'Starring': ['Kenneth Branagh', 'Sarah Smart', 'Jeany Spark']}\nWallander is a treat for those of us who want to have our gray mater tickled. A smart and complex inter-weaving of plots and subplots makes for great detective stories and character development of the finest kind. The cinematography is stunning and the supporting cast is gritty enough that they are believable. Dark detective work with excellent Ah Ha moments makes for a series that treats the viewer to a quality series to be viewed multiple times.\nDepressing, grinding, enlightening and superb\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English', 'English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Colm McCarthy', 'Anthony Byrne'], 'Producers': ['Andrew Lowe (Element Films)', 'Rob Pursey'], 'Starring': ['Own McDonnell', 'Ian McElhinney']}\nBy offering the viewer more than just shallow character development Single-Handed fleshes out the experience of law enforcement Irish style in a beautiful but rugged landscape. The main characters scrape against each other creating a tension that flows through each stories in the series. If your looking for the cookie cutter American T.V. police or detective stories you'll be wasting your time, but if instead you want something that pushes your mental mystery button Single- Handed may just your cup of tea.\nComplex characters with interlocking stories make this a good watch.\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': [\"Thaddeus O'Sullivan\", 'Charlie McCarthy'], 'Producers': ['Andrew Lowe', 'Rob Pursey'], 'Starring': ['Owen McDonnell', 'Matthew McNulty', 'Simone Lahbib'], 'Studio': ['Acorn Media']}\nSergeant Driscoll's character gains a number of layers in season two and the intensity of both the mysteries and the personal conflicts create a can't wait for the next episode mindset. I don't know if there will be a third season but the first two have been excellent in both material and scenery.\nYou'll Hate when this series comes to an end!\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Ben Taylor'], 'Producers': ['Rob Delaney', 'Sharon Horgan', 'Richard Allen-Turner', 'Kara Baker', 'Jon Thoday'], 'Starring': ['Sharon Horgan', 'Rob Delaney'], 'Studio': ['Amazon Studios']}\nWitty and fast paced sorry there was only one season. Looking forward to more.\nFive Stars\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['David Hare'], 'Producers': ['Bill Nighy', 'Nigel Marchant', 'Rebecca Eaton', 'Gareth Neame', 'David Barron', 'Christine Langan', 'Celia Duval', 'Scott Rudin', 'David Heyman'], 'Starring': ['Bill Nighy', 'Christopher Walken', 'Felicity Jones'], 'Studio': ['PBS']}\noutstanding watch really kept the mind working. The twists and turns are intellectually satisfying, and the cast is superb.\nMore than a spy story\nEx Machina\nScience Fiction, Suspense, Cerebral, Futuristic\n['A young programmer is selected to participate in a breakthrough experiment in artificial intelligence by evaluating the human qualities of a breathtaking female A.I.']\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Alex Garland'], 'Producers': ['Andrew Macdonald', 'Allon Reich'], 'Starring': ['Alicia Vikander', 'Domhnall Gleeson', 'Oscar Isaac']}\nMakes I Robot look like a kiddie movie. Character development is superb. You see the end game coming and you just can't get out of the way.\nCould this be the future?\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['David Koepp'], 'Producers': ['Andrew Lazar', 'Johnny Depp', 'Christi Dembrowski'], 'Starring': ['Johnny Depp', 'Gwyneth Paltrow', 'Ewan McGregor'], 'Studio': ['LIONSGATE']}\nFor those who remember the late Terry Thomas this was a romp down memory lane.
