Skills which have proven to be superb in Homeland and Band of Brothers just to name two. Sadly Life only lasted 2 seasons, but it did give us two excellent actors in Lewis and Shahi. We can still enjoy both on the small screen today.\nReview Title: Life and then some\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
