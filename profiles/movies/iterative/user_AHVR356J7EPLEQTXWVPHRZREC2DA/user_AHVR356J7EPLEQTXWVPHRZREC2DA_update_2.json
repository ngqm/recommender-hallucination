It's probably not the best TV series ever made but it's highly entertaining, witty and it also has it's serious moments, when meaningful things are said. Plus it has Stana Katic, whom I think is one of the most beautiful women on TV right now.\nReview Title: Hooked on Castle\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Who would not like Maggie Smith's character, or the beautiful daughters or the British accent. But in in the end this is just another melodrama. Only a very fine one. Enjoy while it lasts.\nTop Level Telenovela\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Rob Bowman', 'John Terlesky', 'Bill Roe', 'Bryan Spicer', 'Paul Holahan', 'Thomas J.
