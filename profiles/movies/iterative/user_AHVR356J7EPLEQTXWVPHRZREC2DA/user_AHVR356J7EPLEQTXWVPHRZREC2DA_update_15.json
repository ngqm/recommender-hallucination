Great performances by Cary Grant, James Mason and a very young Martin Landau. Eva Marie Saint also delivers a good performance, but not as good as other Hitchcock's &#34;blondes&#34;.

Who would not like Maggie Smith's character, or the beautiful daughters or the British accent. But in in the end this is just another melodrama. Only a very fine one.

For personal reasons that are too complicated to explain I missed the second half of the last season. Now, as a Prime member, I had the opportunity to watch the whole season again. I am still a fan, and as controversial as  it was at the time, I like the finale. Whatever happened to Tony and his family is left to the imagination of the viewer and we can think of any future we want for him without being disappointed. It was also bittersweet to see James Gandolfini delivering a perfect Tony. It is sad to realize the we will never see him again. Rest in peace James and thank you for Tony.\nThe show the redefined how we see mobsters\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Brian Percival', 'David Evans', 'Philip John', 'Andy Goddard', 'Catherine Morshead', 'Minkie Spiro', 'Brian Kelly', 'Michael Engler', 'Ben Bolt', 'Ashley Pearce'], 'Producers': ['Liz Trubridge'], 'Starring': ['Huge Bonneville', 'Michelle Dockery', 'Maggie Smith'], 'Studio': ['BritBox']}\nSuperb writing, perfect casting, what else could could you have for?\nperfect casting, what else could could you have for\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English', 'English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Dennis Smith', \"Terrence O'Hara\", 'Tony Wharmby', 'James Whitmore Jr.', 'Thomas J.
