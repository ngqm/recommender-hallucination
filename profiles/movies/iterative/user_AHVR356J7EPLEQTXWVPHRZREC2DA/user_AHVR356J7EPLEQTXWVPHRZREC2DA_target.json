For personal reasons that are too complicated to explain I missed the second half of the last season. Now, as a Prime member, I had the opportunity to watch the whole season again. I am still a fan, and as controversial as  it was at the time, I like the finale. Whatever happened to Tony and his family is left to the imagination of the viewer and we can think of any future we want for him without being disappointed. It was also bittersweet to see James Gandolfini delivering a perfect Tony. It is sad to realize the we will never see him again.
