Who would not like Maggie Smith's character, or the beautiful daughters or the British accent. But in in the end this is just another melodrama. Only a very fine one.

It's probably not the best TV series ever made but it's highly entertaining, witty and it also has it's serious moments, when meaningful things are said.
