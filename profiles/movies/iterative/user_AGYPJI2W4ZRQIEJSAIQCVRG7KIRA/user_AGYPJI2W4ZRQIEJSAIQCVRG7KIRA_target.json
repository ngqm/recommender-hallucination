So I clicked eject.  So I can't say how good the movie is but this DVD is horribly made.<br /><br />My DVD player is perfectly capable of remembering where it left off other DVDs, even weeks later.  The studio spent tons of money on the movie then apparently gave the DVD & its menus to be made by their unemployed nephew for $20.\nSo I can't say how good the movie is but this DVD is HORRIBLY made.\nArrival\nDrama, Science Fiction, Cerebral, Dreamlike\n['When mysterious spacecraft touch down across the globe, an elite team - led by expert translator Louise Banks (Academy Award nominee Amy Adams) - races against time to decipher their intent.']\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English (US) [CC]', 'English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['---'], 'Producers': ['Shawn Levy', 'Dan Levine', 'Aaron Ryder', 'David Linde'], 'Starring': ['Amy Adams', 'Jeremy Renner', 'Forest Whitaker']}\nFantastic movie.
