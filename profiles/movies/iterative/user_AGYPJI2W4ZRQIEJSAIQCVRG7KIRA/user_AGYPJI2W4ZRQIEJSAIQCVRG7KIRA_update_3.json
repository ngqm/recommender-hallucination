So I clicked eject.  So I can't say how good the movie is but this DVD is horribly made.<br /><br />My DVD player is perfectly capable of remembering where it left off other DVDs, even weeks later.  The studio spent tons of money on the movie then apparently gave the DVD & its menus to be made by their unemployed nephew for $20.\nReview Title: So I can't say how good the movie is but this DVD is HORRIBLY made.\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
