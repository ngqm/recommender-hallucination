It can be rather silly at times, with some classic B-movie antics, but it really does nail many aspects of social decline. Overall entertaining, with a few surprise laugh-out-loud moments.\nGreat social commentary, with some pretty funny moments!\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'frightening scenes', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Ridley Scott'], 'Producers': ['Gordon Carroll', 'David Giler', 'Walter Hill'], 'Starring': ['Tom Skerritt', 'Sigourney Weaver', 'John Hurt'], 'Studio': ['20TH CENTURY FOX']}\nA few of the effects are dated, but it is amazing how well this 1979 movie stands the test of time. I guess a great movie is always just that.\nThis classic stands the test of time\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Dan Trachtenberg'], 'Producers': ['J.

Abrams', 'Lindsey Weber', 'Bryan Burk', 'Drew Goddard', 'Matt Reeves'], 'Starring': ['John Goodman', 'Mary Elizabeth Winstead', 'John Gallagher Jr.'], 'Studio': ['Paramount Pictures']}\nVery exciting and suspenseful. Overall a good movie. Although my son disagrees with me, I thought the ending was kind of weak and could have been resolved better. The ending is a pretty jarring transition from the unreliable narrator, psychological suspense to a kind of action movie. I love the reality of the ending (the story line), I just don't think the movie pulls it off very well.\nVery suspenseful and exciting\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'frightening scenes', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Matt Reeves'], 'Producers': ['Sherryl Clark', 'Guy Riedel', 'J. J. Abrams', 'Bryan Burk'], 'Starring': ['Lizzy Caplan', 'Jessica Lucas', 'T.J. Miller'], 'Studio': ['Paramount Pictures Corp.']}\nGreat movie! It's exciting, suspenseful and really a well done movie. However, the entire movie is filmed in the &#34;amateur&#34;, shaky camera style. I was amazed that it did not make me nauseous, which this style often does, and I was surprised to find that I got so caught up in the story that I kind of forgot about the style. There are a few plot points that seem a little hard to believe, but overall a great and entertaining movie.\nGreat entertainment\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Hettie Macdonald', \"Daniel O'Hara\", 'Ed Bazalgette', 'Daniel Nettheim', 'Justin Molotnikov', 'Rachel Talalay'], 'Producers': ['Tracie Simpson', 'Derek Ritchie', 'Nikki Wilson', 'Peter Bennett'], 'Starring': ['Peter Capaldi', 'Jenna Coleman', 'Michelle Gomez'], 'Studio': ['BBC America']}\nCapaldi is not Matt Smith or David Tennant, but those are incredibly difficult acts to follow, and he does brings something, I'm just not quite sure how to define it...
