Overall a good movie. Although my son disagrees with me, I thought the ending was kind of weak and could have been resolved better. The ending is a pretty jarring transition from the unreliable narrator, psychological suspense to a kind of action movie. I love the reality of the ending (the story line), I just don't think the movie pulls it off very well.\nReview Title: Very suspenseful and exciting\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

It can be rather silly at times, with some classic B-movie antics, but it really does nail many aspects of social decline. Overall entertaining, with a few surprise laugh-out-loud moments.\nGreat social commentary, with some pretty funny moments!\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'frightening scenes', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Ridley Scott'], 'Producers': ['Gordon Carroll', 'David Giler', 'Walter Hill'], 'Starring': ['Tom Skerritt', 'Sigourney Weaver', 'John Hurt'], 'Studio': ['20TH CENTURY FOX']}\nA few of the effects are dated, but it is amazing how well this 1979 movie stands the test of time.
