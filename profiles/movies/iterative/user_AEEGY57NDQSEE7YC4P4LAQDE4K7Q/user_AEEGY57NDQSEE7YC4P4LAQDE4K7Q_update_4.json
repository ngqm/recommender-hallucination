  "reference_summary": "Toy Story & Toy Story 2 (2 Pack)\nRated:    G    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment, All Disney Titles\n['Product description', 'Toy Story & Toy Story 2 (2 Pack', 'Amazon.com', 'Toy Story', 'There is greatness in film that can be discussed, dissected, and talked about late into the night. Then there is genius that is right in front of our faces--we smile at the spell it puts us into and are refreshed, and nary a word needs to be spoken. This kind of entertainment is what they used to call \"movie magic,\" and there is loads of it in this irresistible computer animation feature. Just a picture of these bright toys on the cover of', 'Toy Story', \"looks intriguing, reawakening the kid in us. Filmmaker John Lasseter's shorts (namely\", 'Knickknack', 'and', 'Tin Toy', ', which can be found on the Pixar video', 'Tiny Toy Stories', ') illustrate not only a technical brilliance but also a great sense of humor--one in which the pun is always intended. Lasseter thinks of himself as a storyteller first and an animator second, much like another film innovator, Walt Disney.', \"Lasseter's story is universal and magical: what do toys do when they're not played with? Cowboy Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks), Andy's favorite bedroom toy, tries to calm the other toys (some original, some classic) during a wrenching time of year--the birthday party, when newer toys may replace them. Sure enough, Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) is the new toy that takes over the throne. Buzz has a crucial flaw, though--he believes he's the real Buzz Lightyear, not a toy. Bright and cheerful,\", 'Toy Story', 'is much more than a 90-minute commercial for the inevitable bonanza of Woody and Buzz toys. Lasseter further scores with perfect voice casting, including Don Rickles as Mr.\\xa0Potato Head and Wallace Shawn as a meek dinosaur. The director-animator won a special Oscar for \"the development and inspired application of techniques that have made possible the first feature-length computer-animated film.\" In other words, the movie is great.', '--Doug Thomas', 'Toy Story 2', 'John Lasseter and his gang of high-tech creators at Pixar create another entertainment for the ages. Like the few great movie sequels,', 'Toy Story\\xa02', \"comments on why the first one was so wonderful while finding a fresh angle worthy of a new film. The craze of toy collecting becomes the focus here, as we find out Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) is not only a beloved toy to Andy but also a rare doll from a popular '60s children's show. When a greedy collector takes Woody, Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) launches a rescue mission with Andy's other toys. To say more would be a crime because this is one of the most creative and smile-inducing films since, well, the first\", 'Toy Story', '.', \"Although the toys look the same as in the 1994 feature, Pixar shows how much technology has advanced: the human characters look more human, backgrounds are superior, and two action sequences that book-end the film are dazzling. And it's a hoot for kids and adults. The film is packed with spoofs, easily accessible in-jokes, and inspired voice casting (with newcomer Joan Cusack especially a delight as Cowgirl Jessie). But as the Pixar canon of films illustrates, the filmmakers are storytellers first. Woody's heart-tugging predicament can easily be translated into the eternal debate of living a good life versus living forever.\", 'Toy Story\\xa02', 'also achieved something in the U.S. two other outstanding 1999 animated features (', 'The Iron Giant', ',', 'Princess Mononoke', ') could not: it became a huge box-office hit.', '--Doug Thomas']\n{'Format': 'Color, Widescreen, NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Toy Story 2pak', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1 EX), English (THX Surround EX)', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'G (General Audience)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.25 x 1 inches; 6.4 Ounces', 'Media Format': 'Color, Widescreen, NTSC', 'Release date': 'October 17, 2000', 'Actors': 'Toy Story 2pak', 'Studio': 'Disney/Pixar', 'Number of discs': '2'}\nThis is hands down the best Disney Movie.
