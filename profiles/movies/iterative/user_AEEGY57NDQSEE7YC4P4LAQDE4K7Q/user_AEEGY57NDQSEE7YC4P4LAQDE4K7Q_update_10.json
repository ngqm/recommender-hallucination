Elina travels with her puffball Bibble to Fairy School at the magnificent Crystal Palace. There, she meets the other fairy apprentices, chosen to learn the annual Flight of Spring and magically create the first rainbow of the season. But when the evil Laverna tries to stop the Flight, threatening to plunge Fairytopia into ten years of bitter winter, Elina and her new friends must learn that \"together we are strong.\" But are they strong enough to defeat Laverna and bring the rainbow to life? And will Bibble, who has a loose tooth, fall in love with the adorable puffball Dizzle?', 'Amazon.com', 'Believing in oneself can be difficult, even with the support of friends. The formerly wingless fairy Elina has saved Fairytopia more than once, proving herself against Fungus Maximus and turning the evil Laverna into a frog in', 'Barbie Fairytopia', 'and', 'Barbie Fairytopia--Mermaidia', \", but she still questions her own abilities when Guardian Azura selects her to become her apprentice and learn the all-important flight of spring--a ritual which ensures another year of vitality in Fairytopia. The taunts and snobby attitudes of her fellow apprentices serve to further undercut Elina's self-esteem, but she vows to do her best to master the flight of spring and soon proves worthy of her appointment. When the trickery of Laverna threatens to stop the flight of spring and destroy Fairytopia forever, it falls to the new apprentices to save Fairytopia. Of course, Elina will play a pivotal role in the group's eventual success or failure. Prepubescent attitudes and shallowness reign among most of the apprentices, but most eventually see the error of their ways and the clear message is the importance of believing in oneself.

I wasn't really looking for life's lessons in a Barbie movie, so I wasn't disappointed.  There is always some good, some bad & lots of magic. Spending time listening to my grand daughters school me on Barbie - that's all the life's lessons I need. It holds their interest. I think the movie has met it's expectations. I would recommend this movie & series to those that are new to the Barbie series. If you're not new to these movies, you know what to expect.\nReview Title: Fairytopia - more magic\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Filmmaker John Lasseter's shorts (namely\", 'Knickknack', 'and', 'Tin Toy', ', which can be found on the Pixar video', 'Tiny Toy Stories', ') illustrate not only a technical brilliance but also a great sense of humor--one in which the pun is always intended. Lasseter thinks of himself as a storyteller first and an animator second, much like another film innovator, Walt Disney.', \"Lasseter's story is universal and magical: what do toys do when they're not played with? Cowboy Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks), Andy's favorite bedroom toy, tries to calm the other toys (some original, some classic) during a wrenching time of year--the birthday party, when newer toys may replace them. Sure enough, Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) is the new toy that takes over the throne. Buzz has a crucial flaw, though--he believes he's the real Buzz Lightyear, not a toy. Bright and cheerful,\", 'Toy Story', 'is much more than a 90-minute commercial for the inevitable bonanza of Woody and Buzz toys.

If one has not seen a Christmas Carol in one version or another, this is just as good as the adult versions, without the ghosts!! The colors are great; the music calm.

I enjoy the movie, they enjoy the movie...so the movie met it's goal. You won't be disappointed.

I feel the movie has met it's expectations when little girls get up and dance & sing and enjoy the movie. the music is nice, calm, the dance steps easy to watch & follow. If you don't care for Barbie, no amount of reviews will make you change your mind. But if your little girls like singing, dancing, colorful images, this is another movie to add to your collection. Life is short; get your popcorn & lemonade and take time for the little ones.\nBarbie - Dancing again!!\nBarbie Fairytopia - Magic of the Rainbow\nKelly Sheridan  (Actor),     Lee Tockar  (Actor),     William Lau  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Animation\n['Product Description', 'Join Barbie as Elina in an all-new Fairytopia adventure! Elina travels with her puffball Bibble to Fairy School at the magnificent Crystal Palace. There, she meets the other fairy apprentices, chosen to learn the annual Flight of Spring and magically create the first rainbow of the season. But when the evil Laverna tries to stop the Flight, threatening to plunge Fairytopia into ten years of bitter winter, Elina and her new friends must learn that \"together we are strong.\" But are they strong enough to defeat Laverna and bring the rainbow to life? And will Bibble, who has a loose tooth, fall in love with the adorable puffball Dizzle?', 'Amazon.com', 'Believing in oneself can be difficult, even with the support of friends. The formerly wingless fairy Elina has saved Fairytopia more than once, proving herself against Fungus Maximus and turning the evil Laverna into a frog in', 'Barbie Fairytopia', 'and', 'Barbie Fairytopia--Mermaidia', \", but she still questions her own abilities when Guardian Azura selects her to become her apprentice and learn the all-important flight of spring--a ritual which ensures another year of vitality in Fairytopia. The taunts and snobby attitudes of her fellow apprentices serve to further undercut Elina's self-esteem, but she vows to do her best to master the flight of spring and soon proves worthy of her appointment. When the trickery of Laverna threatens to stop the flight of spring and destroy Fairytopia forever, it falls to the new apprentices to save Fairytopia. Of course, Elina will play a pivotal role in the group's eventual success or failure. Prepubescent attitudes and shallowness reign among most of the apprentices, but most eventually see the error of their ways and the clear message is the importance of believing in oneself.

I wasn't really looking for life's lessons in a Barbie movie, so I wasn't disappointed.  There is always some good, some bad & lots of magic. Spending time listening to my grand daughters school me on Barbie - that's all the life's lessons I need. It holds their interest. I think the movie has met it's expectations. I would recommend this movie & series to those that are new to the Barbie series. If you're not new to these movies, you know what to expect.\nFairytopia - more magic",
