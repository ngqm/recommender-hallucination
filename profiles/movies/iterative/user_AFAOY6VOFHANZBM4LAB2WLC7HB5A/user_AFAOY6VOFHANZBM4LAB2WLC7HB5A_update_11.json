Surely there are better ways to transmit sensitive information, but since this is really just a conventional thriller with near-future design and spiffy special effects, Gibson and New York artist Robert Longo (making his directorial debut) are more interested in surface gloss and cyberpunk atmosphere.

It's hard not to be dazzled by supporting casts that include Tara Fitzgerald, Robert Powell, Simon Callow, Joanna Lumley, Ian Richardson, Jane Asher, Miriam Margolyes, Tim McInnerny, Herbert Lom, and Jenny Agutter, all nestled into gorgeous, post-World War II backdrops, usually in the English countryside.\", 'This boxed set includes \"The Murder at the Vicarage,\" based on Christie\\'s 1930 book about the killing of one hugely unlikable Colonel Protheroe (Derek Jacobi) in Jane Marple\\'s pretty home village of St. Mary Mead. Typically, there is no end of likely suspects, but what makes the investigation unusual is a pair of competing confessions from two illicit lovers (Jason Flemyng, Janet McTeer). Stephen Tompkinson (', 'Ballykissangel', ') is very good as a police inspector who slowly develops admiration for Miss Marple\\'s keen mind. \"The Body in the Library\" finds Marple aiding the brassy Dolly Bantry (Lumley) after the latter finds the body of an unknown woman in her library. Callow is wonderful as another cop who initially underestimates the heroine\\'s gifts. \"A Murder Is Announced,\" in which a killing is advertised before it happens, and \"4:50 from Paddington,\" about a murder without a body, round out the set with imaginative plots and memorable performances.

Dawn French, Martin Kemp, and Geraldine Chaplin also star in the tale, which involves an old troupe of actors, a jewelry theft, and a very surprising conclusion. \"By the Pricking of My Thumbs\" concerns the disappearance of a doddering old woman who leaves behind a strange, spooky painting of a cottage in the woods, an unnerving figure lurking in the structure\\'s window.

Arkady is truthful to himself and even at the risk of loosing his life he is determined not to give in to the very corrupt system.  He is tough and bruised.
