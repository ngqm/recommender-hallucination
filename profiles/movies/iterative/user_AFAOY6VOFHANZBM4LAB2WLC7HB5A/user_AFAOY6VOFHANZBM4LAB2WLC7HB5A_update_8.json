First you have to ask yourself why valuable top-secret electronic data would be stored in the \"wet-wired\" brain of a human courier (played by Keanu Reeves), who then transports the data from China to New Jersey as part of his last, most dangerous assignment. Surely there are better ways to transmit sensitive information, but since this is really just a conventional thriller with near-future design and spiffy special effects, Gibson and New York artist Robert Longo (making his directorial debut) are more interested in surface gloss and cyberpunk atmosphere. On that level the movie\\'s fairly engaging, and Japanese film star Takeshi Kitano makes a pretty good villain, tracking Reeves down for the information in his data-packed brain. The movie also boasts an eclectic gallery of supporting players including rapper Ice-T, performance artist and rocker Henry Rollins, beefcake actor Dolph Lundgren, and transcontinental oddball Udo Kier.

The luminous Geraldine McEwan (', 'Vanity Fair', \"), following in the footsteps of Helen Hayes, Angela Lansbury, Margaret Rutherford, and others, essays Agatha Christie's aging, amateur sleuth as a discreet observer, knowing friend, and judicious dispenser of wisdom during murder investigations. But what really makes these crisp adaptations a delight is the endless parade of familiar actors playing those numerous suspects, baffled police, and innocent observers who routinely populate Christie's glossy, whodunit landscapes. It's hard not to be dazzled by supporting casts that include Tara Fitzgerald, Robert Powell, Simon Callow, Joanna Lumley, Ian Richardson, Jane Asher, Miriam Margolyes, Tim McInnerny, Herbert Lom, and Jenny Agutter, all nestled into gorgeous, post-World War II backdrops, usually in the English countryside.\", 'This boxed set includes \"The Murder at the Vicarage,\" based on Christie\\'s 1930 book about the killing of one hugely unlikable Colonel Protheroe (Derek Jacobi) in Jane Marple\\'s pretty home village of St. Mary Mead. Typically, there is no end of likely suspects, but what makes the investigation unusual is a pair of competing confessions from two illicit lovers (Jason Flemyng, Janet McTeer). Stephen Tompkinson (', 'Ballykissangel', ') is very good as a police inspector who slowly develops admiration for Miss Marple\\'s keen mind. \"The Body in the Library\" finds Marple aiding the brassy Dolly Bantry (Lumley) after the latter finds the body of an unknown woman in her library. Callow is wonderful as another cop who initially underestimates the heroine\\'s gifts. \"A Murder Is Announced,\" in which a killing is advertised before it happens, and \"4:50 from Paddington,\" about a murder without a body, round out the set with imaginative plots and memorable performances. Don\\'t miss the special featurette in which McEwan and others talk about the endless appeal of Miss Marple.', '--Tom Keogh', 'Review', 'Lively scripting, crisp direction, and evocative design...

As with series 1, the quartet of mysteries in series 2, set shortly after World War II, are ensemble affairs filled out by such familiar faces as Timothy Dalton, Charles Dance, Greta Scacchi, Anthony Andrews, Patricia Hodge, and Imogen Stubbs.

Problem is, Gwenda has only recently moved to Britain for the first time in her life, after growing up in India. Dawn French, Martin Kemp, and Geraldine Chaplin also star in the tale, which involves an old troupe of actors, a jewelry theft, and a very surprising conclusion. \"By the Pricking of My Thumbs\" concerns the disappearance of a doddering old woman who leaves behind a strange, spooky painting of a cottage in the woods, an unnerving figure lurking in the structure\\'s window.

Miss Marple, observing the tragic effects of these missives on relationships and reputations, is practically in the background in this story, watching closely as a nihilistic young man (James D\\'Arcy) comes out of his cynical, alcohol-laced haze to investigate the source of so much misery. (Bonus: director Ken Russell appears as the local, red-cheeked vicar.) Finally, \"The Sittaford Mystery\" finds Timothy Dalton playing a likely prospect to become prime minister, until he\\'s stabbed to death following a s\u00e9ance.

The detective Arkady is an extremely convincing character.  He doesn't quite fit in with the party, but he is totally dedicated to his job.  The movie in part fails because William Hurt cannot carry the role.

Arkady is truthful to himself and even at the risk of loosing his life he is determined not to give in to the very corrupt system.  He is tough and bruised.  Not a hero, but also not willing to lie down. William Hurt seems lethargic in the role.  He does not have any depth.  He is not a man of passion.  He just exists.  He is not easy to identify with.
