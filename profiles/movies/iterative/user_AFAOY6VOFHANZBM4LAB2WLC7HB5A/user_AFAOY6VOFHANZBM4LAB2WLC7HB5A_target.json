Surely there are better ways to transmit sensitive information, but since this is really just a conventional thriller with near-future design and spiffy special effects, Gibson and New York artist Robert Longo (making his directorial debut) are more interested in surface gloss and cyberpunk atmosphere. On that level the movie\\'s fairly engaging, and Japanese film star Takeshi Kitano makes a pretty good villain, tracking Reeves down for the information in his data-packed brain.

It's hard not to be dazzled by supporting casts that include Tara Fitzgerald, Robert Powell, Simon Callow, Joanna Lumley, Ian Richardson, Jane Asher, Miriam Margolyes, Tim McInnerny, Herbert Lom, and Jenny Agutter, all nestled into gorgeous, post-World War II backdrops, usually in the English countryside.\", 'This boxed set includes \"The Murder at the Vicarage,\" based on Christie\\'s 1930 book about the killing of one hugely unlikable Colonel Protheroe (Derek Jacobi) in Jane Marple\\'s pretty home village of St. Mary Mead. Typically, there is no end of likely suspects, but what makes the investigation unusual is a pair of competing confessions from two illicit lovers (Jason Flemyng, Janet McTeer). Stephen Tompkinson (', 'Ballykissangel', ') is very good as a police inspector who slowly develops admiration for Miss Marple\\'s keen mind. \"The Body in the Library\" finds Marple aiding the brassy Dolly Bantry (Lumley) after the latter finds the body of an unknown woman in her library. Callow is wonderful as another cop who initially underestimates the heroine\\'s gifts. \"A Murder Is Announced,\" in which a killing is advertised before it happens, and \"4:50 from Paddington,\" about a murder without a body, round out the set with imaginative plots and memorable performances.

As with series 1, the quartet of mysteries in series 2, set shortly after World War II, are ensemble affairs filled out by such familiar faces as Timothy Dalton, Charles Dance, Greta Scacchi, Anthony Andrews, Patricia Hodge, and Imogen Stubbs.

Dawn French, Martin Kemp, and Geraldine Chaplin also star in the tale, which involves an old troupe of actors, a jewelry theft, and a very surprising conclusion. \"By the Pricking of My Thumbs\" concerns the disappearance of a doddering old woman who leaves behind a strange, spooky painting of a cottage in the woods, an unnerving figure lurking in the structure\\'s window.

The detective Arkady is an extremely convincing character.  He doesn't quite fit in with the party, but he is totally dedicated to his job.  The movie in part fails because William Hurt cannot carry the role.

Arkady is truthful to himself and even at the risk of loosing his life he is determined not to give in to the very corrupt system.  He is tough and bruised.  Not a hero, but also not willing to lie down. William Hurt seems lethargic in the role.  He does not have any depth.  He is not a man of passion.  He just exists.  He is not easy to identify with.

Spend a day in the office with these coworkers and you can't help but laugh at the unrestrained dialogue that is heard at all times.  Imagine a job at a US corporation or at a government office where being politically correct in what you say is not the norm.  For us who live in a world where lawsuits threaten us for any politically incorrect statement or insunation that may transpire, or where the possibility of lossing a job is very real if acceptable language is not kept, it is extremely hilarious to see how coworkers behave in an environment where these constraints are non- existant.  Seeing this alone is worth the price of admission!  This is a very different culture with personalities that portray a great deal of passion continuously.  You would think that they would become quite caloused in this environment, and yet quite the opposite is the case.  Their extreme passions make them very vulnerable.

Lovely locations, but not much sense.  An American girl arrives in Paris to console her sister that is being abandoned by her husband for another woman.  The newly arrived sister then promptly accepts an invitation to be a mistress to another married man.  How can this possibly be considered a comedy?  Very humiliating for both American girls.  They are both meant to look like dumb American blondes.  The rest of the girls' American family finally arrive in Paris to see what can be done.  But all that they can come up with is to thank the philandering husbands mother for accepting them for lunch in their lovely country estate, and enjoy wonderful meals at restaurants that are outrageously expensive.  One ridiculous scene even pokes fun at the fact that Americans are too stupid to even know that the 17% automatic gratuity charge at the end of the meal requires an additional tip because that is the right thing to do.  The Americans feel that 17% on a 900.00 meal is tip enough.  Stupid story.  Not very funny.

The director in this work strolls so far in attempting to put a new spin on the old classic that he, at least for this critic, infuriates more than delights his audience.  Al Pacino was quite innovative in his presentation of Looking for Richard.  He moves the setting to modern day New York, and begins a discussion on Shakespeare while at the same time presenting snippets of the play performed by well known actors.  The results of Pacino's efforts are extremely gratifying because he has presented a classic work and has involved his audience in assessing not only the work but also has shifted the focus from the presentation to an honest discussion as to why the work means what it does to the modern day audience.  In Branagh's case the director takes the work of the playwright and is so distracting in his presentation that the audience is not only not captivated by the work but is actually repulsed by the many distractions in the presentation.

The work's shocking music and dance provoked a riot that evening and soon afterwards was recognized as perhaps the most revolutionary piece of the twentieth century.

He successfuly disected the Rite stylistically, thematically, and clearly underscored his understanding as to how the work was created, including the root influences from the traditional sources.<br />The bluray included performances of the Firebird Suite and the complete Rite of Spring.  The sound was spectacular.  The SanFrancisco symphony orchestra made me a believer that this was probably the best performance that I have ever heard.  It was great to also here the musicians give their takes on their individual roles in the work.<br />MTT also addressed how the Parisians reacted to the work, and how the ballet may have also played a role in the audiences response.<br />This is an incredible Bluray worth every penny.
