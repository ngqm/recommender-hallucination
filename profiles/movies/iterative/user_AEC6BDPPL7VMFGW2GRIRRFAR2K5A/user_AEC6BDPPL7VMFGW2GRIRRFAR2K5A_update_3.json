The other picture, slated to star Robert Redford and Jodie Foster, fell through. The premise of', 'Outbreak', \", which owes something to Elia Kazan's 1950 plague-scare movie,\", 'Panic in the Streets', \", is as terrifying as it is timely. As developers slash their way deeper into the previously unexplored tropical rainforests, they are exposed to radically new forms of life, including diseases, that in these days of commonplace international travel could turn into deadly epidemics almost before we know it. Hoffman's character and his estranged wife (Rene Russo) are disease experts called in to identify the unknown killer, which was carried into the country by an illegally smuggled monkey. The best sequence shows the disease spreading--through recycled air on a passenger jet, or a sneeze in a crowded movie theater. The final chase is pretty conventional, but the cast is terrific, including Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, Donald Sutherland, Cuba Gooding Jr., J.T. Walsh, and Zakes Mokae.\", '--Jim Emerson']\n{'Aspect Ratio': '1.85:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.38 x 0.6 inches; 4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'MFR085391363224#VG', 'Director': 'Wolfgang Petersen', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Color, Full Screen, Widescreen, NTSC', 'Run time': '2 hours and 7 minutes', 'Release date': 'May 21, 1997', 'Actors': 'Dustin Hoffman, Rene Russo, Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, Cuba Gooding Jr.', 'Dubbed': 'French', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish, French', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1), French (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround)', 'Studio': 'Warner Home Video', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nGreat movie with an excellent cast.\nFour Stars\nThe Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (Extended Edition) (Blu-ray)\nIan McKellen  (Actor),     Martin Freeman  (Actor),     Peter Jackson  (Director, Producer, Writer)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG-13    Format: Blu-ray\nMovies & TV, Blu-ray, Movies\n['Join Peter Jackson on the Journey to the World\u2019s Greatest Adventure Three-disc Extended Edition includes 13 minutes of revealing never-before-seen film footage and nearly 9 hours of fascinating in-depth looks at the production.']\n{'Brand': 'NEW LINE HOME VIDEO', 'Package Type': 'Standard Packaging', 'Number of Items': '3', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 5.6 Ounces', 'Item model number': '27724716', 'Director': 'Peter Jackson', 'Media Format': 'Blu-ray, Blu-ray, NTSC', 'Run time': '3 hours and 2 minutes', 'Release date': 'November 5, 2013', 'Actors': 'Ian McKellen, Martin Freeman, Richard Armitage, James Nesbitt, Ken Stott', 'Producers': 'Peter Jackson, Alan Horn, Toby Emmerich, Fran Walsh, Carolynne Cunningham', 'Studio': 'WarnerBrothers', 'Writers': 'Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Guillermo del Toro', 'Number of discs': '3'}\nGreat movies based on the beloved J.
