So far, I like it.  However, the quality of the video is not what it should be.  Yes, this is an older series, but I have DVD's of much older series that look far superior.  I don't think any effort was taken to improve the picture quality by Mill Creek Entertainment.  For that reason I have deducted the one star.\nReview Title: Good, except for picture quality....\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I was so happy to see it finally release on DVD.  However, Warner Brothers could have done a much better job on the DVD.  It is shown in a 2.35:1 widescreen format.  I believe that Amazon said 1.78:1, which is incorrect.  The case says remastered, but I found the quality of the picture way below what it should be.  The picture is grainy and the sound is only so-so.  For the price, I was expecting better.  There are NO SUBTITLES.  You would think if it was \"remastered\" they could at least add that feature.  Having said all this, the movie is still a hoot.  Glad to add it to my dvd collection.  They just don't make them this entertaining anymore.\nWB could have done better!\nWKRP in Cincinnati: The Complete Series [DVD]\nHoward Hesseman  (Actor),     Frank Bonner  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Comedy\n['Product Description', \"Pairing an impeccable ensemble cast with hilarious wit and popular tunes, WKRP in Cincinnati celebrated four amazing seasons, making it the quintessential situation comedy for any music lover!

Too many of the Shout Factory TV series releases video and sound quality have been poor.
