Hollywood brought audiences to atten-hut! in the 1950s and '60s with a string of military comedies like Mr. Roberts, Operation Petticoat, Ensign Pulver, No Time for Sergeants and this splash into the typing pool of dry-land sailors -- a Navy publicity team in the World War II Pacific. Glenn Ford, who appeared in a fistful of the era's service comedies, stars as a lieutenant with a knack for PR activities like placating big shots, calming romantic waters, deflating puffed-up journalists and puffing a profane-mouthed gob into the public's idea of the perfect enlisted man.

I was so happy to see it finally release on DVD.  However, Warner Brothers could have done a much better job on the DVD.  It is shown in a 2.35:1 widescreen format.  I believe that Amazon said 1.78:1, which is incorrect.  The case says remastered, but I found the quality of the picture way below what it should be.  The picture is grainy and the sound is only so-so.  For the price, I was expecting better.  There are NO SUBTITLES.  You would think if it was \"remastered\" they could at least add that feature.  Having said all this, the movie is still a hoot.  Glad to add it to my dvd collection.  They just don't make them this entertaining anymore.\nReview Title: WB could have done better!\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
