Glenn Ford, who appeared in a fistful of the era's service comedies, stars as a lieutenant with a knack for PR activities like placating big shots, calming romantic waters, deflating puffed-up journalists and puffing a profane-mouthed gob into the public's idea of the perfect enlisted man.

I was so happy to see it finally release on DVD.  However, Warner Brothers could have done a much better job on the DVD.  It is shown in a 2.35:1 widescreen format.  I believe that Amazon said 1.78:1, which is incorrect.  The case says remastered, but I found the quality of the picture way below what it should be.  The picture is grainy and the sound is only so-so.  For the price, I was expecting better.  There are NO SUBTITLES.  You would think if it was \"remastered\" they could at least add that feature.  Having said all this, the movie is still a hoot.  Glad to add it to my dvd collection.  They just don't make them this entertaining anymore.\nWB could have done better!\nWKRP in Cincinnati: The Complete Series [DVD]\nHoward Hesseman  (Actor),     Frank Bonner  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Comedy\n['Product Description', \"Pairing an impeccable ensemble cast with hilarious wit and popular tunes, WKRP in Cincinnati celebrated four amazing seasons, making it the quintessential situation comedy for any music lover!

Too many of the Shout Factory TV series releases video and sound quality have been poor.  I just watched a video teaser on the Shout website and if this is the same quality as the actual release, we are all in for a real treat.  This looks so much better than the original TV broadcasts.
