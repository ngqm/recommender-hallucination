Chris' determination finally pays off when he lands an unpaid internship in a brutally competitive stockbroker-training program, where only one in twenty interns will make the cut. But without a salary, Chris and his son are evicted from their apartment and are forced to sleep on the streets, in homeless shelters and even behind the locked doors of a metro station bathroom. With self-confidence and the love and trust of his son, Chris Gardner rises above his obstacles to become a Wall Street legend.\", 'Amazon.com', 'A heartwarming film that demonstrates how good, hard-working people can become homeless almost overnight,', 'Pursuit of Happyness', \"is a tour-de-force showcase for Will Smith, who convincingly portrays a down-and-out dad trying to better his family's life.

When he accepts an internship with a prestigious stock brokerage firm, there\\'s a catch: The position is unpaid, suitable more for trust-fund children than single parents with no other source of income. In many scenes, the viewer panics along with Chris, wondering how he\\'s going to feed his child. While Smith and his son, Jaden, share many tender moments together, Thandie Newton has the thankless role of playing Chris\\' shrill wife, who deserts her family early in the film.
