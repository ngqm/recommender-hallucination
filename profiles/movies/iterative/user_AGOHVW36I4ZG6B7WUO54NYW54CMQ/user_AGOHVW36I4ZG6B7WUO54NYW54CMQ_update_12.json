A fiercely moving portrait of people whose hopes and dreams are constantly deferred, \"A Raisin in the Sun\" was the first play written by an African American woman to be produced on Broadway. The classic, still-relevant story now will be showcased in this totally new television movie adaptation. Sean Combs reprises the role which brought him critical acclaim in the highly anticipated, special three-hour television movie adaptation of the award-winning Broadway revival. Joining him is the cast of the award-winning production, including Emmy and Tony Award winner Phylicia Rashad, four-time Tony Award winner Audra McDonald, Tony Award nominee Sanaa Lathan, plus \"ER\" star John Stamos.', 'Amazon.com', 'Pride and poverty collide in this excellent television movie of the classic play', 'A Raisin in the Sun', '. When Walter Younger (Sean Combs, a.k.a. P. Diddy), his wife Ruth (Audra McDonald,', 'Private Practice', '), and his sister Beneatha (Sanaa Lathan,', 'Something New', ') learn that their deceased father has left their mother Lena (Phylicia Rashad,', 'The Cosby Show', \") with $10,000 in life insurance, their separate ideas of how to spend it threaten to pull the family apart. Lorraine Hansberry's passionate play ranks in the same tier as\", 'Death of a Salesman', 'and', \"Long Day's Journey Into Night\", '. This version is taken from an acclaimed stage production, but the actors have expertly re-pitched their performances for the intimacy of the camera and the script has been subtly but effectively opened up to allow scenes to take place at multiple locations. Lathan, McDonald, and Rashad all deliver rich, multilayered performances; the casting of rapper Combs could have been a mere stunt, but though he lacks the chops of the powerhouse women, he acquits himself decently. Excellent supporting performances from Bill Nunn (', 'Do the Right Thing', \") and John Stamos round out the cast. All in all, a rewarding adaptation of a play that continues to resonate with America's ongoing struggle with race.\", '--Bret Fetzer']\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'TV Drama, Drama', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Audra McDonald, John M.

Chris' determination finally pays off when he lands an unpaid internship in a brutally competitive stockbroker-training program, where only one in twenty interns will make the cut. But without a salary, Chris and his son are evicted from their apartment and are forced to sleep on the streets, in homeless shelters and even behind the locked doors of a metro station bathroom.

Based on the true-life story of Chris Gardner, a San Francisco salesman forced at times to shelter his young son (played by Smith's adorable look-alike offspring Jaden Smith) in a men's room, there is little suspense to the film in terms of Chris' outcome. (His story and eventual success a successful and wealthy Chicago businessman was well-publicized on the newsmagazine show\", '20/20', '.) And let\\'s face it, Hollywood\\'s not too keen on making feel-good movies with unhappy endings. The beauty (and suspense, to a certain extent) of this film is in the way the story is told.

When he accepts an internship with a prestigious stock brokerage firm, there\\'s a catch: The position is unpaid, suitable more for trust-fund children than single parents with no other source of income. In many scenes, the viewer panics along with Chris, wondering how he\\'s going to feed his child. While Smith and his son, Jaden, share many tender moments together, Thandie Newton has the thankless role of playing Chris\\' shrill wife, who deserts her family early in the film. It\\'s not a particularly challenging part for the talented actress, and her departure doesn\\'t impact the storyline much at all. As for the movie\\'s misspelled title, it\\'s inspired from a scene in the film.

The film was based on the bestselling nonfiction book about a multiple-personality patient and her exhaustive therapy. It opens with a brilliant series of scenes that suggest how a young woman named Sybil (Sally Field) experiences unexplained blackouts, which brings her to the attention of a psychiatrist, Dr. Wilbur (Joanne Woodward). The film unfolds around the searching therapy sessions, laced with flashbacks to Sybil's toxic childhood. There's also a tentative romance between the lonely Sybil and a manchild (Brad Davis) who lives across the alley. Most notably, of course, there are the appearances of Sybil's alternate personalities, who express her strangled emotional life. Stewart Stern's sensitive script seems to flow organically from one scene to the next, and director Daniel Petrie frequently allows the camera to observe the acting acrobatics in long, challenging takes.\", 'Woodward, who won an Oscar for playing a multiple-personality patient in', 'The Three Faces of Eve', ', is all nurturing warmth as the steadfast doctor.

Field's work is anguished but non-actor-y, and despite the character's hidden personalities, she seems as clear as day in her performance.

A fiercely moving portrait of people whose hopes and dreams are constantly deferred, \"A Raisin in the Sun\" was the first play written by an African American woman to be produced on Broadway. The classic, still-relevant story now will be showcased in this totally new television movie adaptation. Sean Combs reprises the role which brought him critical acclaim in the highly anticipated, special three-hour television movie adaptation of the award-winning Broadway revival. Joining him is the cast of the award-winning production, including Emmy and Tony Award winner Phylicia Rashad, four-time Tony Award winner Audra McDonald, Tony Award nominee Sanaa Lathan, plus \"ER\" star John Stamos.', 'Amazon.com', 'Pride and poverty collide in this excellent television movie of the classic play', 'A Raisin in the Sun', '. When Walter Younger (Sean Combs, a.k.a. P. Diddy), his wife Ruth (Audra McDonald,', 'Private Practice', '), and his sister Beneatha (Sanaa Lathan,', 'Something New', ') learn that their deceased father has left their mother Lena (Phylicia Rashad,', 'The Cosby Show', \") with $10,000 in life insurance, their separate ideas of how to spend it threaten to pull the family apart. Lorraine Hansberry's passionate play ranks in the same tier as\", 'Death of a Salesman', 'and', \"Long Day's Journey Into Night\", '. This version is taken from an acclaimed stage production, but the actors have expertly re-pitched their performances for the intimacy of the camera and the script has been subtly but effectively opened up to allow scenes to take place at multiple locations. Lathan, McDonald, and Rashad all deliver rich, multilayered performances; the casting of rapper Combs could have been a mere stunt, but though he lacks the chops of the powerhouse women, he acquits himself decently. Excellent supporting performances from Bill Nunn (', 'Do the Right Thing', \") and John Stamos round out the cast. All in all, a rewarding adaptation of a play that continues to resonate with America's ongoing struggle with race.\", '--Bret Fetzer']\n{'Genre': 'TV Drama, Drama', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Audra McDonald, John M.
