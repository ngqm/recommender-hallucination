I attempted to write a review without clicking any stars, but found that was impossible.<br /><br />There was so much contention and foul language, I never figured out what the story line was.  I bought it new right after it came out.  A friend watched with me.  We both felt the same about the movie, that it was a waste of money.  I donated to Goodwill.  Maybe they can make some money on it since it won awards.\nReview Title: I did not like this movie AT ALL\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
