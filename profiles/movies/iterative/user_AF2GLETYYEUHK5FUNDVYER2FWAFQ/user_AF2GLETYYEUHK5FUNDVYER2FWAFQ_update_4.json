I attempted to write a review without clicking any stars, but found that was impossible.<br /><br />There was so much contention and foul language, I never figured out what the story line was.  I bought it new right after it came out.  A friend watched with me.  We both felt the same about the movie, that it was a waste of money.  I donated to Goodwill.

Taught by his foster father to harness his lust for blood and killing, Dexter lives by his own strict moral code - he only kills murderers who can't otherwise be brought to justice. Dexter is a killer who grapples with fitting into society while, at the same time, he struggles with his inability to feel emotion. The irony of Dexter's life is that he works closely as a blood splatter analyst with the very people who hunt his kind - the homicide departments.\", 'Amazon.com', 'Own it all: 8 seasons, exclusive art book and a bonus disc of killer special feature in a collectible slide box inspired by the one Dexter himself uses on the show to catalog his kills.
