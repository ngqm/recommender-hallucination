Said wrap-out was one of many controversies that swirled around the show in season 2; clashes with the network over the handling of the finale led to Maples and co-executive producer Paul Stupin--the show's guiding forces--leaving the program, which was then re-tooled to focus more on Mary's work and less on her family.
