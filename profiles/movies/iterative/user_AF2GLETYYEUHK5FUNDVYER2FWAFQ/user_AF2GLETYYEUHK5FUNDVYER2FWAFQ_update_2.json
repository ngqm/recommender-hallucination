I attempted to write a review without clicking any stars, but found that was impossible.<br /><br />There was so much contention and foul language, I never figured out what the story line was.  I bought it new right after it came out.  A friend watched with me.  We both felt the same about the movie, that it was a waste of money.  I donated to Goodwill.  Maybe they can make some money on it since it won awards.\nI did not like this movie AT ALL\nThe Net\nSandra Bullock  (Actor),     Ken Howard  (Actor),     Irwin Winkler  (Director, Producer)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Studio Specials, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, All Sony Pictures Titles\n['Sandra Bullock, Jeremy Northam and Dennis Miller star in this hit thriller about a computer expert whose life is \u201cerased\u201d by a computer conspiracy.']\n{'Aspect Ratio': '1.85:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.5 x 0.5 inches; 2.5 Ounces', 'Item model number': '2227339', 'Director': 'Irwin Winkler', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen, Dubbed', 'Run time': '1 hour and 54 minutes', 'Release date': 'February 7, 2006', 'Actors': 'Sandra Bullock, Ken Howard, Diane Baker, Dennis Miller, Jeremy Northam', 'Dubbed': 'French', 'Subtitles': 'Thai, English, Portuguese, French, Spanish, Mandarin Chinese, Korean', 'Producers': 'Irwin Winkler, Rob Cowan', 'Language': 'Unqualified (DTS ES 6.1)', 'Studio': 'Sony Pictures Home Entertainment', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nTerrific!\nFive Stars",
