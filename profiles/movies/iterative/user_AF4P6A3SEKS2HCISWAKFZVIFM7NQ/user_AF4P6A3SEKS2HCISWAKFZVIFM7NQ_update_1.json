My mom liked it and she and I would watch every episode when it originally aired, particularly the one where Lee and Amanda finally got married. I don't have a DVR or enough time in the day to hunt and search for the episodes, which many times air out of order. Can we get this on DVD?<br /><br />Here is a really, super smart idea.<br /><br />Anyone ready for this one?<br /><br />Take pre-orders. Release the ENTIRE SHOW on DVD, then send it out to those who have pre-ordered it. That makes a lot of sense. Why am I seeing some new series, which haven't been on but even 1-2 seasons, before they are out on DVD.<br /><br />Sopranos? NIP/TUCK? These series are still being aired with new episodes weekly. I know they are popular, but come on, this show was good too.<br /><br />How hard can this be? There are a lot of people that like the series, and want to see it again. There was a time I had to wait 2 years in between the time it was on one station in syndication before it came back on another station.<br /><br />AS OF 3/9/2010....<br /><br />This series has been released on DVD. The earlier review was written 3 years ago. I had actually forgot I had written a review of this until I went to review it and it gave me the option to EDIT, and EDIT I shall.<br /><br />I still give it 5 stars. The network and production company did great by it, or as best as they could; given it's age. It has been over 20 years since it has been on and I bet the original tape/film is not as good as it once was, but it isn't as bad as it could be either.<br /><br />But don't look for extras--out takes, commentaries, promo commercials or even a \"behind the scenes\"; because it isn't on this wonderful 5 disc set. I say wonderful because the packaging is awesome. It is one jewel case with single sided DVDs which take no more room than at best 2 DVDs on the shelf, which goes into a cardboard sleeve. It comes with a booklet to explain each episode and the characters. The DVD artwork is good. The DVDs are clearly marked and the \"menu\" screen is simple. You can play ALL episodes at once or select individual ones.<br /><br />As far as the quality, it might not have been digitally remastered as you can literally see the \"scratches\" in the file. The DVDs play without skipping and the episodes are just as wonderful as I remember them being.<br /><br />If you love the series, here it is. I can not wait for the rest of the seasons and hope they are as quickly released as Nash Bridges has been.\nReview Title: Scarecrow & Mrs King Needs To Be (IS FINALLY) On DVD\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
