Our hero is Remy, a French rat (voiced by Patton Oswalt) with a cultivated palate, who rises from his humble beginnings to become head chef at a Paris restaurant. How this happens is the stuff of Pixar magic, that ineffable blend of headlong comedy, seamless technology, and wonder (in the latter department, this movie's views of nighttime Paris are on a par with French cinema at its most lyrical). Director Brad Bird (\", 'The Incredibles', \") doesn't quite keep all his spinning plates in the air, but the gags are great and the animation amazingly expressive--Remy's shrugs and nods are nimbler than many flesh-and-blood actors can manage. Refreshingly, the movie's characters aren't celebrity-reliant, with the most recognizable voice coming from Peter O'Toole's snide food critic. (This fellow provides the film's sole sour note--an oddly pointed slap at critics, those craven souls who have done nothing but rave about Pixar's movies over the years.) Brad Bird's style is more quick-hit and less resonant than the approach of Pixar honcho John Lasseter, but it's hard to complain about a movie that cooks up such bountiful pleasure. --\", 'Robert Horton', 'Beyond', 'Ratatouille', 'on DVD', 'Ratatouille', 'on Blu-ray', 'Ratatouille', 'Toys & More', 'Other Classic Pixar Hits', 'Stills from', 'Ratatouille', '(Click for larger image)']\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Aspect Ratio': '2.40:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'G (General Audience)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.5 x 0.5 inches; 4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'WD05371400DVD', 'Director': 'Brad Bird, Jan Pinkava', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Dolby, NTSC, Widescreen, Digital Sound', 'Run time': '1 hour and 51 minutes', 'Release date': 'November 6, 2007', 'Actors': 'Brad Garrett, Lou Romano, Patton Oswalt', 'Dubbed': 'English', 'Subtitles': 'English', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround), English (Dolby Digital 5.1), Unqualified (DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1)', 'Studio': 'DISNEY/PIXAR', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: Kids loved It\nReview Title: Five Stars\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
