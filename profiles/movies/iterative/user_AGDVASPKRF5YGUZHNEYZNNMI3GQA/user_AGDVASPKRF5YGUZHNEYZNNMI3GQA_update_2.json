Academy Award(R) winner Robin Williams (Best Supporting Actor, GOOD WILL HUNTING, 1997) shakes up 1965 Saigon in the role that garnered him his very first Oscar(R) nomination. Imported by the military to host an early a.m. radio show, Cronauer (Williams) blasts the formerly serene, sanitized airwaves with a constant barrage of rapid-fire humor and the hottest hits from back home. The G.I.s love him, but the top brass is up in arms. Riddled with sidesplitting comic salvos, bittersweet bombshells, and hot \\'60s rock \\'n\\' roll, this landmark film chronicles one man\\'s raucous Saigon adventures amidst a world gone mad. Featuring all-new bonus material that includes hilarious outtakes from Robin Williams\\' \"raw\" monologues, this Special Edition of GOOD MORNING, VIETNAM, scores a direct hit every time you watch.']\n{'Genre': 'Comedy', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Closed-captioned, Color, NTSC, Special Edition', 'Contributor': 'Richard Portnow, Mitch Markowitz, Bruno Kirby, Forest Whitaker, Chintara Sukapatana, Juney Smith, Barry Levinson, Robert Wuhl, Floyd Vivino, Tung Thanh Tran, Noble Willingham, Robin Williams, Don Stanton, J.T.
