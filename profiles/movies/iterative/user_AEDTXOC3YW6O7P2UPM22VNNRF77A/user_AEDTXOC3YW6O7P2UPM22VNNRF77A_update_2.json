No, some folks just don't get him, but we've filled museums with the works of misunderstood geniuses, and this film is a fitting farewell from one such artist.<br /><br />Altman's signature overlapping dialogue seems different here than in any other film. Unlike the nervous energy of MASH, or the comic surrealism of Popeye, or the self-involved banter in Gosford Park, these conversations are so natural and intimate and authentic that they appear ad-libbed, although Tomlin has confirmed since that they were not. The dressing-rooms scenes between Streep & Tomlin are amazing. No one can bring a viewer into the moment like Altman could. This is Tomlin's best work since Nashville. Even when she's sharing the shot with Streep, one of our greatest actresses, I couldn't take my eyes off Lily Tomlin. She deserves an Oscar nomination for this role.<br /><br />I'm an Altman lover, not an expert, but I can't remember another film in which he used light so beautifully. He lights the film with an amber glow and often the low reflection of footlights, much like Chuck Akers, in anticipation of a romantic interlude, lovingly fills his dressing room with candlelight. Altman creates a look that conveys the intimate, warm nostalgia created by Keillor in his radio broadcasts.<br /><br />Of course, Keillor's material is brilliant, whether or not you like everything about his screenplay. The film is no more political nor sacrilegious nor racy than the radio show, if you pay attention to the radio broadcasts. Might I have done some things differently? Sure, but I probably would have painted eyebrows on the Mona Lisa.<br /><br />Altman lovers will treasure this beautiful gem. Anyone else should understand that you won't be spoon-fed a formulaic film, and if you can put aside any expectations and simply let this master filmmaker tell you his story, paint you his picture, you'll see why we love him so much.\nReview Title: We'll miss you, Mr. Altman.\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Virginia Woolf (Kidman) lives in a suburb of London in the 1920\\x92s as she struggles to begin writing her first great novel, Mrs. Dalloway, while also attempting to overcome the mental illness that threatens to engulf her. Laura Brown (Moore), a young wife and mother in post-World War II Los Angeles, is just starting to read Mrs. Dalloway, and is so deeply affected by it that she begins to question the life she has chosen for herself. Then, in contemporary New York City, Clarissa Vaughan (Streep) is a modern-day mirror image of Woolf\\x92s Mrs. Dalloway as she plans what may be the final party for her friend and former lover, Richard (Harris), who is dying of AIDS.', 'Amazon.com', 'Delicate and hypnotic,', 'The Hours', 'interweaves three stories with remarkable skill: in the 1920s Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) grapples with her inner demons and slowly works on her novel', 'Mrs. Dalloway', \"; in 1949 housewife Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) feels her own destructive impulses; and in 1999 book editor Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep)--much like the title character of Woolf's novel--prepares to throw a party, in honor of her dearest friend, a seriously ill poet (Ed Harris). Small details reverberate from story to story as a powerhouse cast (including Allison Janney, Toni Collette, Claire Danes, Jeff Daniels, John C. Reilly, Stephen Dillane, and Miranda Richardson) gives subtle and beautifully modulated performances. In the hands of director Stephen Daldry (\", 'Billy Elliot', '),', 'The Hours', 'is almost more a piece of music than a story, and like music, it may move you in unexpected ways.', '--Bret Fetzer', 'Set Contains:', \"It's hard to imagine anyone wanting more than what's on this lovely, single disc. There are four newly produced segments: a talk with composer Philip Glass, a featurette on the three main actresses, a must-see 10-minute feature on the writer of the novel (Michael Cunningham) and the screenplay (David Hare), and a crisp half-hour history of Virginia Wolfe with many anecdotes from various scholars. There are two commentaries. Highly recommended is Cunningham with director Stephen Daldry as they go through the movie with a good sense of appreciation for each person's craft. Cunningham is quite charming in revealing the story's origins while Daldry makes even the smallest task of filmmaking interesting. Daldry's so detailed he apologizes for such seemingly trivial bits as filming the opening sequence at a different time of year than it actually happened. The main three actresses speak separately on the other commentary track, and even though fans will enjoy their insights, the energy is very low; perhaps they should have recorded the track together. Streep's deep laughs at her little jokes are very smile-inducing.\", '--Doug Thomas', 'See more']\n{'Genre': 'Kids & Family, Drama', 'Format': 'Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Color, DVD, Widescreen, NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Linda Bassett, Meryl Streep, Michael Cunningham, Charley Ramm, Stephen Daldry, David Hare, Stephen Dillane, Miranda Richardson, Michael Culkin, Christian Coulson, Nicole Kidman, Sophie Wyburd, Julianne Moore, Lyndsey Marshal, George LoftusLinda Bassett, Meryl Streep, Michael Cunningham, Charley Ramm, Stephen Daldry, David Hare, Stephen Dillane, Miranda Richardson, Michael Culkin, Christian Coulson, Nicole Kidman, Sophie Wyburd, Julianne Moore, Lyndsey Marshal, George Loftus  See more', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.0), French', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 54 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.85:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.75 x 5.5 x 0.5 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Director': 'Stephen Daldry', 'Media Format': 'Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Color, DVD, Widescreen, NTSC', 'Run time': '1 hour and 54 minutes', 'Release date': 'June 24, 2003', 'Actors': 'Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore, Stephen Dillane, Miranda Richardson', 'Subtitles': 'English', 'Studio': 'Paramount', 'Writers': 'David Hare, Michael Cunningham', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nIf you haven't seen this film, get it now.  You'll hate yourself for not buying it sooner.  This is one of the most powerful films I have ever seen.  I was mesmerized from the first scene.  It is simply brilliant, and Streep, Kidman, Lewis and Harris are, without a doubt, four of the greatest living actors.  When the film was finished, I couldn't move.  I sat and stared at the blank screen, and I can't remember when, if ever, that's happened with another film.<br />The DVD extras are very nice, and include a documentary on Virginia Woolf and interviews with the three amazing women stars, but to be honest, I had to watch those later because I was so blown away by the film itself that I couldn't concentrate on the extra features afterwards.  I think it's nearly miraculous that every aspect of this film -- the writing, directing, cinematography, and every single actor -- is excellent.  I think it's a masterpiece.\nDon't waste another minute...\nA Prairie Home Companion\nWoody Harrelson  (Actor),     Tommy Lee Jones  (Actor),     Robert Altman  (Director, Producer)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Comedy\n['Prairie Home Companion, A (DVD)', 'From legendary director Robert Altman comes his final film, the deeply moving and comedic A Prairie Home Companion.
