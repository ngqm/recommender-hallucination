Virginia Woolf (Kidman) lives in a suburb of London in the 1920\\x92s as she struggles to begin writing her first great novel, Mrs. Dalloway, while also attempting to overcome the mental illness that threatens to engulf her. Laura Brown (Moore), a young wife and mother in post-World War II Los Angeles, is just starting to read Mrs. Dalloway, and is so deeply affected by it that she begins to question the life she has chosen for herself. Then, in contemporary New York City, Clarissa Vaughan (Streep) is a modern-day mirror image of Woolf\\x92s Mrs. Dalloway as she plans what may be the final party for her friend and former lover, Richard (Harris), who is dying of AIDS.', 'Amazon.com', 'Delicate and hypnotic,', 'The Hours', 'interweaves three stories with remarkable skill: in the 1920s Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) grapples with her inner demons and slowly works on her novel', 'Mrs. Dalloway', \"; in 1949 housewife Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) feels her own destructive impulses; and in 1999 book editor Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep)--much like the title character of Woolf's novel--prepares to throw a party, in honor of her dearest friend, a seriously ill poet (Ed Harris). Small details reverberate from story to story as a powerhouse cast (including Allison Janney, Toni Collette, Claire Danes, Jeff Daniels, John C. Reilly, Stephen Dillane, and Miranda Richardson) gives subtle and beautifully modulated performances. In the hands of director Stephen Daldry (\", 'Billy Elliot', '),', 'The Hours', 'is almost more a piece of music than a story, and like music, it may move you in unexpected ways.', '--Bret Fetzer', 'Set Contains:', \"It's hard to imagine anyone wanting more than what's on this lovely, single disc. There are four newly produced segments: a talk with composer Philip Glass, a featurette on the three main actresses, a must-see 10-minute feature on the writer of the novel (Michael Cunningham) and the screenplay (David Hare), and a crisp half-hour history of Virginia Wolfe with many anecdotes from various scholars. There are two commentaries. Highly recommended is Cunningham with director Stephen Daldry as they go through the movie with a good sense of appreciation for each person's craft. Cunningham is quite charming in revealing the story's origins while Daldry makes even the smallest task of filmmaking interesting. Daldry's so detailed he apologizes for such seemingly trivial bits as filming the opening sequence at a different time of year than it actually happened. The main three actresses speak separately on the other commentary track, and even though fans will enjoy their insights, the energy is very low; perhaps they should have recorded the track together. Streep's deep laughs at her little jokes are very smile-inducing.\", '--Doug Thomas', 'See more']\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Kids & Family, Drama', 'Format': 'Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Color, DVD, Widescreen, NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Linda Bassett, Meryl Streep, Michael Cunningham, Charley Ramm, Stephen Daldry, David Hare, Stephen Dillane, Miranda Richardson, Michael Culkin, Christian Coulson, Nicole Kidman, Sophie Wyburd, Julianne Moore, Lyndsey Marshal, George LoftusLinda Bassett, Meryl Streep, Michael Cunningham, Charley Ramm, Stephen Daldry, David Hare, Stephen Dillane, Miranda Richardson, Michael Culkin, Christian Coulson, Nicole Kidman, Sophie Wyburd, Julianne Moore, Lyndsey Marshal, George Loftus  See more', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.0), French', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 54 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.85:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.75 x 5.5 x 0.5 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Director': 'Stephen Daldry', 'Media Format': 'Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Color, DVD, Widescreen, NTSC', 'Run time': '1 hour and 54 minutes', 'Release date': 'June 24, 2003', 'Actors': 'Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore, Stephen Dillane, Miranda Richardson', 'Subtitles': 'English', 'Studio': 'Paramount', 'Writers': 'David Hare, Michael Cunningham', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: If you haven't seen this film, get it now.  You'll hate yourself for not buying it sooner.  This is one of the most powerful films I have ever seen.  I was mesmerized from the first scene.  It is simply brilliant, and Streep, Kidman, Lewis and Harris are, without a doubt, four of the greatest living actors.  When the film was finished, I couldn't move.  I sat and stared at the blank screen, and I can't remember when, if ever, that's happened with another film.<br />The DVD extras are very nice, and include a documentary on Virginia Woolf and interviews with the three amazing women stars, but to be honest, I had to watch those later because I was so blown away by the film itself that I couldn't concentrate on the extra features afterwards.  I think it's nearly miraculous that every aspect of this film -- the writing, directing, cinematography, and every single actor -- is excellent.  I think it's a masterpiece.\nReview Title: Don't waste another minute...\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
