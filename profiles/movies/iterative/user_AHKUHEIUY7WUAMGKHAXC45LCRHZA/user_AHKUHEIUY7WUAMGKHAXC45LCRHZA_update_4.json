Bucum dreams of opening his own private investigation firm, but right now he's on the trail of slippery con artist Reggie Wright (Mike Epps). Bucum's wild pursuit of Reggie leads to the middle of a multi-million dollar diamond heist, where Reggie's flailing hysteria allows him to avoid capture. Things start to look up for Reggie when he realizes he's the sole winner of a $60 million lottery! Unfortunately, the winning ticket is still in Reggie's wallet ... in the getaway van ... and has been discovered by the diamond thieves. And then Reggie sees Bucum. Bucum may not trust Reggie, but if Reggie's story is true it means a whole lot more than the bail money ... and if it's a scam, Bucum can use Reggie as bait to catch the diamond thieves. Now, either way Bucum can't lose--because, after all, it's All About the Benjamins.\", ']]>', 'Amazon.com', \"Ice Cube cowrote, produced, and stars in this action caper. Bucum (Cube) is a bounty hunter (get it?) with dreams of big money. Reggie (Mike Epps) is a small-time grifter who also has dreams of big money and is at the top of Bucum's list to boot. Yep, you guessed it: tough guy/funny guy buddy flick.\", 'All About the Benjamins', \"is pretty much a by-the-numbers piece of work. There's plenty of macho posturing, gunfire, big-ticket items exploding, and curse words inserted into the script in lieu of actual punch lines. The plot has holes big enough to drive a locomotive through, but then again the plot isn't really the point. Epps's attempts at wacky comedy wear thin early on, but Ice Cube does a fine job, and together they do make quite a few moments hit. Best recommended for when you want turn-your-brain-off excitement.\", '--Ali Davis']\n{'Genre': 'Comedy, Mystery & Suspense/Crime, Action & Adventure', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Color, DTS Surround Sound, NTSC, Dolby, Subtitled, WidescreenMultiple Formats, Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Color, DTS Surround Sound, NTSC, Dolby, Subtitled, Widescreen  See more', 'Contributor': 'Bray, Kevin, Beres, Julianne, Miller, Valarie Rae, Cube, Ice, Giaimo, Anthony, Chase, Jeff, Flanagan, Tommy, Corone, Antoni, Mendes, Eva, Chaplin, Carmen, Epps, Mike, Wow, Bow, Turner, Joan, Brooks, Evelyn, Hall, Anthony Michael, Smith, Roger Guenveur, Chianese Jr., Dominic, Salvano, Gino, Ward (III), Tony, Carter, BobBray, Kevin, Beres, Julianne, Miller, Valarie Rae, Cube, Ice, Giaimo, Anthony, Chase, Jeff, Flanagan, Tommy, Corone, Antoni, Mendes, Eva, Chaplin, Carmen, Epps, Mike, Wow, Bow, Turner, Joan, Brooks, Evelyn, Hall, Anthony Michael, Smith, Roger Guenveur, Chianese Jr., D\u2026  See more', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1), Unqualified, English (DTS 5.1)', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 38 minutes', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 0.01 Ounces', 'Item model number': '1000032313', 'Director': 'Bray, Kevin', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Color, DTS Surround Sound, NTSC, Dolby, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Run time': '1 hour and 38 minutes', 'Release date': 'September 14, 2004', 'Actors': 'Beres, Julianne, Bray, Kevin, Brooks, Evelyn, Carter, Bob, Chaplin, Carmen', 'Subtitles': 'English', 'Studio': 'WarnerBrothers', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nWe absolutely loved this movie.
