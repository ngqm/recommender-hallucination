Kilmer stars as Ray Levoi, a hotshot FBI agent who's thrust into a strange new world when he is sent to solve a murder on an Indian reservation. Hand-picked because of his part-Sioux ancestry, Levoi is teamed with a legendary older agent (Shepard) to capture a radical Indian protester. But once on the reservation, Levoi encounters the irreverent local sheriff (Greene), and the tribe's religious leader (Chief Ted Thin Elk), who knows secrets about Levoi's own lost heritage. And as Levoi's awareness of the native culture grows, so does his belief that the U.S. government has framed an innocent man. A crackerjack mystery and a personal triumph of the heart.\"]\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Drama', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, Full Screen, WidescreenMultiple Formats, Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, Full Screen, Widescreen  See more', 'Contributor': \"Julius Drum, Robert De Niro, Allan R.J.

At the height of WWII, a young submarine crew heads out to sea on a top-secret mission that all but ensures most will never make it home alive. Ordered to patrol the Atlantic and destroy an Allied armada bringing supplies to Britain, these raw recruits must band together, bracing themselves against a depth-charge assault from an unseen enemy - can the Captain and his crew summon the strength to escape their watery grave?', \"Oscar-nominated director Wolfgang Petersen's five-hour epic adventure deftly explores tensions as pressure builds to an explosive climax, packing a visceral punch few movies can match. As we hurtle through the sub's cramped quarters, telegraphing not only the controlled chaos of combat but the fearful faces of the U-boat's heroic crew, this adrenalin-rush of a war film still haunts audiences with one final heart-breaking dilemma: would you let others perish so you could survive?\", 'Nominated for 6 Oscars\u00ae Best Director, Best Writing, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing and Best EffectsNominated for a Golden Globe\u00ae for Best Picture']\n{'Genre': 'Special Interests', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Wolfgang Petersen, Hubertus Bengsch, Bernd Tauber, Martin Semmelrogge, Klaus Wennemann, J\u00fcrgen Prochnow, Herbert Gr\u00f6nemeyerWolfgang Petersen, Hubertus Bengsch, Bernd Tauber, Martin Semmelrogge, Klaus Wennemann, J\u00fcrgen Prochnow, Herbert Gr\u00f6nemeyer  See more', 'Language': 'English', 'Number Of Discs': '2', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.25 x 0.5 inches; 2.88 Ounces', 'Director': 'Wolfgang Petersen', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, NTSC', 'Run time': '4 hours and 53 minutes', 'Release date': 'May 13, 2014', 'Actors': 'J\u00fcrgen Prochnow, Herbert Gr\u00f6nemeyer, Klaus Wennemann, Hubertus Bengsch, Martin Semmelrogge', 'Studio': 'Sony Pictures Home', 'Number of discs': '2'}\nMovie skipped some but ok\nOk\nSoldier Blue\nCandice Bergen  (Actor),     Peter Strauss  (Actor)    Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Drama\n['A wild west story of two survivors of an Indian attack who slowly fall in love.']\n{'Aspect Ratio': '2.35:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.54 x 5.34 x 7.41 inches; 0.71 Ounces', 'Item model number': '20569', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, Widescreen, NTSC', 'Run time': '1 hour and 55 minutes', 'Release date': 'December 12, 2006', 'Actors': 'Candice Bergen, Peter Strauss, Donald Pleasence, James Hampton, Mort Mills', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 1.0)', 'Studio': 'Lionsgate', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nGreat\nGreat movie\nThe Mummy Collector's Set (The Mummy/ The Mummy Returns/ The Scorpion King)\nBrendon Fraser  (Actor),     Arnold Vosloo  (Actor)    Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Action & Adventure\n['Product Description', \"Unearth non-stop action with The Mummy Collector's Set.

Once there, Evelyn accidentally unlocks the tomb of Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), a man who had been buried alive a couple of millennia ago with flesh-eating bugs as punishment for sleeping with the pharaoh\\'s girlfriend. The ancient mummy is revived, and he is determined to bring his old love back to life, which of course means much mayhem (including the unleashing of the 10 plagues) and human sacrifice. Despite the rather gory premise, this movie is fairly tame in terms of violence; most of the magic and surprise come from the special effects, which are glorious to watch, although Imhotep, before being fully reconstituted, is, as one explorer puts it, rather \"juicy.\" Keep in mind this film is as much comedy as it is adventure--those looking for a straightforward horror pic will be disappointed.
