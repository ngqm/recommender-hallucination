See how it all began in the classic original HELLRAISER where Pinhead is introduced to the world, and the equally brilliant HELLBOUND sequel that proves there are no limits! HELLRAISER (1987, 94 Mins.): From horror master Clive Barker comes this chilling nightmare featuring the first appearance of the hideous, demonic Pinhead. When Kirsty Cotton\u2019s family moves into their ancestral home, they are terrorized by the resurrected corpse of her uncle, who requires the flesh of murdered innocent victims in order to become whole and alive again. A creepy, thrillingly perverse tale straddling heaven and hell, extreme pleasure and unbearable pain, HELLRAISER will haunt your dreams. HELLBOUND: HELLRAISER 2 (1988, 99 Mins.): In 1988, it emerged as the shocking follow-up to the film that redefined the face of horror. Two decades later, it remains the most brutally original sequel in horror film history. Clare Higgins, Ashley Laurence and Kenneth Cranham co-star in this hit sequel from executive producer Clive Barker that experiences the flesh like no other. The time to play has come again: Surrender yourself to the infernal labyrinth of HELLBOUND: HELLRAISER II.']\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': '25507355', 'Director': 'Clive Barker, Tony Randel', 'Media Format': 'Dolby, Color, Widescreen, Multiple Formats, NTSC', 'Run time': '3 hours and 13 minutes', 'Release date': 'September 4, 2012', 'Actors': 'Andrew Robinson, Ashley Laurence, Clare Higgins, Sean Chapman', 'Studio': 'Image Entertainment', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: \u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\nReview Title: \u2764\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
