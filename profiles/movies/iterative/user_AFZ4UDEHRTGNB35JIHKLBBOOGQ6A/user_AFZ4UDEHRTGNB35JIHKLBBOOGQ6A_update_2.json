The lead character is such a challenge to watch - over acting as though on stage. The facial expressions alone are almost unbearable. Having watched Weeds, I didn't expect honesty or anything realistic, but a little more depth and humor would go a long way. The other characters are fine, if one dimensional. Their talents are wasted so far. Perhaps it will get better. Weeds was wildly uneven, perhaps this is as well.\nReview Title: Meh, don't believe the hype\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

The film laughs at itself (although one could argue a little more laughter would go a long way). Not for everyone.\nGrows on you\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Michael Trim'], 'Producers': ['Phil Abraham', 'Constantine Makris'], 'Studio': ['Lionsgate']}\nHonestly, I don't understand why this has received such accolades.

  "profile": "**User Profile Summary:**\n\n- **Film Appreciation**: Enjoys films with complex narratives and character development, valuing performances from both leading and supporting actors. The latest interaction indicates a critical view towards overacting and one-dimensional characters, suggesting a heightened expectation for depth and subtlety in performances.\n\n- **Humor & Self-awareness**: Values humor in films, particularly those that are self-reflective or meta. However, the recent review reveals a disappointment when humor feels lacking or misplaced, reinforcing the preference for creativity and originality in storytelling.\n\n- **Diverse Language Options**: Continues to prefer content with multiple audio language options and English subtitles, highlighting an inclination towards accessibility and inclusivity in movie-watching experiences.\n\n- **Director & Producer Interest**: Maintains an interest in notable directors and producers, but shows readiness to critique their works based on performance and narrative quality, indicating a discerning taste for higher-quality productions.\n\n- **Gradual Appreciation**: The user still exhibits a tendency for films to grow on them over time, but the recent critique suggests they are more critical if initial impressions are poor, implying a need for deeper engagement with characters and storylines.\n\nOverall, the user leans towards films that thoughtfully blend humor and depth, appreciates nuanced performances, and is increasingly discerning about the execution of character development and narrative coherence.",
