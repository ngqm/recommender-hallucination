I mean &#34;HELLO&#34;, I melt and he's just on a DVD or movie screen or walking down a Red Carpet, wherever makes no difference.<br /><br />Of course this Thor is the same. Loves his family, his people, all the surrounding planets or in our world, surrounding States and Cities. A true Soldier/Warrior. Respect his parents and even loves his troublesome brother! I have to say I really like this Loki character. Yes he is bad and self enter. But got the attitude of Garfield the Cat and really comical. So yeah I don't think you can have a Thor flick without Loki. Together the brothers compliment each other, tho you wish Loki wasn't so destructive on humankind like he can be. Yes we have romance, anger, some really Ugly bad guys, a crazy Professior and comedy and unfortunately loss of a loved one. So Thor's like us and his home has problems as ours does and we too lose Loved Ones. He just does it with grace and one Heck of a hammer!!<br />Can't wait for the new Captian America coming to theaters 4/4/14!<br />Hope you enjoy Thor: The Dark World. Full of action!!<br />Dezi\nReview Title: If only...\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
