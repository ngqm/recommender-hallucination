First I am a fan of Luke. And he ain't to bad to look at either...know matter the age. LOL<br />I found the movie extremely interesting and thrilling at the same time.<br />Vlad the Impaler, his story is tweaked and told in a diffenert way that is...to me a better way of telling the history of such a wicked and Gruesome Dude! Sure glad I was not form that era.<br />There is Love. There is Honor. There is Family and a bond so strong it can not be broken at all...all the way to the end!<br />Speaking of the end I did not really care for the ending. Yes it leaves it open for another Dracula...But to me this story does not need a #2. Because it would truly ruin this one!<br />Yes I Loved the movie. Great effects and dialogue.<br />I still believe tho that if the ending would have had played out a little bit longer, it would not have left me hanging and finishing the ending for myself'\nReview Title: This Drac could bite me anytime!

Pursued by an invasion force sent to destroy him, the fallen God of Thunder must rise to the battle and learn what it takes to become a true hero.

I mean &#34;HELLO&#34;, I melt and he's just on a DVD or movie screen or walking down a Red Carpet, wherever makes no difference.<br /><br />Of course this Thor is the same. Loves his family, his people, all the surrounding planets or in our world, surrounding States and Cities. A true Soldier/Warrior. Respect his parents and even loves his troublesome brother! I have to say I really like this Loki character. Yes he is bad and self enter. But got the attitude of Garfield the Cat and really comical. So yeah I don't think you can have a Thor flick without Loki. Together the brothers compliment each other, tho you wish Loki wasn't so destructive on humankind like he can be. Yes we have romance, anger, some really Ugly bad guys, a crazy Professior and comedy and unfortunately loss of a loved one. So Thor's like us and his home has problems as ours does and we too lose Loved Ones. He just does it with grace and one Heck of a hammer!!<br />Can't wait for the new Captian America coming to theaters 4/4/14!<br />Hope you enjoy Thor: The Dark World. Full of action!!<br />Dezi\nIf only...\nDracula Untold\nLuke Evans  (Actor),     Sarah Gadon  (Actor),     Gary Shore  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Studio Specials, Universal Studios Home Entertainment, All Universal Studios Titles\n['The origin story of the man who became the enduring legend of Dracula is told in Dracula Untold, an epic action-adventure starring Luke Evans (Fast & Furious 6, The Hobbit series) in the title role.
