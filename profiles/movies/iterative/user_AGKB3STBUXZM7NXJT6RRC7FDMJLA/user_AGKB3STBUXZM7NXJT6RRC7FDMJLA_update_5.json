I mean &#34;HELLO&#34;, I melt and he's just on a DVD or movie screen or walking down a Red Carpet, wherever makes no difference.<br /><br />Of course this Thor is the same. Loves his family, his people, all the surrounding planets or in our world, surrounding States and Cities. A true Soldier/Warrior. Respect his parents and even loves his troublesome brother! I have to say I really like this Loki character. Yes he is bad and self enter. But got the attitude of Garfield the Cat and really comical. So yeah I don't think you can have a Thor flick without Loki. Together the brothers compliment each other, tho you wish Loki wasn't so destructive on humankind like he can be. Yes we have romance, anger, some really Ugly bad guys, a crazy Professior and comedy and unfortunately loss of a loved one. So Thor's like us and his home has problems as ours does and we too lose Loved Ones. He just does it with grace and one Heck of a hammer!!<br />Can't wait for the new Captian America coming to theaters 4/4/14!<br />Hope you enjoy Thor: The Dark World.

First I am a fan of Luke. And he ain't to bad to look at either...know matter the age. LOL<br />I found the movie extremely interesting and thrilling at the same time.<br />Vlad the Impaler, his story is tweaked and told in a diffenert way that is...to me a better way of telling the history of such a wicked and Gruesome Dude! Sure glad I was not form that era.<br />There is Love. There is Honor. There is Family and a bond so strong it can not be broken at all...all the way to the end!<br />Speaking of the end I did not really care for the ending. Yes it leaves it open for another Dracula...But to me this story does not need a #2. Because it would truly ruin this one!<br />Yes I Loved the movie. Great effects and dialogue.<br />I still believe tho that if the ending would have had played out a little bit longer, it would not have left me hanging and finishing the ending for myself'\nThis Drac could bite me anytime!

The celebrated director--one might even say visionary--has pulled off the most elaborate B-movie heist ever with this huge-budget special effects extravaganza that revels in catchphrase clich\u00e9 dialogue, a howlingly obvious script, and the most breathtaking homage to Japanese monster and mecha cinema, manga, and comic tradition. It's all by design, of course, and is a stunning spectacle that also acts as antidote to the bloated, self-important superhero genre and typical bombastic Hollywood tent-pole fare.\", 'Pacific Rim', 'has plenty of bloat and bombast, mind you. But it\\'s in the service of a wondrously geeky story that throws all logic and seriousness to the wind, transporting the viewer to a realm of childlike popcorn escapism no matter their age. A dense and breathless prologue dumps us into the near-future global warfare of Kaiju vs. Jaeger. Kaiju are reptilian monstrosities that emerge from deep in the sea through a portal that leads to a world where Kaijus are systematically bred to destroy. They annihilate coastal cities and claim millions of lives before the world\\'s citizens band together to fight back. The humans build fantastic robots called Jaegers (German for fighters) that are able to vanquish the early Kaiju enemies by employing \"pilots\" who drive the mechanized behemoths in pairs, joining minds in a process known as the Drift. But as the years go by, the war has taken a toll on the humans and the Jaegers, both of whom are nearly defeated. From beginning to end there\\'s really no point in asking questions or trying to calculate details about the outrageous goings-on in the world of', 'Pacific Rim', '. This is a pure thrill ride ruled by del Toro, the wild visual flair of his artistry and his sheer delight for wallowing in tropes and genre chestnuts leading at full volume. The cast is mainly window dressing for the astounding computer images. The pilots Charlie Hunnam, Max Martini, Rob Kazinsky, and Rinko Kikuchi are merely types. The same goes for Idris Elba, but his glowering presence as the unwavering commander is the best real-life thing about', 'Pacific Rim', '. A pair of nerdy scientists (Charlie Day and Burn Gorman) add to the plot (simple as it is), though their primary purpose is wacky comic relief. Del Toro favorite and', 'Hellboy', \"himself, Ron Perelman steals his few short scenes as a bootlegger in Kaiju corpses. His character says a lot about the movie's self-effacing attitude.\", 'Pacific Rim', 'is deeply in cahoots with itself over the ridiculousness of the story, but also delights in the awesomeness of its invention. The action is both coherent and mind-blowing, which is why most people will find it such a kick.
