  "reference_summary": "The Beastmaster (Special Edition) [DVD]\nMarc Singer  (Actor),     Tanya Roberts  (Actor),     Don Coscarelli  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fantasy\n[\"This low-budget entry into the sword-and-sorcery cycle of the early '80s wasn't successful during its initial release, but has steadily built a strong cult following over the years. The Beastmaster tells the story of Dar (Marc Singer), the son of a king who was stolen from his mother's womb by a witch under the command of vicious sorcerer Maax (Rip Torn). A poor villager saves Dar from being sacrificed and raises him as his own son, teaching Dar how to fight and witnessing the boy's ability to telepathically communicate with animals. Their happiness is destroyed when their village is attacked by the evil Jun horde, a race of beast-like warriors controlled by Maax. Dar vows revenge and journeys to his father's former kingdom to destroy Maax. Along the way, he falls in love with gorgeous slave girl Kiri (Tanya Roberts) and teams up with former royal guard Seth (John Amos). Dar also uses his powers to enlist the aid of an eagle, a panther and two adorable ferrets named Kodo and Podo. Together, Dar and his unlikely but brave team square off with Maax in an impressive two-part finale that involves a swordfight on the side of a pyramid and a showdown with the Jun horde near a flaming moat. The resulting film was full of action and eccentric surprises, but failed to make an impression at a box office already glutted with fantasy films. However, The Beastmaster eventually became a serious cult favorite thanks to home video and extensive exposure on cable (it is the second most aired movie on TBS after Gone With the Wind). This enduring popularity led to two sequels and a syndicated television series chronicling the further adventures of Dar.\"]\n{'Genre': 'Fantasy, Romance, Action & Adventure', 'Format': 'Color, Dolby, DTS Surround Sound, DVD, Widescreen, NTSC, Special Edition', 'Contributor': 'Tanya Roberts, Kim Tabet, Ben Hammer, Marc Singer, Christine Kellogg, Billy Jayne, Dale Shawver, Rod Loomis, Chuck Hicks, Freddie Hice, Jonathan Gravish, Richard Humphreys, Fess Reynolds, Don Heyn, Mike Kirton, Diamond Farnsworth, Don Coscarelli, Tommy J.
