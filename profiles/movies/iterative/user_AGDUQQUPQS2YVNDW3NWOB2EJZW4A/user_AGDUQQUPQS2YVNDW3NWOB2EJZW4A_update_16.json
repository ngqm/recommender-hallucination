The Beastmaster tells the story of Dar (Marc Singer), the son of a king who was stolen from his mother's womb by a witch under the command of vicious sorcerer Maax (Rip Torn). A poor villager saves Dar from being sacrificed and raises him as his own son, teaching Dar how to fight and witnessing the boy's ability to telepathically communicate with animals. Their happiness is destroyed when their village is attacked by the evil Jun horde, a race of beast-like warriors controlled by Maax. Dar vows revenge and journeys to his father's former kingdom to destroy Maax. Along the way, he falls in love with gorgeous slave girl Kiri (Tanya Roberts) and teams up with former royal guard Seth (John Amos). Dar also uses his powers to enlist the aid of an eagle, a panther and two adorable ferrets named Kodo and Podo. Together, Dar and his unlikely but brave team square off with Maax in an impressive two-part finale that involves a swordfight on the side of a pyramid and a showdown with the Jun horde near a flaming moat. The resulting film was full of action and eccentric surprises, but failed to make an impression at a box office already glutted with fantasy films. However, The Beastmaster eventually became a serious cult favorite thanks to home video and extensive exposure on cable (it is the second most aired movie on TBS after Gone With the Wind). This enduring popularity led to two sequels and a syndicated television series chronicling the further adventures of Dar.\"]\n{'Genre': 'Fantasy, Romance, Action & Adventure', 'Format': 'Color, Dolby, DTS Surround Sound, DVD, Widescreen, NTSC, Special Edition', 'Contributor': 'Tanya Roberts, Kim Tabet, Ben Hammer, Marc Singer, Christine Kellogg, Billy Jayne, Dale Shawver, Rod Loomis, Chuck Hicks, Freddie Hice, Jonathan Gravish, Richard Humphreys, Fess Reynolds, Don Heyn, Mike Kirton, Diamond Farnsworth, Don Coscarelli, Tommy J.

Booth depends on clues from the living, witnesses and suspects, while Brennan gathers evidence from the dead, relying on her uncanny ability to read clues left behind in the bones of the victims.

Booth may be blunt, but he\\'s comfortable dealing with the public. Bones, on the other hand, would rather be sequestered away with the dead, trying to figure out what happened before their uncertain deaths.

And the two women aren\\'t getting along.', \"Still, everyone is able to work together to solve a series of crimes, such as identifying the remains of an all but unidentifiable teenage boy and dealing with a serial killer who is emulating the crimes depicted in Bones' latest mystery novel.

Featuring Australian newcomer Anna Torv, Dawson\u2019s Creek\u2019s Josh Jackson, John Noble and Lance Reddick, the first electrifying season of Fringe follows an unlikely trio who uncover a deadly mystery that may be part of a larger and more disturbing pattern that lives somewhere between science fiction and reality. As the season begins, FBI Special Agent Olivia Dunham (Torv) is called in to investigate a mysterious outbreak that nearly kills her partner. The only person with any answers is an institutionalized scientist, Dr. Walter Bishop (Noble) who can only be released under the care of his estranged son (Jackson). Together, the three discover that the answer to this mystery is only a small piece of a much larger, more shocking truth.', ']]>', 'Amazon.com', 'Teleportation, mind control, astral projection, invisibility, precognition, spontaneous combustion, reanimation: these are among the peripheral sciences--or \"pseudo-sciences,\" as one skeptic puts it--examined during the first season of', 'Fringe', ', a Fox network TV drama debuting on DVD with the full first season (twenty episodes) offered on seven extras-laden discs.

Abrams (whose bulging resume as a director, writer, and producer includes', 'Lost', ',', 'Alias', ', and the 2009', 'Star Trek', \"feature film) has even more on his mind. Along with the weird science, the series features a multi-agency task force investigating related acts of terrorism that may very well add up to a threat of unimaginable global proportions; people who are exactly what they appear to be (i.e., insane) and others who are anything but; plot twists galore; family drama, interpersonal relationships, corporate evil, cop chases...

Seems this is but one part of \"The Pattern,\" a series of synchronous, similarly shocking events that unfold as the show progresses; in subsequent episodes, lots of people are killed in graphic fashion by all manner of horrors, including scary monsters (slugs as big as a football, teethed parasites that can crush your heart), a gas that freezes a busload of passengers \"like insects trapped in amber,\" people so radioactive they can literally make your brain boil\u2026 it goes on. Helping Dunham and the rest of the force figure it all out are scientist Dr. Walter Bishop (an appealing John Noble), who\\'s spent the past 17 years locked up in the loony bin and whose research may be responsible for some of the crimes we witness, and his son-babysitter Peter (Joshua Jackson). As for the \"fringe\" element, Dr. Bishop and other, less benign geniuses jump-start a dead man\\'s brain, photograph another victim\\'s cornea in order to access the last thing she saw before death, connect Dunham to her boyfriend so she can experience his memories of the incident that left him comatose, use high-frequency vibrations to enable bank robbers to pass through a solid vault wall, and much, much more.
