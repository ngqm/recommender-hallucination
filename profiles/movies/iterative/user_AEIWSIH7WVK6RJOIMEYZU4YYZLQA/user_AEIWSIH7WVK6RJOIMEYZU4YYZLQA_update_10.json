In exchange for extraordinary powers, Dr. Parnassus (Plummer)makes a deal with the Devil to turn over any child of his when they turn sixteen. But as his daughter Valentina\u2019s (Lily Cole) birthday approaches, a mysterious stranger(Ledger) arrives with the power to change everything.

Times are tight and the quartet is starting to unravel when they rescue Tony, a philanthropist (Heath Ledger, reuniting with Gilliam for the last time), from the Russian mob. Though Anton pines for Valentina, she falls for the new fellow, who charms female viewers into opening up their wallets. Little do the ladies realize they risk their souls when they pass through the Imaginarium, a Mylar mirror that leads to alternate realities (where Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell play Tony\\'s doppelg\u00e4ngers). As it transpires, Parnassus made a Faustian bargain with Mr. Nick (Tom Waits, whom Gilliam considers \"America\\'s greatest musical poet\") centuries before and must supply Satan with five souls by Valentina\\'s 16th birthday or Nick will take her away from him--permanently.
