The issue persists even after we learned in the first edition of this video that corporations are basically sociopaths.  in fact our Supreme Court has declared that corporations are entitled to some of the privileges of individual humans.  Sadly, the necessary sequel does not have all the necessary backup material, nor does it articulate a path forward so that citizens can correct the egregious mistake, such as \"sunsetting\" corporate charters automatically unless they can prove a social benefit.  Yes the sequel is \"necessary\" but not sufficient.\nReview Title: Not as good as the original\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

From the initial screen to the last credits, this movie is a complete failure.  The art deco frame on the initial screen overpowers the information it surrounds.  There is HIP HOP music in a 1920's Charleston era film! The dancing sucks and the crowd scenes are filled with people who don't look at all like people of the era.  The supporting characters are extremely poorly developed and in some cases so wooden that they might as well be mannequins. It is not the fault of the actors, it's the terrible script and direction that they were subjected to. The stage set looks like something concocted by Disney, not at all like a 1920's mansion.  Even DiCaprio's character is only marginally believable.  And to top it all off, the DVD is encrusted with 8 or 9 previews.  Again, save your money for an earlier version, e.g. with Robert Redford.

While a raging storm prevents her crossing, a quiet, modest, and penniless Scottish laird named Torquil (Roger Livesey) slowly wins her cheerfully mercenary heart and upsets her carefully arranged plans with messy emotions. Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger\\'s much-loved romantic drama is a handsome work full of vivid, offbeat characters (Pamela Brown is especially striking as an earthy villager always accompanied by a pack of bloodhounds) living in a world that\\'s part tradition and part myth. Villagers work and celebrate with the simple spirit of common folk (\"We\\'re not poor, we just haven\\'t any money,\" Torquil admonishes the materialist Joan). Powell brings his lively manner and bold visual invention to the creation of his beautiful but harsh primal paradise, culminating in the awesome spectacle of a massive whirlpool that could be the work of the \"legend of Corryvreckan\" or the stormy embodiment of Joan\\'s hysterical heart. Awash in mystic power of ancient castles and chanted legends,', \"I Know Where I'm Going\", \"is one of the most romantic visions of Britain's most magical director.\", '--Sean Axmaker']\n{'Aspect Ratio': '1.33:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'Unrated (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 2.72 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'CRRNKNO30DVD', 'Director': 'Michael Powell, Emeric Pressburger', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Closed-captioned, NTSC, Black & White', 'Run time': '1 hour and 31 minutes', 'Release date': 'June 1, 2010', 'Actors': 'Pamela Brown, Petula Clark, Finlay Currie, Wendy Hiller, Roger Livesey', 'Subtitles': 'English', 'Producers': 'George R.

Some ancients believed it rode on the back of a turtle. The Greeks viewed it as a sphere and measured it with astonishing accuracy. Today, scientists monitor it from space, detecting complex climate patterns that threaten our survival.', 'Narrated by Patrick Stewart', '(', 'X-Men, Star Trek: The Next Generation', '), this fascinating six-part series traces the history of mapmaking from crude clay tablets to sophisticated electronic screens. Internationally respected historians, NASA scientists, and other experts explain how humans rely on imagination, observation, and mathematics to create pictures that make sense of our world. Throughout history, maps have served as symbols of wealth and power, tools of conquest and subjugation, and instruments for saving lives. They once held information worth killing for, and now they offer clues that might avert global destruction.', 'Award-winning actor Patrick Stewart narrates this acclaimed series, produced in consultation with the British Library and Royal Geographical Society--the world\u2019s largest scholarly organization dedicated to the science of geography.', 'SPECIAL FEATURES', '20-page viewer\u2019s guide includes highlights, questions to consider, avenues for further learning, \"Tools of the Mapmaker\u2019s Trade,\" \"The Math Behind a Map,\" and \"Myths on Maps.\"', '20-page viewer\u2019s guide includes highlights, questions to consider, avenues for further learning, \"Tools of the Mapmaker\u2019s Trade,\" \"The Math Behind a Map,\" and \"Myths on Maps.\"', '\"The Chartbusters\": pioneers in cartography', '\"The Chartbusters\": pioneers in cartography', 'Text interview with Patrick Stewart', 'Text interview with Patrick Stewart', 'Biographies of Stewart and series editor Simon Berthon', 'Biographies of Stewart and series editor Simon Berthon', 'Exclusive web extras', 'Exclusive web extras', 'Amazon.com', 'Shown on PBS when the series was first released,', 'The Shape of the World', 'has until now only had limited availability through VHS. Now readily available on DVD, these six 50-minute episodes will, for those of us for whom world geography is a foggy haze, serve as a welcome crash course. Why do maps matter and what are their political implications?

Produced in consultation with the British Library and the Royal Geographical Society, the series functions like a college course: episodes are broken up chronologically and thematically and there\u2019s even a 20-page supplementary booklet that asks pertinent questions about each show. All in all, it reminds one just how arbitrary and subjective drawing up a map can be.', 'Episode One, \"Heaven and Earth,\" starts the series off on a lofty cosmological note, detailing beliefs in Egypt, China, ancient Greece, and Europe regarding the shape of the planet and how Earth was formed. Opening with scenes set at a map-reading ceremony on the island of Java, the episode covers both indigenous cultural views and Western philosophy with adept acuity. Philosophers and museum curators show works of art that encapsulate past beliefs, and the subject matter is far-reaching. Where did Ptolemy\\'s accurate maps disappear to during the Middle Ages? And how does the history of silk production factor into influencing worldviews about a round earth versus a flat one? Each ensuing episode follows similarly. Episodes three and four, \"Staking a Claim\" and \"Empire!\" survey naval exploration of the Americas and the French, English, and Dutch colonization of countries such as India and Australia to illustrate how the New World was mapped out based on a few men\\'s opinions. Native Americans and Indian scholars alike are interviewed on historical topics, and for these reasons the show feels round, as if it\\'s offering a holistic view in efforts to create a more accurate map of public opinion. One of the best parts about the series is that important maps are discussed politically, economically, and artistically.', 'Episode six, \"The Writing on the Screen,\" shows us what in 1990 was a new technology invented for ambulances: GPS driving systems. Though this and other later episodes feature dated computer technology, it is interesting to meditate on our advances and to consider what purposes inventions were originally meant to serve versus what they are presently used for.', '--Trinie Dalton']\n{'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Box set, Color, NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Patrick Stewart', 'Language': 'Unqualified (DTS ES 6.1)', 'Runtime': '5 hours and 6 minutes', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'Unrated (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.5 x 0.8 inches; 10.4 Ounces', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Box set, Color, NTSC', 'Run time': '5 hours and 6 minutes', 'Release date': 'August 4, 2009', 'Actors': 'Patrick Stewart', 'Studio': 'Athena', 'Number of discs': '3'}\nI love maps so I was very interested in this documentary.
