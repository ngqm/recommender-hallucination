The world of Ninjago is in terrible danger. An army of skeletons has invaded from the underworld, under the command of the evil Lord Garmadon. Their goal: capture the Four Weapons of Spinjitzu, artifacts so powerful it is said no one being can wield them all at once. Now Garmadon\u2019s brother, the heroic Sensei Wu, must gather four young men and train them in the ways of the ancient art of Spinjitzu. These four \u2013 Kai, Jay, Zane and Cole \u2013 must become ninja and stand against the dark power of Garmadon and his evil skeleton army. If they fail, the four weapons will be lost and Ninjago doomed forever.', ']]>', 'Amazon.com', 'The two-part adventure', 'Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu', \"is based on a line of toys Lego introduced in 2011. Kai, a young blacksmith, is eager--too eager--to forge a great sword. He initially snubs the unassuming Sensei Wu, the master of Spinjitzu martial arts. When Kai's sister Nya is kidnapped by Samukai and his skeleton army from the Underworld, Wu realizes the evil Garmadon is using Samukai to find four legendary weapons that will give him enormous power. Wu trains Kai to join his student-warriors, Jay, Zane, and Cole, and keep Garmadon from seizing power.\", 'Masters of Spinjitzu', \"is a lightweight, product-based adventure, but it's not a terribly original one.

I wish all of season 3 would be available in the USA, but apparently it's not.  (Why can other countries get it and we can't? Bummer!)  One thing I, as a septuagenarian adult, like very much is that the characters have a moral compass, even though there is the usual cartoon mayhem.  Also, the oriental aesthetic is a refreshing change from the ordinary cartoon graphics.  Well done.\nFrom the grandparents of a 5 year old boy\nLEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu: Season 2\nMichael Helmuth Hansen  (Director),     Trylle Vilstrup  (Director),     Vincent Tong  (Actor),     Kirby Morrow  (Actor)    &                   1                  more   Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Musicals & Performing Arts\n['LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu Season Two', 'Since Lord Garmadon\u2019s disappearance from the Underworld, Ninjago has been at peace; but when Garmadon\u2019s son, Lloyd, releases the five ancient warring tribes of the Serpentine, the Ninja had to learn how to unlock their full potential in order to combat the growing threat.
