From the initial screen to the last credits, this movie is a complete failure.  The art deco frame on the initial screen overpowers the information it surrounds.  There is HIP HOP music in a 1920's Charleston era film! The dancing sucks and the crowd scenes are filled with people who don't look at all like people of the era.  The supporting characters are extremely poorly developed and in some cases so wooden that they might as well be mannequins. It is not the fault of the actors, it's the terrible script and direction that they were subjected to. The stage set looks like something concocted by Disney, not at all like a 1920's mansion.  Even DiCaprio's character is only marginally believable.  And to top it all off, the DVD is encrusted with 8 or 9 previews.  Again, save your money for an earlier version, e.g. with Robert Redford.

But fate has a surprise for everyone when Lloyd is captured by the snakes and Sensei Wu informs the ninjas that they must rescue him.
