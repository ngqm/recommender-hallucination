The four hope to unleash their inner potential in preparation for defending the world against the return of the Dark Lord Garmadon.

Sensei Wu is a wise teacher and the young ninjas develop their skills quickly, learning to use their four special weapons in a way that releases their elemental powers. But fate has a surprise for everyone when Lloyd is captured by the snakes and Sensei Wu informs the ninjas that they must rescue him. The question of which of the four ninjas will become the Green Ninja causes no end of bickering among the boys, even as they work together to rescue Lloyd and save Ninjago from the serpents.

The surprises just keep coming as five tribes of snakes band together in a quest to release an evil monster known as the Devourer, and eventually the ninjas find Lloyd training right alongside them.
