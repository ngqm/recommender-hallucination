When young Yale graduate Theophilus North (Edwards) settles in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1926, he charms the elite with his ability to heal with an unusual energy that flows from his fingertips. But as North gains a reputation as a savior, he simultaneously endures the wrath of the local doctor, who labels him a charlatan. Suddenly this gifted newcomer must defend his honor before his unique talent sparks a backlash that lands him in jail!\", 'Amazon.com', \"T. Theopholis North (Anthony Edwards) is an aspiring adventurer making do as a tutor and reader to the upper-crust in 1920s Newport, Rhode Island, in Danny Huston's enchanting if rough-edged adaptation of Thornton Wilder's\", 'comic novel', \". Equally at home with the rich (Robert Mitchum's blustery but big-hearted philosopher millionaire) and the poor (butler and all-around-town character Harry Dean Stanton), the young man with an electric personality (literally) becomes a liberator, a matchmaker, a reluctant faith healer, and a tonic for a community in the thrall of charlatans. Huston, son of the great John Huston (who helped script the film), is not a deft filmmaker, but he has a welcoming warmth and a contagious affection for his colorful characters. If his cast (which includes Lauren Bacall, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Anjelica Huston, Danny's sister) tends to overplay their parts, it's in the genial spirit of this lighthearted lark.\", '--Sean Axmaker']\n{'Format': 'Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Color, Dubbed, Full Screen, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Anthony Edwards, Harry Dean Stanton, Anjelica Huston, Robert Mitchum, Christopher Durang, James Costigan, Thornton Wilder, John Huston, Mark Metcalf, Mary Stuart Masterson, Virginia Madsen, Danny Huston, Sandra Birnhak Ames, Hunter Carson, David R.
