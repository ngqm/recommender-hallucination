I thought it would be on the lines of \"Sister Act\". A clean comedy with joyful music. It was until someone had to interject profanity into the movie for some strange reason. THEN we had choir members sleeping with each other - yeah - that was funny and so very Christian like. It was so sad to see beautiful voices wasted. And Dolly - what were you thinking??<br /><br /> So - turned it off (after we paid to rent it) and read a book.....\nCould have been great = Slams Christian values\nSeven Days in Utopia\nRobert Duvall  (Actor),     Lucas Black  (Actor),     Matt Russell  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    G    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Independently Distributed, Drama\n[\"SEVEN DAYS IN UTOPIA follows the story of Luke Chisolm (Lucas Black), a talented young golfer set on making the pro tour.
