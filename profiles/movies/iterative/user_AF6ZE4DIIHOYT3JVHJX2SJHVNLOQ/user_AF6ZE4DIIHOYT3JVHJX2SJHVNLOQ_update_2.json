I thought it would be on the lines of \"Sister Act\". A clean comedy with joyful music. It was until someone had to interject profanity into the movie for some strange reason. THEN we had choir members sleeping with each other - yeah - that was funny and so very Christian like. It was so sad to see beautiful voices wasted. And Dolly - what were you thinking??<br /><br /> So - turned it off (after we paid to rent it) and read a book.....\nReview Title: Could have been great = Slams Christian values\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

  "profile": "**Updated User Profile Summary:**\n\n- **Interests:** The user maintains a strong preference for classic Western films, particularly those featuring iconic actors and directors such as John Wayne and John Ford. Recent interactions suggest a growing interest in comedic films with musical elements, though these must align more closely with their values.\n\n- **Viewing Preferences:** Enjoys films with robust narratives focusing on moral themes like courage and justice. However, this recent review indicates a keen sensitivity to content that diverges from traditional values, particularly concerning themes that may be interpreted as disrespectful to Christian values or morality.\n\n- **Rating Behavior:** The user typically rates films highly (5.0 in earlier interactions), but has shown a critical side, as evidenced by a particularly low rating (1.0) for content they found objectionable. This suggests a discerning attitude toward films, particularly regarding the adherence to themes of integrity and respect.\n\n- **Content Engagement:** Values entertainment but exhibits frustration when content appears to undermine the film's potential or its thematic integrity, suggesting that the enjoyment of character-driven narratives must be complemented by a sense of appropriateness.\n\n- **Collection Mindset:** Continues to display a desire to build a personal collection of significant works, particularly those featuring beloved actors, indicating a collector mentality towards classic films.\n\n- **Open-mindedness:** While generally light-hearted in their approach to cinema, the recent review reflects a stricter criterion for enjoyment, particularly regarding the adherence to moral themes.\n\nOverall, the user seeks out classic films that resonate with traditional values and storytelling but is now also showing a more critical stance toward contemporary interpretations of those values in newer films.",
