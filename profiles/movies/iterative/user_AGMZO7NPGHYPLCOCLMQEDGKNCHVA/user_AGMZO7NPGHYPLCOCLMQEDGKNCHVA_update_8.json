In the ruins of what was once North America, twelve remaining districts are forced by the Capitol to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, televised for all to see. 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen becomes a contender in the Games in order to save her little sister from having to compete. Only one of the 24 contenders can survive. To win the Games and return home, Katniss must make choices that weigh survival against humanity and life against love.\", 'Amazon.com', 'Building on her performance as a take-no-prisoners teenager in', \"Winter's Bone\", ', Jennifer Lawrence portrays heroine Katniss Everdeen in Gary Ross\\'s action-oriented adaptation of author-screenwriter Suzanne Collins\\'s young adult bestseller. Set in a dystopian future in which the income gap is greater than ever, 24 underprivileged youth fight to the death every year in a televised spectacle designed to entertain the rich and give the poor enough hope to quell any further unrest--but not too much, warns Panem president Snow (Donald Sutherland), because that would be \"dangerous.\" Hailing from the same mining town, 16-year-olds Katniss and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson,', 'The Kids Are All Right', \") represent District 12 with the help of escort Effie (an unrecognizable Elizabeth Banks) and mentor Haymitch (a scene-stealing Woody Harrelson). At first they're adversaries, but a wary partnership eventually develops, though the rules stipulate that only one contestant can win. For those who haven't read the book, the conclusion is likely to come as a surprise. Before it arrives, Ross (\", 'Pleasantville', \") depicts a society in which the Haves appear to have stepped out of a Dr. Seuss book and the Have-Nots look like refugees from the WPA photographs of Walker Evans. It's an odd mix, made odder still by frenetic fight scenes where it's hard to tell who's doing what to whom.

I saw the movie and was immediately hooked. I appreciate how it appeals to multiple age groups and that, as an adult, I do not have to be embarrassed to admit that I am a District 12 fan. These movies are very well made and nothing that was on the big screen was lost in translation when put onto Blu-Ray discs. All of the imagery and sound quality is still intact and I can enjoy the movie at home just as I did in the theater.\nReview Title: A new favorite\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

After writing the script about a two-bit boxer who gets a \"million-to-one shot\" against the world heavyweight champion, Stallone insisted that he star in the title role, and his equally unknown status helped to catapult him (and this rousing film) to overnight success. The story is familiar, but it has been handled with such vitality and emotional honesty that you can\\'t help but leap and cheer for Rocky Balboa, the chump turned champ (despite his valiant defeat in the ring) who stuns the boxing world with the support of his timid girlfriend, Adrian (Talia Shire), and grizzled trainer, Mickey (Burgess Meredith). Oscar nominations went to all the lead actors (including Burt Young as Adrian\\'s hot-tempered brother), but four sequels could never top the universal appeal of this low-budget crowd pleaser. --', 'Jeff Shannon', 'Review for', 'Rocky II', ':', 'Beginning precisely where Rocky left off, the surprisingly effective 1979 sequel takes the saga of Rocky Balboa to its logical next step, as the palooka turned public idol and media darling returns to his \"normal\" life in Philadelphia with his newlywed bride Adrian (Talia Shire) and some degree of material comfort. He needs to find a job, but boxing champ Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) is challenging Rocky to a lucrative rematch, and despite his doctor\\'s warning against future boxing, Rocky can\\'t resist. Defying the odds that most sequels can\\'t live up to their originals, Rocky II doesn\\'t pack all the punch that Rocky did, but it takes us further into the lives of its now-familiar and beloved characters, and Stallone (as director and star) gives us another rousing finale in the ring. Do you really need to know who wins? --', 'Jeff Shannon', 'Review for', 'Rocky III', ':', 'Rocky III', ': The third installment in the Rocky saga is the last one to matter, and in this case only marginally. The now rich and famous Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) triumphantly pummels a succession of boxing challengers until he encounters Clubber Lang (Mr. T), a human wall of brick who wants a piece of Rocky\\'s action. The Rock\\'s loyal trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) has taken ill and dies, so Rocky recruits retired opponent Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) to whip him into fighting shape after his embarrassing defeat to Clubber. Time for another rematch, mixed in with some family matters involving Rocky\\'s brother-in-law Paulie (Burt Young), who\\'s feeling neglected amid all the hoopla. Not bad as sequels go, boosted by Mr. T.\\'s taunting presence and yet another rousing finale. For those with a bad case of \\'80s nostalgia, the hit theme song \"Eye of the Tiger\" is sure to bring back memories. --', 'Jeff Shannon', 'Review for', 'Rocky IV', ': It was time for Sylvester Stallone to say \"enough, already\" to the boxing hero he plays in the popular Rocky film series, but instead Stallone kept the saga going by pushing Rocky into Rambo territory. The 1985', 'Rocky IV', \"finds the Italian stallion pitted against a seemingly unbeatable Russian monster named Drago (Dolph Lundgren) who lets his wife (Stallone's then-wife, Brigitte Nielsen) do all the talking. With a mighty punch, Drago has sent Rocky's former opponent and trainer Apollo Creed to an early grave, and the boxer responds with the ultimate challenge. Even the Russians are rooting for Rocky, so it's not hard to guess how the film ends. Despite Stallone's claims to the contrary, this installment was followed by\", 'Rocky V', 'in 1990. --', 'Jeff Shannon', 'Review for', 'Rocky Balboa', ': The sixth installment of the', 'Rocky', 'series picks up the story of the Italian Stallion 16 years after the morose', 'Rocky V', \". And sure, at his advanced age, Sylvester Stallone now looks like one of those sides of beef his character used to pound on. No matter. Somehow you buy the premise after all these years, even if it takes forever for Rocky Balboa to stop wallowing in self-pity (Adrian is dead, his old haunts are demolished) and get down to the business of drinking raw eggs and running up staircases. The business at hand is an unlikely exhibition fight with champion Mason Dixon (Antonio Tarver), which the near-sexagenarian Mr. Balboa has no business accepting. Of course, just as sure as the horns of Bill Conti's theme music are even now trumpeting through your head, the ol' Rock might have a punch or two left in him. Stallone wrote and directed, and there isn't much to say except that the movie steps in its pre-determined paces with a canny sense of what has come before (it's practically an homage to all the previous Rocky pictures, complete with fleeting flashbacks). Burt Young is around again, and Geraldine Hughes makes an appealing, rather chaste female companion for Rocky. Stallone's Rocky has gotten suspiciously articulate over the years, but he still knows how to slouch. If Stallone never forgets that, he can probably keep the franchise rolling. --\", 'Robert Horton']\n{'Aspect Ratio': '1.85:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG (Parental Guidance Suggested)', 'Product Dimensions': '6.75 x 5.3 x 1 inches; 4 Ounces', 'Director': 'Sylvester Stallone', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Blu-ray, Box set, Color, Dolby, DTS Surround Sound, Dubbed, Extra tracks, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Run time': '8 hours and 52 minutes', 'Release date': 'November 3, 2009', 'Actors': 'Sylvester Stallone, Burt Young, Carl Weathers, Burgess Meredith, Talia Shire', 'Dubbed': 'French, Spanish', 'Subtitles': 'Spanish, Portuguese', 'Studio': 'MGM (Video & DVD)', 'Writers': 'Sylvester Stallone', 'Number of discs': '7'}\nI still have most of these movies on VHS, if you can believe that.

Set in a dystopian future in which the income gap is greater than ever, 24 underprivileged youth fight to the death every year in a televised spectacle designed to entertain the rich and give the poor enough hope to quell any further unrest--but not too much, warns Panem president Snow (Donald Sutherland), because that would be \"dangerous.\" Hailing from the same mining town, 16-year-olds Katniss and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson,', 'The Kids Are All Right', \") represent District 12 with the help of escort Effie (an unrecognizable Elizabeth Banks) and mentor Haymitch (a scene-stealing Woody Harrelson).
