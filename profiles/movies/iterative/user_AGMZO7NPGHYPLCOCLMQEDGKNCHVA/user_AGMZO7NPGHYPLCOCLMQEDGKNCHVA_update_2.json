Enjoy a heartwarming holiday classic sure to make everyone's Christmas list! PREP & LANDING: NAUGHTY VS.

Instead, he\\'s saddled with a novice partner: Lanny is eager, but he\\'s clearly not the brightest ornament on the tree. When Wayne gets careless and a little boy spots him, the entire elf bureaucracy panics. Of course, Wayne and Lanny save the day, ensuring everyone has a joyous Christmas. Disney brought the \"Prep & Landing\" characters back two years later in \"Naughty vs. Nice.\" A child on the Naughty List has gotten ahold of an elf\\'s fruitcake transmitter and is attempting to hack into Santa\\'s database. Wayne and Lanny accept the mission to recapture the transmitter, joined by Wayne\\'s roisterous younger brother Noel. Both Wayne and the would-be hacker must resolve aching sibling rivalries before Christmas can be merry. The two specials have a more lavish look than most television animation, with richly detailed settings.
