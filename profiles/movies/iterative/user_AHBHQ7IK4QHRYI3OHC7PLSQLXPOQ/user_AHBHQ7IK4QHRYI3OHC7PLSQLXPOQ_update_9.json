Her parents (mother American, father British) then moved to the Fiji Islands and remained there for 15 years. Like many British colonial children, Beatt was sent off to English boarding school and upon finishing, she attended Art College where she discovered the world of independent and experimental cinema. During the 70s she worked in London distributing and exhibiting experimental films before traveling for a year through the Middle East, Iran and India. Beatt moved to Berlin in 1976, where she is now based, and began curating extensive retrospectives for the Arsenal Cinema. She also collaborated with Yvonne Rainer, Joan Jonas, Ulrike Ottinger, and Tilda Swinton on diverse films. Since 1979 Beatt has directed critically acclaimed features and essay films, all presented at international film festivals, such as Study of An Island, the award-winning Fury is a Feeling Too, The Party - Nature Morte and The Invisible Frame. The landscapes, architecture and music, cultures, and social-political histories of Berlin, the Middle East and South Pacific continue to influence her work, as does the quest for formal innovation determined by subject matter. In 1985-86 Beatt returned to the South Seas and traveled through the islands to write a script that delved into the true heart of Fijian life while mirroring European myths of paradise. She is completing the feature A House in Berlin, to be released in 2012, a story of post-Wall Jewish restitution in East Berlin, which inevitably leads the main character to Palestine, to other questions of dispossession and Walls.', 'See more']\nAverage Rating: 3.9\nProduct Details: {'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.25 x 0.5 inches; 4 Ounces', 'Director': 'Cynthia Beatt', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Run time': '1 hour and 27 minutes', 'Release date': 'November 8, 2011', 'Actors': 'Tilda Swinton', 'Studio': 'Icarus Films', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: Two films, circling Berlin with sights you'd  never see otherwise, especially in the earlier of the two before the Wall came down.

Only a few citizens above suspicion, like renowned pro-Socialist playwright Georg Dreyman, were permitted to lead private lives. But when a corrupt government official falls for Georg\\x92s stunning actress-girlfriend, Christa, an ambitious Stasi policeman is ordered to bug the writer\\x92s apartment to gain incriminating evidence against the rival. Now, what the officer discovers is about to dramatically change their lives - as well as his - in this seductive political thriller Peter Travers (Rolling Stone) proclaims is \"the best kind of movie: one you can\\x92t get out of your head.\"', 'Amazon.com', \"Nominated for a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar, this is a first-rate thriller that, like Bertolucci's\", 'The Conformist', \"and Coppola's\", 'The Conversation', ', opts for character development over car chases. The place is East Berlin, the year is 1984, and it all begins with a simple surveillance assignment: Capt. Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich M\u00fche in a restrained, yet deeply felt performance), a Stasi officer and a specialist in this kind of thing, has been assigned to keep an eye on Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch,', 'Black Book', '), a respected playwright, and his actress girlfriend, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck,', 'Mostly Martha', \"). Though Dreyman is known to associate with the occasional dissident, like blacklisted director Albert Jerska (Volkmar Kleinert), his record is spotless. Everything changes when Wiesler discovers that Minister Hempf (Thomas Thieme) has an ulterior motive in spying on this seemingly upright citizen. In other words, it's personal, and Wiesler's sympathies shift from the government to its people--or at least to this one particular person. That would be risky enough, but then Wiesler uses his privileged position to affect a change in Dreyman's life. The God-like move he makes may be minor and untraceable, but it will have major consequences for all concerned, including Wiesler himself. Writer/director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck starts with a simple premise that becomes more complicated and emotionally involving as his assured debut unfolds.
