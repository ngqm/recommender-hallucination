[Blu-ray]\nReview Date: 2012/12/26\nStore: George Clooney  (Actor),     John Turturro  (Actor),     Joel Coen  (Director, Writer),     Roger Deakins  (Director)    &                   1                  more   Rated:    PG-13    Format: Blu-ray\nCategories: Movies & TV, Blu-ray, Movies\nProduct Description: ['Product Description', 'George Clooney (', 'The Perfect Storm', ') and John Turturro (', 'Cars 2', \")embark on the adventure of a lifetime in this hilarious, offbeat road picture. And now, for the first time, this quirky gem shines more brightly than ever in Blu-ray High Definition! Fed up with crushing rocks on a prison farm in Mississippi, the dapper, silver-tongued Ulysses Everett McGill (Clooney) busts loose...except he's still shackled to two misfits from his chain gang: bad-tempered Pete (Turturro), and sweet, dimwitted Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson). With nothing to lose and buried loot to regain, the three embark on a riotous odyssey filled with chases, close calls, near misses and betrayal. Experience every unpredictable moment as it plays out in the crystal-clear sound and breathtaking picture quality of Blu-ray.

Our wandering hero in this case is one Ulysses Everett McGill, a slick-tongued wise guy with a thing about hair pomade (George Clooney, blithely sending up his own dapper image) who talks his chain-gang buddies (Coen-movie regular John Turturro and newcomer Tim Blake Nelson) into lighting out after some buried loot he claims to know of. En route they come up against a prophetic blind man on a railroad truck, a burly, one-eyed baddie (the ever-magnificent John Goodman), a trio of sexy singing ladies, a blues guitarist who's sold his soul to the devil, a brace of crooked politicos on the stump, a manic-depressive bank robber, and--well, you get the idea. Into this, their most relaxed film yet, the Coens have tossed a beguiling ragbag of inconsequential situations, a wealth of looping, left-field dialogue, and a whole stash of gags both verbal and visual. O Brother (the title's lifted from Preston Sturges's classic 1941 comedy\", \"Sullivan's Travels\", \") is furthermore graced with glowing, burnished photography from Roger Deakins and a masterly soundtrack from T-Bone Burnett that pays loving homage to American '30s folk styles--blues, gospel, bluegrass, jazz, and more. And just to prove that the brothers haven't lost their knack for bad-taste humor, we get a Ku Klux Klan rally choreographed like a cross between a Nuremberg rally and a Busby Berkeley musical. --\", 'Philip Kemp']\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Comedy', 'Format': 'Blu-ray, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Wayne Duvall, Ed Gale, Daniel Von Bargen, Ray McKinnon, Brian Reddy, Del Pentecost, Joel Coen, Chris Thomas King, Michael Badalucco, J.R.
