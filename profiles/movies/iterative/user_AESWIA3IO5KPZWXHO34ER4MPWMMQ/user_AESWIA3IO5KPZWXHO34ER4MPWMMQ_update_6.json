Trouble is, Earp (Garner, Twilight, Maverick) has been hired to work as a technical expert on the film - and this doesn't sit too well with the big at-the-top-of-his-career movie star Mix. Even worse... Earp doesn't take too well to movie moguls and the fancy studio life. So, Old West and New Hollywood collide and inadvertently become a vivid backdrop for one of the most shocking murder mysteries ever to scorch the silver screen. Come back to a lost time when movies were movies, murders were mayhem and heroes were just plain outrageous, in SUNSET... the action-packed adventure this side of Hollywood and Vine.

I had it and lost it accidentally so when I discovered this here and, while high, at a great price compared to others (smile). It is a very funny DVD with Bruce Willis and James Garner being tongue-in-cheek funny.

And now, for the first time, this quirky gem shines more brightly than ever in Blu-ray High Definition! Fed up with crushing rocks on a prison farm in Mississippi, the dapper, silver-tongued Ulysses Everett McGill (Clooney) busts loose...except he's still shackled to two misfits from his chain gang: bad-tempered Pete (Turturro), and sweet, dimwitted Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson). With nothing to lose and buried loot to regain, the three embark on a riotous odyssey filled with chases, close calls, near misses and betrayal. Experience every unpredictable moment as it plays out in the crystal-clear sound and breathtaking picture quality of Blu-ray. Populated with strange characters, including a blind prophet, sexy sirens, and a one-eyed Bible salesman (John Goodman),\", 'O Brother, Where Art Thou', '? will leave you laughing at every outrageous and surprising twist and turn', 'Amazon.com', 'Only Joel and Ethan Coen, the fraternal director and producer team behind art-house hits such as', 'The Big Lebowski', 'and', 'Fargo', \"and masters of quirky and ultra-stylish genre subversion, would dare nick the plot line of Homer's Odyssey for a comic picaresque saga about three cons on the run in 1930s Mississippi. Our wandering hero in this case is one Ulysses Everett McGill, a slick-tongued wise guy with a thing about hair pomade (George Clooney, blithely sending up his own dapper image) who talks his chain-gang buddies (Coen-movie regular John Turturro and newcomer Tim Blake Nelson) into lighting out after some buried loot he claims to know of. En route they come up against a prophetic blind man on a railroad truck, a burly, one-eyed baddie (the ever-magnificent John Goodman), a trio of sexy singing ladies, a blues guitarist who's sold his soul to the devil, a brace of crooked politicos on the stump, a manic-depressive bank robber, and--well, you get the idea. Into this, their most relaxed film yet, the Coens have tossed a beguiling ragbag of inconsequential situations, a wealth of looping, left-field dialogue, and a whole stash of gags both verbal and visual. O Brother (the title's lifted from Preston Sturges's classic 1941 comedy\", \"Sullivan's Travels\", \") is furthermore graced with glowing, burnished photography from Roger Deakins and a masterly soundtrack from T-Bone Burnett that pays loving homage to American '30s folk styles--blues, gospel, bluegrass, jazz, and more. And just to prove that the brothers haven't lost their knack for bad-taste humor, we get a Ku Klux Klan rally choreographed like a cross between a Nuremberg rally and a Busby Berkeley musical. --\", 'Philip Kemp']\n{'Genre': 'Comedy', 'Format': 'Blu-ray, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Wayne Duvall, Ed Gale, Daniel Von Bargen, Ray McKinnon, Brian Reddy, Del Pentecost, Joel Coen, Chris Thomas King, Michael Badalucco, J.R.

I have fluctuated between #1 and #2 of the Sweating' program with my VHS copies and it was past time to get this on DVD.  The quality is great and while I haven't used #3-#5 of the DVDs, I'm sure they are just as good.  This is a great starter exercise program, especially if you haven't exercised in a while.  The songs are fun and the moves very easy.  The people working with Richard are all different sizes (i.e., not perfect size 6's) so you can workout without being intimidated by skinny people (smile).  Richard Simmons may come across as hokey but you can't fault that this form of exercise is enjoyable!

It really isn't THAT sweet because underneath the story of a woman who rents a p\u00e2tisserie and specializes in chocolate - amazing, chocolate decadence - is some ugliness.  It really makes you want to learn how to make all her chocolate goodness but it is a story of bias.  It is a story of fear and hatred of what is not known.
