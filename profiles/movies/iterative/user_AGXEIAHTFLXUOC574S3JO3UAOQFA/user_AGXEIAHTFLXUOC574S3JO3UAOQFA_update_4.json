It was a witty take on the original.\nLove It\n{'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['David Gelb'], 'Producers': ['Kevin Iwashina', 'Tom Pelligrini'], 'Starring': ['Jiro Ono'], 'Studio': ['Tribeca Shortlist']}\nWe love sushi (invited our sushi chef to our wedding) and are always looking to try new and amazing food.
