I like to watch it when I'm doing stuff around the house or working from home.\nFun & a little predictable\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English', 'English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Baz Luhrmann'], 'Producers': ['Baz Luhrmann', 'Catherine Martin', 'Douglas Wick', 'Lucy Fisher', 'Catherine Knapman'], 'Starring': ['Leonardo DiCaprio', 'Tobey Maguire', 'Carey Mulligan'], 'Studio': ['Warner Bros.']}\nIt wasn't up to the typical Baz movies. Just felt it was overhyped and trying too hard to be something else but didn't quite make it.\nNot the Best\n{'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Dan Scanlon'], 'Producers': ['Pete Docter', 'John Lasseter', 'Nicole Paradis Grindle', 'Kori Rae', 'Andrew Stanton', 'Lee Unkrich'], 'Starring': ['Billy Crystal', 'John Goodman', 'Steve Buscemi', 'Helen Mirren'], 'Studio': ['Pixar']}\nI'm a big dork and have always loved cartoons and ESPECIALLY Pixar/Dreamworks/etc.  it's great for kids (animation, slap-stick type comedy) but also has the double entendre for the adults watching too. It was a witty take on the original.\nLove It\n{'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['David Gelb'], 'Producers': ['Kevin Iwashina', 'Tom Pelligrini'], 'Starring': ['Jiro Ono'], 'Studio': ['Tribeca Shortlist']}\nWe love sushi (invited our sushi chef to our wedding) and are always looking to try new and amazing food. The story is well told and watching this just makes us want to go to Japan. If you are into food, sushi or are just curios, I highly recommend this movie.\nWell Done\n{'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Paul Feig'], 'Producers': ['Peter Chernin', 'Jenno Topping', 'Paul Feig', 'Michele Imperato Stabile', 'Dylan Clark'], 'Starring': ['Sandra Bullock', 'Melissa McCarthy', 'Demi\u00e1n Bichir'], 'Studio': ['Fox']}\nIt's a bit crass and predictable - but some of Melissa McCartney's lines are absolutely hilarious.
