Mumble, The Master of Tap, has a problem because his tiny son, Erik, is choreo-phobic. Reluctant to dance, Erik runs away and encounters The Mighty Sven - a penguin who can fly!

When Erik sees the puffin Mighty Sven (Hank Azaria), he decides he can learn to fly: Sven is the leader of a cult that preaches if you believe it, it can happen. An unexplained seismic event causes a glacier to shift, trapping Gloria and all the other emperor penguins: Mumble, Erik, and two other chicks must rescue them before they starve. What begins as a familiar story about a diffident chick quickly becomes needlessly and hopelessly mired in subplots involving elephant seals, skua gulls, human explorers, and a pair of renegade krill (voiced by Brad Pitt and Matt Damon). The motion-capture animation is adequate at best, with snow and water splashing around the dancing penguins to hide the fact that their feet aren't making contact with the ground plane.
