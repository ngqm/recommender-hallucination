One is a cop. The other is a killer. Clint Eastwood is Wes Block, a lawman walking a Tightrope separating him from the man he strives to be and the man he fears he is. When investigating brutal sex murders, he uncovers a link between himself and the suspect. To the killer, the only good hooker is a dead one \u2013 especially if she\u2019s been with Block. Soon no woman who knows Block is safe, including those dearest to him (Genevieve Bujold and Alison Eastwood). Showcasing New Orleans at its moody best, writer/director Richard Tuggle (Escape from Alcatraz) adds shadings to Block that make him more than a stoic action hero. And Eastwood grabs the challenge with one of his best performances ever.']\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Drama, Suspense', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Clint Eastwood, Genevi\u00e8ve Bujold', 'Initial release date': '2010-06-01', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1), Unqualified', 'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 0.01 Ounces', 'Item model number': '120253', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Run time': '1 hour and 54 minutes', 'Release date': 'June 1, 2010', 'Actors': 'Clint Eastwood, Genevi\u00e8ve Bujold', 'Subtitles': 'Portuguese, Spanish, Korean, French, English, Japanese, Thai', 'Producers': 'Clint Eastwood', 'Studio': 'Studio Distribution Services', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: It's ok.\nReview Title: Ok movie\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

As star and director of White Hunter, Black Heart, Clint Eastwood crafts one of the most acclaimed movies of his enduring career. He plays brilliant, driven filmmaker John Wilson (loosely based on the legendary John Huston), who\u2019s determined to turn his new project in Africa into a grand personal adventure hunting a wild elephant. Jeff Fahey, Marisa Berenson and George Dzundza co-star in this rugged and absorbing tale from the novel by co-screenwriter Peter Viertel, who worked with Huston in Africa in 1950 on The African Queen. Filmed in Zimbabwe and London, White Hunter, Black Heart is a bold trek into the heart of adventure.
