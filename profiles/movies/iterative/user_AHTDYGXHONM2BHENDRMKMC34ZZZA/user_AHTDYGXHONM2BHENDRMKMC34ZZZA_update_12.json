All of the other movies in this series followed the plot line, having a good climactic encounter with the good and bad guys and a happy conclusion.<br /><br />None of the key elements of a great movie are in this one.

So, had to see the sequel. It's just as good as the first. But, there was so much vulgarity in it, I felt a little let down that they had to go that far with it, to push the 'anti-hero' theme.\nA great sequel to the original Dead Pool. But, much more vulgarity.\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'Fran\u00e7ais (Canada)', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a)', 'Italiano', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', 'Polski', '\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e', 'Portugu\u00eas', 'Deutsch', 'Fran\u00e7ais (France)'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', 'Deutsch [UT]', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica) [CC]', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a) [CC]', 'Fran\u00e7ais [CC]', 'Italiano [CC]', 'Nederlands [CC]', 'Polski', 'Portugu\u00eas', 'Portugu\u00eas [SDH]', 'Svenska'], 'Directors': ['Steven Spielberg'], 'Producers': ['Adam Somner', 'Daniel Lupi', 'Chris Defaria', 'Bruce Berman', 'Donald De Line', 'Kristie Macosko Krieger', 'Steven Spielberg', 'Dan Farah'], 'Starring': ['Tye Sheridan', 'Olivia Cooke', 'Ben Mendelsohn'], 'Studio': ['WARNER BROS.']}\nI like the concept, how they integrated characters from so many of the classic video games. That is what really made the movie. Also, the movie itself was like a video game. That's fun for all you gamers. But, like they sometimes do, in Hollywood, they put all the best scenes in the trailer. So, there weren't any real great scenes left to impress you, as you watched the movie.\nThe best scenes were in the trailers, but it's still a good movie.\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Anthony Russo', 'Joe Russo'], 'Producers': ['Kevin Feige'], 'Starring': ['Robert Downey Jr.', 'Chris Hemsworth', 'Mark Ruffalo'], 'Studio': ['Marvel']}\nIf you're an Avengers fan, and haven't seen this movie yet, it's a must see. I was a little lost, at first. Because I missed one or two of the movies leading up to this one. (How the hell did Thor lose his eye?) The cliffhanger at the end was both shocking and awesome. The directors did a good job. I'm fairly salivating for the next installment of the Avengers franchise!\nThe best Avengers movie yet!\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Tyler Perry'], 'Producers': ['Mark E. Swinton', 'Will Areu', 'Tyler Perry'], 'Starring': ['Tiffany Haddish', 'Tika Sumpter', 'Omari Hardwick'], 'Studio': ['Paramount Pictures']}\nI like the Madea character. I like the Madea movies. Of all the Tyler Perry movies, the comedies are the best. His dramas all fall flat on their face. His scripts are too predictable, characters too flat, story lines are like ruts on a muddy road. They follow a path, unwavering, till they get stuck... and.... die. Tiffany Haddish is great in this role. As are the other actors. They all make the movie tolerable. Some movies are larger than the actors in them. These actors are MUCH better than the movie they're in.\nIt's still a Tyler Perry movie.\nRear Window\nSuspense, Atmospheric, Compelling, Harrowing\n['A bored, injured photojournalist confined to his apartment has no choice but to busy himself with observing his neighbors. His voyeurism becomes detective work, however, when he witnesses a murder. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock.']\n{'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Alfred Hitchcock'], 'Producers': ['Alfred Hitchcock'], 'Starring': ['James Stewart', 'Grace Kelly', 'Wendell Corey']}\nFirst, I didn't actually rent this video. Somehow, someone hacked my Prime account and rented it. I'm sure it was just a test, to see if they could. I have since changed my password. However, I CAN tell you that, if you haven't seen this movie before, it's one worth watching. It's one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films. And, Jimmy Stewart was perfect in the leading role. I've seen it a few times over the years and really enjoyed it. In fact, there was a remake about ten years ago. But, the first is still the best.\nJimmy Stewart and Alfred Hitchcock!\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Roland Emmerich'], 'Producers': ['Bradley Fischer', 'Harald Kloser', 'James Vanderbilt', 'Larry Franco', 'Laeta Kalogridis', 'Roland Emmerich'], 'Starring': ['Channing Tatum', 'Jamie Foxx', 'Maggie Gyllenhaal'], 'Studio': ['Columbia Pictures']}\nIt's a fun movie. Almost like a take off of Olympus has fallen. But, with enough comedic quality to make it just campy enough to enjoy, without going overboard like 'Airplane'. All of the acting was well done. The special effects were great. The movie kind of reminded me of Independence Day. But, a little funnier in parts. Worth watching.\nKind of like Olympus has fallen. But campy like Independence Day.\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Gregory Hoblit'], 'Producers': ['Charles Roven', 'Dawn Steel'], 'Starring': ['Denzel Washington', 'John Goodman', 'Donald Sutherland'], 'Studio': ['WARNER BROS.']}\nHonestly, my wife and I don't even remember watching it. So, it must not have been THAT great, or that bad. Either way, I'm sure we would have some kind of recollection of that movie. So, in all fairness, I have to go down the middle of the road here and give it three stars.\nNot memorable.\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', 'Espa\u00f1ol'], 'Directors': ['Derrick Borte'], 'Producers': ['Mark Gill', 'Andrew Gunn'], 'Starring': ['Russell Crowe', 'Caren Pistorius', 'Gabriel Bateman'], 'Studio': ['Solstice Studios']}\nFirst, Russel Crow has gotten REALLY FAT! And, I don't think he did it just for this movie. I think that his weight gain may be the reason why he was selected for this role, though.<br /><br />This movie really will keep you on the edge of your seat. Some scenes are pretty shocking. And the ending was a total surprise, and a little cheesy. But, still good.<br /><br />It was well worth the ticket. Five stars.\nOn the edge of your seat, for the whole movie!\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Andy Serkis'], 'Producers': ['Avi Arad', 'Matt Tolmach', 'Amy Pascal'], 'Starring': ['Tom Hardy', 'Woody Harrelson', 'Michelle Williams'], 'Studio': ['SONY PICTURES ENTERTAINMENT', 'INC.']}\nSequels rarely measure up to the firsts. This one does. It's just as much fun, just as crazy. Woody Harrelson is very believable as the bad guy. Good movie for a 'staying home tonight' watch.\nLet there be FUN!\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Matt Reeves'], 'Producers': ['Michael E. Uslan', 'Walter Hamada', 'Chantal Nong Vo', 'Simon Emanuel', 'Dylan Clark', 'Matt Reeves'], 'Starring': ['Robert Pattinson', 'Zo\u00eb Kravitz', 'Jeffrey Wright'], 'Studio': ['MGM']}\nI have seen every Batman pic ever produced. This one is by far the most deeply engaging one I have ever seen. It's a very dark portrayal of the Dark Night. It's also very 'realistic' in the sense that Batman doesn't have a thousand super futuristic gadgets, monstrous car, motorcycle and plane at his disposal. Bruce Wayne has some serious issues. The villains aren't ultra-rich megalomaniacs. Just common thugs. Catwoman is a pretty regular girl. But, the things that make Batman who he is still stand out. He's a detective. He doesn't use guns. He operates covertly. He has one ally in Gotham PD, Mr. Gordon, who becomes the Commissioner during the movie. The Penguin is there. As is the Riddler.<br /><br />The entire movie is dark, oppressive and sinister. But, Batman is very human and a great Samaritan.  I love this movie and am going to watch it again, and again and again.\nThe most engaging Batman movie, EVER!\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium', 'Espa\u00f1ol'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', 'Espa\u00f1ol'], 'Directors': ['Martin Campbell'], 'Producers': ['Cathy Schulman', 'Moshe Diamant', 'Rupert Maconick', 'Michael Heimler', 'Arthur Sarkissian'], 'Starring': ['Liam Neeson', 'Guy Pearce', 'Monica Bellucci']}\nLiam is an outstanding character actor. He may not be a superstar like John Wayne. But, he definitely delivers in every one of his films. He knows his genre and sticks with it. Memory is one of his better films.\nLiam Neeson does his thing!\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Pierre Coffin', 'Kyle Balda'], 'Producers': ['Christopher Meledandri', 'Janet Healy'], 'Starring': ['Steve Carell', 'Kristen Wiig', 'Trey Parker'], 'Studio': ['Universal Pictures']}\nThe best thing about all of the Despicable Me movies is all the visual comedy, schtick.
