Somehow, someone hacked my Prime account and rented it. I'm sure it was just a test, to see if they could. I have since changed my password. However, I CAN tell you that, if you haven't seen this movie before, it's one worth watching. It's one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films. And, Jimmy Stewart was perfect in the leading role. I've seen it a few times over the years and really enjoyed it. In fact, there was a remake about ten years ago. But, the first is still the best.\nReview Title: Jimmy Stewart and Alfred Hitchcock!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

So, had to see the sequel. It's just as good as the first. But, there was so much vulgarity in it, I felt a little let down that they had to go that far with it, to push the 'anti-hero' theme.\nA great sequel to the original Dead Pool. But, much more vulgarity.\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'Fran\u00e7ais (Canada)', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a)', 'Italiano', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', 'Polski', '\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e', 'Portugu\u00eas', 'Deutsch', 'Fran\u00e7ais (France)'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', 'Deutsch [UT]', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica) [CC]', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a) [CC]', 'Fran\u00e7ais [CC]', 'Italiano [CC]', 'Nederlands [CC]', 'Polski', 'Portugu\u00eas', 'Portugu\u00eas [SDH]', 'Svenska'], 'Directors': ['Steven Spielberg'], 'Producers': ['Adam Somner', 'Daniel Lupi', 'Chris Defaria', 'Bruce Berman', 'Donald De Line', 'Kristie Macosko Krieger', 'Steven Spielberg', 'Dan Farah'], 'Starring': ['Tye Sheridan', 'Olivia Cooke', 'Ben Mendelsohn'], 'Studio': ['WARNER BROS.']}\nI like the concept, how they integrated characters from so many of the classic video games. That is what really made the movie. Also, the movie itself was like a video game. That's fun for all you gamers. But, like they sometimes do, in Hollywood, they put all the best scenes in the trailer. So, there weren't any real great scenes left to impress you, as you watched the movie.\nThe best scenes were in the trailers, but it's still a good movie.\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Anthony Russo', 'Joe Russo'], 'Producers': ['Kevin Feige'], 'Starring': ['Robert Downey Jr.', 'Chris Hemsworth', 'Mark Ruffalo'], 'Studio': ['Marvel']}\nIf you're an Avengers fan, and haven't seen this movie yet, it's a must see. I was a little lost, at first. Because I missed one or two of the movies leading up to this one. (How the hell did Thor lose his eye?) The cliffhanger at the end was both shocking and awesome. The directors did a good job. I'm fairly salivating for the next installment of the Avengers franchise!\nThe best Avengers movie yet!\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Tyler Perry'], 'Producers': ['Mark E.

Of all the Tyler Perry movies, the comedies are the best. His dramas all fall flat on their face. His scripts are too predictable, characters too flat, story lines are like ruts on a muddy road. They follow a path, unwavering, till they get stuck... and.... die. Tiffany Haddish is great in this role. As are the other actors. They all make the movie tolerable. Some movies are larger than the actors in them. These actors are MUCH better than the movie they're in.\nIt's still a Tyler Perry movie.\nRear Window\nSuspense, Atmospheric, Compelling, Harrowing\n['A bored, injured photojournalist confined to his apartment has no choice but to busy himself with observing his neighbors.
