The centerpiece of the movie is a little girl (Zelda Harris) who views the ups and downs of her parents' experiences (mom and dad are played by Delroy Lindo and Alfre Woodard), and who navigates the life of her neighborhood. Lee tosses in a lot of '70s detail (watching\", 'The Partridge Family', \") and other diversions (Harris's journey through suburbia), but he has no master sensibility controlling the flow of it all. The film is more wearying than anything, although bright spots include Lindo's fine performance as a talented man suffering from irrelevance.\", '--Tom Keogh']\n{'Aspect Ratio': '1.85:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.38 x 0.6 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': '2020515', 'Director': 'Spike Lee', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Closed-captioned, Anamorphic, Color, NTSC, Widescreen, Dolby', 'Run time': '1 hour and 54 minutes', 'Release date': 'September 1, 2015', 'Actors': 'Alfre Woodard, Delroy Lindo, Spike Lee, David Patrick Kelly, Zelda Harris', 'Dubbed': 'French', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish', 'Producers': 'Spike Lee', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1), French (Dolby Digital 5.1), Unqualified', 'Studio': 'Universal Pictures Home Entertainment', 'Writers': 'Joie Susannah Lee, Cinque Lee, Spike Lee', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nOne of my favorite films from my chilhood.
