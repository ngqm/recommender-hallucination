I know that seems weird but as a native New Yorker, I just love the scenes between a mom and her son in front of the most spectacular Christmas Tree in the world.  So, there it is.<br /><br />The movie isn't particularly bad or good.  Pretty much the same formula as the first movie with just a few more predictable changes.  But I don't mind sitting through it and going along for the ride.  I could do far worse.\nReview Title: Guilty Pleasure - okay movie\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Hayao Miyazaki\\'s latest triumph, filled with astonishing animation and epic adventure, is a dazzling masterpiece for the ages. It\\'s a \"wonderfully welcoming work of art that\\'s as funny and entertaining as it is brilliant, beautiful, and deep\" (Joe Morgenstern, Wall Street Journal). SPIRITED AWAY is a wondrous fantasy about a young girl, Chihiro, trapped in a strange new world of spirits. When her parents undergo a mysterious transformation, she must call upon the courage she never knew she had to free herself and return her family to the outside world. An unforgettable story brimming with creativity, SPIRITED AWAY will take you on a journey beyond your imagination. \"To enter the world of Hayao Miyazaki is to experience a kind of lighthearted enchantment that is unique to the world of animation\" (Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times). It\\'s a fantastic tale the whole family will want to experience over and over again.~~(c) 2001 Nibariki -- GNDDTM', 'Set Contains:', 'The most interesting extra feature on the two-disc set is the Nippon Television Special on the making of', 'Spirited Away', ', not because it\\'s significantly different from American making-of programs, but because the camera crew was allowed to film Miyazaki at work. It\\'s fascinating to watch the visionary director explaining how individual movements should be animated, and even performing the little dance the frog-master does to welcome the No-Face to Yubaba\\'s bath house. (Old animators describe Walt Disney giving similar performances, but no comparable footage exists.) It\\'s also striking to see how intimate Studio Ghibli is, unencumbered by the tiers of management that burden American studios. The scene comparisons enable the viewer to study the storyboards for the film, which Miyazaki draws himself. These simple yet wonderfully vivid images capture the essence of a mood, a movement, an expression. \"Behind the Microphone\" offers a fairly standard behind-the-scenes look at the creation of the excellent English version of', 'Spirited Away', '.', '--Charles Solomon']\n{'Genre': 'Fantasy', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Animated, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Hayao Miyazaki', 'Language': 'French (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround), Japanese (Dolby Digital 5.1), English (Dolby Digital 5.1), Unqualified', 'Runtime': '2 hours and 5 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.78:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG (Parental Guidance Suggested)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.57 x 5.3 x 7.52 inches; 4.32 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'UPC# 7869 3621 3843', 'Director': 'Hayao Miyazaki', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Animated, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Run time': '2 hours and 5 minutes', 'Release date': 'April 15, 2003', 'Studio': 'Walt Disney Home Entertainment Presents A Studio Ghibli Film', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nTo try and describe this movie is kind of crazy.  I mean there's this little girl in a world inhabited by strange and curious spirits who must rescue her parents from a frightening and terrible fate. But the journey is so much more than a simple description.<br /><br />The animation is just gorgeous, the story is captivating and unique, and the musical score is so haunting and beautiful, you will find yourself remembering the themes long after the movie is over.

It's never been re- broadcast that I could tell and I just figured for the price why not buy it.<br /><br />There was nothing on tv worth watching so we popped the film in and had a really enjoyable time watching it. In fact it is eons better than some of the garbage currently on.<br /><br />Great love story, top notch actors and a pretty decent story. For a couple of hours I escaped into a very pleasant movie.<br /><br />If anyone out there has any influence, please get some network to give this film some air time. If even if its just on the Lifetime channel.  I'm certain the viewers would love it.\nFun movie - even if a tad bit dated\nHOME ALONE 2: LOST IN NEW YORK\nMacaulay Culkin  (Actor),     Joe Pesci  (Actor),     Chris Columbus  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Studio Specials, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, Kids & Family, Family Features\n['Macaulay Culkin, Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern.
