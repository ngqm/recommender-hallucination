Hayao Miyazaki\\'s latest triumph, filled with astonishing animation and epic adventure, is a dazzling masterpiece for the ages. It\\'s a \"wonderfully welcoming work of art that\\'s as funny and entertaining as it is brilliant, beautiful, and deep\" (Joe Morgenstern, Wall Street Journal). SPIRITED AWAY is a wondrous fantasy about a young girl, Chihiro, trapped in a strange new world of spirits. When her parents undergo a mysterious transformation, she must call upon the courage she never knew she had to free herself and return her family to the outside world. An unforgettable story brimming with creativity, SPIRITED AWAY will take you on a journey beyond your imagination. \"To enter the world of Hayao Miyazaki is to experience a kind of lighthearted enchantment that is unique to the world of animation\" (Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times). It\\'s a fantastic tale the whole family will want to experience over and over again.~~(c) 2001 Nibariki -- GNDDTM', 'Set Contains:', 'The most interesting extra feature on the two-disc set is the Nippon Television Special on the making of', 'Spirited Away', ', not because it\\'s significantly different from American making-of programs, but because the camera crew was allowed to film Miyazaki at work. It\\'s fascinating to watch the visionary director explaining how individual movements should be animated, and even performing the little dance the frog-master does to welcome the No-Face to Yubaba\\'s bath house. (Old animators describe Walt Disney giving similar performances, but no comparable footage exists.) It\\'s also striking to see how intimate Studio Ghibli is, unencumbered by the tiers of management that burden American studios. The scene comparisons enable the viewer to study the storyboards for the film, which Miyazaki draws himself. These simple yet wonderfully vivid images capture the essence of a mood, a movement, an expression. \"Behind the Microphone\" offers a fairly standard behind-the-scenes look at the creation of the excellent English version of', 'Spirited Away', '.', '--Charles Solomon']\n{'Genre': 'Fantasy', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Animated, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Hayao Miyazaki', 'Language': 'French (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround), Japanese (Dolby Digital 5.1), English (Dolby Digital 5.1), Unqualified', 'Runtime': '2 hours and 5 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.78:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG (Parental Guidance Suggested)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.57 x 5.3 x 7.52 inches; 4.32 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'UPC# 7869 3621 3843', 'Director': 'Hayao Miyazaki', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Animated, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Run time': '2 hours and 5 minutes', 'Release date': 'April 15, 2003', 'Studio': 'Walt Disney Home Entertainment Presents A Studio Ghibli Film', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nTo try and describe this movie is kind of crazy.  I mean there's this little girl in a world inhabited by strange and curious spirits who must rescue her parents from a frightening and terrible fate. But the journey is so much more than a simple description.<br /><br />The animation is just gorgeous, the story is captivating and unique, and the musical score is so haunting and beautiful, you will find yourself remembering the themes long after the movie is over.

It's never been re- broadcast that I could tell and I just figured for the price why not buy it.<br /><br />There was nothing on tv worth watching so we popped the film in and had a really enjoyable time watching it. In fact it is eons better than some of the garbage currently on.<br /><br />Great love story, top notch actors and a pretty decent story. For a couple of hours I escaped into a very pleasant movie.<br /><br />If anyone out there has any influence, please get some network to give this film some air time.

I know that seems weird but as a native New Yorker, I just love the scenes between a mom and her son in front of the most spectacular Christmas Tree in the world.  So, there it is.<br /><br />The movie isn't particularly bad or good.  Pretty much the same formula as the first movie with just a few more predictable changes.  But I don't mind sitting through it and going along for the ride.

She says that you don't feel a lot of pressure and the pace is perfect for a person who hasn't exercised a lot in their life and wants to gradually get into it.

The story is basically an updated version of the whole \"boy on the milk carton\" scenario, revised as the \"boy on the website\".  Clever and plausible.<br /><br />Need something to watch when you're out of options - this film is a good choice for some fueled up energy and an entertaining night at the movies.\nKeeps your attention - entertaining\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Robson', 'Mark'], 'Producers': ['David Weisbart'], 'Starring': ['Barbara Parkins', 'Patty Duke', 'Paul Burke'], 'Studio': ['Crowd Pleasers']}\nEvery now & then I just feel like watching something totally mindless and brain dead (not me, the movie!) and this perfectly fits the bill.<br /><br />The story, the setting, the horrific attempts at acting and the complete unavailability of some type of cohesive editing make this film the ideal candidate for those rainy days when Lifetime Channel is showing something you've seen one too many times.  In fact, it's more like horrific success at over-acting that leaves me mesmerized.<br /><br />Don't worry too much about the story of three young women of the 60's trying to succeed in modeling, film, broadway and love.  Just sit back with a chilled bottle of wine, some crackers & cheese, and a couple of hours to give yourself a break and have a totally entertaining afternoon at \"camp\".\nTotal camp, terrible acting - love it!\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Joseph Sargent'], 'Producers': ['Synergy Ent'], 'Starring': ['Sally Field', 'Eleanor Parker', 'Lane Bradbury'], 'Studio': ['The Film Detective']}\nI hadn't seen this movie since the 70's when it was an \"ABC Movie of the Week\", but it always stayed in my mind.<br /><br />The story of youth wanting to run away from the constraints of misguided adults is as old as time.  And although the clothes, characters, music and some of the dialogue is a little dated, the feelings are the same. Generational breakdown in communication pure & simple. Everyone has wanted to run away & join the circus at some point in their life.<br /><br />The acting is what actually sets this film apart from many of that period.  A very young Sally Fields, Jackie Cooper, Eleanor Parker, and a sadly under-used David Carradine (pre \"Kung Fu\") elevate this film.<br /><br />I think its worth watching & especially since Amazon offers it for free with your Prime membership. A whole lot better than most of the garbage out there right now.\nWorth the trip down Memory Lane\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'frightening scenes', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['William Castle'], 'Producers': ['William Castle', 'Robb White'], 'Starring': ['Vincent Price', 'Richard Long', 'Carolyn Craid'], 'Studio': ['More to Explore']}\nA teriffic old time scary haunted house story complete with clueless guests, skanky wife, possible infidelity, things that go bump in the night and the Master himself - Vincent Price.
