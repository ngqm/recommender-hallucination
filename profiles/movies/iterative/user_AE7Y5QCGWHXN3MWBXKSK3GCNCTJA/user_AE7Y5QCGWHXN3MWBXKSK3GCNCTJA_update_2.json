I admit I wouldn't have spent money on the Marx Brothers or Lucille Ball alone, but now that I have them, I'll watch.  Elizabeth Taylor is great in the original Father of the Bride.

Aimed at an audience that wasn't born when the series originally aired, the sci-fi extravaganza doesn't even require familiarity, despite cameo appearances by several of the TV show's original cast members. Instead it's a high-tech hybrid of the original premise with enough sensory overload to qualify as a spectacular big-screen video game, supported by a time-travel premise that's adequately clever but hardly original. It's certainly never boring, and visually it's an occasionally awesome demonstration of special effects technology. But in its attempt to be all things to all demographics, the movie's more of a marketing ploy than a satisfying adventure, thankfully dispensing with the TV show's cheesy camp but otherwise squandering a promising cast in favor of eye-candy and ephemeral storytelling. In keeping with the movie's high-tech appeal, the DVD is a feature-packed marvel, including two audio commentaries, deleted scenes, two featurettes covering special effects and the original TV series (featuring complete biographies and episode guides), the original screenplay, and interactive games.\", '--Jeff Shannon']\n{'Genre': 'Science Fiction & Fantasy, Action & Adventure, Mystery & Suspense', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Color, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Michael DeLuca, William Hurt, Mace Neufeld, Jack Johnson, Matt LeBlanc, Mimi Rogers, Stephen Hopkins, Gary Oldman, Jared Harris, Irwin Allen, Dick Tufeld, Richard Saperstein, Heather Graham, Robert Rehme, Akiva Goldsman, Lacey ChabertMichael DeLuca, William Hurt, Mace Neufeld, Jack Johnson, Matt LeBlanc, Mimi Rogers, Stephen Hopkins, Gary Oldman, Jared Harris, Irwin Allen, Dick Tufeld, Richard Saperstein, Heather Graham, Robert Rehme, Akiva Goldsman, Lacey Chabert  See more', 'Language': 'Unqualified, English (Dolby Digital 5.1)', 'Runtime': '2 hours and 10 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '2.35:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.38 x 0.6 inches; 2.72 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'MFR794043466724#VG', 'Director': 'Stephen Hopkins', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Color, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Run time': '2 hours and 10 minutes', 'Release date': 'August 9, 2005', 'Actors': 'William Hurt, Mimi Rogers, Heather Graham, Lacey Chabert, Jack Johnson', 'Subtitles': 'English', 'Producers': 'Mace Neufeld, Robert Rehme, Richard Saperstein, Michael DeLuca', 'Studio': 'WarnerBrothers', 'Writers': 'Akiva Goldsman', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nArrived quickly.
