Marooned in an unknown and hostile region of the cosmos, they must band together to survive in this state-of-the art update of the classic television series.', ']]>', 'Amazon.com', \"Packed with more than 750 dazzling visual effects, this $70 million adventure does more (and less) than give the 1965-68 TV series a state-of-the-art face-lift. Aimed at an audience that wasn't born when the series originally aired, the sci-fi extravaganza doesn't even require familiarity, despite cameo appearances by several of the TV show's original cast members. Instead it's a high-tech hybrid of the original premise with enough sensory overload to qualify as a spectacular big-screen video game, supported by a time-travel premise that's adequately clever but hardly original. It's certainly never boring, and visually it's an occasionally awesome demonstration of special effects technology. But in its attempt to be all things to all demographics, the movie's more of a marketing ploy than a satisfying adventure, thankfully dispensing with the TV show's cheesy camp but otherwise squandering a promising cast in favor of eye-candy and ephemeral storytelling. In keeping with the movie's high-tech appeal, the DVD is a feature-packed marvel, including two audio commentaries, deleted scenes, two featurettes covering special effects and the original TV series (featuring complete biographies and episode guides), the original screenplay, and interactive games.\", '--Jeff Shannon']\n{'Genre': 'Science Fiction & Fantasy, Action & Adventure, Mystery & Suspense', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Color, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Michael DeLuca, William Hurt, Mace Neufeld, Jack Johnson, Matt LeBlanc, Mimi Rogers, Stephen Hopkins, Gary Oldman, Jared Harris, Irwin Allen, Dick Tufeld, Richard Saperstein, Heather Graham, Robert Rehme, Akiva Goldsman, Lacey ChabertMichael DeLuca, William Hurt, Mace Neufeld, Jack Johnson, Matt LeBlanc, Mimi Rogers, Stephen Hopkins, Gary Oldman, Jared Harris, Irwin Allen, Dick Tufeld, Richard Saperstein, Heather Graham, Robert Rehme, Akiva Goldsman, Lacey Chabert  See more', 'Language': 'Unqualified, English (Dolby Digital 5.1)', 'Runtime': '2 hours and 10 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '2.35:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.38 x 0.6 inches; 2.72 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'MFR794043466724#VG', 'Director': 'Stephen Hopkins', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Color, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Run time': '2 hours and 10 minutes', 'Release date': 'August 9, 2005', 'Actors': 'William Hurt, Mimi Rogers, Heather Graham, Lacey Chabert, Jack Johnson', 'Subtitles': 'English', 'Producers': 'Mace Neufeld, Robert Rehme, Richard Saperstein, Michael DeLuca', 'Studio': 'WarnerBrothers', 'Writers': 'Akiva Goldsman', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nArrived quickly.

A frazzled drama critic\u2019s two maiden aunts put a secret ingredient in their elderberry wine \u2013 and the resulting circus is howlingly hilarious, with a comically rubber-faced, rubber-legged Grant in the center ring. A NIGHT AT THE OPERA Grand opera equals grand comedy as the Marx Brothers cram a ship\u2019s stateroom and more with wall-to-wall gags, one-liners, musical riffs and two hard-boiled eggs \u2013 all while skewering pompous schemes to sabotage an opera production. \u201cArguably their finest film\u201d (4 Star Rating! - Leonard Maltin\u2019s Movie Guide). THE LONG, LONG TRAILER Anyone know how to park this thing? Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz play newlyweds who hit the honeymoon road with a 40-foot house trailer in tow in this slaphappily-ever-after comedy directed by Vincente Minnelli. FATHER OF THE BRIDE (1950) Spencer Tracy is the father and Elizabeth Taylor the bride in this comic celebration of an American rite (and wrongs) of passage.

I admit I wouldn't have spent money on the Marx Brothers or Lucille Ball alone, but now that I have them, I'll watch.  Elizabeth Taylor is great in the original Father of the Bride.  Arsenic & Old Lace, though....  you gotta watch it.\nGreat value!\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Cecil B. DeMille'], 'Producers': ['Cecil B.
