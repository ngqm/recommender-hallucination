No doubt the threads will pull together in a little while, but by the end of episode three, I am considering giving up on this. The other thing which is annoying is that it's always the least likely person who is the bad guy...\nHodgepodge\n{'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'Espa\u00f1ol', 'Portugu\u00eas'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', 'Espa\u00f1ol [CC]', 'Portugu\u00eas [SDH]'], 'Directors': ['Mark Cendrowski', 'Anthony Rich', 'Peter Chakos', 'Nikki Lorre', 'James Burrows', 'Howard Murray', 'Gay Linvill', 'Kristy Cecil', 'Ted Wass', 'Andrew D. Weyman'], 'Producers': ['Not Specified'], 'Starring': ['Johnny Galecki', 'Jim Parsons', 'Kaley Cuoco'], 'Studio': ['CBS']}\nInevitably, the characters become caricatures, and the humor has become less subtle: more easy vulgar laughs. 'Modern Family' sustains itself much more effectively. It's amazing that BBT kept up a reasonable standard for so long!\nDecline and Fall\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['David Drury', 'Nick Laughland', 'Nick Renton'], 'Producers': ['Chris Burt', 'Michele Buck', 'Rebecca Eaton'], 'Starring': ['Angela Griffin', 'Clare Holman', 'Kevin Whately']}\nI'm hopelessly biased: once you get to know these characters, they could be solving the mystery of where Johnny left his lunchbox and I'd watch it with pleasure. Subtle acting, great locations and puzzling plots, with enough, but not too much, tension, and wry humor. Great entertainment, and even the morgue scenes are made bearable by the presence of a sweet pathologist!\nClassic British Murders.\nGrantchester\nSuspense, Drama\n['In GRANTCHESTER, a young vicar and a veteran cop join forces to solve baffling murders around a placid English village in 1953.']\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Harry Bradbeer', 'Tim Fywell', 'Jim Robertson'], 'Producers': ['Diederick Santer'], 'Starring': ['James Norton', 'Robson Green', 'Morven Christie']}\nAs in any good drama, the characters are more important than the plot, and their faults are what make them interesting! Excellent acting and great period detail.\nAnother top quality English melodrama.\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Don McBrearty', 'Bruce McDonald', 'Jim Donovan', 'Steve DiMarco', 'Philip Earnshaw', 'Norma Bailey', 'Tim Southam', 'Brett Sullivan', 'Sudz Sutherland', 'Anne Wheeler'], 'Starring': ['David Sutcliffe', 'Stefanie Von Pfetten', \"Luisa d'Oliveira\"], 'Studio': ['BBC America']}\nIntriguing plots and characters.
