Subtle acting, great locations and puzzling plots, with enough, but not too much, tension, and wry humor. Great entertainment, and even the morgue scenes are made bearable by the presence of a sweet pathologist!\nReview Title: Classic British Murders.\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Jon Cassar', 'Brad Turner', 'Milan Cheylov', 'Bryan Spicer', 'Stephen Hopkins', 'Ian Toynton', 'Frederick King Keller', 'James Whitmore Jr.', 'Tim Iacofano', 'Kevin Hooks'], 'Starring': ['Kiefer Sutherland', 'Leslie Hope', 'Sarah Clarke'], 'Studio': ['FOX']}\nThe main, straightforward terrorist plot is obscured by an annoying teenage girl/family thread meant to humanize the protagonist. No doubt the threads will pull together in a little while, but by the end of episode three, I am considering giving up on this. The other thing which is annoying is that it's always the least likely person who is the bad guy...\nHodgepodge\n{'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'Espa\u00f1ol', 'Portugu\u00eas'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', 'Espa\u00f1ol [CC]', 'Portugu\u00eas [SDH]'], 'Directors': ['Mark Cendrowski', 'Anthony Rich', 'Peter Chakos', 'Nikki Lorre', 'James Burrows', 'Howard Murray', 'Gay Linvill', 'Kristy Cecil', 'Ted Wass', 'Andrew D. Weyman'], 'Producers': ['Not Specified'], 'Starring': ['Johnny Galecki', 'Jim Parsons', 'Kaley Cuoco'], 'Studio': ['CBS']}\nInevitably, the characters become caricatures, and the humor has become less subtle: more easy vulgar laughs. 'Modern Family' sustains itself much more effectively. It's amazing that BBT kept up a reasonable standard for so long!\nDecline and Fall\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['David Drury', 'Nick Laughland', 'Nick Renton'], 'Producers': ['Chris Burt', 'Michele Buck', 'Rebecca Eaton'], 'Starring': ['Angela Griffin', 'Clare Holman', 'Kevin Whately']}\nI'm hopelessly biased: once you get to know these characters, they could be solving the mystery of where Johnny left his lunchbox and I'd watch it with pleasure.
