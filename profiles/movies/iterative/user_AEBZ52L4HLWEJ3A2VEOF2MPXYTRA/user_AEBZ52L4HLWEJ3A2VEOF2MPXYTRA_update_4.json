It's a quirky romantic comedy about a mental patient (Johnny Depp) who claims to be Don Juan, the world's greatest lover, and he gets quite a few women to believe it's true. Brando plays the psychiatrist who tries to analyze his patient's apparent delusion, and Dunaway plays Brando's wife, who wants to inject some Don Juan-ish romance into their marital routine. Walking a fine line between precious comedy, wistful drama, and delicate fantasy, the movie gets a big dose of charm from its esteemed cast, with Depp delivering dialogue that would have sounded ludicrous from a lesser actor. This may not be a great movie, but it is guaranteed to put you in an amorous mood.\", '--Jeff Shannon']\n{'Genre': 'Drama, Romance', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, Full Screen, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen, LetterboxedMultiple Formats, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, Full Screen, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen, Letterboxed  See more', 'Contributor': 'Bob Dishy, Marita Geraghty, Johnny Depp, Geraldine Pailhas, Gilbert Lewis, Fred Fuchs, Talisa Soto, Franc Luz, Patrick Palmer, Marlon Brando, Jo Champa, Faye Dunaway, Carmen Argenziano, Jeremy Leven, Francis Ford Coppola, Michael De Luca, Ruth Vitale, Richard C.
