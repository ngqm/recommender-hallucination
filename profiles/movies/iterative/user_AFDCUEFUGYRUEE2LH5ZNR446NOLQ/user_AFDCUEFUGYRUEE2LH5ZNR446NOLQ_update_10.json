A 'stepping stone'-'building up to,'.. suspenseful movie!~ ..HOWEVER!-<br />The sound quality is 'VERY POOR' each time I order a movie from Prime Video. They rev up the sound effects 'so sky-high loud' that you have to keep lowering the volume each time. But when they speak, you can 'barely hear' the actors speaking! Then you have to swing up the volume each time they talk!- You can hardly even hear them.  And, I have the sound 'maxed out' to the highest level on my tv!- Amazon has a marvelous array of movies but they have got to try to improve the adjustment of their sound with these movies! Or,..
