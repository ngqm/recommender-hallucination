It was a very delightful musical that we all enjoyed n a very good picture! If you like musicals, (which to say, I'm not a person who is very fond of them), this one you will  honestly like~\ud83d\udc4d I recommend one to see it. To me, it was the best \"Oklahoma\" picture made!~  Frankly,...

A 'stepping stone'-'building up to,'.. suspenseful movie!~ ..HOWEVER!-<br />The sound quality is 'VERY POOR' each time I order a movie from Prime Video. They rev up the sound effects 'so sky-high loud' that you have to keep lowering the volume each time. But when they speak, you can 'barely hear' the actors speaking! Then you have to swing up the volume each time they talk!- You can hardly even hear them.  And, I have the sound 'maxed out' to the highest level on my tv!- Amazon has a marvelous array of movies but they have got to try to improve the adjustment of their sound with these movies! Or,.. I've got to drop Prime Video and use another station. 'Think I'll let Amazon know soon concerning this \"movie vs. sound\"quality problem. \"Duel\" has always been a great movie~ You'll love it!!~\nGreat Movie!!~ Bad/Poor Sound Quality!!\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Jerry Lewis'], 'Producers': ['Ernest D.
