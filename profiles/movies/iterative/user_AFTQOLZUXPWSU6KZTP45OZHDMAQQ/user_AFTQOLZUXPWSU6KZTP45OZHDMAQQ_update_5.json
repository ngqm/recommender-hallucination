The age we live in is often so full of meaningless things , and love is often put aside. This film captures the heart and much more. It's a story of struggles that anyone can endure, child, teen, adult and senior.....finding meaning and love again.\nAmazing film that gives you faith in humanity\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['John Alexander', 'Samuel Donovan', 'Paul Wilmshurst', 'David Moore'], 'Producers': ['Anne Mensah', 'Cameron Roach', 'Richard Fell', 'Bill Gallagher', 'Nigel Marchant', 'Gareth Neame', 'Sue de Beauvoir'], 'Starring': ['Burn Gorman', 'Max Beesley', 'Jason Flemying'], 'Studio': ['PBS']}\nReally love it.

I don't really understand the person who said it was &#34;overrated.&#34; For someone to feel this is overrated probably isn't able to enjoy the subtleties often found in good writing.\nI LOVED this movie\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Chris Durlacher'], 'Producers': ['Jeremy Bradshaw']}\nWhat an amazing movie!!!
