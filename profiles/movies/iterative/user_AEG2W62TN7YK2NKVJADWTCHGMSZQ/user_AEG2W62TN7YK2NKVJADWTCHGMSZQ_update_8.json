  "reference_summary": "{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Terry McDonagh'], 'Starring': ['Ray Winstone', 'Suranne Jones'], 'Studio': ['FilmRise']}\nOn a whim, I came across this British mystery series and decided to watch.  I'm on the 2nd season and have thoroughly enjoyed the series ... it's too bad that it ends with 2nd season.  would've been nice to have more added.\nOn a whim\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Byrum Geisler'], 'Producers': ['Brandon Garza', 'Alex Bice', 'Wes Ross'], 'Starring': ['Ethan Sharrett', 'Chase Conner', 'Brandi Price'], 'Studio': ['Washington House']}\nI decided to give this film 5 stars because of the movie's themes even though the story was somewhat slow to develop.  These are new actors that I wasn't familiar with but I especially developed a strong bond with Ben Bennett.  You could see how much he wanted to tell Lee about his feelings but was afraid to do so.<br />The film deals with the real problems that a relationship like this one can bring.  It was moving to see a happy ending like this one.\nMakes You Think\n{'Content advisory': ['Smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['John Korty', 'Arthur Hiller'], 'Producers': ['David Golden', 'Howard G. Minsky'], 'Starring': ['Ali MacGraw', \"Ryan O'Neal\", 'John Marley'], 'Studio': ['Paramount Pictures']}\nI watched this in 1970 & loved it.  Now 49 yrs later, it still has the same effect ... a universal love theme with a sad ending.  superb acting by R. O'Neal and A. McGraw\nEpic Love Story\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Alejandro Bazzano'], 'Producers': ['Nacho Manubens', 'Sonia Martinez', 'Josep Cister Rubio', 'Aitor Montanchez'], 'Starring': ['Miguel angel Mu\u00f1oz', 'Susi Sanchez', 'Elvira Minguez'], 'Studio': ['Atresmedia Television']}\nThis was one of the best productions I've seen from Spain.  Beautiful cinematography and breathtaking scenes of the Basque country.  One of the reasons I chose to watch it is just that to see the country scenes.  This seems to be a \"film noir\" type with a good plot and an unexpected ending.  All new actors for me however, I had seen Susi Sanchez acting in a previous Spanish film.  The only thing that I felt was NOT NECESSARY were all the sex scenes in the earlier episodes ... don't believe this contributed to the plot or if they had to throw in sex, the directors could have given it a \"softer\" touch ... I didn't dock any stars for that though.  For those language fans out there, there's a lot of the Basque language you see in the film ... and I picked up some of the simpler Basque greetings.  Recommended for mature audiences.\nGood Acting and Unexpected Ending\nAshes in the Snow\nHistorical, Romance, Downbeat, Emotional\n[\"During World War II, a 16 year-old aspiring artist and her family are deported to Siberia amidst Stalin's brutal dismantling of the Baltic region.

I always enjoy historical films and I was blown away by this film.  Beautiful cinematography and outstanding acting.  Although it had some violent scenes, I believe the film conveyed the message how these innocent families struggled, survived and perished under Stalin's rule.  Recommended for those interested in history.\nExtraordinary  historical account\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Rose Bosch'], 'Producers': ['Jean-Robert Gibard', 'Alain Goldman', 'Catherine Morisse', 'Christer von Lindequist'], 'Starring': ['Jean Reno', 'Melanie Laurent', 'Gad Elmaleh'], 'Studio': ['Menemsha Films']}\nAn explicit historical account of the Velodrome d'hiver Round up (La Rafle) in Paris where thousands of Jews were arrested in mass and placed in extremely crowded conditions at the velodrome.<br />A very emotional film depicting the horror of mass murder of innocent people in transit to Auschwitz.<br />Beautiful cinematography and outstanding acting.

This was a historical drama in remembrance of the Holodomor Genocide in Ukraine 1932-33.<br />I had never heard of this horrific tragedy in the history of mankind.  It was a sad representation of the horrors of the Ukranian people but at the same time showing the determination of the people's desire to fight back.<br />Highly recommended for world history students.\nBitter Harvest - Remembering the genocide in Ukraine 1932-33\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Gillian Armstrong'], 'Producers': ['Sarah Curtis', 'Douglas Rae'], 'Starring': ['Cate Blanchett', 'Billy Crudup', 'Michael Gambon'], 'Studio': ['WARNER BROS.']}\nIf you're drawn to romance and historical films, then you will like this movie.
