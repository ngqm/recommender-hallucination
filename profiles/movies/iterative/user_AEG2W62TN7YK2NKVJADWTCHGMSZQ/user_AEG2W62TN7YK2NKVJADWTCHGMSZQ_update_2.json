These are new actors that I wasn't familiar with but I especially developed a strong bond with Ben Bennett.  You could see how much he wanted to tell Lee about his feelings but was afraid to do so.<br />The film deals with the real problems that a relationship like this one can bring.  It was moving to see a happy ending like this one.\nReview Title: Makes You Think\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
