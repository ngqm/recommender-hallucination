  "reference_summary": "{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Terry McDonagh'], 'Starring': ['Ray Winstone', 'Suranne Jones'], 'Studio': ['FilmRise']}\nOn a whim, I came across this British mystery series and decided to watch.  I'm on the 2nd season and have thoroughly enjoyed the series ... it's too bad that it ends with 2nd season.  would've been nice to have more added.\nOn a whim\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Byrum Geisler'], 'Producers': ['Brandon Garza', 'Alex Bice', 'Wes Ross'], 'Starring': ['Ethan Sharrett', 'Chase Conner', 'Brandi Price'], 'Studio': ['Washington House']}\nI decided to give this film 5 stars because of the movie's themes even though the story was somewhat slow to develop.  These are new actors that I wasn't familiar with but I especially developed a strong bond with Ben Bennett.  You could see how much he wanted to tell Lee about his feelings but was afraid to do so.<br />The film deals with the real problems that a relationship like this one can bring.  It was moving to see a happy ending like this one.\nMakes You Think\n{'Content advisory': ['Smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['John Korty', 'Arthur Hiller'], 'Producers': ['David Golden', 'Howard G.
