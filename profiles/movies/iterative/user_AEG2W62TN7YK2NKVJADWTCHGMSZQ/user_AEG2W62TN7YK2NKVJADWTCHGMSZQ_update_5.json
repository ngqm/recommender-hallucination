  "reference_summary": "{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Terry McDonagh'], 'Starring': ['Ray Winstone', 'Suranne Jones'], 'Studio': ['FilmRise']}\nOn a whim, I came across this British mystery series and decided to watch.  I'm on the 2nd season and have thoroughly enjoyed the series ... it's too bad that it ends with 2nd season.  would've been nice to have more added.\nOn a whim\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Byrum Geisler'], 'Producers': ['Brandon Garza', 'Alex Bice', 'Wes Ross'], 'Starring': ['Ethan Sharrett', 'Chase Conner', 'Brandi Price'], 'Studio': ['Washington House']}\nI decided to give this film 5 stars because of the movie's themes even though the story was somewhat slow to develop.  These are new actors that I wasn't familiar with but I especially developed a strong bond with Ben Bennett.  You could see how much he wanted to tell Lee about his feelings but was afraid to do so.<br />The film deals with the real problems that a relationship like this one can bring.  It was moving to see a happy ending like this one.\nMakes You Think\n{'Content advisory': ['Smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['John Korty', 'Arthur Hiller'], 'Producers': ['David Golden', 'Howard G. Minsky'], 'Starring': ['Ali MacGraw', \"Ryan O'Neal\", 'John Marley'], 'Studio': ['Paramount Pictures']}\nI watched this in 1970 & loved it.  Now 49 yrs later, it still has the same effect ... a universal love theme with a sad ending.  superb acting by R. O'Neal and A. McGraw\nEpic Love Story\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Alejandro Bazzano'], 'Producers': ['Nacho Manubens', 'Sonia Martinez', 'Josep Cister Rubio', 'Aitor Montanchez'], 'Starring': ['Miguel angel Mu\u00f1oz', 'Susi Sanchez', 'Elvira Minguez'], 'Studio': ['Atresmedia Television']}\nThis was one of the best productions I've seen from Spain.  Beautiful cinematography and breathtaking scenes of the Basque country.  One of the reasons I chose to watch it is just that to see the country scenes.  This seems to be a \"film noir\" type with a good plot and an unexpected ending.  All new actors for me however, I had seen Susi Sanchez acting in a previous Spanish film.  The only thing that I felt was NOT NECESSARY were all the sex scenes in the earlier episodes ... don't believe this contributed to the plot or if they had to throw in sex, the directors could have given it a \"softer\" touch ... I didn't dock any stars for that though.  For those language fans out there, there's a lot of the Basque language you see in the film ... and I picked up some of the simpler Basque greetings.  Recommended for mature audiences.\nGood Acting and Unexpected Ending\nAshes in the Snow\nHistorical, Romance, Downbeat, Emotional\n[\"During World War II, a 16 year-old aspiring artist and her family are deported to Siberia amidst Stalin's brutal dismantling of the Baltic region.
