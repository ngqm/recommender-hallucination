Toye', 'Robert King', 'Matt Shakman', 'Nelson McCormick']}\nI just started this series and it it hard to stop watching it!  I love the main character Alicia.  My next  favorite is Zack, her son.  Both of them are so smart and yet, vulnerable.  Strong women will love this.  If you want to be a strong woman you will love it too.  If men would like to be better men, they can pick up a few pointers from this series as well.  Enjoy!\nVery good program\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Bobby Quinn'], 'Starring': ['Johnny Carson', 'Ed McMahon', 'Bill Clinton'], 'Studio': ['Respond2 Entertainment']}\nCarson was a one of a kind, never to be duplicated.
