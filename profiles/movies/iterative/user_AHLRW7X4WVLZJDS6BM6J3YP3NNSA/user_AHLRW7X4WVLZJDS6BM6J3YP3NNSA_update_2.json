Training a blind dog can be extra challenging. So, when author Caroline Levin was approached by dog owners requesting help, we caught those sessions on film.', 'Whether you have a large, active dog, like Bubba, losing his vision slowly - or a small, shy dog like Leo, completely blind from detached retinas - this film can help you. Levin guides each dog and owner through the skills discussed in Chapter 8 of \"Living With Blind Dogs\". Additional footage includes demonstrations with more advanced dogs. Levin also discusses training theory, equipment, and dog-training issues specific to SARD dogs (confusion, lethargy, depression).

I've also installed 'pool noodles,' strung together with cotton clothsline cord and held at just the right height for Wiggles' shoulder by 'plant stakes' (may be procured at most 'big box' stores like KMart, WalMart, and also gardening stores, generally green-coated metal), through which the long string of pool noodles is 'threaded,' and located around the home and/or flower bed's perimeter. During the growing months, daylily foliage covers the pool noodles, but it is amazing how appreciative your blind pet will be of your efforts to help him/her maneuver safely in your yard!<br /><br />Also, the video did not cover the very real dangers of water, holes, etc., that your blind friend cannot see. This includes indoor dangers like sunken tubs and the many objects that become hazards to one no longer able to see them.<br /><br />The video did stress the importance of not moving furniture, and very patiently (sometimes almost too patiently, for suggestions were repeated several times) made sure the viewer was shown the few techniques more than once.<br /><br />A good start to this topic, but it is hoped there will be more to come, as this is a very important subject to those who are blessed with these special friends and companions and to be their 'seeing eye people.'<br /><br />We want to do our best to make their lives happy, and this is not difficult for the devoted pet owner.<br /><br />Music played softly can be soothing, but the voices of two or more people can be confusing to the blind one. At times of frustration and confusion, the calming support and 'I'm here for you and love you very much' message is vital to keeping your special friend secure and content with his/her new chapter in life.<br /><br />Please, love your blind dog as he/she would love you if you lost one of your senses: it's far from the end, but a new and blessed beginning to have such a role as seeing eye person. We are both just fine with our lives now and still enjoy playtime, walks, and normal life.<br /><br />Don't let this minor hurdle stop you from loving and living a wonderful life with your blind pet. You'll come to learn the blessings of a profoundly special relationship -- you won't be sorry!\nNot bad\nTammy and The Bachelor [VHS]\nDebbie Reynolds  (Actor),     Walter Brennan  (Actor),     Joseph Pevney  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    NR    Format: VHS Tape\nMovies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Comedy\n['Tammy and The Bachelor']\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.32 x 4.19 x 1.12 inches; 6.13 Ounces', 'Director': 'Joseph Pevney', 'Run time': '1 hour and 29 minutes', 'Release date': 'January 20, 1993', 'Date First Available': 'December 14, 2006', 'Actors': 'Debbie Reynolds, Walter Brennan, Leslie Nielsen, Mala Powers, Sidney Blackmer', 'Studio': 'Universal Studios Home Entertainment', 'Producers': 'Ross Hunter', 'Writers': 'Cid Ricketts Sumner, Oscar Brodney'}\nThis is my all-time favorite movie and one that I've enjoyed on a regular basis for years.
