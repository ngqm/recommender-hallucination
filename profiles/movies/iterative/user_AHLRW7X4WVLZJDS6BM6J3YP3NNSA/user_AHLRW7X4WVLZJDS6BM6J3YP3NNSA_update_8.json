While the first couple of seasons of Newhart had a couple of characters that were forgettable (just my opinion), when Peter Scolari joined the program, it really took off and flew very well! Larry, Darol and Darrell were just priceless, and the shows were each examples of stellar writing and acting.

I've also installed 'pool noodles,' strung together with cotton clothsline cord and held at just the right height for Wiggles' shoulder by 'plant stakes' (may be procured at most 'big box' stores like KMart, WalMart, and also gardening stores, generally green-coated metal), through which the long string of pool noodles is 'threaded,' and located around the home and/or flower bed's perimeter. During the growing months, daylily foliage covers the pool noodles, but it is amazing how appreciative your blind pet will be of your efforts to help him/her maneuver safely in your yard!<br /><br />Also, the video did not cover the very real dangers of water, holes, etc., that your blind friend cannot see. This includes indoor dangers like sunken tubs and the many objects that become hazards to one no longer able to see them.<br /><br />The video did stress the importance of not moving furniture, and very patiently (sometimes almost too patiently, for suggestions were repeated several times) made sure the viewer was shown the few techniques more than once.<br /><br />A good start to this topic, but it is hoped there will be more to come, as this is a very important subject to those who are blessed with these special friends and companions and to be their 'seeing eye people.'<br /><br />We want to do our best to make their lives happy, and this is not difficult for the devoted pet owner.<br /><br />Music played softly can be soothing, but the voices of two or more people can be confusing to the blind one. At times of frustration and confusion, the calming support and 'I'm here for you and love you very much' message is vital to keeping your special friend secure and content with his/her new chapter in life.<br /><br />Please, love your blind dog as he/she would love you if you lost one of your senses: it's far from the end, but a new and blessed beginning to have such a role as seeing eye person. We are both just fine with our lives now and still enjoy playtime, walks, and normal life.<br /><br />Don't let this minor hurdle stop you from loving and living a wonderful life with your blind pet.

This TV movie, clearly intended as a pilot for a possible series, stars Denver as former FBI agent Jim Clayton, who goes to Alaska when the incompetence of his superiors at the bureau becomes unbearable.

But Rick soon turns up dead and it's up to Jim to clear his friend's name of bootlegging charges and bring peace to Rick's wife and son. Along the way, of course, there's an occasion for Denver to pull out his guitar and exercise his soaring tenor. The plot and overall quality is standard television fare of the 1980s: The bad guys are obviously bad, a young boy needs to regain his faith in humanity, and solving the case doesn't involve detective work so much as looking earnest and getting into awkwardly choreographed fist fights.
