I'm a fan of the early years of the Waltons, and absolutely hate the later years when major cast members jumped ship.  Still mad a Richard Thomas for not coming back for a few episodes in the last season (John Boy, war has changed you!).  Anyway, these can be put on the TV any time, in any order, and be enjoyed by the whole family, with the exception of the teenage daughter who thinks they are lame.  But, she thinks practically everything is lame, so her opinion her is probably also lame.  PS.  I have season 1 & 2 also, and enjoy them every bit as much.\nReview Title: and absolutely hate the later years when major cast members jumped ship\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Based on the Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award-winning play, Doubt is a mesmerizing, suspense-filled drama with four riveting performances from Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams and Viola Davis that will have you pinned to the edge of your seat. Sister Aloysius Beauvier (Streep), the rigid and fear-inspiring principal of the Saint Nicholas Church School, suffers an extreme dislike for the progressive and popular parish priest Father Flynn (Hoffman). Looking for wrongdoing in every corner, Sister Aloysius believes she\\'s uncovered the ultimate sin when she hears Father Flynn has taken a special interest in a troubled boy. But without proof, the only thing certain is doubt.\"One of the best pictures of the year,\" (USA Today, Rolling Stone, New York Post, San Francisco Examiner, Roger Ebert).Bonus Features include From Stage To Screen, Scoring Doubt, The Sisters Of Charity', 'Amazon.com', \"It's always a risk when writers direct their own work, since some playwrights don't travel well from stage to screen. Aided by Roger Deakins, of\", 'No Country for Old Men', 'fame, who vividly captures the look of a blustery Bronx winter,', 'Moonstruck', \"'s John Patrick Shanley pulls it off. If\", 'Doubt', 'makes for a dialogue-heavy experience, like', 'The Crucible', 'and', '12 Angry Men', \", the words and ideas are never dull, and a consummate cast makes each one count. Set in 1964 and loosely inspired by actual events, Shanley focuses on St. Nicholas, a Catholic primary school that has accepted its first African-American student, Donald Miller (Joseph Foster), who serves as altar boy to the warm-hearted Father Flynn (Phillip Seymour Hoffman). Donald may not have any friends, but that doesn't worry his mother, Mrs. Miller (Viola Davis in a scene-stealing performance), since her sole concern is that her son gets a good education. When Sister James (Amy Adams) notices Flynn concentrating more of his attentions on Miller than the other boys, she mentions the matter to Sister Aloysius Beauvier (Meryl Streep), the school's hard-nosed principal. Looking for any excuse to push the progressive priest out of her tradition-minded institution, Sister Aloysius sets out to destroy him, and if that means ruining Donald's future in the process--so be it. Naturally, she's the least sympathetic combatant in this battle, but Streep invests her disciplinarian with wit and unexpected flashes of empathy. Of all the characters she's played, Sister Aloysius comes closest to caricature, but she never feels like a cartoon; just a sad woman willing to do anything to hold onto what little she has before the forces of change render her--and everything she represents--redundant.\", '--Kathleen C.
