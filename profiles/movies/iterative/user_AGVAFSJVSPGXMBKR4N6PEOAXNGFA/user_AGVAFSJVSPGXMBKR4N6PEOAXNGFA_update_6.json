Santa Claus\\' head has more than 50 different working parts, and Jack has more than 400 separate interchangeable heads, each handcrafted with a different facial expression. The smallest working puppet in the movie is a doll from the \"real world\" Jack visits that is only one inch long. Sally is wearing a real miniature dress laid on top of foam latex so that the fabric doesn\\'t move too much on screen. At the height of production, the animators produced only 70 seconds of finished film per week.

Because of the negative comments posted to my original review, I decided to watch the movie again, on Showtime, in HD-Big screen.  I thought that maybe I missed something.  My opinion has not changed.  I think it's an absolutely terrible movie, and I was a little too generous giving it a second star.  By the way, in this class of movie, I like Coraline the best.<br /><br />Original review:  I watched this via streaming.  The detail was outstanding.  The problem was that as much as I liked Corpse Bride, I disliked this movie.  In Corpse Bride, the characters seemed genuine, and I really sympathized with the two brides.  Loved the dog.  In Nightmare, all the characters were shallow, not developed, and not lovable at all.  Even the dog failed to give me any emotion. Totally bored throughout.  Waited for it to get better, and it never did.  Corpse Bride gave us a detestable evil character, and a surprise ending, Nightmare gave us neither.\nReview Title: Very dissapointing after Corpse Bride.\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

But he's soon pulled over by the police who tell him that his father, George Sr., has broken out of prison. Due to the company's shady business deal with Iraq, Michael could face prison time, so he returns home to clear his name even as George Sr. secretly flees to Mexico, Tobias decides to be an understudy for the Blue Man Group, and Lucille begins a torrid affair with her husband's twin brother, Oscar.\", 'Season three', \"In this Emmy\u00ae-winning comedy's hilarious third season, Michael Bluth finally realizes that it's his Uncle Oscar serving time in prison, not his father. Reluctant to spring Oscar due to the effect it may have on the family business, Michael decides that the only fair thing to do is to find his father and place him under house arrest. Yet once found, George Sr. insists he was tricked into working with the Iraqis, leaving Michael no choice but to investigate his father's outrageous claim. But it isn't until Michael and Buster go to Iraq on a rescue mission to save Gob that the depth of the devious plot is revealed...and Michael learns which family member is the real brains behind all the madness.\", 'Amazon.com', 'Season One:', 'Winner of the Outstanding Comedy Series Emmy its first year out,', 'Arrested Development', \"is the kind of sitcom that gives you hope for television. A mockumentary-style exploration of the beleaguered Bluth family, it's one of those idiosyncratic shows that doesn't rely on a laugh track or a studio audience; it's shot more like a TV drama, albeit with an omniscient narrator (executive producer Ron Howard) overseeing the proceedings. Holding the Bluths together just barely is son Michael Bluth (Jason Bateman), the only normal guy in a family that's chock full of nuts. Hardworking and sensible, Michael's certain he's going to be given control of his family's Enron-style corporation upon the retirement of his father (Jeffrey Tambor). The fact that he's passed over instead for his mother (Jessica Walter) is only a blip when compared to his father's immediate arrest for dubious accounting practices, and the resulting freeze on the family's previously limitless wealth.\", \"Bereft of money, and even less family love, the Bluths have to band together in their moment of need--not easy when everyone's looking out for number 1. In addition to his scabrous parents, Michael has to contend with his lothario older brother (Will Arnett), his basically useless younger brother (Tony Hale), his greedy twin sister (Portia DeRossi), and her sexually ambiguous husband (David Cross). Michael's only comrade in sanity is his son George Michael (Michael Cera), but then again, the teenage boy harbors a secret crush on his cousin (Alia Shawkat). A peerless ensemble led by the brilliant Bateman (who ever knew he could be this good?), all the actors are pitch-perfect in their roles, delivering the dryly funny, sometimes absurdist dialogue with the speed and flair of classic farce. The unusual tone of\", 'Arrested Development', \"takes a bit of getting used to--it's far different from anything you'll see on TV, even HBO--but once you buy in to the Bluths' innumerable dysfunctions, you'll be laughing your head off for hours.--\", 'Mark Englehart', 'Season Two:', 'The axe of cancellation dangled perilously over', 'Arrested Development', \"during its second season, but the award-winning comedy fought against fate to deliver a hilarious if scattershot 18 episodes (reduced from the original show order of 22), and stayed alive for the beginning of a third season. Most likely, the creators and actors knew the clock was ticking down, so they didn't hesitate to throw their all into these manic, hilarious episodes, which have only the thinnest of plot arcs but an electrifying energy that makes them hard to resist. Some of the story antics were more of the same: good son Michael (Jason Bateman) tries to keep his company afloat, but is often foiled by older brother Gob (Will Arnett); the precarious marriage of Lindsay (Portia de Rossi) and Tobias (David Cross) undergoes a trial separation; and young George-Michael (Michael Cera) fights his attraction to his cousin Maeby (Alia Shawkat). Other show developments, though, were new and stunningly, uproariously bizarre: Buster (Tony Hale) joins the army, but later finds his hand bitten off by a seal (yes, a real seal), and Oscar (Jeffrey Tambor), the hippie brother of jailed George Sr. (also Tambor), rekindles an affair with sister-in-law Lucille (Jessica Walter), which may have resulted in Buster's conception years ago.\", 'Jokes flew fast and furious, as did guest stars--Ben Stiller, Julia Louis-Dreyfuss, Christine Taylor, Thomas Jane, Ed Begley Jr., Ione Skye, and Zach Braff among them--making it hard to keep straight who was doing what and why. No matter, as each of the episodes was in and of itself was a perfect gem of comedy, strung together by sharp writing and fantastic performances. In addition to the regular cast, both Liza Minnelli, reprising her role as \"Lucille Two,\" and Martin Short, as an, um, eccentric family friend, deserve special mention, with the episode both appeared in, \"Ready, Aim, Marry Me,\" a frenetic exercise in slapstick farce. Typical examples of the show\\'s offbeat humor were found in \"Afternoon Delight,\" in which various members of the Bluth family discover the true meaning of the \\'70s ballad, \"Meet the Veals,\" wherein the Bluths encounter the conservative parents of George Michael\\'s girlfriend, and \"Motherboy XXX,\" surrounding an unsettling mother-son traditional dance. The entire cast cohered perfectly through this season, and their give and take provided a perfect balance among the actors, all of whom were even better than the previous year. However, it\\'s Bateman who should be singled out as the show\\'s anchor, mixing dry sarcasm with impeccable comic timing. Despite plummeting ratings,', 'Arrested Development', \"didn't just keep its head above water, it swam with grace and hilarity. --\", 'Mark Englehart', 'Season Three:', 'Arrested Development', '--one of the greatest comedies in the history of television--went out in a blaze of glory. The truncated final season packed more biting humor per minute than ever before. In only 13 episodes, dozens of intertwining storylines spun in all directions: In addition to the overarching story about the fractious infighting of the Bluth family and the family\\'s housing development company being investigated for treason in Iraq (a plot arc that comes to a dazzlingly surreal conclusion), the put-upon \"good son\" Michael Bluth (Jason Bateman,', 'Teen Wolf Too', ') pursues romance with a lovely British woman (Charlize Theron,', 'Monster', ') who turns out to be woefully inappropriate; swaggering magician Gob (Will Arnett,', 'Monster-In-Law', ') flees from his newly-discovered teenage son while still pandering for the affection of his self-absorbed father (Jeffrey Tambor,', 'The Larry Sanders Show', '); flighty Lindsay (Portia de Rossi,', 'Ally McBeal', ') and her sexually blurry husband Tobias (David Cross,', 'Mr. Show', \") both get the hots for the family's new lawyer, Bob Loblaw (Scott Baio,\", 'Charles in Charge', \"); and much, much more. It's difficult to describe what makes\", 'Arrested Development', 'so brilliant. The ensemble is uniformly superb (Jessica Walter, as the family\\'s boozing, scheming matriarch, is particularly devastating this season) and the surprising guest stars (including Andy Richter, James Lipton, Justine Bateman, and many others) are perfectly cast; the characters\\' abominable behavior defies conventional television notions of \"likability\", yet they only grow more endearing the more you watch; the humor embraces wild slapstick and sharp satire, often within a single scene; and the nimble documentary style allows for sly glancing references to jokes and scenes from long-past episodes, rewarding devoted fans. But the key is that, no matter how screwball', 'Arrested Development', 'becomes, the show offers a rich, textured, and wonderfully coherent world in which these characters feel genuine, a world completely unlike the flat, plastic simulacrum offered by the average sitcom.', 'Arrested Development', 'was true to itself to the end.

Life. This is the story of three couples trying to stay afloat - and one woman's efforts to show them how to do it. HBO's newest adult drama series explores issues of intimacy - through the point of view of a 20-something couple, prenumpital concerns and fidelity are examined, while the series' 30-something couple confront their failed attempts to start a family, coping with the effects it has on their sex life. And after two kids and 12 years of marriage, a couple in their early 40s question why their love and devotion hasn't translated into physical intimacy in nearly a year. Tell Me You Love Me explores the telling, everyday moments that can make or break a couple's commitment to one another, both emotionally and physically.\", ']]>', 'Amazon.com', \"This 10-episode first season of HBO's drama,\", 'Tell Me You Love Me', \", is a semi-sexy romp into the world of coupledom, though in total it casts a depressed glow on the possibility of long-term connection. In it, three couples plus their endearing shared therapist, May (Jane Alexander), feud over various issues arisen due to marriage, aging, differing sexual desires, and sheer boredom. Episodes rotate couples' scenarios and are spliced with scenes showing each seeking refuge in May's office. The youngest pair, sous chef Jaime (Michelle Borth) and her fianc\u00e9 Hugo (Luke Ferrell Kirby), break their engagement over feared infidelity, while Jaime lands pretty boy Nick (Ian Somerhalder) to temporarily ease her pain over the broken commitment. Thirty-somethings, Pawlik (Adam Scott) and Carolyn (Sonya Walger), struggle to get pregnant. As their situation escalates they detest what they recognize in each other as parental traits they've both worked so hard to avoid. The most riveting and mature situation develops as Dave (Tim DeKay) and Katie (Ally Parker) realize that after 13 years of marriage and kids they're incapable of having sex. DeKay and Parker make an eerily convincing acting team, mirroring oodles of couples who lack passion but don't know how to fix it. Dave and Katie most successfully ask the core question of whether or not marriage can truly work. Here, sex and love are separated into two distinct categories. Failed intimacy abounds as emotional overload and stress sets in for each team of lovers. The first several episodes set up the dilemmas and are rife with fighting and despair; midway through, relief comes as Dave and Katie take their therapist's advice and have some nights alone with no kids. Similarly, Jaime gives Hugo a break after he nearly overdoses. Episodes nine and ten are the juiciest, as one begins to wonder who will stay split up and who will weather the desperation. Carolyn reconsiders her anxiety-inducing job, while we see Katie and Dave still crumbling under tension as they remodel their already-perfect house yet again. Throughout, sex scenes amongst the two sexually active couples provide some respite from the bickering, though they mostly illustrate how sex serves as both sanctuary and escape.\", 'Tell Me You Love Me', 'shows marriage as an uphill battle, though seemingly this means to inspire viewers to assess their own relationships for preservation. --', 'Trinie Dalton']\n{'Genre': 'Drama/Television, Drama', 'Format': 'Box set, NTSC, Widescreen, Multiple Formats, Color, Closed-captioned', 'Contributor': 'David Selby, Tim DeKay, Michelle Borth, Sonya Walger, Adam Scott', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1), Unqualified, Spanish (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround)', 'Number Of Discs': '4', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '8 x 5.75 x 0.75 inches; 7.2 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'HBOD35866D', 'Media Format': 'Box set, NTSC, Widescreen, Multiple Formats, Color, Closed-captioned', 'Run time': '10 hours', 'Release date': 'October 21, 2014', 'Actors': 'Michelle Borth, Tim DeKay, Adam Scott, David Selby, Sonya Walger', 'Studio': 'HBO Studios', 'Number of discs': '4'}\nSome nice acting, decent story, erotic scenes.

How director David Fincher--with makeup artists, special-effects wizards, and body doubles--achieves this is one of the main sources of fascination in the early reels of the movie. The premise is loosely borrowed from an F. Scott Fitzgerald story (and bears an even stronger resemblance to Andrew Sean Greer's novel The Confessions of Max Tivoli), with young/old Benjamin growing up in New Orleans, meeting the girl of his dreams (Cate Blanchett), and sharing a few blissful years with her until their different aging agendas send them in opposite directions. The love story takes over the second half of the picture, as Eric Roth's script begins to resemble his work on Forrest Gump. This is too bad, because Benjamin's early life is a wonderfully picaresque journey, especially a set of midnight liaisons with a Russian lady (Tilda Swinton) in an atmospheric hotel. Fincher observes all this with an entomologist's eye, cool and exacting, which keeps the material from getting all gooey. Still, the Hurricane Katrina framing story feels put-on, and the movie lets Benjamin slide offscreen during its later stages--curious indeed.\", '--Robert Horton', 'Stills from', 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button', '(Click for larger image)']\n{'Genre': 'Drama', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Blu-ray, Color, Dolby, Dubbed, NTSC, Special Edition, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Mahershalalhashbaz Ali, Lois Hall, Cate Blanchett, Rampai Mohadi, Alexandre Desplat, Julia Ormond, Jason Flemyng, Lance E.

Can Christmas be saved? Bored with the same old scare-and-scream routine, Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town, longs to spread the joy of Christmas. But his merry mission puts Santa in jeopardy and creates a nightmare for good little boys and girls everywhere! Bonus Features  THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS is the first full-length stop-motion animated film ever created. The movie contains more than 227 animated characters. Santa Claus\\' head has more than 50 different working parts, and Jack has more than 400 separate interchangeable heads, each handcrafted with a different facial expression. The smallest working puppet in the movie is a doll from the \"real world\" Jack visits that is only one inch long. Sally is wearing a real miniature dress laid on top of foam latex so that the fabric doesn\\'t move too much on screen. At the height of production, the animators produced only 70 seconds of finished film per week. To create Halloweentown\\'s twisted look, the design artists often made their sketches using their nondrawing hand. What\\'s This?

Because of the negative comments posted to my original review, I decided to watch the movie again, on Showtime, in HD-Big screen.  I thought that maybe I missed something.  My opinion has not changed.  I think it's an absolutely terrible movie, and I was a little too generous giving it a second star.  By the way, in this class of movie, I like Coraline the best.<br /><br />Original review:  I watched this via streaming.  The detail was outstanding.  The problem was that as much as I liked Corpse Bride, I disliked this movie.  In Corpse Bride, the characters seemed genuine, and I really sympathized with the two brides.  Loved the dog.  In Nightmare, all the characters were shallow, not developed, and not lovable at all.  Even the dog failed to give me any emotion. Totally bored throughout.  Waited for it to get better, and it never did.  Corpse Bride gave us a detestable evil character, and a surprise ending, Nightmare gave us neither.\nVery dissapointing after Corpse Bride.",
