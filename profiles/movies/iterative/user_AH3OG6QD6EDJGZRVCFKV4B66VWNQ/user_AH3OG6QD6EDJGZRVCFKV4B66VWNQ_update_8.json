(Before Cable),', 'Rome', 'charts the dramatic shifts in the balance of power between former friends Pompey Magnus (Kenneth Cranham), leader of the Senate, and Julius Caesar (Ciaran Hinds), whose imminent return after eight years to Rome after conquering the Gauls, has the ruling class up in arms. At the heart of Rome is the odd couple friendship between two soldiers who fortuitously become heroes of the people. Lucius Vorenus (Kevin McKidd) is married, honorable, and steadfast. Titus Pullo (Ray Stevenson) is an amoral rogue whose philosophy is best summed up, \"I kill my enemies, take their gold, and enjoy their women.\" Among', 'Rome', \"'s most compelling subplots is Lucius's strained relationship with his wife, Niobe (Indira Varma), who is surprised to see her husband alive (but not as surprised as he is to find her upon his homecoming with a newborn baby in her arms!) Any viewer befuddlement over\", 'Rome', \"'s intrigues and machinations, and determining who is hero and who is foe, disappears the minute Golden Globe-nominee Polly Walker appears as Atia, Caesar's formidable niece and a villainess for the ages. In the first hour alone, she offers her already married daughter as a bride to the recently widowed Pompey.\", 'Rome', 'is a painstakingly mounted production that earned eight well-deserved Emmy nominations in such categories as costumes, set design, and art direction. Michael Apted (', \"Coal Miner's Daughter\", ') was honored with a Director\\'s Guild Award for the first episode, \"The Stolen Eagle.\" But artistic considerations aside, instantly addicted viewers will agree with Atia, who notes at one point, \"I adore the secrecy, the intrigue. It\\'s most thrilling.\"', 'Season 2 begins in the wake of Julius Caesar\\'s assassination, and charts the power struggle to fill his sandals between \"vulgar beast\" Mark Antony (James Purefoy) and \"clever boy\" Octavian (Simon Woods), who is surprisingly named Caesar\\'s sole heir. The series\\' most compelling relationship is between fellow soldiers and unlikely friends, the honorable Lucius Vorenus (Kevin McKidd) and Titus \"Violence is the only trade I know\" Pullo (Ray Stevenson), who somewhat reverse roles when Vorenus is overcome with grief in the wake of his wife\\'s suicide. Season 2 considerably ups the ante in the rivalry between Atia (an Emmy-worthy Polly Walker), who is Antony\\'s mistress, and Servilia (Lindsay Duncan) with attempted poisonings and sickening torture. Another gripping subplot is Vorenus\\'s estrangement from his children, who, at the climax of the season opener are presumed slaughtered, but whose true fate may be even more devastating to the father who cursed them.', 'Rome', '\\'s second season does not scrimp on the series\\' sex and violence, in both cases exceedingly brutal. But in this cauldron of treachery and betrayal, words, too, are vicious, as when a defiant Atia ominously tells Octavian\\'s new wife, Livia, \"Far better women that you have sworn to [destroy me]. Go look for them now.\" In writing', 'Rome', \"'s epitaph, we come to praise this series, not to bury it.

There are some new characters to bolster the veteran cast and, interestingly (although not surprisingly), Jack's character has taken an altogether darker, more psychopathic turn. The danger the characters find themselves in also has a much more global, not to mention topical, impetus, grounded as it is in the war against terrorism. Although the territory is more familiar this time around, this second season is just as much a high-tension, taut, adrenalin-fuelled ride as the first, and one that will have you glued to your TV for the next 24 hours.\", '--Kristen Bowditch']\n{'Format': \"Box set, Closed-captioned, Collector's Edition, Dolby, Dubbed, Subtitled, NTSC\", 'Contributor': 'Reiko Aylesworth, Carlos Bernard, Kiefer Sutherland, Penny Johnson Jerald, Xander Berkeley, Elisha Cuthbert, Sarah Wynter, Dennis HaysbertReiko Aylesworth, Carlos Bernard, Kiefer Sutherland, Penny Johnson Jerald, Xander Berkeley, Elisha Cuthbert, Sarah Wynter, Dennis Haysbert  See more', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1), Spanish (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround)', 'Number Of Discs': '7', 'Runtime': '17 hours and 44 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.78:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'Unrated (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '1.97 x 5.72 x 7.56 inches; 1.15 Pounds', 'Media Format': \"Box set, Closed-captioned, Collector's Edition, Dolby, Dubbed, Subtitled, NTSC\", 'Run time': '17 hours and 44 minutes', 'Release date': 'September 9, 2003', 'Actors': 'Kiefer Sutherland, Carlos Bernard, Reiko Aylesworth, Sarah Wynter, Dennis Haysbert', 'Dubbed': 'Spanish', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish', 'Studio': 'Fox Network', 'Number of discs': '7'}\nI started watching 24 and I noticed I missed a season.
