In one carriage, there are four survivors: \"The General,\" an elderly English gentleman, Werner, a young German, aimee, an orphaned eight-year old girl, and emily Delahunty, an English novelist who invites them to her home to recuperate. Thrown together by misfortune, they find themselves attempting to rework the torn fabric of their lives, while a concerned police inspector attempts to piece together the events that brought them there. When aimee\\'s straightlaced American uncle arrives to take her away, it shakes an already delicate household to the core. Will the magic of emily\\'s house in Umbria bring happiness to all? or will happiness prove as elusive as the answers to the quesitons that bind them together?', ']]>', 'Amazon.com', 'Falling neatly into the', 'Enchanted April', 'and', 'Under the Tuscan Sun', 'category, the made-for-HBO', 'My House in Umbria', \"boasts lovely Italian vistas and comforting Englishness. But it begins with a note of violence: on a train rolling through the sunny countryside, a terrorist bomb detonates, killing a handful of passengers. The strangers that survive recuperate at the villa of an eccentric but kindly romance novelist, also a survivor of the blast. She's played by Maggie Smith, who bustles through the role with a pleasing mix of gin and daffodils. Chris Cooper is an uptight American who comes to the villa to pick up his orphaned niece and bristles at the bohemian atmosphere. Director Richard Loncraine maintains the melancholy mood amidst the sun-dappled gardens of Umbria, but Smith really holds the film together with her authority and slightly tipsy humor.\", '--Robert Horton']\n{'Genre': 'Drama', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, Dubbed, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Various', 'Initial release date': '2005-04-12', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1), English (Dolby Digital 4.0), Unqualified, French (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround), Spanish (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround)', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.78:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 1.6 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'HBO92032DVD', 'Director': 'Various', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, Dubbed, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Run time': '1 hour and 49 minutes', 'Release date': 'April 12, 2005', 'Actors': 'Various', 'Dubbed': 'Spanish', 'Subtitles': 'English, French, Spanish', 'Studio': 'HBO Studios', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nI have to give this movie a very mixed review. On the one hand, the storyline, the script, the score and the acting are fairly reliably horrendous throughout. The storyline is weak, choppy, and drags on miserably. The characters are not very likable (to put it mildly...), and even the most gifted ones (Maggie Smith, Timothy Spall, Chris Cooper and Giancarlo Giannini) are effectively dragged down and their abilities trampled by the leaden script and the absolute lack of talent of some of the other actors. In particular, Bernard Furmann turns in a devastatingly feeble performance that makes you wonder if he's ever darkened the doorstep of an acting school.<br /><br />However, on the other hand, the Italian scenery, that wonderful house, with its beautiful garden and setting, and the cinematography are beyond amazingly gorgeous - all of them. As such, I have now seen this movie at least half a dozen times in the past few months, trying to ignore the fallow storyline and the lame acting, and am quite determined to retire in that region of Italy and, preferably, in that very house.<br /><br />Take from that what you will....\nVery (!) mixed feelings about this movie...\nBirds of America\nMatthew Perry  (Actor),     Hilary Swank  (Actor),     Craig Lucas  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Independently Distributed, Comedy\n[\"Morrie's (Matthew Perry) life is unraveling.

Surprisingly so, because it is habitually rated just average on the various sites like Amazon and IMDB. People don't seem to understand the very deep and beautiful psychology of this movie, which ultimately culminates in discovering what and where a person's real freedom is. Not in a political way, but in a liberating, \"life's journey\" kind of way. This movie is beautifully written, which is a tricky matter when dealing with this level of intellectualism. It stops short of being preachy or over-written. It is perfect! The casting is excellent too. Each character has great depth (or shallowness) that is magnificently represented by the actors chosen for each role. The pacing is also very well done, as is the score and the camera work. All in all, when it was over, I was ready to start watching it all over again. I really actually wish the whole story would have stretched much longer. It was sheer delight.<br /><br />A movie about recognizing the chains that bind you and the love that frees you.\nMy New Favorite Movie this Year!\nHum Dil De Chuke Sanam\nAishwarya Rai Ajay Devgan Salman Khan (Actor),  Sanjay Leela Bhansali (Director)\nMovies & TV, Musicals & Performing Arts, Musicals\n{'Language': 'English', 'Item Weight': '3.52 ounces'}\n(SPOILERS....!!!)<br />I do love the colors and pageantry of Indian films. This one was one of the best, visually. It seems as though Nandini had a different sari on in every scene. That, I enjoyed very much, because the saris are just gorgeous. And so was Nandini. Sameer, on the other hand, though handsome, struck me more like an Indian Jerry Lewis with his demented need to be funny all the time. He was clearly the \"comic relief\" and, as such, it was a relief that the beauty did not choose the Indian Peter Pan in the end.<br /><br />But my really big (B.I.G.) issue with this movie is how the director blatantly tried to pass off Budapest as being in \"Italy\". Surely this must be as insulting to most self-respecting, educated Indians as it is to Hungarians? Seriously, he could easily have presented Budapest as some city in Italy, if only he had not chosen to display the very well-known Hungarian panoramas of the Danube and the Hungarian Parliament as well as just about every single much-frequented tourist landmark in that city, and even including taxicabs with Hungarian writing on the side. I mean, filming in alternate locations is done all the time, but with a little more finesse and, generally, the filmmakers take pains to at least use the correct language and local customs and costumes for the intended backdrop. None of which happened here.<br /><br />It gets worse... Not only did he try to pass off Budapest as being in Italy, all the \"Italians\" are speaking Hungarian! The closest you get to an Italian phrase in this movie is when they refer to \"The church of the Santa Maria\" which, in truth, is probably more a Latin name than it is Italian.<br /><br />For me, a Hungarian (in case you haven't guessed...), this whole thing was very distracting and pretty laughable. Pity, really, since clearly this was a fairly big-budget production. And the storyline was kind of fun and unexpected too.<br /><br />So, if you don't mind a tour of Budapest, a taste of Hungary, while trying to \"imagine\" you are in Italy, this is the movie for you. Overall, I did find the movie enjoyable and did not mind a good chuckle while I watched footage of my birth city, listened to my mother tongue and proceeded to get homesick just a little... Yes, pretty distracting, really...\nCharming visual fest, but omigosh....(SPOILERS....!!!)\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Lewis', 'Robert Michael'], 'Producers': ['Don Buday', 'Brenda Friend', 'Marcy Gross', 'Ann Weston'], 'Starring': ['James Brolin', 'Melody Anderson', 'Pamela Bellwood'], 'Studio': ['Thriller and Mystery']}\nThis movie stars James Brolin as Michael Wakefield, an innkeeper with a deep, dark secret - Which was the original TV movie's title: \"Deep Dark Secrets\". Melody Anderson is his innocent, beautiful, child-like wife Julianne, who worships the ground he walks on until, one day, a stranger comes to call and Michael disappears and is thought to have died in an accident. In her efforts to take over the management of the B&B, Julianne starts finding out a lot of nasty little and big things about Michael, who she thought she knew, but now must realize that she did not know him at all.<br /><br />The plot of this movie would be a mediocre not-so-bad one if the acting weren't so trite and generally horrendous. However, some movies are so bad they start slipping into the \"kinda fun entertainment\" category, simply by virtue of their flaws, which are fun to watch as you cringe and grit your teeth and wonder who in their right mind financed this disaster? This is definitely one of those movies.<br /><br />So, if you enjoy wincing and can find pleasure in picking apart scene after scene of truly piteously bad acting, this movie is for you. I am sad to admit that I am one of those people. At least where this particular movie is concerned... So, I am understandably torn as to what rating to give it? 4 stars for unintentional entertainment, or 1 star for missing the mark intended by a few hundred miles?  I have to add that I do like most of the sets in this otherwise truly painful little TV movie. It's a very pretty B&B and the grounds around it, and the colors and decorations are very nice. Ah yes, I am truly conflicted.<br /><br />Hmmmm, I wonder if it will ever make it to DVD...?  :)))<br /><br />Update: 7/20/2013 - Now it's available for free on Amazon Prime! How fun!  :)\nReally bad acting. So bad, it's almost fun.\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Michael Grossman'], 'Producers': ['Josh Berman', 'Alex Taub', 'David Petrarca', 'Craig Zadan', 'Neil Meron'], 'Starring': ['Brooke Elliott', 'Margaret Cho', 'Jackson Hurst']}\nMy husband and I just love this series.
