There is a LOT of drinking going on in this series. They celebrate everything (!) with booze. They meet after hours in bars to &#34;relax&#34; and discuss their day and/or plans. They break out bottles at work when they win a case or for pretty much any conceivable celebration. They also drink when they are dispirited or depressed. Alicia, the main character, is pretty much a confirmed alcoholic. She meets with friends at bars regularly after work and, when she doesn't, she goes home and makes a beeline for the wine bottle as soon as she steps in the door. And they make it all seem very natural and desirable. I don't drink at all because I don't enjoy the effects of alcohol, but even I, at times almost wanted a nice glass of amber liquid or a glass of wine to hold, sip and nurse. So, anyway, you get the picture.<br /><br />Otherwise, I highly recommend this interesting and intelligent series. It's not perfect, but what is? It's well-made and fun to watch and follow.\nReview Title: WARNING!!! NOT recommended for recovering alcoholics!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

But it begins with a note of violence: on a train rolling through the sunny countryside, a terrorist bomb detonates, killing a handful of passengers.

She's played by Maggie Smith, who bustles through the role with a pleasing mix of gin and daffodils. Chris Cooper is an uptight American who comes to the villa to pick up his orphaned niece and bristles at the bohemian atmosphere. Director Richard Loncraine maintains the melancholy mood amidst the sun-dappled gardens of Umbria, but Smith really holds the film together with her authority and slightly tipsy humor.\", '--Robert Horton']\n{'Genre': 'Drama', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, Dubbed, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Various', 'Initial release date': '2005-04-12', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1), English (Dolby Digital 4.0), Unqualified, French (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround), Spanish (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround)', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.78:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 1.6 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'HBO92032DVD', 'Director': 'Various', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, Dubbed, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Run time': '1 hour and 49 minutes', 'Release date': 'April 12, 2005', 'Actors': 'Various', 'Dubbed': 'Spanish', 'Subtitles': 'English, French, Spanish', 'Studio': 'HBO Studios', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nI have to give this movie a very mixed review. On the one hand, the storyline, the script, the score and the acting are fairly reliably horrendous throughout. The storyline is weak, choppy, and drags on miserably. The characters are not very likable (to put it mildly...), and even the most gifted ones (Maggie Smith, Timothy Spall, Chris Cooper and Giancarlo Giannini) are effectively dragged down and their abilities trampled by the leaden script and the absolute lack of talent of some of the other actors. In particular, Bernard Furmann turns in a devastatingly feeble performance that makes you wonder if he's ever darkened the doorstep of an acting school.<br /><br />However, on the other hand, the Italian scenery, that wonderful house, with its beautiful garden and setting, and the cinematography are beyond amazingly gorgeous - all of them. As such, I have now seen this movie at least half a dozen times in the past few months, trying to ignore the fallow storyline and the lame acting, and am quite determined to retire in that region of Italy and, preferably, in that very house.<br /><br />Take from that what you will....\nVery (!) mixed feelings about this movie...\nBirds of America\nMatthew Perry  (Actor),     Hilary Swank  (Actor),     Craig Lucas  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Independently Distributed, Comedy\n[\"Morrie's (Matthew Perry) life is unraveling.

Surprisingly so, because it is habitually rated just average on the various sites like Amazon and IMDB. People don't seem to understand the very deep and beautiful psychology of this movie, which ultimately culminates in discovering what and where a person's real freedom is. Not in a political way, but in a liberating, \"life's journey\" kind of way. This movie is beautifully written, which is a tricky matter when dealing with this level of intellectualism. It stops short of being preachy or over-written. It is perfect! The casting is excellent too. Each character has great depth (or shallowness) that is magnificently represented by the actors chosen for each role. The pacing is also very well done, as is the score and the camera work. All in all, when it was over, I was ready to start watching it all over again. I really actually wish the whole story would have stretched much longer. It was sheer delight.<br /><br />A movie about recognizing the chains that bind you and the love that frees you.\nMy New Favorite Movie this Year!\nHum Dil De Chuke Sanam\nAishwarya Rai Ajay Devgan Salman Khan (Actor),  Sanjay Leela Bhansali (Director)\nMovies & TV, Musicals & Performing Arts, Musicals\n{'Language': 'English', 'Item Weight': '3.52 ounces'}\n(SPOILERS....!!!)<br />I do love the colors and pageantry of Indian films. This one was one of the best, visually. It seems as though Nandini had a different sari on in every scene. That, I enjoyed very much, because the saris are just gorgeous. And so was Nandini. Sameer, on the other hand, though handsome, struck me more like an Indian Jerry Lewis with his demented need to be funny all the time. He was clearly the \"comic relief\" and, as such, it was a relief that the beauty did not choose the Indian Peter Pan in the end.<br /><br />But my really big (B.I.G.) issue with this movie is how the director blatantly tried to pass off Budapest as being in \"Italy\". Surely this must be as insulting to most self-respecting, educated Indians as it is to Hungarians? Seriously, he could easily have presented Budapest as some city in Italy, if only he had not chosen to display the very well-known Hungarian panoramas of the Danube and the Hungarian Parliament as well as just about every single much-frequented tourist landmark in that city, and even including taxicabs with Hungarian writing on the side. I mean, filming in alternate locations is done all the time, but with a little more finesse and, generally, the filmmakers take pains to at least use the correct language and local customs and costumes for the intended backdrop. None of which happened here.<br /><br />It gets worse... Not only did he try to pass off Budapest as being in Italy, all the \"Italians\" are speaking Hungarian! The closest you get to an Italian phrase in this movie is when they refer to \"The church of the Santa Maria\" which, in truth, is probably more a Latin name than it is Italian.<br /><br />For me, a Hungarian (in case you haven't guessed...), this whole thing was very distracting and pretty laughable. Pity, really, since clearly this was a fairly big-budget production. And the storyline was kind of fun and unexpected too.<br /><br />So, if you don't mind a tour of Budapest, a taste of Hungary, while trying to \"imagine\" you are in Italy, this is the movie for you. Overall, I did find the movie enjoyable and did not mind a good chuckle while I watched footage of my birth city, listened to my mother tongue and proceeded to get homesick just a little... Yes, pretty distracting, really...\nCharming visual fest, but omigosh....(SPOILERS....!!!)\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Lewis', 'Robert Michael'], 'Producers': ['Don Buday', 'Brenda Friend', 'Marcy Gross', 'Ann Weston'], 'Starring': ['James Brolin', 'Melody Anderson', 'Pamela Bellwood'], 'Studio': ['Thriller and Mystery']}\nThis movie stars James Brolin as Michael Wakefield, an innkeeper with a deep, dark secret - Which was the original TV movie's title: \"Deep Dark Secrets\". Melody Anderson is his innocent, beautiful, child-like wife Julianne, who worships the ground he walks on until, one day, a stranger comes to call and Michael disappears and is thought to have died in an accident. In her efforts to take over the management of the B&B, Julianne starts finding out a lot of nasty little and big things about Michael, who she thought she knew, but now must realize that she did not know him at all.<br /><br />The plot of this movie would be a mediocre not-so-bad one if the acting weren't so trite and generally horrendous. However, some movies are so bad they start slipping into the \"kinda fun entertainment\" category, simply by virtue of their flaws, which are fun to watch as you cringe and grit your teeth and wonder who in their right mind financed this disaster? This is definitely one of those movies.<br /><br />So, if you enjoy wincing and can find pleasure in picking apart scene after scene of truly piteously bad acting, this movie is for you. I am sad to admit that I am one of those people. At least where this particular movie is concerned... So, I am understandably torn as to what rating to give it? 4 stars for unintentional entertainment, or 1 star for missing the mark intended by a few hundred miles?  I have to add that I do like most of the sets in this otherwise truly painful little TV movie. It's a very pretty B&B and the grounds around it, and the colors and decorations are very nice. Ah yes, I am truly conflicted.<br /><br />Hmmmm, I wonder if it will ever make it to DVD...?  :)))<br /><br />Update: 7/20/2013 - Now it's available for free on Amazon Prime! How fun!  :)\nReally bad acting. So bad, it's almost fun.\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Michael Grossman'], 'Producers': ['Josh Berman', 'Alex Taub', 'David Petrarca', 'Craig Zadan', 'Neil Meron'], 'Starring': ['Brooke Elliott', 'Margaret Cho', 'Jackson Hurst']}\nMy husband and I just love this series. It is consistently fun and funny while also being somewhat cerebral at times. The characters are well-defined and fairly complex. And this last episode in season four has really upped the ante on the possibilities for next year. I am hoping this ending turns out to be just a dream - like the Dallas season finale was - a lifetime ago...  :))\nGreat cliffhanger!\nCanon 7D Crash Course : Made for Beginners!\nMichael Andrew  (Actor)    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Movies\n['Award winning instructor and professional wedding photographer Michael Andrew takes us on a step-by-step tour of the Canon 7D in this limited edition training DVD video.

The first portion of the DVD is a mini-course in photography. Although I am already somewhat experienced in this, having owned an SLR camera for many years, this is still a welcome feature as I have not actually used my SLR in a long time. I have been using my point and shoot Canons for years now. So a refresher course is definitely in order and this DVD has a very well presented and pretty comprehensive one, using the Canon EOS 7D as the example and, as such, also taking the viewer through its functions at the same time.<br /><br />The last part of the DVD goes through the actual buttons and menus and functions of the Canon EOS 7D in depth and detail. The presenter is very thorough and articulate. Everything is presented very clearly with the buttons and functions he is talking about very clearly indicated in close-ups on the camera's features under discussion, and highlighted in a way that there can be no mistaking what he is talking about. I find myself pausing, rewinding, and playing along on my camera to get a real feel for what he is demonstrating.<br /><br />The DVD also has a very well laid-out and easy to navigate interactive menu, so one can jump to the preferred section and get going on it quickly and easily.<br /><br />I have barely begun to scratch the surface of this DVD but, so far, I am very (!) happy I got it. I will surely be adding more to my review when I have watched more. For now, I can say that it looks like it delivers everything that is promised in the description. And it does so beautifully. Both the audio and the video quality of this DVD are professional grade, high quality. I think it is worth every penny I spent on it, even though I flinched when I did so.<br /><br />I recommend this DVD highly, if you want to get to know your Canon EOS 7D quickly and in a very pleasant way. Also recommend it on its value as a wonderful photo course for beginners - with or without the specific camera.<br /><br />My only recommendation to the sellers would be to package the product more carefully when sending it out. It looks like they are recycling old bubble wrap envelopes, which is not a bad thing to do, other than it looks a bit tacky. However, the larger concern is that I had to order this product twice because they forgot to seal the torn side of the envelope with scotch tape. And so the envelope arrived empty, except for the Amazon invoice, which somehow survived the journey. Overall, not a problem for me, except for the extra wait involved, because Amazon immediately issued me a refund. But I did notice that the second DVD was shipped in exactly the same kind of recycled bubble wrap envelope with the side slit open. Fortunately, they did not forget to tape this one up...<br /><br />Update: 11/27/2012 Still very happy with this DVD, so I thought I'd add Michael's description from his web site in here in a clearer format than there is in the product description above.

We like the premise and the trailer looked promising. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a big disappointment. Especially since it was a product of Merchant Ivory Productions, makers of such wonders as Howard's End, A Room With a View and The Remains of The Day.  For this very reason, we opted to watch it as soon as someone told us about it. We were so happy to see it was included free with Amazon Prime We thought it would surely be wonderful.<br /><br />However, not so. Dimensions was needlessly repetitious and superficial in both theme and execution, generally unfocused in its presentation (not visually), the storyline tried very hard, but lacked depth, and the finish was wholly predictable and really fairly boring. But then, so was the rest of it. Boring, that is. The one fun moment we had really had nothing to do with the story. We just noticed that a segment of river they were showing had also appeared in Howard's End... Big thrill! :)<br /><br />Visually, it was fine. Nice British locations. Though not many of them. The cast were OK too, but what could they do with the script? The props were pretty laughable, especially the look and premise of one of the main props, which essentially looked like a twisted teepee skeleton and really served no logical or visual, or any other purpose whatsoever. Yet it kept cropping up towards the end of the movie and adding irritation to already established boredom.<br /><br />This was supposed to be an interesting scientific/metaphysical movie. Sad to say, it fell short by light leagues. I might recommend this to someone I really don't like and don't mind pissing off.\nNot good would be an understatement.\nThe Good Wife: Complete Series\nChristine Baranski  (Actor),     Matt Czuchry  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Paramount Home Entertainment, Drama\n{'Genre': 'Drama/Television', 'Format': 'AC-3, Box set, Dubbed, Subtitled, Widescreen, NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Christine Baranski, Julianna Margulies, Matt Czuchry', 'Language': 'English', 'Number Of Discs': '42', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 2.65 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'unknown', 'Media Format': 'AC-3, Box set, Dubbed, Subtitled, Widescreen, NTSC', 'Release date': 'April 4, 2017', 'Actors': 'Christine Baranski, Matt Czuchry, Julianna Margulies', 'Dubbed': 'French', 'Subtitles': 'French, English, Portuguese, Spanish', 'Studio': 'Paramount', 'Number of discs': '42'}\nAlthough I absolutely love this series (I have watched the whole series on Amazon Prime about 4-5 times so far), I have to say it should come with a strong warning: It is definitely NOT recommended for recovering alcoholics.
