This 'new' disc sold by Amazon, with no DVD security features on the packaging, has numerous glitches; I suspect it's on all copies of this edition, I bought it new. It pauses momentarily, perhaps makes a sound, and continues. It's done this several times already having started the movie (it's on as I speak). It's widescreen and the picture quality is okay, but my roommate pointed out to me that it's overdubbed, that is the sound isn't always matching the lips; I checked the listing, and sure enough, it says \"dubbed\". I haven't tried the French-language soundtrack. I already purchased a used copy of a more expensive edition of this film by Anchor Bay. I'll be returning this one. I'm surprised at Amazon for selling an inferior version as new.<br /><br />--<br /><br />I received and am playing the disk I referred to [[ASIN:6305511861 The Car]] and when trying to review the Amazon system informed me I have already reviewed the product, being the other disk of inferior condition that wouldn't play. This, of course, is ridiculous. This disk, as I have anticipated, is superior and is playing without a single glitch. It was professionally produced with packaging as a DVD should be. So, definitely get this (ASIN 6305511861) rather than the cheaper disk on Amazon which began this review. Both are Region 1. I bought a used disk which is in better condition than the \"new\" one sold by Amazon. Neither Region 1 DVD disk of this movie has subtitles. I'm happy with the widescreen version included on the ASIN mentioned. The single caveat of this edition is that the packaging has a definite flaw:  the ring that holds the disk continues in a full circle even past the finger indentations, making it impossible to remove the disk easily even when holding down the middle button. You could scratch the disk trying to get it out, I had to hold it upside down and dig with the \"button finger\". I won't return it to the case. But the disk itself is great, and the one I recommend (Anchor Bay). Too bad it's out of print.\nGlitched. Dubbed.

It had humorous moments, and raunchy references, but not a competitor for mainstream-LGBT hybrid comedy-romances (see Kissing Jessica Stein [[ASIN: B000QUCQXS]], Puccini for Beginners [[ASIN: B000N2H8XC]], Gray Matters [[ASIN: B000O76ZO4]], and Out At The Wedding [[ASIN: B001MVWMIY]] for spectacular examples).\nOkay, but I want more on this theme.\nGray Matters\nHeather Graham  (Actor),     Thomas Cavanagh  (Actor),     Sue Kramer  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Studio Specials, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, All Fox Titles\n['Product Description', 'They finish each other\\'s sentences, dance like Fred and Ginger, and share the same downtown loft--the perfect couple?

Too bad it's not available for streaming. I loved it! I'd say one of her most enjoyable movies. She's older (middle-older teen) in this, and it only offers more depth and romantic escapades for her fans! The setting (modern day pirate's boat & cove) and adventure, with her relationship with her old salt dad, and her budding interest in a handsome, young modern man from the city, is refreshing, the 60's appeal is fun, and her character is a rough & tumble tomboy that you'd better not mess with! However, she's feeling soft new feelings she hasn't experienced before, and the coming-of-age conflict is portrayed very well and really fun to watch. This is now one of my very favorite films of hers (along with Gypsy Girl). :) I had never seen this one before, so glad it's available on DVD at least!\nNow one of my very favorite Haley Mills films :)\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Ken Kwapis'], 'Producers': ['Howard W. Koch', 'Todd Graff'], 'Starring': ['Fran Drescher', 'Timothy Dalton', 'Ian McNeice'], 'Studio': ['Paramount Pictures Corp.']}\nFrankly, it was a lot more cornball and slapstick than I remembered, but with superb character portrayal by Fran Drescher I remembered how fun this movie was the first time I saw it and loved it, and I still do! Timothy Dalton's character is completely over the top and tv-sitcom unbelievable, he barks, shouts, and doesn't seem real at all; however Fran is so likeable, warm, and believable in her role that it is still enjoyable for light, funny, romantic fare including children. The contrast between her New York City apartment life and family (her mother is also well-portrayed and hilarious!), and the setting in the Eastern bloc ... castle... is great and Fran's character is spontaneous, outrageous, and make you laugh outloud. You'll identify with her easily. I love this theme, even in silly comedies.\nSilly, laugh out loud comedy, but Fran Drescher's portrayal is simply superb. Fun!\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Craig Pryce'], 'Producers': ['Ian McDougall'], 'Starring': ['Catherine Bell', 'Chris Potter', 'Catherine Disher'], 'Studio': ['Living Arts']}\nEven if you don't intend to view the whole (so far) 5-part movie series, (I purchased them all), you will enjoy the first entry with the following elements:  black-sheep girl trying to get a new start, befuddled leading man with children, nosy and hostile neighbors, small town, mystery, romance, lack of all the elements we don't want to see, and witchery on Christmas! A young couple's romance, family friendly. Our mystery woman arrives unseen in a small town where everyone knows everyone and mainstreet is still open. We learn she has inhereted the large, abandoned mansion. Catherine Bell is at once mysterious, spunky, a rebel, sweet, moral, kind-hearted, intimidating, cute, wise, vulnerable, tough, and all-around absolutely adorable and lovable. She produces the series, and I don't grow tired of the story. See why this is a much beloved modern tv-movie series for years.\nI love this movie & series! Family Halloween meets Christmas Romance!\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['WilderBilly'], 'Producers': ['Billy Wilder'], 'Starring': ['Humphrey Bogart', 'Audrey Hepburn', 'William Holden'], 'Studio': ['Classics']}\nI love the beginning set-up of this movie, with the narration performed by Audrey's character. I could watch the start again and again. Whole movie is enjoyable, and the Cinderella story and surprise twists are standard and enjoyable romance fare.\nMy favorite Audrey Hepburn film.\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['George Seaton'], 'Producers': ['William Perlberg'], 'Starring': [\"Maureen O'Hara\", 'John Payne', 'Edmund Gwenn'], 'Studio': ['20th Century Fox']}\nThis movie never gets old and I watch it with delight every year.
