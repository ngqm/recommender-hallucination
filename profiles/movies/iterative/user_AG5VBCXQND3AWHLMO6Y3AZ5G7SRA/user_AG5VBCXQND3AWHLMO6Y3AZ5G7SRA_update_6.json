Too bad it's not available for streaming. I loved it! I'd say one of her most enjoyable movies. She's older (middle-older teen) in this, and it only offers more depth and romantic escapades for her fans! The setting (modern day pirate's boat & cove) and adventure, with her relationship with her old salt dad, and her budding interest in a handsome, young modern man from the city, is refreshing, the 60's appeal is fun, and her character is a rough & tumble tomboy that you'd better not mess with! However, she's feeling soft new feelings she hasn't experienced before, and the coming-of-age conflict is portrayed very well and really fun to watch. This is now one of my very favorite films of hers (along with Gypsy Girl). :) I had never seen this one before, so glad it's available on DVD at least!\nReview Title: Now one of my very favorite Haley Mills films :)\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

This 'new' disc sold by Amazon, with no DVD security features on the packaging, has numerous glitches; I suspect it's on all copies of this edition, I bought it new. It pauses momentarily, perhaps makes a sound, and continues. It's done this several times already having started the movie (it's on as I speak). It's widescreen and the picture quality is okay, but my roommate pointed out to me that it's overdubbed, that is the sound isn't always matching the lips; I checked the listing, and sure enough, it says \"dubbed\". I haven't tried the French-language soundtrack. I already purchased a used copy of a more expensive edition of this film by Anchor Bay. I'll be returning this one. I'm surprised at Amazon for selling an inferior version as new.<br /><br />--<br /><br />I received and am playing the disk I referred to [[ASIN:6305511861 The Car]] and when trying to review the Amazon system informed me I have already reviewed the product, being the other disk of inferior condition that wouldn't play. This, of course, is ridiculous. This disk, as I have anticipated, is superior and is playing without a single glitch. It was professionally produced with packaging as a DVD should be. So, definitely get this (ASIN 6305511861) rather than the cheaper disk on Amazon which began this review. Both are Region 1. I bought a used disk which is in better condition than the \"new\" one sold by Amazon. Neither Region 1 DVD disk of this movie has subtitles. I'm happy with the widescreen version included on the ASIN mentioned. The single caveat of this edition is that the packaging has a definite flaw:  the ring that holds the disk continues in a full circle even past the finger indentations, making it impossible to remove the disk easily even when holding down the middle button. You could scratch the disk trying to get it out, I had to hold it upside down and dig with the \"button finger\". I won't return it to the case. But the disk itself is great, and the one I recommend (Anchor Bay). Too bad it's out of print.\nGlitched. Dubbed.

It's love at first sight and a match made in heaven. They enjoy a storybook romance and decide to get married, much to the dismay of Joe's quirky but loving parents. It's marital bliss until Joe discovers that Amanda was born a man and had a sex change at age 18! Devastated by Amanda's shocking admission, Joe sends her out the door. After much thought, however, Joe comes to his senses and realizes that Amanda was the best thing that ever happened to him. In his quest to find Amanda and rekindle their relationship, he discovers the real truth about love.
