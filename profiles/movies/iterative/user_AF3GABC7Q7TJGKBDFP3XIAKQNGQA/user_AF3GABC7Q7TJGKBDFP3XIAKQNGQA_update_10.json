Suave, yes, but also a \"blunt instrument,\" reckless, and possessed with an ego that compromises his judgment during his first mission to root out the mastermind behind an operation that funds international terrorists. In classic Bond film tradition, his global itinerary takes him to far-flung locales, including Uganda, Madagascar, the Bahamas (that\\'s more like it), and Montenegro, where he is pitted against his nemesis in a poker game, with hundreds of millions in the pot. The stakes get even higher when Bond lets down his \"armor\" and falls in love with Vesper (Eva Green), the ravishing banker\\'s representative fronting him the money.', 'For longtime fans of the franchise,', 'Casino Royale', 'offers some retro kicks.

Carl Fredricksen, a retired balloon salesman, is part rascal, part dreamer who is ready for his last chance at high-flying excitement. Tying thousands of balloons to his house, Carl sets off to the lost world of his childhood dreams. Unbeknownst to Carl, Russell, an overeager 8-year-old Wilderness Explorer who has never ventured beyond his backyard, is in the wrong place at the wrong time -- Carl\\'s front porch!

Stuck together in the wilds of the jungle, Carl realizes that sometimes life\\'s biggest adventures aren\\'t the ones you set out looking for. Including the hilarious short film \"Dug\\'s Special Mission,\" UP reaches new heights on Blu-ray(TM) and DVD. \"You will want to see it again and again,\" raves Christopher Kelly of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.

Carl Fredericksen (voice by Ed Asner) ranks among the most unlikely heroes in recent animation history. A 78- year-old curmudgeon, he enjoyed his modest life as a balloon seller because he shared it with his adventurous wife Ellie (Ellie Docter). But she died, leaving him with memories and the awareness that they never made their dream journey to Paradise Falls in South America. When well-meaning officials consign Carl to Shady Oaks Retirement Home, he rigs thousands of helium balloons to his house and floats to South America. The journey's scarcely begun when he discovers a stowaway: Russell (Jordan Nagai), a chubby, maladroit Wilderness Explorer Scout who's out to earn his Elderly Assistance Badge. In the tropical jungle, Carl and Russell find more than they bargained for: Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer), a crazed explorer whose newsreels once inspired Carl and Ellie; Kevin, an exotic bird with a weakness for chocolate; and Dug (Bob Peterson), an endearingly dim golden retriever fitted with a voice box. More importantly, the travelers discover they need each other: Russell needs a (grand)father figure; Carl needs someone to enliven his life without Ellie. Together, they learn that sharing ice-cream cones and counting the passing cars can be more meaningful than feats of daring-do and distant horizons.

Alternate versions of key moments in the film show how these scenes changed during preproduction and why. An early storyboard of the wordless \"Married Life\" sequence that reduced many viewers to tears could have worked, but it\\'s far less satisfying than the final iteration. Discussions of the characters Carl and Russell include preliminary art and footage of director Pete Docter working with child actor Jordan Nagai. In a thoughtful interview, composer Michael Giacchino explains his use of musical motifs for the individual characters, and how shifts from major to minor chords suggest different moods. The Global Guardian Badge Game narrated by Nagai is an interesting geography quiz that would be more fun if the controls were better calibrated--it\\'s hard to land a cursor on Delaware or Belgium when it keeps drifting away.

With the Cardinals' lives on the line, and the Camerlengo (Ewan McGregor) desperate for help, Langdon embarks on a nonstop, action-packed race through sealed crypts, dangerous catacombs, and the most secret vault on Earth!\", 'Amazon.com', \"If the devil is in the details, there's a lot of wicked fun in\", 'Angels & Demons', ', the sequel (originally a prequel) to', 'The Da Vinci Code', \". Director Ron Howard delivers edge-of-your-pew thrills all over the Vatican, the City of Rome, and the deepest, dankest catacombs. Tom Hanks is dependably watchable in his reprised role as Professor Robert Langdon, summoned urgently to Rome on a matter of utmost urgency--which happens to coincide with the death of the Pope, meaning the Vatican is teeming with cardinals and Rome is teeming with the faithful. A religious offshoot group, calling themselves the Illuminati, which protested the Catholic Church's prosecution of scientists 400 years ago, has resurfaced and is making extreme, and gruesome, terrorist demands. The film zooms around the city, as Langdon follows clues embedded in art, architecture, and the very bone structure of the Vatican. The cast is terrific, including Ewan McGregor, who is memorable as a young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the late pontiff, and who seems to challenge the common wisdom of the Conclave just by being 40 years younger than his fellows when he lectures for church reform. Stellan Skarsgard is excellent as a gruff commander of the Swiss Guard, who may or may not have thrown in with the Illuminati. But the real star of the film is Rome, and its High Church gorgeousness, with lush cinematography by Salvatore Totino, who renders the real sky above the Vatican, in a cataclysmic event, with the detail and majesty of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. --\", 'A.T.
