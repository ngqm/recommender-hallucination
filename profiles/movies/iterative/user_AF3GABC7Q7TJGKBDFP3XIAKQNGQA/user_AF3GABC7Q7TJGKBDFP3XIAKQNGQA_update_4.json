But Bond is no less dangerous, and with two professional assassinations in quick succession, he is elevated to \"00\" status. \"M\" (Judi Dench), head of the British Secret Service, sends the newly-promoted 007 on his first mission that takes him to Madagascar, the Bahamas and eventually leads him to Montenegro to face Le Chiffre, a ruthless financier under threat from his terrorist clientele, who is attempting to restore his funds in a high-stakes poker game at the Casino Royale. \"M\" places Bond under the watchful eye of the Treasury official Vesper Lynd. At first skeptical of what value Vesper can provide, Bond\\'s interest in her deepens as they brave danger together. Le Chiffre\\'s cunning and cruelty come to bear on them both in a way Bond could never imagine, and he learns his most important lesson: Trust no one.', 'Amazon.com', 'The most successful invigoration of a cinematic franchise since', 'Batman Begins, Casino Royale', 'offers a new Bond identity. Based on the Ian Fleming novel that introduced Agent 007 into a Cold War world,', 'Casino Royale', 'is the most brutal and viscerally exciting James Bond film since Sean Connery left Her Majesty\\'s Secret Service. Meet the new Bond; not the same as the old Bond. Daniel Craig gives a galvanizing performance as the freshly minted double-0 agent. Suave, yes, but also a \"blunt instrument,\" reckless, and possessed with an ego that compromises his judgment during his first mission to root out the mastermind behind an operation that funds international terrorists. In classic Bond film tradition, his global itinerary takes him to far-flung locales, including Uganda, Madagascar, the Bahamas (that\\'s more like it), and Montenegro, where he is pitted against his nemesis in a poker game, with hundreds of millions in the pot. The stakes get even higher when Bond lets down his \"armor\" and falls in love with Vesper (Eva Green), the ravishing banker\\'s representative fronting him the money.', 'For longtime fans of the franchise,', 'Casino Royale', 'offers some retro kicks. Bond wins his iconic Astin-Martin at the gaming table, and when a bartender asks if he wants his martini \"shaken or stirred,\" he disdainfully replies, \"Do I look like I give a damn?\" There\\'s no Moneypenny or \"Q,\" but Dame Judi Dench is back as the exasperated M, who one senses, admires Bond\\'s \"bloody cheek.\" A Bond film is only as good as its villain, and Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre, who weeps blood, is a sinister dandy. From its punishing violence and virtuoso action sequences to its romance,', 'Casino Royale', 'is a Bond film that, in the words of one character, makes you feel it, particularly during an excruciating torture sequence. Double-0s, Bond observes early on, \"have a short life expectancy.\" But with Craig, there is new life in the old franchise yet, as well as genuine anticipation for the next one when, at last, the signature James Bond theme kicks in following the best last line ever in any Bond film.

Carl Fredricksen, a retired balloon salesman, is part rascal, part dreamer who is ready for his last chance at high-flying excitement. Tying thousands of balloons to his house, Carl sets off to the lost world of his childhood dreams. Unbeknownst to Carl, Russell, an overeager 8-year-old Wilderness Explorer who has never ventured beyond his backyard, is in the wrong place at the wrong time -- Carl\\'s front porch! The world\\'s most unlikely duo reach new heights and meet fantastic friends like Dug, a dog with a special collar that allows him to speak, and Kevin, a rare 13-foot tall flightless bird. Stuck together in the wilds of the jungle, Carl realizes that sometimes life\\'s biggest adventures aren\\'t the ones you set out looking for. Including the hilarious short film \"Dug\\'s Special Mission,\" UP reaches new heights on Blu-ray(TM) and DVD. \"You will want to see it again and again,\" raves Christopher Kelly of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. It\\'s adventure that will send your spirits soaring!', 'Amazon.com', 'At a time when too many animated films consist of anthropomorphized animals cracking sitcom one-liners and flatulence jokes, the warmth, originality, humor, and unflagging imagination of', 'Up', \"feel as welcome as rain in a desert. Carl Fredericksen (voice by Ed Asner) ranks among the most unlikely heroes in recent animation history. A 78- year-old curmudgeon, he enjoyed his modest life as a balloon seller because he shared it with his adventurous wife Ellie (Ellie Docter). But she died, leaving him with memories and the awareness that they never made their dream journey to Paradise Falls in South America. When well-meaning officials consign Carl to Shady Oaks Retirement Home, he rigs thousands of helium balloons to his house and floats to South America. The journey's scarcely begun when he discovers a stowaway: Russell (Jordan Nagai), a chubby, maladroit Wilderness Explorer Scout who's out to earn his Elderly Assistance Badge. In the tropical jungle, Carl and Russell find more than they bargained for: Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer), a crazed explorer whose newsreels once inspired Carl and Ellie; Kevin, an exotic bird with a weakness for chocolate; and Dug (Bob Peterson), an endearingly dim golden retriever fitted with a voice box. More importantly, the travelers discover they need each other: Russell needs a (grand)father figure; Carl needs someone to enliven his life without Ellie. Together, they learn that sharing ice-cream cones and counting the passing cars can be more meaningful than feats of daring-do and distant horizons. Pete Docter (\", 'Monsters, Inc', \". ) and Bob Peterson direct the film with consummate skill and taste, allowing the poignant moments to unfold without dialogue to Michael Giacchnio's vibrant score. Building on their work in\", 'The Incredibles', 'and', 'Ratatouille', \", the Pixar crew offers nuanced animation of the stylized characters. Even by Pixar's elevated standards,\", 'Up', 'is an exceptional film that will appeal of audiences of all ages. Rated PG for some peril and action. --', 'Charles Solomon', 'Stills from', 'Up', '(Click for larger image)', 'Set Contains:', \"The eagerly awaited Blu-ray of Pixar's hit\", 'Up', 'comes loaded with extras, including two animated shorts: Peter Sohn\\'s \"Partly Cloudy,\" which screened with the feature in its theatrical release, and a new film, \"Dug\\'s Special Mission.\" Directed by Ronnie Del Carmen, \"Special Mission\" reveals how Dug, the dim but lovable golden retriever, met Carl and Russell. \"Adventure Is Out There\" documents the research trip a key group of artists took to the Tapuis in South America and includes not only footage of the precipitous ascent of the mountain, but watercolor sketches the artists did there. Alternate versions of key moments in the film show how these scenes changed during preproduction and why. An early storyboard of the wordless \"Married Life\" sequence that reduced many viewers to tears could have worked, but it\\'s far less satisfying than the final iteration. Discussions of the characters Carl and Russell include preliminary art and footage of director Pete Docter working with child actor Jordan Nagai. In a thoughtful interview, composer Michael Giacchino explains his use of musical motifs for the individual characters, and how shifts from major to minor chords suggest different moods. The Global Guardian Badge Game narrated by Nagai is an interesting geography quiz that would be more fun if the controls were better calibrated--it\\'s hard to land a cursor on Delaware or Belgium when it keeps drifting away. The bonus materials suggest that if Pixar consistently makes the best animated films in America, it\\'s because such talented artists work so hard on them.', '--Charles Solomon', 'See more']\n{'Genre': 'Kids & Family, Animation, Action & Adventure', 'Format': 'Blu-ray', 'Contributor': 'Don Fullilove, Delroy Lindo, Elie Docter, Pete Docter, Jordan Nagai, Story By Pete Docter, Bob Peterson And Tom McCarth, Screenplay By Bob Peterson And Pete Docter, Jerome Ranft, Ed Asner, Directed By Pete Docter, Christopher Plummer, John Ratzenberger, Danny Mann, Bob Peterson, David Kaye, Mickie T.
