Borchers', 'John Allen Nelson', 'Daryl Sancton', 'Max Strom', 'David Tripet'], 'Starring': ['Joan Severance', 'Tony Denison', 'John Allen Nelson'], 'Studio': ['EPIX']}\nGeez, am I the ONLY person watching Prime that would like to see a decent movie?  I got 1/10th of the way thru this and went back to read the reviews to see if I was watching the same movie reviewed by others as &#34;bad girl&#34; or &#34;character&#34; depth, and I could go on.  But yep, I was watchin' the same innocuous boring as h\u20acll, practically made for Lifetime t.v. movie.<br />I proceeded to fast forward it several mins at a time to see if I could find anything remotely worth watching.  Never found it.<br />I'll be glad when Prime has more then worthless movies to watch!\nBleh...\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Morgan Freeman'], 'Producers': ['Bingo Gubelmann', 'Jack Heller', 'Austin Stark', 'Jim Young', 'Richard Bard', 'Nuala Barton', 'Benji Kohn', 'Chris Papvasiliou'], 'Starring': ['Mischa Barton', 'Matt Long', 'Jessica Stroup'], 'Studio': ['Paramount']}\nI must say this is the only good movie in this genre that is decent that I've seen on Amazon Prime.  I totally agree with the review this is a mix of &#34;Swimfan&#34; and &#34;Misery&#34;.<br />I give Misery 5 stars for being one of the best movies in horror/suspense.  That said, I didn't think I'd see another movie so well put together.  This is.<br />I liked that there wasn't any slip up's in the story.  &#34;Shelby&#34; does an excellent job covering her tracks.\nAhhhh, the football hero...maybe you really can't go home\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['PJ Woodside'], 'Producers': ['PJ Woodside', 'Steve Hudgins'], 'Starring': ['Kristine Renee Farley', 'Justin Veazey', 'Jessica Cook'], 'Studio': ['Indie Rights']}\nI can sum up my review in two words: Don't Bother!
