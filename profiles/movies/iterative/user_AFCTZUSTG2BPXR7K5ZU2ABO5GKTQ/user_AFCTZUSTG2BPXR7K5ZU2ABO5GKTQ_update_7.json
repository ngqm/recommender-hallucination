I've had a set of DVDs since I was a kid and am happy to now have the Blu Rays. The one drawback is this is the new dub done for Netflix not the original dub, so I guess I have to keep that DVD set around longer. If you want the original dub on Blu Ray you need to find the Special Edition set, which is obviously a lot more expensive.
