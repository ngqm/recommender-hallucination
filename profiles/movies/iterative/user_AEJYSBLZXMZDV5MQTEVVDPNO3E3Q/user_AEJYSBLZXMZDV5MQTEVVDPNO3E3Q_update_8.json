Partially inspired by 1958\\'s It! The Terror from Beyond Space, this instant classic set a tone of its own, offering richly detailed sets, ominous atmosphere, relentless suspense, and a flawless ensemble cast as the crew of the space freighter Nostromo, who fall prey to a vicious creature (designed by Swiss artist H.R. Giger) that had gestated inside one of the ill-fated crew members. In a star-making role, Sigourney Weaver excels as sole survivor Ripley, becoming the screen\\'s most popular heroine in a lucrative movie franchise. To measure the film\\'s success, one need only recall the many images that have been burned into our collective psyche, including the \"facehugger,\" the \"chestburster,\" and Ripley\\'s climactic encounter with the full-grown monster. Impeccably directed by Ridley Scott, Alien is one of the cinema\\'s most unforgettable nightmares.', '--Jeff Shannon', 'Review of', 'Aliens', 'Aliens is one of the few cases of a sequel that far surpassed the original. Sigourney Weaver returns as Ripley, who awakens on Earth only to discover that she has been hibernating in space so long that everyone she knows is dead. Then she is talked into traveling (along with a squad of Marines) to a planet under assault by the same aliens that nearly killed her. Once she gets there, she finds a lost little girl who triggers her maternal instincts--and she discovers that the company has once again double-crossed her, in hopes of capturing one of the aliens to study as a military weapon. Directed and written by James Cameron, this is one of the most intensely exciting (not to mention intensely frightening) action films ever, with a large ensemble cast that includes Bill Paxton, Lance Henriksen, Paul Reiser, and Michael Biehn. Weaver defined the action woman in this film and walked away with an Oscar nomination for her trouble.', '--Marshall Fine', 'Review of', 'Alien 3', 'The least successful film in this series was directed by stylemaster (and content-underachiever) David Fincher. Ripley, the only survivor of her past mission, awakens on a prison planet in the far corners of the solar system. As she tries to recover, she realizes that not only has an alien gotten loose on the planet, the alien has implanted one of its own within her. As she battles the prison authorities (and is aided by the prisoners) in trying to kill the alien, she must also cope with a distinctly shortened lifespan that awaits her. But the striking imagery makes for muddled action and the script confuses it further. The ending looks startling but it takes a long time--and a not particularly satisfying journey--to get there.', '--Marshall Fine', 'Review of', 'Alien Resurrection', \"Perhaps these films are like the Star Trek movies: The even-numbered episodes are the best ones. Certainly this film (directed by French stylist Jean-Pierre Jeunet) is an improvement over Alien 3, with a script that breathes exciting new life into the franchise. This chapter is set even further in the future, where scientists on a space colony have cloned both the alien and Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), who died in Alien 3; in doing so, however, they've mixed alien DNA with Ripley's human chromosomes, which gives Ripley surprising power (and a bad attitude). A band of smugglers comes aboard only to discover the new race of aliens--and when the multi-mouthed melonheads get loose, no place is safe. But, on the plus side, they have Ripley as a guide to help them get out. Winona Ryder is on hand as the smugglers' most unlikely crew member (with a secret of her own), but this one is Sigourney's all the way.\", '--Marshall Fine']\n{'Genre': 'Horror/Things That Go Bump/Monsters, Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Blu-ray, Box set, Dolby, DTS Surround Sound, Dubbed, NTSC, Subtitled, WidescreenMultiple Formats, AC-3, Blu-ray, Box set, Dolby, DTS Surround Sound, Dubbed, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen   See more', 'Contributor': 'Tom Skerritt, David Fincher, Ridley Scott, John Hurt, James Cameron, Winona Ryder, Sigourney Weaver, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Lance HenriksenTom Skerritt, David Fincher, Ridley Scott, John Hurt, James Cameron, Winona Ryder, Sigourney Weaver, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Lance Henriksen   See more', 'Language': 'German (DTS 5.1), French (DTS 5.1), Spanish (Dolby Digital 5.1), English (Dolby TrueHD)', 'Runtime': '7 hours and 57 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '2.35:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '1 x 5.6 x 6.9 inches; 14.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'Alien Ant', 'Director': 'Ridley Scott, David Fincher, James Cameron, Jean-Pierre Jeunet', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Blu-ray, Box set, Dolby, DTS Surround Sound, Dubbed, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Run time': '7 hours and 57 minutes', 'Release date': 'October 26, 2010', 'Actors': 'Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerritt, John Hurt, Lance Henriksen, Winona Ryder', 'Dubbed': 'Spanish, French', 'Subtitles': 'English, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish', 'Studio': '20th Century Fox Home Entertainment', 'Number of discs': '6'}\nGreat blue-ray uplift.

Director Coppola paints a chilling portrait of the Sicilian clan's rise and near fall from power in America, masterfully balancing the story between the Corleone's family life and the ugly crime business in which they are engaged. Based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel and featuring career-making performances by Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall, this searing and brilliant film garnered ten Academy Award nominations, and won three including Best Picture of 1972.\", 'Amazon.com', \"People used to say this was Frank Sinatra's world, and the rest of us just lived in it. After watching the multiple special features in the box set\", 'The Godfather - Coppola Restoration', \", one might conclude it's actually time for a cultural and historical revision: This is the Corleone family's world.

David Chase, creator of and writer on', 'The Sopranos', ', for example, describes in the featurette \"Godfather World\" that his hit HBO series was intended to be the story of the first generation of mobsters actually influenced by Francis Ford Coppola\\'s hit trilogy. Joe Mantegna calls the three films \"the Italian', 'Star Wars', '.\" (Mantegna co-stars in', 'The Godfather III', '.)

A number of people similarly testify in \"Godfather World\" to the importance and ubiquitousness of', 'The Godfather', 'and its sequels in American life. There\\'s no point in arguing, so its best to move on to the other featurettes, including \"The Masterpiece That Almost Wasn\\'t,\" reviewing in detail much of what has been said about Paramount\\'s mistreatment of Coppola, about casting fights (Steve McQueen as Michael?), about the studio\\'s assumption they were getting a quick-and-dirty B-movie, and about producer Robert Evans\\' determination to keep his choice of director and unlikely actors under his wing. Fresh information within the special features, however, begins with \"\u2026 When the Shooting Stopped,\" a fine study of post-production on', 'The Godfather', ', with several surprising and fascinating facts. Among emerging details is an explanation of why Michael Corleone\\'s scream toward the end of The Godfather III is silenced out. (Hint: it was meant to be the inverse of a sound effect in the first movie.) \"Emulsional Rescue: Revealing', 'The Godfather', '\" talks about the painstaking work of restoring the first two films, beginning with a phone call from Coppola to Steven Spielberg (after the latter\\'s DreamWorks studio became part of the Viacom family) asking if he\\'d request money from Paramount for restoration work. \"', 'The Godfather', 'On the Red Carpet is a negligible series of fawning statements about the movie from hot young actors, while \"Four Short Films\" are brief and enjoyable takes on different aspects of', \"The Godfather's\", 'impact on modern living.', '--Tom Keogh', 'Stills from', 'The Godfather - The Coppola Restoration Giftset', '(Click for larger image)']\n{'Aspect Ratio': '1.85:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.72 x 5.5 x 6.86 inches; 7.84 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'BSP 2032', 'Director': 'Francis Ford Coppola', 'Media Format': 'Blu-ray, Closed-captioned, Color, Widescreen', 'Run time': '9 hours and 9 minutes', 'Release date': 'September 23, 2008', 'Actors': 'Al Pacino', 'Dubbed': 'French, Spanish', 'Subtitles': 'French, Portuguese, Spanish, English', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1), English (Mono)', 'Studio': 'Paramount Home Entertainment', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '4'}\nWatching the Godfather films, one right after the other, is an awesome experience.
