The show is both wholesome and entertaining. Anytime my 4 year old experiences a life issue we quickly search for the correct episode to play for him. Like when our son was experiencing life with a new sister we played the episode of Daniel tigers new sibling coming home. Overall amazing\nGreat animation show for kids ever.\n{'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'Espa\u00f1ol', 'Portugu\u00eas', 'Fran\u00e7ais'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', 'Espa\u00f1ol', 'Fran\u00e7ais', 'Portugu\u00eas'], 'Directors': ['Jon Erwin', 'Andrew Erwin (The Erwin Brothers)'], 'Producers': ['Kevin Downes', 'Jon Erwin', 'Andrew Erwin'], 'Starring': ['KJ Apa', 'Britt Robertson', 'Melissa Roxburgh'], 'Studio': ['Lionsgate']}\nWhile I enjoyed the film, I felt it was slow at times.
