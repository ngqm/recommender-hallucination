It features three of the shows dancers, Kym, Ashly and Maksim and promises to teach the viewer dance steps while providing a good workout.  Unfortunately, the cuing is inadequate and the instructions are spare at best. The warm up and cool down segments are short.  The dance segments feature the Paso Doble, ChaCha, Samba and Jive(supposedly a combination of the Lindy and the swing). These are followed by a  totally annoying and frustrating freestyle section that seems designed to  spotlight the three dancers.  It is way to fast and even the three teachers are unable to follow each other's lead.  The instructors are oblivious to the fact that they are actually supposed to be leading non-professionals.  The banter is truly irritating--it is very hard to believe that toned, professional dancers would be winded and sore from this workout. The segments do not flow smoothly from one to the other.<br /><br />If you want a good workout that are many superb videos catering to virtually every taste that are much easier to follow. If you want to learn to dance, sign up for classes.  If you want to see your favorite dancer, skip this video and tape the tv show.\nReview Title: Dancing Gets Only Three Stars\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
