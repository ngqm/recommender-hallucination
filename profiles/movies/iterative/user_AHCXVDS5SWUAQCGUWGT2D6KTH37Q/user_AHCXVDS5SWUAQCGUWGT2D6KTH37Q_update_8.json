It had been a long time since I've seen an action movie with such a combination of bad acting, horrible directing, a snoozer for a script and a cast that couldn't deliver their lines with any sort of skills.  Rappers, C-list movie stars and singers make up this woeful cast of 'professional' bank robbers who only 'take' the big ones... the major chase scenes are so ridiculous you will roll your eyes and shake your head as you watch them.... there was a host of reasons a sequel wasn't made.\nUgh....\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Adam Arkin', 'Jon Avnet', 'Peter Werner', 'Michael Dinner', 'John Dahl', 'Bill Johnson', 'Michael W.

I have to agree- it's well acted, written and directed.  My favorite actor on the show after Timothy Olyphant is Erica Tazel.\nEnjoying discovering 'Justified'!\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Joe Chappelle', 'Ernest R.

Chris Pine simply doesn't have the presence that I expect from this role and Keiera Knightly was simply annoying and distracting as his love interest.<br /><br />Mr. Branaugh had directed other action films with similar underwhelming results (the first 'Thor' movie nearly put me to sleep)... This was a decently entertaining movie but not overly satisfying.<br /><br />IF there is a sequel diminishing Ms. Knightly's character and more emphasis on the action involving Mr Ryan would be my advice.\nNot enough emphasis on the main character, too much on his wife, poorly directed\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Timothy Van Patten', 'Allen Coulter', 'Jeremy Podeswa', 'Ed Bianchi', 'Brad Anderson', 'Alik Sakharov', 'Jake Paltrow', 'Simon Cellan Jones', 'Brian Kirk', 'Martin Scorsese'], 'Starring': ['Steve Buscemi', 'Michael Pitt', 'Kelly Macdonald'], 'Studio': ['HBO']}\nOhh so good!
