It had been a long time since I've seen an action movie with such a combination of bad acting, horrible directing, a snoozer for a script and a cast that couldn't deliver their lines with any sort of skills.  Rappers, C-list movie stars and singers make up this woeful cast of 'professional' bank robbers who only 'take' the big ones... the major chase scenes are so ridiculous you will roll your eyes and shake your head as you watch them.... there was a host of reasons a sequel wasn't made.\nUgh....\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Adam Arkin', 'Jon Avnet', 'Peter Werner', 'Michael Dinner', 'John Dahl', 'Bill Johnson', 'Michael W.

I have to agree- it's well acted, written and directed.  My favorite actor on the show after Timothy Olyphant is Erica Tazel.\nEnjoying discovering 'Justified'!\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Joe Chappelle', 'Ernest R.
