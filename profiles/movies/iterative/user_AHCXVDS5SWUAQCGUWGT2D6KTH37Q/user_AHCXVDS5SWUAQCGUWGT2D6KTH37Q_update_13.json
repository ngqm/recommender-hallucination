Jennifer Lawrence was fine in her role yet I found myself not caring about either character.<br /><br />The plot is a bit ridiculous and the best acting in the film is turned in by Lawrence Fishburne who unfortunately suffers the fate of so many lone black actors in a film...<br /><br />The plot is a bit thin and the directing not inspiring... Thank goodness this bombed at the box office so there will be no sequel.\nReview Title: Zzzzz....

The newcomers are mediocre to horrible actors, the plot was lifted from other Star War movies and some of the holes in the plot were bigger than the Death Star.<br /><br />Death/destruction is coming yet no attempt to flee the planet?<br /><br />Young Darth Vader wannabee gets into a fierce light saber fight with someone who has never used a light saber yet was holding his own? How is that possible?!<br /><br />An untrained person in the Force using mind tricks that, according to previous movies, only a trained Jedi can use?<br /><br />Harrison Ford looked bored and Carrie Fisher was simply 'there'... good paychecks for both I suppose (Harrison got $25 million and a cut of the box office I heard).<br /><br />The Finn character is this movie's Jar Jar Binks... I was prepared to have him killed off about 20 minutes into the movie (dang- he lives on for the sequels). This young actor is awful- all wide eye looks and zero acting ability.<br /><br />The Rey character is all furrowed brow and, again, ZERO acting ability. If I never see these two (John Boyega and Daisey Ridley) in another movie I will be very happy (and I won't see them together again because there is no way I'm watching the inevitable sequels of this horrid film).<br /><br />The character played by Lupita Nyong'o is such a laughable rip-off of Yoda... to think she did publicity saying she was in this movie when actually it is only her voice that is in the movie. If I didn't stay for the credits I would have never known which character she played!<br /><br />It looks as if JJ Abrams has bitten off too many movie projects and this was a lazy, lazy directing and script writing effort... Disney made their money and the financial backers are happy. That is the most positive thing I can say about this movie of which I wouldn't watch again if came on free TV and there was nothing else on.
