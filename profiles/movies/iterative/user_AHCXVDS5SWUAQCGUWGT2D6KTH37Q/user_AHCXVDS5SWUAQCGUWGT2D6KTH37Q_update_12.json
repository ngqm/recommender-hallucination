The newcomers are mediocre to horrible actors, the plot was lifted from other Star War movies and some of the holes in the plot were bigger than the Death Star.<br /><br />Death/destruction is coming yet no attempt to flee the planet?<br /><br />Young Darth Vader wannabee gets into a fierce light saber fight with someone who has never used a light saber yet was holding his own? How is that possible?!<br /><br />An untrained person in the Force using mind tricks that, according to previous movies, only a trained Jedi can use?<br /><br />Harrison Ford looked bored and Carrie Fisher was simply 'there'... good paychecks for both I suppose (Harrison got $25 million and a cut of the box office I heard).<br /><br />The Finn character is this movie's Jar Jar Binks... I was prepared to have him killed off about 20 minutes into the movie (dang- he lives on for the sequels). This young actor is awful- all wide eye looks and zero acting ability.<br /><br />The Rey character is all furrowed brow and, again, ZERO acting ability. If I never see these two (John Boyega and Daisey Ridley) in another movie I will be very happy (and I won't see them together again because there is no way I'm watching the inevitable sequels of this horrid film).<br /><br />The character played by Lupita Nyong'o is such a laughable rip-off of Yoda... to think she did publicity saying she was in this movie when actually it is only her voice that is in the movie. If I didn't stay for the credits I would have never known which character she played!<br /><br />It looks as if JJ Abrams has bitten off too many movie projects and this was a lazy, lazy directing and script writing effort... Disney made their money and the financial backers are happy. That is the most positive thing I can say about this movie of which I wouldn't watch again if came on free TV and there was nothing else on. I was looking at my watch 30 minutes into the movie!\nReview Title: Expensive mess... JJ Abrams took a huge misstep with this one.\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

It had been a long time since I've seen an action movie with such a combination of bad acting, horrible directing, a snoozer for a script and a cast that couldn't deliver their lines with any sort of skills.  Rappers, C-list movie stars and singers make up this woeful cast of 'professional' bank robbers who only 'take' the big ones... the major chase scenes are so ridiculous you will roll your eyes and shake your head as you watch them.... there was a host of reasons a sequel wasn't made.\nUgh....\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Adam Arkin', 'Jon Avnet', 'Peter Werner', 'Michael Dinner', 'John Dahl', 'Bill Johnson', 'Michael W.

Chris Pine simply doesn't have the presence that I expect from this role and Keiera Knightly was simply annoying and distracting as his love interest.<br /><br />Mr. Branaugh had directed other action films with similar underwhelming results (the first 'Thor' movie nearly put me to sleep)...
