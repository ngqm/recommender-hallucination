Each mystery is new and unusual and involves the group stopping someone from wreaking certain havoc on the world. Scooby-Doo was a large, loveable but cowardly Great Dane who hung around four California high school students (Fred, Velma, Daphne and Shaggy). The four teen-agers were in constant search of mysteries and adventures, driving around in a bright green van known as the Mystery Machine. Many of the group's adventures involved villians who took on supernatural disguises (ghosts and monsters); the villians' activities usually involved blackmail, theft, fraud and other forms of corruption. At the first hint of trouble, Scooby-Doo (and usually, Shaggy as well) running for cover; they usually found themselves in even deeper trouble.
