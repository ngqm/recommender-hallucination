Now, for the first time on DVD, experience the hits through a chronology of vintage live performances such as \"Branded Man\" (Country Music Holiday,1968), \"Mama Tried\" (Billy Walker\\'s Country Carnival, 1968) and \"Okie From Muskogee\" (The Porter Wagoner Show, 1970). When Merle Haggard left prison in 1960, he went on to achieve 38 #1 hits (to date) and establish himself as one of the greats in country music. But getting out of prison didn\\'t quite mean leaving his rebel ways behind. His songwriting depicted the truths of a rough-and-tumble life which he fused with a musical style derived from hardcore country, jazz, blues and folk to create a sound no one had ever heard, with lyrics many could relate to. From the walls of San Quentin to his free-spirited life as an irreverent and unique voice outside the Nashville establishment to his induction in the Country Music Hall of Fame, Merle Haggard has never left a doubt that he is country\\'s original outlaw.']\n{'Genre': 'Merle Haggard Legendary Performances, Country', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Merle Haggard', 'Language': 'English', 'Number Of Discs': '1', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.33:1', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '5.4 x 7.5 x 0.6 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'DVD0808001', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, NTSC', 'Run time': '1 hour and 5 minutes', 'Release date': 'November 11, 2008', 'Actors': 'Merle Haggard', 'Studio': 'SHOUT!
