Couldn't wait to watch the next episode.  The cast was really good, plenty of drama and even the small town vigilantism was plausible.  I think this series was well written and acted and can't wait to see if there will be a Season 2 and how they would move on from the ending.  This series reminded me of the American series, The Killing.  Very believable storyline.\nReview Title: Great drama series - unpredictable ending\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Story lines deal with corruption, deal-making, insidious city crime in a small town, arson, drug smuggling and family conflicts.  Watched two series ... wish there were more.  Good acting, great locales, slight romance, plenty of conflict and lots more room for more episodes.\nSmall town policing - blurred ethical lines!\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['James Strong', 'Euros Lyn'], 'Producers': ['Jane Featherstone', 'Chris Chibnall', 'Richard Stokes'], 'Starring': ['David Tennant', 'Olivia Colman', 'Jodie Whittaker'], 'Studio': ['PBS']}\nReally enjoyed watching the first season of Broadchurch ... which I did in one sitting.
