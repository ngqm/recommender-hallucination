Story lines deal with corruption, deal-making, insidious city crime in a small town, arson, drug smuggling and family conflicts.  Watched two series ... wish there were more.  Good acting, great locales, slight romance, plenty of conflict and lots more room for more episodes.\nSmall town policing - blurred ethical lines!\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['James Strong', 'Euros Lyn'], 'Producers': ['Jane Featherstone', 'Chris Chibnall', 'Richard Stokes'], 'Starring': ['David Tennant', 'Olivia Colman', 'Jodie Whittaker'], 'Studio': ['PBS']}\nReally enjoyed watching the first season of Broadchurch ... which I did in one sitting.  Couldn't wait to watch the next episode.  The cast was really good, plenty of drama and even the small town vigilantism was plausible.  I think this series was well written and acted and can't wait to see if there will be a Season 2 and how they would move on from the ending.  This series reminded me of the American series, The Killing.  Very believable storyline.\nGreat drama series - unpredictable ending\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', 'Espa\u00f1ol'], 'Directors': ['Lasse Hallstrom'], 'Producers': ['Steven Spielberg', 'Oprah Winfrey', 'Juliet Blake'], 'Starring': ['Helen Mirren', 'Om Puri', 'Manish Dayal'], 'Studio': ['DreamWorks Pictures']}\nReally enjoyable movie!  All the actors were excellent.  Scenery is very beautiful but almost the entire movie takes place in one village.  I thoroughly enjoyed The Hundred Foot Journey as I have all of Lasse Halstrom's movies!\nAll the actors were excellent.

The writers did wonderful job reintroducing the earlier unsolved missing and possibly murdered girls mystery; and the Season 1 murder trial and all the ramifications of prosecution and defense strategies and trial testimony were very engrossing!  This is very well written, well cast and well acted!  Can't wait for Season 3, and I hope they can keep the momentum up for a few more years!\nReally enjoyed Season 1 and didn't know how they would do ...\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Tim Fywell', 'Jim Loach', 'Mat King'], 'Producers': ['Emma Kingsman-Lloyd', 'Andy Harries', 'Charles Elton', 'Robert Murphy'], 'Starring': ['Stephen Tompkinson', 'Andrea Lowe', 'Caroline Catz'], 'Studio': ['BBC America']}\nEpisodes are good.  Tompkinson's acting is often overdone.  Like his new DC.\nEpisodes are good.

Sometimes Tompkinson's acting is a bit over the top.  Not sure why they pair him with such an insubordinate DC.\nDecent Police Procedural set in Beautiful Yorkshire\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['James Cameron'], 'Producers': ['Brooke Breton', 'James Cameron', 'Laeta Kalogridis', 'Jon Landau', 'Josh McLaglen', 'Janace Tashjian', 'Peter M. Tobyansen', 'Colin Wilson'], 'Starring': ['Sam Worthington', 'Sigourney Weaver', 'Zoe Saldana']}\nLoved all the special effects!  Will definitely watch Avatar 2.\nCharming!\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Israel Horovitz'], 'Producers': ['Rachael Horovitz', 'Gary Foster', 'Nitsa Benchetrit', 'David C. Barrot'], 'Starring': ['Kevin Kline', 'Kristin Scott Thomas', 'Maggie Smith']}\nInteresting story of the inheritance of an interest in a glorious Paris apartment with a sitting tenant with a lifetime lease and a totally hard luck guy just trying to get his hands on what he feels is overdue to him!  It's a bit dark, and even occasionally quite depressing, but does lift out of that to a satisfying conclusion.  Kevin Kline is wonderfully irreverent and can even be quite horrible when he wants to be! Very good cast!  Tip of the hat to Maggie Smith and Kristin Scott Thomas.\nDark Comedy, Exceptionally Good Cast\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Simon Langton'], 'Producers': ['Sue Birtwistle', 'Michael Wearing'], 'Starring': ['Alison Steadman', 'Julia Sawalha', 'Colin Firth'], 'Studio': ['Series']}\nGreat story, wonderful period costumes and social drama, excellent cast and and beautiful scenery.

This was extremely well written, had a superb cast and was wonderfully produced.  Very well done all around.  I developed a whole new respect for Benedict Cumberbatch.  He's quite the actor!\nWonderfully Done Period Drama\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Shona Auerbach'], 'Producers': ['Caroline Wood'], 'Starring': ['Emily Mortimer', 'Gerard Butler', 'Jack McElhone'], 'Studio': ['Miramax']}\nA lovely movie about a mom who goes to great lengths to maintain a lie to protect and care for her son.  Very well done!  Wonderful cast!  Storyline deals with a real life issue for many families.\nHeart warming family drama\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Otto Bathurst', 'Simon Curtis'], 'Producers': ['Paul Rutman', 'Simon Curtis', 'Hilary Salmon'], 'Starring': ['David Oyelowo', 'Edward Woodward', 'Hugh Bonneville'], 'Studio': ['HBO']}\nWell done, interesting mystery that focuses on the ongoing effects and repercussions of tragedy on the family involved.  Liked the extended format.  Several characters were pretty annoying, but it was well acted and a really solid story.\nAttention grabbing missing person mystery!\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Adrian Shergold', 'Peter Hoar', 'Farren Blackburn', 'Paul Whittington'], 'Producers': ['ITV'], 'Starring': ['Brenda Blethyn', 'Kenny Doughty', 'Jon Morrison'], 'Studio': ['BritBox']}\nBeautiful scenery, great characters, quirky cantankerous lead detective & decent mysteries make for a great series!\nFive Stars",
