Story lines deal with corruption, deal-making, insidious city crime in a small town, arson, drug smuggling and family conflicts.  Watched two series ... wish there were more.  Good acting, great locales, slight romance, plenty of conflict and lots more room for more episodes.\nSmall town policing - blurred ethical lines!\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['James Strong', 'Euros Lyn'], 'Producers': ['Jane Featherstone', 'Chris Chibnall', 'Richard Stokes'], 'Starring': ['David Tennant', 'Olivia Colman', 'Jodie Whittaker'], 'Studio': ['PBS']}\nReally enjoyed watching the first season of Broadchurch ... which I did in one sitting.  Couldn't wait to watch the next episode.  The cast was really good, plenty of drama and even the small town vigilantism was plausible.  I think this series was well written and acted and can't wait to see if there will be a Season 2 and how they would move on from the ending.  This series reminded me of the American series, The Killing.  Very believable storyline.\nGreat drama series - unpredictable ending\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', 'Espa\u00f1ol'], 'Directors': ['Lasse Hallstrom'], 'Producers': ['Steven Spielberg', 'Oprah Winfrey', 'Juliet Blake'], 'Starring': ['Helen Mirren', 'Om Puri', 'Manish Dayal'], 'Studio': ['DreamWorks Pictures']}\nReally enjoyable movie!  All the actors were excellent.  Scenery is very beautiful but almost the entire movie takes place in one village.

The writers did wonderful job reintroducing the earlier unsolved missing and possibly murdered girls mystery; and the Season 1 murder trial and all the ramifications of prosecution and defense strategies and trial testimony were very engrossing!  This is very well written, well cast and well acted!  Can't wait for Season 3, and I hope they can keep the momentum up for a few more years!\nReally enjoyed Season 1 and didn't know how they would do ...\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Tim Fywell', 'Jim Loach', 'Mat King'], 'Producers': ['Emma Kingsman-Lloyd', 'Andy Harries', 'Charles Elton', 'Robert Murphy'], 'Starring': ['Stephen Tompkinson', 'Andrea Lowe', 'Caroline Catz'], 'Studio': ['BBC America']}\nEpisodes are good.
