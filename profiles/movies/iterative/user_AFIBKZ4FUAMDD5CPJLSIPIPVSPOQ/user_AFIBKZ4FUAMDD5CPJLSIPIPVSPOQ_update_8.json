I can't imagine what movie THEY watched, because this movie had plenty of story line.  In fact, I don't think it had enough music!  I have loved the Four Seasons music my entire life, but had never really delved into the story of the band.  It was both wonderful and heart wrenching to see how they became who they became.  I won't go into details as I don't want to share any spoilers, but I can't think of a better thing to do on a Friday night than to brew up a cup of hot chocolate, pop some popcorn, and kick back and enjoy the Jersey Boys.\nReview Title: ... reviews where someone had stated this movie was only good for the music\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

It's not going to be intellectually stimulating, but what super hero movie is?  Thor is eye candy, the fight scenes are fun, and the ending is sweet.  Overall an enjoyable way to spend an hour and a half.\nVery enjoyable movie!\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Ben Affleck'], 'Producers': ['Grant Heslov', 'Marion Kodama Yue', 'George Clooney'], 'Starring': ['Ben Affleck', 'Bryan Cranston', 'Alan Arkin'], 'Studio': ['WARNER BROS.']}\nI rented this movie after hearing all of the hype about it, not really knowing all that much about it.  Then I found out it was a true story from declassified files from the government and was stunned.  The news reels made you feel like they were happening right then, not a filmed version.  The movie dragged in spots, I think I expected a bit more action in some parts, but the ending more than made up for it.\nSurprising...\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Joss Whedon'], 'Producers': ['Kevin Feige'], 'Starring': ['Robert Downey Jr. Chris Evans'], 'Studio': ['Hit Movies']}\nI have watched this movie over and over again and every time it makes me laugh.  Robert Downey, Jr. is outstanding at using his sarcastic whit.  The Hulk, though, is who really made this movie for me.  I laughed until I cried at the scene involving him and Loki.  Here's this big green beast of a guy and I found myself wanting to hug him and then hang out and have a laugh.  This one is a keeper.\nLOVE this movie!\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Richard LaGravenese'], 'Producers': ['Erwin Stoff', 'Andrew A.

This movie is no exception.  What could have been a series of very good movies was condensed into one movie that cannot possibly move forward into the sequels.  How can it when so much was changed in the first movie that there is no way to incorporate the other books?<br /><br />That being said, if you have not read the series you will probably enjoy this movie. On it's own, it really wasn't bad.  The acting was decent, although a bit cheesy in parts.  It moved along well and had a decent story line.  So, if you're just looking for a movie whose trailer looks interesting, I definitely wouldn't tell you to pass on this one.  If you're looking for a movie that reflects even 1/3 of the actual book series, choose another one.\nNot like the book\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Steve McQueen'], 'Producers': ['Dede Gardner', 'Anthony Katagas', 'Jeremy Kleiner', 'Steve McQueen', 'Arnon Milchan', 'Brad Pitt', 'Bill Pohlad', 'John Ridley', 'Tessa Ross', 'Bianca Stigter'], 'Starring': ['Chiwetel Ejiofor', 'Michael Kenneth Williams', 'Michael Fassbender'], 'Studio': ['Fox']}\nMy son and I watched this movie and found ourselves alternately sickened and furious over what happened.  To think that this actually happened is incomprehensible.  The movie was so well done that you could not help but be completely emotionally invested in it.  This is not an easy movie to watch, but it is an important one.\nInfuriating\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Renny Harlin'], 'Producers': ['Danny Lerner', 'Les Weldon', 'Boaz Davidson', 'Renny Harlin'], 'Starring': ['Kellan Lutz', 'Scott Adkins', 'Liam McIntyre'], 'Studio': ['Lionsgate']}\nThe previews for this movie looked really interesting, and I love most mythological movies, so we settled in with some popcorn to watch.  This movie was a complete waste of the $3.99 I paid to rent it through Amazon.  They tried to make up for terrible acting with action scenes that were in slow motion.  All that did was make it last longer, it didn't make it better.  Kellan Lutz should have been able to pull off Hercules, he certainly had the physique for it, but I just never connected with his character.  The love of his life was just silly.  Every line she said was supposed to be dramatic and instead it came out like some poorly written young adult novel.  Really, pass this one by.  It's not worth the time wasted, even if it ends up on Prime.\nA part of my life I will never get back.\n{'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['John Carney'], 'Producers': ['Judd Apatow', 'Tobin Armbrust', 'Anthony Bregman', 'Sam Hoffman', 'Ben Nearn', 'Tom Rice'], 'Starring': ['Keira Knightley', 'Mark Ruffalo', 'Hailee Steinfeld'], 'Studio': ['Weinstein Company LLC', 'The']}\nI very much enjoyed this movie.  The story line was good, Mark Ruffalo was excellent, as always.  Adam Levine was a wonderful surprise.  I suppose he shouldn't have been as musicians do well at showing emotion.  For the little time that he was actually in the movie, he portrayed his role very well.  My only complaint is that I don't think Keira Knightley is a good enough singer to pull off the role.  She's eh, okay, but I would never buy a song she performed.  I think they could have gotten a stronger lead.\nI very much enjoyed this movie\n{'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Clint Eastwood'], 'Producers': ['Clint Eastwood', 'Graham King', 'Robert Lorenz'], 'Starring': ['John Lloyd Young', 'Erich Bergen', 'Michael Lomenda'], 'Studio': ['Four Seasons Partnership', 'Warner Bros.']}\nI had read several reviews where someone had stated this movie was only good for the music, to not watch it for a plot.
