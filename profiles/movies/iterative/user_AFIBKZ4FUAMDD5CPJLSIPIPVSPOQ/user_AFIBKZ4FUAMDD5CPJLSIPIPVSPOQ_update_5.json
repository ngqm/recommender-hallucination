To think that this actually happened is incomprehensible.  The movie was so well done that you could not help but be completely emotionally invested in it.

It's not going to be intellectually stimulating, but what super hero movie is?  Thor is eye candy, the fight scenes are fun, and the ending is sweet.  Overall an enjoyable way to spend an hour and a half.\nVery enjoyable movie!\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Ben Affleck'], 'Producers': ['Grant Heslov', 'Marion Kodama Yue', 'George Clooney'], 'Starring': ['Ben Affleck', 'Bryan Cranston', 'Alan Arkin'], 'Studio': ['WARNER BROS.']}\nI rented this movie after hearing all of the hype about it, not really knowing all that much about it.  Then I found out it was a true story from declassified files from the government and was stunned.  The news reels made you feel like they were happening right then, not a filmed version.  The movie dragged in spots, I think I expected a bit more action in some parts, but the ending more than made up for it.\nSurprising...\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Joss Whedon'], 'Producers': ['Kevin Feige'], 'Starring': ['Robert Downey Jr. Chris Evans'], 'Studio': ['Hit Movies']}\nI have watched this movie over and over again and every time it makes me laugh.  Robert Downey, Jr. is outstanding at using his sarcastic whit.  The Hulk, though, is who really made this movie for me.  I laughed until I cried at the scene involving him and Loki.  Here's this big green beast of a guy and I found myself wanting to hug him and then hang out and have a laugh.  This one is a keeper.\nLOVE this movie!\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Richard LaGravenese'], 'Producers': ['Erwin Stoff', 'Andrew A. Kosove', 'Broderick Johnson', 'Molly Mickler Smith', 'David Valdes'], 'Starring': ['Alden Ehrenreich', 'Alice Englert', 'Jeremy Irons']}\nI admit that I am one of those people who reads a book then sees the movie and am disappointed.  This movie is no exception.  What could have been a series of very good movies was condensed into one movie that cannot possibly move forward into the sequels.  How can it when so much was changed in the first movie that there is no way to incorporate the other books?<br /><br />That being said, if you have not read the series you will probably enjoy this movie. On it's own, it really wasn't bad.  The acting was decent, although a bit cheesy in parts.  It moved along well and had a decent story line.  So, if you're just looking for a movie whose trailer looks interesting, I definitely wouldn't tell you to pass on this one.  If you're looking for a movie that reflects even 1/3 of the actual book series, choose another one.\nNot like the book\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Steve McQueen'], 'Producers': ['Dede Gardner', 'Anthony Katagas', 'Jeremy Kleiner', 'Steve McQueen', 'Arnon Milchan', 'Brad Pitt', 'Bill Pohlad', 'John Ridley', 'Tessa Ross', 'Bianca Stigter'], 'Starring': ['Chiwetel Ejiofor', 'Michael Kenneth Williams', 'Michael Fassbender'], 'Studio': ['Fox']}\nMy son and I watched this movie and found ourselves alternately sickened and furious over what happened.
