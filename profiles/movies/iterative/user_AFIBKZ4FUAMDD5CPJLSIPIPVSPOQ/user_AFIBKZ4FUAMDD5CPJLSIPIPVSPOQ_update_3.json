Robert Downey, Jr. is outstanding at using his sarcastic whit.  The Hulk, though, is who really made this movie for me.  I laughed until I cried at the scene involving him and Loki.  Here's this big green beast of a guy and I found myself wanting to hug him and then hang out and have a laugh.  This one is a keeper.\nReview Title: LOVE this movie!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

It's not going to be intellectually stimulating, but what super hero movie is?  Thor is eye candy, the fight scenes are fun, and the ending is sweet.  Overall an enjoyable way to spend an hour and a half.\nVery enjoyable movie!\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Ben Affleck'], 'Producers': ['Grant Heslov', 'Marion Kodama Yue', 'George Clooney'], 'Starring': ['Ben Affleck', 'Bryan Cranston', 'Alan Arkin'], 'Studio': ['WARNER BROS.']}\nI rented this movie after hearing all of the hype about it, not really knowing all that much about it.  Then I found out it was a true story from declassified files from the government and was stunned.  The news reels made you feel like they were happening right then, not a filmed version.  The movie dragged in spots, I think I expected a bit more action in some parts, but the ending more than made up for it.\nSurprising...\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Joss Whedon'], 'Producers': ['Kevin Feige'], 'Starring': ['Robert Downey Jr. Chris Evans'], 'Studio': ['Hit Movies']}\nI have watched this movie over and over again and every time it makes me laugh.
