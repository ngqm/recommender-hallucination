But this has been a gripper from the start.  I kind of hope the dome actually DOES have a mind of its own, actually IS protecting the people inside ... but things took a really weird twist a few weeks ago when, by jumping off an underground cliff, people from inside the dome somehow fell through to land outside the dome.  So totally weird that now there's no telling WHAT's going to happen next.  But I'm still caught in this show's grip.<br /><br />And if we miss an episode we're both happy to pull it up from Amazon, even nicer 'cause no commercials!\nReview Title: It's been a gripper from the start\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Sometimes you really get tired of blood 'n guts etc etc etc.  Sometimes a good ol' cute good guy mean bad guy lots of action adventure is just the thing.  So this is for those times.  I wouldn't mind watching this again.\nHappy ending youth oriented, I loved it\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Stephen Kay', 'F\u00e9lix Enr\u00edquez Alcal\u00e1', 'Allan Kroeker', 'Jamie Barber', 'Emile B.

So I knew I would be watching hero-Reacher using his incredible powers of induction and deduction, muscle-power, fight-moxie, and the bad guys were in truuu-ble.  Action-packed, great chase-scene, only moderate blood and gore, solid view-ability ... so I actually watched it.\nI don't watch a lot of movies but I sat and watched this.\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Quentin Tarantino'], 'Producers': ['Lawrence Bender'], 'Starring': ['Pam Grier', 'Samuel L. Jackson', 'Robert Forster']}\nPlot, plot, plot, is really excellent in this great old movie.  But the rest is pretty darned great, too, the actors/actresses, the acting, the camera work, well, everything that goes in to putting together a movie, it's all really really good;  you have to watch kind of carefully to put it all together, but it's definitely worth watching and re-watching.\nIt all holds together so cleverly\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Allan Dwan'], 'Producers': ['Nathan Scott'], 'Starring': ['Ruth Warrick', 'Natalie Wood', 'Walter Brennan'], 'Studio': ['Paramount']}\nThe little boy with the wild hair and glowering look and his sleek glib daddy were the &#34;villains&#34; of this delightful 1947 charmer.  Bad spoiled little boy with big slingshot and big &#34;something&#34; in the slingshot he kept threatening to whop cute little Jenny (Natalie Wood) with.  He never got to actually do it but I got the implication that slingshot well could have broken her arm.  As with old movies, the many details from the past (white picket fence full of rosebush after rosebush, glass dishes with ticks, old microscope, threat of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, male-female interactions, all have the charm and reasonable authenticity that can only be experienced by watching old movies.  &#34;Essence of charm.&#34;  And of course, Natalie Wood as a little girl had her own loveliness, perhaps SOMEbody was trying to find a Shirley Temple clone.  Personally, I am very glad to have had the opportunity to watch something that brings back the &#34;old days&#34; with an engaging plot handily concluded by happy coincidence thrown in.\nBlast from the Past with Class\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['J. Lee Thompson'], 'Producers': ['Arthur P. Jacobs'], 'Starring': ['Shirley MacLaine', 'Paul Newman', 'Robert Mitchum']}\n... and that was the line that I remembered from having seen this movie as a child.  It made an indelible impression.  I loved it then, and loved it now that Prime has made it available to watch again all these years later.  A shapely Shirley MacLaine in a multitude of weird and wonderful 60's outfits by Edith Head, takes the rags to riches story to another level.  All she wants is the simple life with a failure of a man, and each man she marries becomes a raging success, only adding to her growing and enormous fortune as their successes find a kitschy way to kill them, one by one, leaving poor Shirley with all that money.  As she describes her history to a psychologist throughout the movie, she compares each life to a kind of movie, starting out with a cute Charlie Chaplin-style (performed by Dick Van Dyke), and in my opinion, most memorable with \"Lush Budget Productions,\" performed with Robert Mitchum.  This movie was Hollywood laughing at itself, it's definitely worth a watch, with a bit of philosophy thrown in, and a joyous happy ending with four kids.  Enjoy!\nSimplify, simplify, our lives are frittered away in details!\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Jack Bender', 'Peter Leto', 'David Barrett', 'Sergio Mimica-Gezzan', 'Kari Skogland', 'Eriq La Salle', 'Edward Ornelas', 'Peter Weller', 'Roxann Dawson', 'Paul A.
