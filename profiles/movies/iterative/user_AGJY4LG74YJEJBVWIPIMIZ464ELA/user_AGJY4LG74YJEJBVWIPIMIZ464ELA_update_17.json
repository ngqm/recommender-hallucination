Directed by Peter Webber. Hannibal Rising is the terrifying Silence of the Lambs prequel that reveals the history of the infamous Hannibal and how he came to be a cannibalistic murderer. After young Hannibal is forced to watch his little sister, Mischa, devoured by starving soldiers in his homeland Lithuania, Hannibal vows to avenge his sister's death by slaying those who committed not only war crimes against the Lecters, but also against other families during WW II. In detailing Hannibal's revenge plan, the film investigates the psychological implications of witnessing cannibalism to justify Hannibal's insatiable appetite for human flesh.\", 'Review', \"Though Hannibal Rising's Lecter (Gaspard Ulliel) is a pussycat compared to Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs, this sequel's story of revenge is grizzly enough to satisfy lovers of Thomas Harris's epic tale. After young Hannibal (Aaron Thomas) is forced to watch his little sister, Mischa (Helena Lia Tachovska), devoured by starving soldiers in his homeland Lithuania, Hannibal vows to avenge his sister's death by slaying those who committed not only war crimes against the Lecters, but also against other families during WW II. In detailing Hannibal's revenge plan, the film investigates the psychological implications of witnessing cannibalism to justify Hannibal's insatiable appetite for human flesh. The most interesting aspect of Hannibal Rising its analytical connections drawn between Hannibal's childhood traumas and his murderous adult obsessions is also the film's weak point. The links oversimplify Lecter's complex character. For example, though titillating to see flashbacks of Lecter's sister hacked up and boiled while Lecter visits a Parisian meat market, the reference is too obvious. One learns why he excels in his medical school classes dissecting cadavers, and we're given explicit explanation for why he slices off and eats his victims' cheeks. The story only complicates when Hannibal interacts with his sexy Aunt, Lady Murasaki (Gong Li). When Murasaki educates him in the art of beheading, the viewer sees Hannibal's sword fetish as a manifestation of physical lust. --Trinie Dalton --Amazon.com\"]\n{'Genre': 'Horror', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Blu-ray, Import, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Gaspard Ulliel, Rhys Ifans, Aaran Thomas, Peter Webber, Helena-Lia Tachovsk\u00e1, Li Gong', 'Language': 'English, French', 'Runtime': '2 hours and 1 minute', 'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '6.5 x 5.25 x 0.25 inches; 2.88 Ounces', 'Director': 'Peter Webber', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Blu-ray, Import, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Run time': '2 hours and 1 minute', 'Release date': 'April 6, 2010', 'Actors': 'Gaspard Ulliel, Rhys Ifans, Li Gong, Aaran Thomas, Helena-Lia Tachovsk\u00e1', 'Subtitles': 'English', 'Studio': 'Alliance', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nSadly, the standard definition dvd has a few more additional minutes than the blu ray.
