Midsomer is a quaint English town and DCI Barnaby is at the ready to solve the bumper crop of murders in such a tiny place as Badger's Drift.

I thought they did an excellent job in casting and the new DCI was able to make a seamless transition into the next generation of mysteries, but people don't like change and I haven't seen much of the newer series, which is a disappointment because I thought the whole things was very well done.\nReview Title: Very Well Done\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

When a circle rings the moon, trouble looms, Should you misplace your broom, sorry; a hand vac can't be used in an exorcism rite. Fun and excitement abound in the Owens family of wily witches. One problem, though: the men the Owens women fall in love with are doomed to an untimely death. Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman bring a sparkling screen magic to Practical Magic, adapted from Alice Hoffman's bestseller and directed by Griffin Dunne (Addicted to Love). They play Sally and Gillian Owens, sisters hexed by a centuries -old curse...and coping with a witches brew of events involving a possible love match (Aidan Quinn) for one, a zombie (Goran Visnjic) for the other and a need to resume the age-old witchcraft taught by two doting Owens aunts (Stockard Channing and Dianne Wiest). Sit for a spell and enjoy.\", 'Amazon.com', 'Actor Griffin Dunne improves a bit on his first film as a director,', 'Addicted to Love', \", with this drama-comedy about a family of witches. Nicole Kidman and Sandra Bullock play spell-casting sisters of different temperaments: the former is a high-living, free-spirited sort, while Bullock's character is a homebody who can't get around a family curse that kills the men in their lives. A widowed single mom, Bullock gets into a jam with an abusive Bulgarian (Goran Visnjic) and is helped out by her sibling, but the result brings a good-looking, warm, inquisitive cop (Aidan Quinn) into their lives. The film has a variety of tonal changes--cute, scary, glum--that Dunne can't always effectively juggle. But the female-centric, celebratory nature of the film (the fantasies, the sharing, the witchy bonds) is infectious, and supporting roles by Dianne Wiest and Stockard Channing as Kidman and Bullock's magical aunts are a lot of fun.\", '--Tom Keogh']\n{'Aspect Ratio': '2.35:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.38 x 0.6 inches; 4 Ounces', 'Director': 'Griffin Dunne', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, Widescreen, NTSC', 'Run time': '1 hour and 43 minutes', 'Release date': 'February 16, 1999', 'Actors': 'Sandra Bullock, Nicole Kidman, Stockard Channing, Dianne Wiest, Goran Visnjic', 'Subtitles': 'English, French', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1), French (Dolby Digital 5.1)', 'Studio': 'Warner Home Video', 'Writers': 'Adam Brooks, Akiva Goldsman, Alice Hoffman, Robin Swicord', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nIf you are looking for a romance wrapped in a little mystery and magic then Practical Magic is for you.<br />Sandra Bullock, Nicole Kiiddman, Dianne Weist, and Stockard Channing deliver a fast moving whirlwind of magical happenings while Aidan Quinn tries to figure out what happened to a diabolical character from Arizona as the roses go crazy in the garden.

The scenery is beautiful and the characters engaging. It's one of my most favorite movies.<br /><br />My only complaint is, I wish it were the director's cut that I first saw. I think the cutting down of movies to secure shorter run times in manufacturing has ruined more than one excellent effort with heavy handed and insensitive cutting. I don't buy a lot of DVD's just because of the butchering that goes on with the original stories; they really don't do a very good job of it.

The first two seasonss are whimsical, fun, and upbeat. In this third season, Miss Fisher begins to mellow into a full on cozy detective and the tone is a little more serious and the plots a little more complex. The core cast is just fantastic and I certainly hope this series will take flight and a place alongside Poirot and Miss Marple in the classics of cozy mystery. Nathan Page plays detective Jack Robinson who, on his own, is the chief police detective for the district. However, his most endearing quality is how he entertains Miss Fisher's efforts and together they solve the mysteries. This series is funny (Jack and Hugh Collins in the police car late at night watching the legs of Miss Fisher disappear through an upstairs window,) and engrossing. The stories are well written and superbly acted.
