The program aired in syndication from 1954-55 and was based on mostly original stories written directly for television. It stars Ronald Howard \u2013 the son of screen legend Leslie Howard (of Scarlet Pimpernel and Gone with the Wind fame) \u2013 as Holmes and Howard Marion Crawford as Watson. Howard portrays a younger, more laid-back version of Sherlock Holmes based on the character in A Study in Scarlet and in line with Producer Sheldon Reynold\u2019s vision. His rapport with Howard Marion-Crawford\u2019s Dr. Watson is also more cooperative and less needling than most portrayals.

When a circle rings the moon, trouble looms, Should you misplace your broom, sorry; a hand vac can't be used in an exorcism rite. Fun and excitement abound in the Owens family of wily witches. One problem, though: the men the Owens women fall in love with are doomed to an untimely death. Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman bring a sparkling screen magic to Practical Magic, adapted from Alice Hoffman's bestseller and directed by Griffin Dunne (Addicted to Love). They play Sally and Gillian Owens, sisters hexed by a centuries -old curse...and coping with a witches brew of events involving a possible love match (Aidan Quinn) for one, a zombie (Goran Visnjic) for the other and a need to resume the age-old witchcraft taught by two doting Owens aunts (Stockard Channing and Dianne Wiest). Sit for a spell and enjoy.\", 'Amazon.com', 'Actor Griffin Dunne improves a bit on his first film as a director,', 'Addicted to Love', \", with this drama-comedy about a family of witches. Nicole Kidman and Sandra Bullock play spell-casting sisters of different temperaments: the former is a high-living, free-spirited sort, while Bullock's character is a homebody who can't get around a family curse that kills the men in their lives. A widowed single mom, Bullock gets into a jam with an abusive Bulgarian (Goran Visnjic) and is helped out by her sibling, but the result brings a good-looking, warm, inquisitive cop (Aidan Quinn) into their lives. The film has a variety of tonal changes--cute, scary, glum--that Dunne can't always effectively juggle. But the female-centric, celebratory nature of the film (the fantasies, the sharing, the witchy bonds) is infectious, and supporting roles by Dianne Wiest and Stockard Channing as Kidman and Bullock's magical aunts are a lot of fun.\", '--Tom Keogh']\n{'Aspect Ratio': '2.35:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.38 x 0.6 inches; 4 Ounces', 'Director': 'Griffin Dunne', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, Widescreen, NTSC', 'Run time': '1 hour and 43 minutes', 'Release date': 'February 16, 1999', 'Actors': 'Sandra Bullock, Nicole Kidman, Stockard Channing, Dianne Wiest, Goran Visnjic', 'Subtitles': 'English, French', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1), French (Dolby Digital 5.1)', 'Studio': 'Warner Home Video', 'Writers': 'Adam Brooks, Akiva Goldsman, Alice Hoffman, Robin Swicord', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nIf you are looking for a romance wrapped in a little mystery and magic then Practical Magic is for you.<br />Sandra Bullock, Nicole Kiiddman, Dianne Weist, and Stockard Channing deliver a fast moving whirlwind of magical happenings while Aidan Quinn tries to figure out what happened to a diabolical character from Arizona as the roses go crazy in the garden.

What fun! (I've read some negative things about this production but I would counsel to ignore them.) Technically you can enjoy this without it breaking down into window pane pixels or slowing to a stop towards the end and it's great entertainment. You can completely forget the bills and what Congress is doing and suspend reality for the length of this film and enjoy it with the kids! It's got it all: Romance, knights in shining armor, horses, a cause at stake, a family secret, beautiful ladies in courtly clothes, and villians abound.

The scenery is beautiful and the characters engaging. It's one of my most favorite movies.<br /><br />My only complaint is, I wish it were the director's cut that I first saw. I think the cutting down of movies to secure shorter run times in manufacturing has ruined more than one excellent effort with heavy handed and insensitive cutting. I don't buy a lot of DVD's just because of the butchering that goes on with the original stories; they really don't do a very good job of it. I wish the DVD manufacturers would stop that for the sake of aesthetics.\nSayonara\nSherlock Holmes: The Complete Series\nRonald Howard  (Actor),     Howard Marion-Crawford  (Actor),     Steve Previn  (Director),     Sheldon Reynolds  (Director)    &                   1                  more   Rated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Action & Adventure\n['This 39-episode series was the FIRST American television show of Sherlock Holmes adventures \u2013 and the only one for almost 60 years until 2012\u2019s Elementary.
