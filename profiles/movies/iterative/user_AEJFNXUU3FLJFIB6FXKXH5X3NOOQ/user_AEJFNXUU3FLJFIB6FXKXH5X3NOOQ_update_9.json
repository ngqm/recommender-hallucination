Everybody justs sleepwalks thru this entire flick. And for Vin before I even cash my check on a mish mash script effectively kills any chance for another sequel for this franchise not that it matters.  This franchise deserved a better send off than this. Makes watching paint dry exciting again.

From even Pentagons own study , known as Pentagon Papers which examined the US role from 1945 -1967'  in the area the real reason for the US involvement in Vietnam was to contain China expanision . One of three fronts long-run effort to contain China (realizing that the USSR \"contains\" China on the north and northwest):<br />(a) the Japan\u2013Korea front;<br />(b) the India\u2013Pakistan front; and<br />(c) the Southeast Asia front.<br />The fantasy put forth by political bias in this film is the same insanity that brought the US to bomb Laos, Cambodia & expand the war into US politics that made Watergate topple the Nixon administration in it's pursiut for fatally flawed foriegn & domestic policy.\nThud Pilots in a massive steamy Dud movie\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Neil Hollander', 'Rick Gordon', 'Mark H Tuttle'], 'Producers': ['Peter Maris', 'Donna K Tuttle', 'Mark H Tuttle'], 'Starring': ['Neil Armstrong']}\nFirst off Neil Armstrong is a god. Awesome narration. But this aviation series suffers major flaws , mistakes in so many areas it would take pages just to list. So for example lets look at episode 13 that centers on jets. The myth that german aviation specifically the TA -183  heavily influenced the Mig-15 . MiG-15 is merely a progression of the MiG-9 using information that was generally understood after the WWII. The MiG-9 was developed before any of the Ta-183 data was avalible and Ta-183's key feature was the high T-tail which was also its greatest short coming.  The design history of the MiG-15 is available from the Mikoyan OKB Archives. English-language secondary sources include Mikoyan OKB by Bill Gunston, Soviet Secret Projects (Fighters) by Tony Buttler and MiG-15 by Yefim Gordon. All the authors are internationally respected and authoritative sources and all have concluded that the Ta-183 and MiG-15 are not related. Incidently in Tony Buttler's book he reveals that one rejected layout for the MiG-15 had forward-swept wings.\nanother aviation series with some major flaws\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Various'], 'Starring': ['Christopher Lee', 'Peter Read'], 'Studio': ['HDP']}\nThe 2nd Film is a horror gem from1964  -  Dementia 13' and  is Francis Ford Coppola's first flick, his directorial debut.

Besides the japanese fighter zero did not make it first flight until April 1939' was not deployed to China until 1940' in very small numbers with the 12th Rengo K\u014dk\u016btai . Dog fighting scenes are wasted with over the top cgi mish mash.
