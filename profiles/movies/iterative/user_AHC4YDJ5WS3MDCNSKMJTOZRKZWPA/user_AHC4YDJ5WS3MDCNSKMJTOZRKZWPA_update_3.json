She\u2019s pregnant for the second time by her absent father; at home, she must wait hand and foot on her mother, a poisonously angry woman who abuses her emotionally and physically. School is a place of chaos, and Precious has reached the ninth grade with good marks and an awful secret: she can neither read nor write. Precious may sometimes be down, but she is never out. Beneath her impassive expression is a watchful, curious young woman with an inchoate but unshakeable sense that other possibilities exist for her. Threatened with expulsion, Precious is offered the chance to transfer to an alternative school, Each One/Teach One. Precious doesn\u2019t know the meaning of \u201calternative,\u201d but her instincts tell her this is the chance she has been waiting for.

What's particularly notable about the film's success and acclaim is that in the beginning, at least, it presents one of the grimmest scenarios imaginable. The scene is Harlem, New York, in 1987. Teenager Clarisse Precious Jones (played by newcomer Gabourey Sibide in an absolutely fearless performance) is dirt poor, morbidly obese, semiliterate, and pregnant for the second time--both courtesy of her own father (the first baby was born with Down syndrome). Her home life is several levels below Hell, as her bitter, vengeful welfare mother, Mary (Mo'Nique, in a role that has generated legitimate Oscar\u00ae buzz), abuses her both physically and otherwise (telling Precious she should have aborted her is only the worst of a relentless flood of insults and vitriol). Yet somehow, the young woman still has hopes and dreams (depicted in a series of delightful fantasy sequences). She enrolls in an alternative school, where a young teacher (Paula Patton) takes her under her wing and even into her home, and visits a social worker (an excellent Mariah Carey; fellow pop star Lenny Kravitz is also effective as a male nurse) who further helps bring Precious out of the darkness. Incredibly, Precious's circumstances deteriorate even more before showing the slightest sign of improvement, and a climactic confrontation with her mother is one of the more wrenching scenes in recent memory. But against all odds, director Lee Daniels, screenwriter Geoffrey Fletcher (working from Sapphire's novel), and especially the wondrously affecting Sibide have managed to make\", 'Precious', 'a film that will lift the viewer far higher up that one might ever have thought possible.', '--Sam Graham']\n{'Genre': 'Drama', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Contributor': \"Lee Daniels, Mo'Nique, Gabourey Sidibe\", 'Language': 'English', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 49 minutes', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 2.72 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'LGT27239DVD', 'Director': 'Lee Daniels', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Run time': '1 hour and 49 minutes', 'Release date': 'March 9, 2010', 'Actors': \"Gabourey Sidibe, Mo'Nique\", 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish', 'Studio': 'Lionsgate', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nA new perspective, thought-provoking!\nFive Stars\nDefinitely, Maybe (Widescreen)\nRyan Reynolds  (Actor),     Kevin Kline  (Actor),     Adam Brooks  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Comedy\n['Product Description', \"From the makers of Notting Hill and Love Actually comes the charming and irresistibly funny romantic comedy Definitely, Maybe.

She is curious about the women her dad loved prior to marrying (and separating from) her mother. Instead of telling her, \"None of your business,\" he decides to tell her about them... Sort of. Will is played by Ryan Reynolds and his precocious daughter Maya is adroitly portrayed by Abigail Breslin (', 'Little Miss Sunshine', '). Will figures out a way to tell Maya about his most meaningful relationships in a PG manner that also is interactive for her (Or as she describes it, \"a love story mystery!\"). Changing a few of their characteristics and disguising their names, Will tells her about three exceptional women and Maya tries to deduce which one became her mom. Was it Emily (Elizabeth Banks), the wholesome Midwestern girl afraid of the big city; Summer (Rachel Weisz), the exotic journalist; or April (Isla Fisher), the rebel with a cause? Hearing about all these women, Maya asks, \"What\\'s the boy word for slut?\" Spanning 15 years, back to when Will was an idealistic young man with the hopes of one day becoming president of the United States, the film has a nice light touch and deals with father-daughter bonding issues in a unique, if not completely realistic manner. Reynolds is a genial but bland leading man, but the women--including young Breslin--more than hold their own in this fun film. --', 'Jae-Ha Kim', 'Get to Know the Girlfriends From', 'Definitely, Maybe', 'Elizabeth Banks (Emily)', 'Isla Fisher (April)', 'Rachel Weisz (Summer)', 'Beyond', 'Definitely, Maybe', 'on DVD', 'More From Ryan Reynolds', 'Father Daughter Essentials', 'More Romantic Comedies', 'Stills from', 'Definitely, Maybe', '(Click for larger image)']\n{'Genre': 'Romance, Comedy', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Abigail Breslin, Rachel Weisz, Ryan Reynolds, Adam Ferrara, Florian Ballhaus, Derek Luke, Adam Brooks, Clint Mansell, Annie Parisse, Isla Fisher, Kevin Kline, Elizabeth BanksAbigail Breslin, Rachel Weisz, Ryan Reynolds, Adam Ferrara, Florian Ballhaus, Derek Luke, Adam Brooks, Clint Mansell, Annie Parisse, Isla Fisher, Kevin Kline, Elizabeth Banks  See more', 'Initial release date': '2008-06-24', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1), French (Dolby Digital 5.1), Spanish (Dolby Digital 5.1), Unqualified', 'Aspect Ratio': '2.35:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 2.72 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'MHV61100526DVD', 'Director': 'Adam Brooks', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Run time': '1 hour and 52 minutes', 'Release date': 'June 24, 2008', 'Actors': 'Ryan Reynolds, Kevin Kline, Rachel Weisz, Elizabeth Banks, Isla Fisher', 'Dubbed': 'French, Spanish', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish, French', 'Studio': 'Studio Distribution Services', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nJust for fun...\nFive Stars\nStand and Deliver\nRamon Menendez  (Director, Writer),     Edward James Olmos  (Actor),     Lou Diamond Phillips  (Actor)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Drama\n[\"Edward James Olmos's Oscar-nominated performance energizes this true-life story of a Los Angeles high school teacher who drives his students on to excellence at calculus.\"]\n{'Genre': 'Documentary/Biography', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Full Screen, NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Lou Diamond Phillips, Edward James Olmos, Estelle Harris, Andy Garcia, Tom Musca, Mark Phelan, Lindsay Law, Rosana De Soto, Mark Eliot, Ramon Menendez, Virginia ParisLou Diamond Phillips, Edward James Olmos, Estelle Harris, Andy Garcia, Tom Musca, Mark Phelan, Lindsay Law, Rosana De Soto, Mark Eliot, Ramon Menendez, Virginia Paris  See more', 'Language': 'English (Mono), Unqualified', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 43 minutes', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG (Parental Guidance Suggested)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.75 x 5.5 x 0.5 inches; 1.92 Ounces', 'Item model number': '157968', 'Director': 'Ramon Menendez', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Full Screen, NTSC', 'Run time': '1 hour and 43 minutes', 'Release date': 'June 8, 2010', 'Actors': 'Edward James Olmos, Lou Diamond Phillips, Rosana De Soto, Andy Garcia, Estelle Harris', 'Producers': 'Lindsay Law, Tom Musca', 'Studio': 'WarnerBrothers', 'Writers': 'Ramon Menendez, Tom Musca', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nI showed it to my Educational students in college...excellent!\nexcellent!",
