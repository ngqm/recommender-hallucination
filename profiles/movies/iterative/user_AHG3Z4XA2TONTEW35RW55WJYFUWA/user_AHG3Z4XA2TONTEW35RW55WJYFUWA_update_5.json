  "reference_summary": "Midnight in Paris [Blu-ray]\nOwen Wilson  (Actor),     Rachel McAdams  (Actor),     Woody Allen  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG-13    Format: Blu-ray\nMovies & TV, Award Winners in Movies & TV, Oscar Central, Past Oscar Winners\n['Product Description', \"This is a romantic comedy set in Paris about a family that goes there because of business, and two young people who are engaged to be married in the fall have experiences there that change their lives. It's about a young man's great love for a city, Paris, and the illusion people have that a life different from theirs would be much better.\", 'Amazon.com', 'Paris is a city that lends itself to daydreaming, to walking the streets and imagining all sorts of magic, a quality that Woody Allen understands perfectly.', 'Midnight in Paris', \"is Allen's charming reverie about just that quality, with a screenwriter hero named Gil (Owen Wilson) who strolls the lanes of Paris with his head in the clouds and walks right into his own best fantasy. Gil is there with his materialistic fianc\u00e9e (Rachel McAdams) and her unpleasant parents, taking a break from his financially rewarding but spiritually unfulfilling Hollywood career--and he can't stop thinking that all he wants to do is quit the movies, move to Paris, and write that novel he's been meaning to finish. You know, be like his heroes in the bohemian Paris of the 1920s. Sure enough, a midnight encounter draws him into the jazzy world of Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Picasso and Dali, and an intense Ernest Hemingway, who promises to bring Gil's manuscript to Gertrude Stein for review. Gil wakes up every morning back in the real world, but returning to his enchanted Paris proves fairly easy. In the execution of this marvelous fantasia, Allen pursues the idea that people of every generation have always romanticized a previous age as golden (this is in fact explained to us by Michael Sheen's pedantic art expert), but he also honors Gil's need to find out certain truths for himself. The movie's on the side of gentle fantasy, and it has some literary/cinematic in-jokes that call back to the kind of goofy humor Allen created in\", 'Love and Death', \".The film is guilty of the slackness that Allen's latter-day directing has sometimes shown, and the underwritten roles for McAdams and Marion Cotillard are better acted than written. But the city glows with Allen's romantic sense of it, and Owen Wilson has just the right nice-guy melancholy to put the idea over. A worthy entry in the Cinema of the Daydream.\", '--Robert Horton']\n{'Genre': 'Romance, Comedy', 'Format': 'Blu-ray, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Michel Vuillermoz, Olivier Rabourdin, Owen Wilson, Thierry Hancisse, Adrien de Van, Michael Sheen, Marianne Basler, Woody Allen, Marion Cotillard, Marcial Di Fonzo Bo, Laurent Spielvogel, Rachel McAdams, Gad Elmaleh, Adrien Brody, Catherine Benguigui, L\u00e9a Seydoux, Carla Bruni, Kathy BatesMichel Vuillermoz, Olivier Rabourdin, Owen Wilson, Thierry Hancisse, Adrien de Van, Michael Sheen, Marianne Basler, Woody Allen, Marion Cotillard, Marcial Di Fonzo Bo, Laurent Spielvogel, Rachel McAdams, Gad Elmaleh, Adrien Brody, Catherine Benguigui, L\u00e9a Seydoux\u2026  See more', 'Language': 'English', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 34 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.85:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.5 x 5.4 x 6.7 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': '23915943', 'Director': 'Woody Allen', 'Media Format': 'Blu-ray, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Run time': '1 hour and 34 minutes', 'Release date': 'December 20, 2011', 'Actors': 'Owen Wilson, Rachel McAdams, Adrien Brody, Carla Bruni, Marion Cotillard', 'Dubbed': 'French', 'Subtitles': 'English, French, Spanish', 'Studio': 'Sony Pictures Home Entertainment', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nThe film is very entertaining, and worth watching just for the atmospheric views of Paris.

The fifth', 'Harry Potter', 'film has arrived. The time is long past that this can be considered a simple \"children\\'s\" series--though children and adults alike will enjoy it immensely. Starting off from the dark and tragic ending of the fourth film,', 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix', 'begins in a somber and angst-filled tone that carries through the entire 138 minutes (the shortest of any', 'HP', \"movie despite being adapted from the longest book). Hopes of winning the Quidditch Cup have been replaced by woes like government corruption, distorted media spin, and the casualties of war. As the themes have matured, so have the primary characters' acting abilities. Ron (Rupert Grint), Hermione (Emma Watson), and especially Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) are more convincing than ever--in roles that are more demanding.  Harry is deeply traumatized from having witnessed Cedric Diggory's murder, but he will soon find that this was just another chapter in the continuing loss he will endure. Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) has returned and, in an attempt to conceal this catastrophe from the wizarding public, the Ministry of Magic has teamed up with the wizard newspaper The Daily Prophet to smear young Potter and wise Dumbledore (Michael Gambon)--seemingly the only two people in the public eye who believe the Dark Lord has returned. With no one else to stand against the wicked Death Eaters, the Hogwarts headmaster is forced to revive his secret anti-Voldemort society, the Order of the Phoenix. This welcomes back characters like Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson), kind Remus Lupin (David Thewlis), fatherly Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), and insidious Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), and introduces a short list of intriguing new faces. In the meantime, a semi-psychotic bureaucrat from the Ministry (brilliantly portrayed by Imelda Staunton) has seized power at Hogwarts, and Harry is forced to form a secret society of his own--lest the other young wizards at his school be left ill-equipped to defend themselves in the looming war between good and evil. In addition, Harry is filled with an inexplicable rage that only his Godfather Sirius seems to be able to understand.  This film, though not as frightening as its predecessor, earns its PG-13 rating mostly because of the ever-darkening tone. As always, the loyal fans of J.K. Rowling's books will suffer huge cuts from the original plot and character developments, but make no mistake: this is a good movie.\", '--Jordan Thompson']\n{'Genre': 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Format': 'Blu-ray, Widescreen, Color, Dubbed, Subtitled', 'Contributor': 'Rupert Grint, Bridgette Millar, Emma Watson, George Harris (II), Peter Cartwright, Richard Griffiths, Fiona Shaw, Robert Pattinson, Miles Jupp, David Yates (II), Geraldine Somerville, Daniel Radcliffe, Richard Macklin, Brendan Gleeson, Gary Oldman, Jason Boyd (III), Harry Melling, Natalia Tena, Adrian Rawlins, Kathryn Hunter, Ralph FiennesRupert Grint, Bridgette Millar, Emma Watson, George Harris (II), Peter Cartwright, Richard Griffiths, Fiona Shaw, Robert Pattinson, Miles Jupp, David Yates (II), Geraldine Somerville, Daniel Radcliffe, Richard Macklin, Brendan Gleeson, Gary Oldman, Jason Boyd (III), Harry Mel\u2026   See more', 'Language': 'German (Dolby Digital 5.1), Italian (Dolby Digital 5.1), Dutch (Dolby Digital 5.1), Japanese (Dolby Digital 5.1), Swedish (Dolby Digital 5.1), Catalan (Dolby Digital 5.1), English (Dolby Digital 5.1), French (Dolby Digital 5.1), Danish (Dolby Digital 5.1), English (PCM Surround), Spanish (Dolby Digital 5.1), Flemish (Dolby Digital 5.1)', 'Runtime': '2 hours and 18 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '2.40:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned)', 'Product Dimensions': '6.5 x 5.25 x 0.5 inches; 1.6 Ounces', 'Item model number': '085391156949', 'Director': 'David Yates (II)', 'Media Format': 'Blu-ray, Widescreen, Color, Dubbed, Subtitled', 'Run time': '2 hours and 18 minutes', 'Release date': 'December 11, 2007', 'Actors': 'Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Harry Melling, Richard Macklin', 'Dubbed': 'French, Spanish', 'Subtitles': 'English, Japanese, Portuguese, French, Spanish, Chinese, Korean, German, Italian, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Swedish, Norwegian, Catalan', 'Studio': 'WarnerBrothers', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nPhoenix is not my favorite of the Potter films, but it is still a good view and I thought it was well worth reordering in Blu-ray when my original DVD copy started freezing and doing other weird things when I tried to watch it.
