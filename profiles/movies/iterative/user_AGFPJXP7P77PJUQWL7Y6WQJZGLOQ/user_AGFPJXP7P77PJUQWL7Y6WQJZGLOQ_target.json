Pretty high school student Hiyori Kazane nurtures a crush on Tomoki. She watches him with his friend Sohara and the Angeloids, but she's too shy to say anything to him. The first half of the movie echoes the original series: Tomoki and his friends go about their usual misadventures around town and at local festivals. The filmmakers include plenty of jiggle shots and underwear jokes. At one point, the girls' panties fly away like a swarm of butterflies, although the viewer never learns why. The last third of the film turns serious: apparently Hiyori is dreaming her everyday adventures while her body lies in the facility known as Synapse. When she's hit by a truck, Hiyori dies in her dream and reenters her real body. She wants to come back to Sorami so intensely, she returns as an Angeloid--to destroy Tomoki. The tragic romance plays oddly against the gross jokes. During much of the film, Tomoki is drawn as a sort of toy-avatar who argues with himself on the toilet and rides the conveyor belt in a sushi bar, naked on a plastic tray. Although\", \"Heaven's Lost Property\", 'has proved popular on both sides of the Pacific,', 'otaku', \"who watch it for the fan service shots probably won't enjoy the ill-starred romance, and romantics will be put off by the raw jokes.

It's packed with pervy stuff, cuteness, and humor. This anime will strike the heartstrings and make your sides hurt from laughing too hard. It's perfectly scripted and made- it's just too much perfection in one show.

I was not disappointed at all and can\u2019t wait to watch it again. It\u2019s one of those movies where you\u2019ll be playing detective in your head and think you have the right answer only to become stumped the next minute and second guess yourself. I highly recommend giving this a watch, you won\u2019t regret it!\nKeeps you curious!\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Jared Hess'], 'Producers': ['Jeremy Coon', 'Chris Wyatt', 'Sean Covel', 'Jory Weitz'], 'Starring': ['Jon Heder', 'Jon Gries', 'Aaron Ruell'], 'Studio': ['Crowd Pleasers']}\nIt is a great movie although it\u2019s a little too quirky for my taste. I recommend it to anyone wanting to laugh!\nFunny!\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Lars Klevberg'], 'Producers': ['Jason Cloth', 'Chris Ferguson', 'Aaron L.

I wouldn\u2019t watch again or buy it, but I\u2019d recommend for people to watch at least once if they\u2019re a fan of the Conjuring universe.\nNot awful, not great...\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Ari Aster'], 'Producers': ['Patrik Andersson', 'Thomas Benski', 'Tyler Campellone', 'Scott E. Chester', 'Beau Ferris', 'Fredrik Heinig', 'Lars Knudsen', 'Pelle Nilsson', 'Jeffrey Penman'], 'Starring': ['Florence Pugh', 'Jack Reynor', 'William Jackson Harper'], 'Studio': ['A24 Distribution LLC']}\nI love this movie because it has every element a true horror film should have. Unsettling atmosphere, brow-shifting moments, creepy scenes that make you thankful for not having to experience them yourself, disturbing characters that make your skin crawl- you name it. I\u2019m a horror fan and honestly I don\u2019t do well with watching this alone, even in daylight. I highly recommend Midsommar to anyone who loves being weirded/freaked out or enjoys thought-provoking subjects. By the way, this is a movie that you need to actually watch from start to finish (as well as pay attention to the small details).. so set aside time, put down the phone, and prepare yourself for this bizarre ride!\nIncredibly dark and thrilling!\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Gene Stupnitsky'], 'Producers': ['Lee Eisenberg', 'Evan Goldberg', 'Seth Rogen', 'James Weaver'], 'Starring': ['Jacob Tremblay', 'Keith L.

My boyfriend got me into the Marvel universe (I was always into X-men but he introduced me to these movies when we met) and I was amazed at how fast I fell in love with each and every single Marvel movie (except for Tom Holland\u2019s Spiderman films because Andrew Garfield is KING). Endgame is perfect and beyond captivating. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s still be amazing for people who aren\u2019t hardcore Marvel fans who skipped over Iron Man or Hulk or Thor or Avengers, but TRUST me when I say if you\u2019re one of those people then you\u2019re missing out on an incredible and thrilling journey. I can\u2019t recommend this movie enough!!!\nBrilliant, intense, hilarious, and action-packed!\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Dennie Gordon'], 'Producers': ['Denise Di Novi', 'Robert Thorne', 'Mary-Kate Olsen', 'Ashley Olsen'], 'Starring': ['Mary-Kate Olsen', 'Ashley Olsen', 'Andy Richter'], 'Studio': ['Warner Bros.']}\nThis is not a movie that anyone should take seriously or have high expectations for. It\u2019s about two polar opposite twins who unwillingly get stuck together after many mishaps, learning about each other along the way and what it means to be sisters. The cast is awesome but there are some scenes that might cause some light cringing. Overall, it\u2019s a funny story with some heavy moments and I truly enjoy putting this movie on from time to time when I need to chill and laugh. Did I mention Simple Plan is in it???\nAwkward acting, Simple Plan, and lots of humor!\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['John Francis Daley', 'Jonathan Goldstein'], 'Producers': ['John Davis', 'Jason Bateman', 'John Fox', 'James Garavente'], 'Starring': ['Jason Bateman', 'Rachel McAdams', 'Billy Magnussen']}\nBeing a gamer, I\u2019m OBSESSED with Game Night. Max and Annie\u2019s witty and loving nerdy relationship, Gary\u2019s odd demeanor, Brooks\u2019s cocky attitude, Sarah\u2019s partnership with Ryan\u2019s goofy, air headed yet intelligent self, Kevin\u2019s comedically-charged curiosity with Michelle\u2019s mystery celebrity hookup, and everything in between! Whenever anyone asks for my recommendation for a comedy, I direct them to this movie and they always come back to me telling me how funny it was and how they full on bought it! I can\u2019t recommend this gem enough!!!\nBEST. MOVIE. EVER.
