Pretty high school student Hiyori Kazane nurtures a crush on Tomoki. She watches him with his friend Sohara and the Angeloids, but she's too shy to say anything to him. The first half of the movie echoes the original series: Tomoki and his friends go about their usual misadventures around town and at local festivals. The filmmakers include plenty of jiggle shots and underwear jokes. At one point, the girls' panties fly away like a swarm of butterflies, although the viewer never learns why. The last third of the film turns serious: apparently Hiyori is dreaming her everyday adventures while her body lies in the facility known as Synapse. When she's hit by a truck, Hiyori dies in her dream and reenters her real body. She wants to come back to Sorami so intensely, she returns as an Angeloid--to destroy Tomoki. The tragic romance plays oddly against the gross jokes. During much of the film, Tomoki is drawn as a sort of toy-avatar who argues with himself on the toilet and rides the conveyor belt in a sushi bar, naked on a plastic tray. Although\", \"Heaven's Lost Property\", 'has proved popular on both sides of the Pacific,', 'otaku', \"who watch it for the fan service shots probably won't enjoy the ill-starred romance, and romantics will be put off by the raw jokes.

It's packed with pervy stuff, cuteness, and humor. This anime will strike the heartstrings and make your sides hurt from laughing too hard. It's perfectly scripted and made- it's just too much perfection in one show.

I was not disappointed at all and can\u2019t wait to watch it again. It\u2019s one of those movies where you\u2019ll be playing detective in your head and think you have the right answer only to become stumped the next minute and second guess yourself. I highly recommend giving this a watch, you won\u2019t regret it!\nKeeps you curious!\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Jared Hess'], 'Producers': ['Jeremy Coon', 'Chris Wyatt', 'Sean Covel', 'Jory Weitz'], 'Starring': ['Jon Heder', 'Jon Gries', 'Aaron Ruell'], 'Studio': ['Crowd Pleasers']}\nIt is a great movie although it\u2019s a little too quirky for my taste.

Unsettling atmosphere, brow-shifting moments, creepy scenes that make you thankful for not having to experience them yourself, disturbing characters that make your skin crawl- you name it. I\u2019m a horror fan and honestly I don\u2019t do well with watching this alone, even in daylight. I highly recommend Midsommar to anyone who loves being weirded/freaked out or enjoys thought-provoking subjects. By the way, this is a movie that you need to actually watch from start to finish (as well as pay attention to the small details).. so set aside time, put down the phone, and prepare yourself for this bizarre ride!\nIncredibly dark and thrilling!\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Gene Stupnitsky'], 'Producers': ['Lee Eisenberg', 'Evan Goldberg', 'Seth Rogen', 'James Weaver'], 'Starring': ['Jacob Tremblay', 'Keith L.
