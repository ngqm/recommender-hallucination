Henry's short story about a young bride and groom, each of whom foolishly--but quite lovingly--sacrifices a treasured possession to buy the perfect Christmas gift for their mate. Amid a flurry of bustling New Yorkers clad in early-20th-century garb, O. Henry himself (David Wayne) sets the scene: Beth, a teenage orphan (Marie Osmond), comes to live with her wealthy aunt and uncle (the latter played by Donald Moffat). Her friendship with a cheerful kitchen maid soon leads to a stormy encounter with a handsome Swiss immigrant, Rudy (Timothy Bottoms). Despite Beth and Rudy's conflicting social statuses, and Beth's arranged engagement to a sickly bird watcher (a young James Woods, who truly fits the bill), the two fall in love and miraculously overcome these obstacles--all in about 95 minutes. Old-fashioned romance, elegant costumes, and a happy ending make this predictable story completely irresistible to those who love a good fairy tale--or to Osmond fans who fondly remember watching the movie on TV in 1978.

However, she quickly won me over and I loved every minute of this film after that.  This story is wonderfully touching and in the end, their gifts to one another are funny but really felt.  You KNOW that they are gifts from the heart.  This movie really is about love at Christmastime and the actors in this version couldn't have been better chosen.  They all do a great job and I would recommend this film to anyone!  I plan to watch it time and again!\nReview Title: Really, REALLY good... a definite MUST SEE!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Basic Yoga Workout for Dummies VHS\nSara Ivanhoe  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: VHS Tape\nMovies & TV, Yoga, General\n['Product Description', 'Anyone can do yoga with this step-by-step instruction of the 12 essential yoga postures. Hosted by Sara Ivanhoe, \"Basic Yoga Workout For Dummies\" is a simple introduction to the physical and spiritual rewards of beginning yoga.', 'Amazon.com', 'A workout that balances both the body and the mind can be found in the', 'Basic Yoga Workout for Dummies', '. Fundamental postures are explained and demonstrated slowly with an emphasis on breathing and motion. Sara Ivanhoe teaches 12 basic poses that are termed the \"daily dozen\" and offers challenges and modifications to each of these moves. Ivanhoe presents these concepts in an approachable and calming manner that adds to the overall relaxed feeling that this session exudes. Newcomers to the practice of yoga will learn jargon, essential postures, and focusing techniques. Experienced participants may find some information redundant, but Ivanhoe offers such thorough explanations about each posture that you can\\'t help but expand your existing knowledge of yoga. As the mountain pose, standing forward bend, and downward facing dog are explained (not to mention the nine other poses within the \"daily dozen\"), proper body alignment becomes the focus. Meticulous attention is given to the connection between breathing and body movement with several reminders to keep the spine in \"neutral alignment.\" This session ranks great for safety and content and makes yoga accessible to anyone who \"always wanted to, but never did.\" This is a substantial program that can introduce the basics and build your understanding of yoga.', '--Olivia Voigts']\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.5 x 3.9 x 1.2 inches; 7.36 Ounces', 'Run time': '45 minutes', 'Release date': 'November 14, 2000', 'Date First Available': 'September 29, 2006', 'Actors': 'Sara Ivanhoe', 'Studio': 'Starz / Anchor Bay'}\nThis was one of the first yoga videos that I bought and I really learned a lot from it.  Yes, it is somewhat talky but a beginner really needs to know all the things that Sara Ivanhoe talks about.  Proper form and execution of the poses is a crucial part of yoga, in order to get the most benefits from the practice and to prevent unnecessary injuries.  Several key poses are shown in this video that can be built upon as your practice increases.  They are very nicely described too, so that a beginner can start a yoga practice doing it right.  I like that about this video.<br />I have moved on to other, more complex videos now but I still like to come back to this one once in a while just to get back in touch with the basics.  It is a good yoga workout and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to get acquainted with yoga or just wanting a gentle yoga routine on hand!\nGreat video to start yoga with!\nBeyond Basic Yoga for Dummies [VHS]\nSara Ivanhoe  (Actor)    Rated:    Unrated    Format: VHS Tape\nMovies & TV, Yoga, General\n{'Genre': 'Exercise_&_fitness_-_yoga', 'Format': 'NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Sara Ivanhoe', 'Language': 'English', 'Number Of Discs': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.3 x 4.2 x 1.1 inches; 5.6 Ounces', 'Run time': '56 minutes', 'Release date': 'September 24, 2002', 'Date First Available': 'September 29, 2006', 'Actors': 'Sara Ivanhoe', 'Studio': 'Starz / Anchor Bay'}\nSara Ivanhoe presents another good, effective yoga workout.  This one is only a slight bit tougher than the first Dummies video but it is worth having.  It seems to be assumed that the viewer has been doing the first video faithfully and has developed more flexibility and balance.  It uses both quite a bit more than the first video did.  It is a good workout and Sara Ivanhoe talks you through it like in the first one.<br />This video is a great addition to any yoga video library!\nA step up from the basics; nice video!\nElf (DVD)\nJon Favreau  (Director),     Leon Redbone  (Actor),     Will Ferrell  (Actor)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Holidays & Seasonal, Christmas, Comedy\n['Product Description', \"This hilarious Christmas film tells the tale of a young orphan child who mistakenly crawls into Santa's bag of gifts on Christmas Eve and is transported back to the North Pole and raised as an elf.

Will Ferrell does a bang job with this character - Buddy the Elf.  He is just so nice that you can't HELP but like him.  He only tries to do good and help people but it backfires sometimes and he ends up feeling like he doesn't fit in anywhere.  This is a movie that I could watch every holiday season, right along with Christmas in Connecticut, Love Actually and The Bishop's Wife.  I thought it was delightful and something I could watch with my nephew and not think twice.  Yes, it is corny but it really is funny too and well worth renting!\nIt IS a bit corny but really good - a Christmas classic!\nGift of Love\nRated:    Unrated    Format: VHS Tape\nMovies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Drama\n['Amazon.com', \"Inspired by O.
