Fundamental postures are explained and demonstrated slowly with an emphasis on breathing and motion. Sara Ivanhoe teaches 12 basic poses that are termed the \"daily dozen\" and offers challenges and modifications to each of these moves. Ivanhoe presents these concepts in an approachable and calming manner that adds to the overall relaxed feeling that this session exudes. Newcomers to the practice of yoga will learn jargon, essential postures, and focusing techniques. Experienced participants may find some information redundant, but Ivanhoe offers such thorough explanations about each posture that you can\\'t help but expand your existing knowledge of yoga. As the mountain pose, standing forward bend, and downward facing dog are explained (not to mention the nine other poses within the \"daily dozen\"), proper body alignment becomes the focus. Meticulous attention is given to the connection between breathing and body movement with several reminders to keep the spine in \"neutral alignment.\" This session ranks great for safety and content and makes yoga accessible to anyone who \"always wanted to, but never did.\" This is a substantial program that can introduce the basics and build your understanding of yoga.', '--Olivia Voigts']\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '7.5 x 3.9 x 1.2 inches; 7.36 Ounces', 'Run time': '45 minutes', 'Release date': 'November 14, 2000', 'Date First Available': 'September 29, 2006', 'Actors': 'Sara Ivanhoe', 'Studio': 'Starz / Anchor Bay'}\nReview Text: This was one of the first yoga videos that I bought and I really learned a lot from it.  Yes, it is somewhat talky but a beginner really needs to know all the things that Sara Ivanhoe talks about.  Proper form and execution of the poses is a crucial part of yoga, in order to get the most benefits from the practice and to prevent unnecessary injuries.  Several key poses are shown in this video that can be built upon as your practice increases.  They are very nicely described too, so that a beginner can start a yoga practice doing it right.  I like that about this video.<br />I have moved on to other, more complex videos now but I still like to come back to this one once in a while just to get back in touch with the basics.  It is a good yoga workout and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to get acquainted with yoga or just wanting a gentle yoga routine on hand!\nReview Title: Great video to start yoga with!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
