I lived in the San Luis Valley for two years, not far (in Colorado terms!) from both the town of San Luis and the New Mexico border.  My house had clear close views of Blanca Peak, Ute Mountain, the San Juans and the Sangres.  Thanks for the memories, nice to see the area again, but this is the worst-constructed documentary of all time.  &#34;Docu-drama&#34; would be a better fit, with waaaaay too much drama.  Better you should read about the &#34;Mysterious Valley&#34; in the series of the same name, written by Christopher O'Brien.  Maybe someday he'll produce a genuine doc.  Hope so, can't wait.\nReview Title: Hoping for a Christopher O'Brien doc!\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Will miss his work.  Younger kids might be upset with Jo as a child losing her father, but other than that they'll enjoy the tornado scenes.  Totally safe and fun for the average family.  Special effects hold up even with today's advanced technology.\nGreat fun!\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Ron Howard'], 'Producers': ['Brian Grazer'], 'Starring': ['Tom Hanks', 'Bill Paxton', 'Kevin Bacon'], 'Studio': ['UNIVERSAL PAY TELEVISION']}\nRon Howard.  Tom Hanks.  'nuff said!  :)  Even with that bit of poetic license, it's a great movie.  If you want cold, hard facts, rent a documentary.  For entertainment and cultural enlightenment, watch this movie.\nWatched it at least 50 times over the years.\n{'Content advisory': ['Alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Philip Kaufman'], 'Producers': ['Robert Chartoff', 'Irwin Winkler'], 'Starring': ['Scott Glenn', 'Ed Harris', 'Barbara Hershey'], 'Studio': ['WARNER BROS.']}\nA classic movie!  Great mix of fictional bits and pieces and a LOT of history.  Characters are well-played.  No dull moments, so get your soda and popcorn before you begin. :)  You won't want to push the PAUSE button.\nThis was my birthday gift to myself\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Roland Emmerich'], 'Producers': ['Dean Devlin'], 'Starring': ['Will Smith', 'Bill Pullman', 'Jeff Goldblum'], 'Studio': ['20TH CENTURY FOX']}\nBad science, great movie.

There's a version of this movie that is filled with tons of extraneous garbage but this one is NOT that version.  Great, cohesive storytelling and impressive visual effects that actually have a purpose rather than being a gee-whiz distraction.  Don't rent this, BUY it.  You'll watch it over and over.\nDon't just rent it, BUY it!  :)\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English [Audio Description]', 'English', 'Deutsch', 'Italiano', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', 'Portugu\u00eas', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a)', '\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e', 'Fran\u00e7ais (France)', 'Fran\u00e7ais (Canada)'], 'Subtitles': ['English', 'English [CC]', 'Dansk [CC]', 'Deutsch', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica) [CC]', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a) [CC]', 'Suomi [CC]', 'Fran\u00e7ais [CC]', 'Italiano [CC]', 'Norsk Bokm\u00e5l [CC]', 'Nederlands [CC]', 'Portugu\u00eas', 'Portugu\u00eas [SDH]', 'Svenska [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Brad Peyton'], 'Producers': ['Bruce Berman', 'Sam Brown', 'Tripp Vinson', 'Steven Mnuchin', 'Toby Emmerich', 'Rob Cowan', 'Richard Brener', 'Michael Disco', 'Beau Flynn'], 'Starring': ['Dwayne Johnson', 'Carla Gugino', 'Alexandra Daddario']}\nFun movie, standard share of heroism, emotion, humor, personal conflict.  Rented instead of buying, as I had not seen it before.  Decided not to purchase but it was well worth the low rental price.  So make some popcorn and enjoy!
