Will miss his work.  Younger kids might be upset with Jo as a child losing her father, but other than that they'll enjoy the tornado scenes.  Totally safe and fun for the average family.

Tom Hanks.  'nuff said!  :)  Even with that bit of poetic license, it's a great movie.  If you want cold, hard facts, rent a documentary.  For entertainment and cultural enlightenment, watch this movie.\nWatched it at least 50 times over the years.\n{'Content advisory': ['Alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Philip Kaufman'], 'Producers': ['Robert Chartoff', 'Irwin Winkler'], 'Starring': ['Scott Glenn', 'Ed Harris', 'Barbara Hershey'], 'Studio': ['WARNER BROS.']}\nA classic movie!
