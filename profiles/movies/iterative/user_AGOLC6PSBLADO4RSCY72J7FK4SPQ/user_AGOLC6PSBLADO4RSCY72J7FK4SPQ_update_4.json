This film was based off the Stephen King short story', 'Four Past Midnight', '.', 'The Stand', \"Originally aired as a television mini-series, this all-star filmization of Stephen King's gripping epic of good versus evil chronicles the episodic adventures of a disparate group of people who struggle to reestablish civilization after a man-made catastrophe wipes out most of the world's population. The world abruptly ends when a deadly virus accidentally escapes from a government sponsored biological warfare laboratory.

He brings so much peace and hope to those in crisis or looking to connect. He gave me answers that I was looking for and peace with death. If you are very spiritual and interested and interested in life after death. Try reading one of his books or just get a video or two. You won't be disappointed.<br /><br /> The one thing with this package though is, that the 2nd CD in each one, is a repeat of the first, just with added bonus footage. So it was really false advertised that it was complete season 1.\nJohn Edward Cross Country Season 1 Review\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Steven Cantor', 'Peter Spirer'], 'Producers': ['Steven Cantor', 'Paul Dokuchitz', 'Mark Mori', 'Constance Van Flandern', 'Zeitgeist Films'], 'Starring': ['Sally Mann'], 'Studio': ['Zeitgeist Films']}\nI highly recommend this to photographers and alike.
