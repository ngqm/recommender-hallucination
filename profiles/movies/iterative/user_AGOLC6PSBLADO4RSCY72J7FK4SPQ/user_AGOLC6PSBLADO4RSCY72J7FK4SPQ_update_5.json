He brings so much peace and hope to those in crisis or looking to connect. He gave me answers that I was looking for and peace with death. If you are very spiritual and interested and interested in life after death. Try reading one of his books or just get a video or two. You won't be disappointed.<br /><br /> The one thing with this package though is, that the 2nd CD in each one, is a repeat of the first, just with added bonus footage.
