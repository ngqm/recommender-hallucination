The world abruptly ends when a deadly virus accidentally escapes from a government sponsored biological warfare laboratory. Soon people are dropping like flies from the plague, but a few survive and find themselves strangely compelled to head into the West. Good-hearted people follow the voice of an ancient black woman and head for Boulder, Colorado. Bad people follow the enigmatic Walkin' Dude to Las Vegas. It is only a matter of time before the two sides are forced into a climactic battle over the final fate of humanity.\", 'Golden Years', 'This made-for-TV mini-series from the notorious horror writer centers upon a hapless old janitor who begins undergoing incredible physical changes after he is accidentally covered with experimental chemicals following a laboratory mishap.

A couple of moments are genuinely popcorn-dropping, no doubt about it. The stock characters may be nothing to rave about, but the actors themselves are agreeable, and the movie's do-or-die situation provides an elemental tug that's hard to resist, even if you know better.\", '--Robert Horton']\n{'Genre': 'Drama', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Kieran Darcy-Smith, Andrew Traucki, Mark Simpson, Gyton Grantley, Damian Walshe, Adrienne Pickering, Zoe NaylorKieran Darcy-Smith, Andrew Traucki, Mark Simpson, Gyton Grantley, Damian Walshe, Adrienne Pickering, Zoe Naylor   See more', 'Language': 'English', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 28 minutes', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.6 x 5.3 x 7.5 inches; 2.12 Ounces', 'Item model number': '17520531', 'Director': 'Andrew Traucki', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Run time': '1 hour and 28 minutes', 'Release date': 'July 19, 2011', 'Actors': 'Damian Walshe, Gyton Grantley, Adrienne Pickering, Zoe Naylor, Kieran Darcy-Smith', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish', 'Studio': 'IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nThis is filmed in beautiful Australia.

He brings so much peace and hope to those in crisis or looking to connect. He gave me answers that I was looking for and peace with death. If you are very spiritual and interested and interested in life after death. Try reading one of his books or just get a video or two. You won't be disappointed.<br /><br /> The one thing with this package though is, that the 2nd CD in each one, is a repeat of the first, just with added bonus footage. So it was really false advertised that it was complete season 1.\nJohn Edward Cross Country Season 1 Review\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Steven Cantor', 'Peter Spirer'], 'Producers': ['Steven Cantor', 'Paul Dokuchitz', 'Mark Mori', 'Constance Van Flandern', 'Zeitgeist Films'], 'Starring': ['Sally Mann'], 'Studio': ['Zeitgeist Films']}\nI highly recommend this to photographers and alike.
