A young woman in her 20s, Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara), is a clerk working in a Manhattan department store and dreaming of a more fulfilling life when she meets Carol (Cate Blanchett), an alluring woman trapped in a loveless, convenient marriage. As an immediate connection sparks between them, the innocence of their first encounter dims and their connection deepens. While Carol breaks free from the confines of marriage, her husband (Kyle Chandler) begins to question her competence as a mother as her involvement with Therese and close relationship with her best friend Abby (Sarah Paulson) come to light.\"]\nAverage Rating: 4.6\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Drama', 'Format': 'NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Film4; Killer Films; Number 9 Films Ltd., Stephen Woolley, Todd Haynes, Christine Vachon, Cate Blanchett, Cory Smith, Rooney Mara, Phyllis Nagy, Jake Lacy, Sarah Paulson, Tessa Ross, Kyle Chandler, Carrie Brownstein, Elizabeth KarlsenFilm4; Killer Films; Number 9 Films Ltd., Stephen Woolley, Todd Haynes, Christine Vachon, Cate Blanchett, Cory Smith, Rooney Mara, Phyllis Nagy, Jake Lacy, Sarah Paulson, Tessa Ross, Kyle Chandler, Carrie Brownstein, Elizabeth Karlsen  See more', 'Language': 'English', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.6 x 5.3 x 7.5 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Audio Description': 'English', 'Item model number': '35273501', 'Director': 'Todd Haynes', 'Media Format': 'NTSC', 'Release date': 'March 15, 2016', 'Actors': 'Cate Blanchett, Rooney Mara, Kyle Chandler, Sarah Paulson, Jake Lacy', 'Dubbed': 'Spanish', 'Producers': 'Tessa Ross, Stephen Woolley, Phyllis Nagy, Christine Vachon, Elizabeth Karlsen', 'Studio': 'Lionsgate', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: Good product\nReview Title: Five Stars\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
