Micke\u2019s mom is hilarious. Theme by Taira hasn\u2019t left my head in two days. Storylines aren\u2019t hyped with tension beyond acute social situations, which I like; it\u2019s character-driven, though Aino needs more sense of character that\u2019s not in-reaction-to. Scenes with her mom were lovely. Their flat\u2019s making me self-conscious about my own furnishings....Smarter than Easy, infinitely less self-absorbed and more company-collegial than Portlandia.<br /><br />Amazon cataloguer doesn\u2019t get the series, though; just tags foreign/Scandi and you get a lot of foreign true crime in your feed.\nReview Title: English major?

He went right to the joint, Kieslowski did.  I couldn't watch it all, this time.<br /><br />I don't think the blue mobile was her daughter's, by the way. I accept that she was the composer, and that for her there was a synaesthesia with the music and the blue lights.  I expect the blue room was her composing room, and that the mobile was a thing from her art, which is why in the end she took it along.  She had to; she needed it.

That b/w process they used is terrifically lush, almost Max Factor.<br /><br />Beyond that, though...boy, this is Journalism Heroes 101. The McCarthy story's a great one and Murrow was a serious guy, but the story's reduced to semaphore for this thing, a series of journalistic cliches. All the President's Men did much better, and that was with Woodward writing his patented Fantasy Internal Dialogue of High Officials. I'm sure the excuse goes that it's a movie, it's supposed to entertain and teach people who've never heard of Joe McCarthy, but that's all messed up. If they've never heard of Joe McCarthy, you want to serve up a shovelful of reality, not gleanings.<br /><br />The acting-to-newsreel trick's a nice one, but it doesn't compensate for the thinness of the storytelling or the punch-pulling with the elbow out to Mars (there's a suicide? I'm shocked!). If you're not just looking for eye candy, try actual books instead on this subject. There's no end of books on both McCarthy and CBS -- I think Fred Friendly wrote one of his own.\nDumbed-down history for the NCLB era\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Guy Maddin'], 'Producers': ['Jody Shapiro', 'Phyllis Laing'], 'Starring': ['Ann Savage', 'Louis Negin', 'Darcy Fehr']}\nI totally believe everything he told me about Winnipeg.

You forget that Wally Shawn can act like this -- what a curdled, potent character. (Where has he been?) The conceits aren't bothersome, they're fine, it's really too painful to watch all at once.

But over and over he takes to bullying and talking over his female clients until I want to shove him out of the room and have a shouting match with him myself. I\u2019m sure the idea was to make a bit of theatre here, but it\u2019s in no way amusing.<br /><br />Apart from which, unfortunately, he just isn\u2019t that good an architect. He\u2019s all right, I guess, but it\u2019s all much of a muchness, the same standard high-end modernism-inflected boxes with big windows. Lots of talk about wanting to preserve the charm of some wreck and then delivering some atrium-ridden nightmare to heat. It\u2019s always an improvement, and certainly things could\u2019ve gone much worse, but...I\u2019m sorry, Dermot, you\u2019re not an artist, and frankly your interiors and additions often don\u2019t really suit the old buildings.\nFor the love of god, stop bullying the woman clients\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['David Batty'], 'Producers': ['Simon Fuller', 'Michael Caine', 'Dick Clement', 'Ian La Frenais', \"Fodhla Cronin O'Reilly\"], 'Starring': ['David Bailey', 'Michael Caine', 'Joan Collins'], 'Studio': ['Gravitas Ventures']}\nI mean....<br /><br />I get that at the end of your life you want to look back, see what it was, remember why it was, relive the good times. It\u2019s just that the rest of us have had to live your particular good time along with you for over fifty bleeding years, and it\u2019s been incredibly damaging. Freedom, self-expression, that\u2019s all great, but so is knowing when to stop. We\u2019re all painfully aware that that\u2019s been a missing feature, and an hour in I just couldn\u2019t watch any more. The film clips were good, entertaining, not actually terribly novel (like I said, it\u2019s been more than 50 years), but what was missing overwhelmed what was there if you weren\u2019t just having a party in the rearview mirror.<br /><br />I\u2019d have welcomed though hearing more from everyone\u2019s non-frugging parents.

The \u201cI have a massive chip on my shoulder because I\u2019m a Jew in antisemitic upper-class England\u201d is wildly, unwatchably OTT, and the film\u2019s got some of the most hysterically closeted-homoerotic scenes I\u2019ve ever seen on film. THAT IS SOME MIGHTY SLOW CHANGING IN THE LOCKER ROOM, MY MAN. I sort of felt like I should leave and give them privacy, or head for the Personal Best section because I plainly had not been invited to this viewing gallery, but then all they did was shake hands sportingly. Also: many, many slow-mo running scenes, often from multiple angles, for those of you who dig the bony knees and flapping shorts.<br /><br />That said, they are indeed handsome men, and when the running\u2019s really happening, it\u2019s very exciting for those of you whose idea of good sports spectator fun is watching people run fast and shouting \u201cGo!\u201d a lot while jumping up and down.

Very awkward watching the young people treat him like a god. I\u2019d say the most important thing you can remember from this is that the 606 shelves are made for *small apartments*. For social housing. Where people can live with some social support and without constant terror of poverty and eviction.

After four or five episodes, though, I found that I was listening to man after man after man after man. Nearly all middle-aged, middle-class. Nearly all white. All well-educated in similar ways. Nearly all brimming with biases about how people live and want to live. And while I recognize that this series was made several years ago, there's just no excuse for this sort of thing anymore.<br /><br />The NYC low-income housing project -- perhaps because of NYC's own processes, or because of Rose's -- got a good earful from prospective residents, and heard an entirely different set of concerns than the residents had...and promptly translated them into a professional middle-class sensibilty. Here's a lady who's terrified that her kid will die of an asthma attack, wants to know about air quality, so their solutions are...nope, not HVAC, duct cleaning, interior air quality, nearby highway air-intake filtration. Instead? An organic market on the ground floor, a gym and a health clinic.<br /><br />I was thinking afterwards about those residents, about how you live when you're poor and there are poor old people with no one most of the time, and poor families, mostly single-mother families. And I was thinking about The Pruitt-Igoe Myth, another housing doc, and how one of the residents remembered the sense of community and playing records so the whole hall could hear, opening up the windows for a dance party. I thought: these mothers need a courtyard, but close together, and not a skyscraper. They need to be able to wave to each other and pass things over window to window, shout to please come over and watch the kids for a minute. To have the kids playing down below so all the mothers can look out the window and see what's happening, not rooftop gardens in eco-sensitive planters. And they need this because they can't function without each other's help. They're poor, that's how it works. They can't afford to think only about their apartments and the gardening class schedule.<br /><br />The architects in this series aren't thinking about these things because it hasn't been their job to bring children up, and if they've ever been poor it hasn't been for many decades. They're thinking about what the other architects are thinking about. So it's a very interesting series, for sure. But it's also a very powerful argument for why every field needs strong diversity and a habit of looking around every gathering and saying, \"who are we missing?\"\nGreat intentions, projects undermined by a monoculture of architects & planners\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Niklas Lindgren'], 'Producers': ['Laura Kuulasmaa', 'Sari Lempi\u00e4inen'], 'Starring': ['Anna Paavilainen', 'Elmer B\u00e4ck', 'Mikko Penttil\u00e4'], 'Studio': ['AMC Plus Independent']}\nGreat stuff, and some lowkey, terrific acting.
