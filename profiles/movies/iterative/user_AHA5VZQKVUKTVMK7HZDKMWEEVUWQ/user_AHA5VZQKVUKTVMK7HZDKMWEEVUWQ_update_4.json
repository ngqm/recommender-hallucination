He went right to the joint, Kieslowski did.  I couldn't watch it all, this time.<br /><br />I don't think the blue mobile was her daughter's, by the way. I accept that she was the composer, and that for her there was a synaesthesia with the music and the blue lights.  I expect the blue room was her composing room, and that the mobile was a thing from her art, which is why in the end she took it along.  She had to; she needed it.

That b/w process they used is terrifically lush, almost Max Factor.<br /><br />Beyond that, though...boy, this is Journalism Heroes 101. The McCarthy story's a great one and Murrow was a serious guy, but the story's reduced to semaphore for this thing, a series of journalistic cliches. All the President's Men did much better, and that was with Woodward writing his patented Fantasy Internal Dialogue of High Officials. I'm sure the excuse goes that it's a movie, it's supposed to entertain and teach people who've never heard of Joe McCarthy, but that's all messed up. If they've never heard of Joe McCarthy, you want to serve up a shovelful of reality, not gleanings.<br /><br />The acting-to-newsreel trick's a nice one, but it doesn't compensate for the thinness of the storytelling or the punch-pulling with the elbow out to Mars (there's a suicide? I'm shocked!). If you're not just looking for eye candy, try actual books instead on this subject. There's no end of books on both McCarthy and CBS -- I think Fred Friendly wrote one of his own.\nDumbed-down history for the NCLB era\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Guy Maddin'], 'Producers': ['Jody Shapiro', 'Phyllis Laing'], 'Starring': ['Ann Savage', 'Louis Negin', 'Darcy Fehr']}\nI totally believe everything he told me about Winnipeg.
