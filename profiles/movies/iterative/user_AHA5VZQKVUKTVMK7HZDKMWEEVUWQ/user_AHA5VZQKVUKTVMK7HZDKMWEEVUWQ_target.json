They're astonishingly beautiful buildings, you just can't see it. And then when that Park Ave heiress turned up looking for an architect she misread the building armor as the idea, as city toughness, and then you got that weird Seagram thing just being a...member in the middle of the avenue, with all that wasted real estate in front of it. Too bad. Much beauty along the way, though.\nReview Title: No accounting for taste\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

He went right to the joint, Kieslowski did.  I couldn't watch it all, this time.<br /><br />I don't think the blue mobile was her daughter's, by the way. I accept that she was the composer, and that for her there was a synaesthesia with the music and the blue lights.  I expect the blue room was her composing room, and that the mobile was a thing from her art, which is why in the end she took it along.  She had to; she needed it.

That b/w process they used is terrifically lush, almost Max Factor.<br /><br />Beyond that, though...boy, this is Journalism Heroes 101. The McCarthy story's a great one and Murrow was a serious guy, but the story's reduced to semaphore for this thing, a series of journalistic cliches. All the President's Men did much better, and that was with Woodward writing his patented Fantasy Internal Dialogue of High Officials. I'm sure the excuse goes that it's a movie, it's supposed to entertain and teach people who've never heard of Joe McCarthy, but that's all messed up. If they've never heard of Joe McCarthy, you want to serve up a shovelful of reality, not gleanings.<br /><br />The acting-to-newsreel trick's a nice one, but it doesn't compensate for the thinness of the storytelling or the punch-pulling with the elbow out to Mars (there's a suicide? I'm shocked!). If you're not just looking for eye candy, try actual books instead on this subject.

He\u2019s all right, I guess, but it\u2019s all much of a muchness, the same standard high-end modernism-inflected boxes with big windows. Lots of talk about wanting to preserve the charm of some wreck and then delivering some atrium-ridden nightmare to heat. It\u2019s always an improvement, and certainly things could\u2019ve gone much worse, but...I\u2019m sorry, Dermot, you\u2019re not an artist, and frankly your interiors and additions often don\u2019t really suit the old buildings.\nFor the love of god, stop bullying the woman clients\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['David Batty'], 'Producers': ['Simon Fuller', 'Michael Caine', 'Dick Clement', 'Ian La Frenais', \"Fodhla Cronin O'Reilly\"], 'Starring': ['David Bailey', 'Michael Caine', 'Joan Collins'], 'Studio': ['Gravitas Ventures']}\nI mean....<br /><br />I get that at the end of your life you want to look back, see what it was, remember why it was, relive the good times.

The \u201cI have a massive chip on my shoulder because I\u2019m a Jew in antisemitic upper-class England\u201d is wildly, unwatchably OTT, and the film\u2019s got some of the most hysterically closeted-homoerotic scenes I\u2019ve ever seen on film.

After four or five episodes, though, I found that I was listening to man after man after man after man. Nearly all middle-aged, middle-class. Nearly all white. All well-educated in similar ways. Nearly all brimming with biases about how people live and want to live. And while I recognize that this series was made several years ago, there's just no excuse for this sort of thing anymore.<br /><br />The NYC low-income housing project -- perhaps because of NYC's own processes, or because of Rose's -- got a good earful from prospective residents, and heard an entirely different set of concerns than the residents had...and promptly translated them into a professional middle-class sensibilty. Here's a lady who's terrified that her kid will die of an asthma attack, wants to know about air quality, so their solutions are...nope, not HVAC, duct cleaning, interior air quality, nearby highway air-intake filtration. Instead? An organic market on the ground floor, a gym and a health clinic.<br /><br />I was thinking afterwards about those residents, about how you live when you're poor and there are poor old people with no one most of the time, and poor families, mostly single-mother families. And I was thinking about The Pruitt-Igoe Myth, another housing doc, and how one of the residents remembered the sense of community and playing records so the whole hall could hear, opening up the windows for a dance party. I thought: these mothers need a courtyard, but close together, and not a skyscraper. They need to be able to wave to each other and pass things over window to window, shout to please come over and watch the kids for a minute. To have the kids playing down below so all the mothers can look out the window and see what's happening, not rooftop gardens in eco-sensitive planters. And they need this because they can't function without each other's help. They're poor, that's how it works. They can't afford to think only about their apartments and the gardening class schedule.<br /><br />The architects in this series aren't thinking about these things because it hasn't been their job to bring children up, and if they've ever been poor it hasn't been for many decades. They're thinking about what the other architects are thinking about. So it's a very interesting series, for sure. But it's also a very powerful argument for why every field needs strong diversity and a habit of looking around every gathering and saying, \"who are we missing?\"\nGreat intentions, projects undermined by a monoculture of architects & planners\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Niklas Lindgren'], 'Producers': ['Laura Kuulasmaa', 'Sari Lempi\u00e4inen'], 'Starring': ['Anna Paavilainen', 'Elmer B\u00e4ck', 'Mikko Penttil\u00e4'], 'Studio': ['AMC Plus Independent']}\nGreat stuff, and some lowkey, terrific acting. Micke\u2019s mom is hilarious. Theme by Taira hasn\u2019t left my head in two days.

You may be all misty and feeling wonderful about it, but if you believe that any of this is representative of single motherhood, let alone single motherhood after abuse, how many single moms have you devoted that much effort and time to? Exactly, unless they\u2019re your own daughter. And neither does anyone else.<br /><br />Here\u2019s where single moms generally find help, when they find it at all:<br /><br />- The next abusive, predatory man<br />- The women who run the shelters and support-collecting agencies<br />- The women lawyers and legislators who are occasionally able to make the law work for them<br />- A woman at the kids\u2019 school<br />- Their moms and sisters, sometimes<br /><br />If you actually believe that some lovely, competent, resource-rich community comes together to help the plucky abuse-escapee mom in America, I have a shelter to introduce you to. When are you signing up to dedicate a significant slice of your life to the women and children there? You know, ongoing, committed time? Right. You and everybody else. But hey, now you feel great and inspired, so why should you worry about actual single moms? Surely there\u2019s a nice fairy tale taking care of them all.<br /><br />For the next fairy tale in the book, please turn to \u201cseek help from your faith community.\u201d<br /><br />What actually helps: flexible and part-time salaried jobs with benefits that recognize that kids don\u2019t hatch from eggs and raise themselves. Reasonable quality creches like the rest of the world has. Decent educational systems. All the things that make it possible for single parents to make a reasonable living while bringing up the kids. If you insist on building a society whose entire purpose is to defend men\u2019s ideas of themselves as the big heroes in the story, and entitled to women\u2019s free service, then you get misery for single mothers and their kids. Skip that part, and actually acknowledge violence against women when you vote and in how you build your police & legal systems, and single mothers aren\u2019t pore desperate abused-but-gritty hardship cases fit for making you feel all glowy in a fairy tale. They just become normal parents, raising kids, paying bills.<br /><br />In orther words, it\u2019s up to you, how you vote, what you tell your legislators & councils you want. You don\u2019t get to feel glowy and inspired that way because you don\u2019t get to see a struggle-and-triumph story?

You can of course remedy this by going and looking at it. Despite nan's review below you can certainly find it in major American museums; I grew up with it and frankly hadn't known he'd been an outsider of any kind. And I don't know that he was; he merely wasn't careerist or a pedagogue. Certainly recognized in the top circles though.\nMuch about the artist, not so much about the art\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Adam Curtis'], 'Studio': ['Adam Curtis']}\nAdam Curtis has been working in this vein for decades, and I was expecting some North-London socialist-bookshop dramatics, but as it turned out he didn't need them here; the story overwhelmed his imagination in how selfish people make things go wrong. Everything's bigger in America, I guess.<br /><br />He's telling the story of my adulthood. I watched all of this, as a young and then not-so-young person trained in economics, trade, and international relations, and it was all as he describes. Actually what he describes doesn't begin to touch the Steinbeck-quality realities of how things went, and of what it's meant in terms of race, which we've only just started noticing, here in whiteland. For that you want Giorgio Angelini's documentary Owned, which is also all true. Neither tells the story of women. We've been too busy working for free or near-free for other people to make so many documentaries.<br /><br />But yes. Selfishness destroys societies, and Atlas Shrugged appeals to people who like pulp fiction dressed up to sound meaningful. It's not even good pulp fiction. It's got one good impassioned speech, which is about the nature of money, and the rest can be stripped of the ridiculous B-movie fiction full of Rand's disturbed sexuality and scars from Soviet Communism, and condensed into her pamphlet Anthem. She only ever wrote the same thing over and over again. The fact that Greenspan found any of this appealing...well, it's no surprise, then, that he was slow on the uptake about what people are like, and later professed to be shocked to find that the bond raters and accountancies were on the take, and that rational magic wasn't happening all around him.<br /><br />As for me, I remember reading Atlas Shrugged for the first time: I was 18 and a copy was being passed hand to hand among classmates. So I got it and found it to be such dreadful, miserably-written garbage -- both in its \"philosophy\" and as fiction -- that I actually threw it. I threw an actual book. I don't think I'd ever done that before. (Then, of course, I picked it up and waded through the rest to see if it got any better. It didn't.) Several years later I went back to see what had provoked that kind of reaction, and when I read it through again I heard a terribly sad thing: a woman trapped mentally in the abuses of the Soviet systems she'd grown up in. Since then I've heard echoes of the same from Soviet/Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s on the left and the right, and all I can say about that is that you have to discount the fact that they still see their old world in front of their eyes and hear its sentiments about people, and these are stronger than the vision of the people actually in front of them. Still tedious garbage as a novel, though, and still nothing but solipsism and masochistic fantasies as a philosophy, with a heavy dose of \"I'm going to the garden to eat worms.\" And still attractive to tech/finbros who can't read but want permission to be wholly selfish. Then again, they always like the ladies who give them that, don't they.\nThis sounds like hysterical propaganda and is all true.\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Michael Blackwood'], 'Producers': ['Michael Blackwood'], 'Starring': ['Robert A.M.
