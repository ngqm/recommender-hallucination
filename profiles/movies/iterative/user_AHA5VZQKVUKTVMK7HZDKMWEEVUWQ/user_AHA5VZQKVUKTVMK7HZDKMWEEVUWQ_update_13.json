He went right to the joint, Kieslowski did.  I couldn't watch it all, this time.<br /><br />I don't think the blue mobile was her daughter's, by the way. I accept that she was the composer, and that for her there was a synaesthesia with the music and the blue lights.  I expect the blue room was her composing room, and that the mobile was a thing from her art, which is why in the end she took it along.  She had to; she needed it.

That b/w process they used is terrifically lush, almost Max Factor.<br /><br />Beyond that, though...boy, this is Journalism Heroes 101. The McCarthy story's a great one and Murrow was a serious guy, but the story's reduced to semaphore for this thing, a series of journalistic cliches. All the President's Men did much better, and that was with Woodward writing his patented Fantasy Internal Dialogue of High Officials. I'm sure the excuse goes that it's a movie, it's supposed to entertain and teach people who've never heard of Joe McCarthy, but that's all messed up. If they've never heard of Joe McCarthy, you want to serve up a shovelful of reality, not gleanings.<br /><br />The acting-to-newsreel trick's a nice one, but it doesn't compensate for the thinness of the storytelling or the punch-pulling with the elbow out to Mars (there's a suicide? I'm shocked!). If you're not just looking for eye candy, try actual books instead on this subject. There's no end of books on both McCarthy and CBS -- I think Fred Friendly wrote one of his own.\nDumbed-down history for the NCLB era\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Guy Maddin'], 'Producers': ['Jody Shapiro', 'Phyllis Laing'], 'Starring': ['Ann Savage', 'Louis Negin', 'Darcy Fehr']}\nI totally believe everything he told me about Winnipeg.

You forget that Wally Shawn can act like this -- what a curdled, potent character. (Where has he been?) The conceits aren't bothersome, they're fine, it's really too painful to watch all at once.

But over and over he takes to bullying and talking over his female clients until I want to shove him out of the room and have a shouting match with him myself. I\u2019m sure the idea was to make a bit of theatre here, but it\u2019s in no way amusing.<br /><br />Apart from which, unfortunately, he just isn\u2019t that good an architect. He\u2019s all right, I guess, but it\u2019s all much of a muchness, the same standard high-end modernism-inflected boxes with big windows. Lots of talk about wanting to preserve the charm of some wreck and then delivering some atrium-ridden nightmare to heat. It\u2019s always an improvement, and certainly things could\u2019ve gone much worse, but...I\u2019m sorry, Dermot, you\u2019re not an artist, and frankly your interiors and additions often don\u2019t really suit the old buildings.\nFor the love of god, stop bullying the woman clients\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['David Batty'], 'Producers': ['Simon Fuller', 'Michael Caine', 'Dick Clement', 'Ian La Frenais', \"Fodhla Cronin O'Reilly\"], 'Starring': ['David Bailey', 'Michael Caine', 'Joan Collins'], 'Studio': ['Gravitas Ventures']}\nI mean....<br /><br />I get that at the end of your life you want to look back, see what it was, remember why it was, relive the good times. It\u2019s just that the rest of us have had to live your particular good time along with you for over fifty bleeding years, and it\u2019s been incredibly damaging. Freedom, self-expression, that\u2019s all great, but so is knowing when to stop. We\u2019re all painfully aware that that\u2019s been a missing feature, and an hour in I just couldn\u2019t watch any more. The film clips were good, entertaining, not actually terribly novel (like I said, it\u2019s been more than 50 years), but what was missing overwhelmed what was there if you weren\u2019t just having a party in the rearview mirror.<br /><br />I\u2019d have welcomed though hearing more from everyone\u2019s non-frugging parents. And more recognition of what you got wrong, how you\u2019ve noticed it at this point.

I sort of felt like I should leave and give them privacy, or head for the Personal Best section because I plainly had not been invited to this viewing gallery, but then all they did was shake hands sportingly.
