He went right to the joint, Kieslowski did.  I couldn't watch it all, this time.<br /><br />I don't think the blue mobile was her daughter's, by the way. I accept that she was the composer, and that for her there was a synaesthesia with the music and the blue lights.  I expect the blue room was her composing room, and that the mobile was a thing from her art, which is why in the end she took it along.  She had to; she needed it.

That b/w process they used is terrifically lush, almost Max Factor.<br /><br />Beyond that, though...boy, this is Journalism Heroes 101. The McCarthy story's a great one and Murrow was a serious guy, but the story's reduced to semaphore for this thing, a series of journalistic cliches. All the President's Men did much better, and that was with Woodward writing his patented Fantasy Internal Dialogue of High Officials. I'm sure the excuse goes that it's a movie, it's supposed to entertain and teach people who've never heard of Joe McCarthy, but that's all messed up. If they've never heard of Joe McCarthy, you want to serve up a shovelful of reality, not gleanings.<br /><br />The acting-to-newsreel trick's a nice one, but it doesn't compensate for the thinness of the storytelling or the punch-pulling with the elbow out to Mars (there's a suicide? I'm shocked!). If you're not just looking for eye candy, try actual books instead on this subject. There's no end of books on both McCarthy and CBS -- I think Fred Friendly wrote one of his own.\nDumbed-down history for the NCLB era\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Guy Maddin'], 'Producers': ['Jody Shapiro', 'Phyllis Laing'], 'Starring': ['Ann Savage', 'Louis Negin', 'Darcy Fehr']}\nI totally believe everything he told me about Winnipeg.

You forget that Wally Shawn can act like this -- what a curdled, potent character. (Where has he been?) The conceits aren't bothersome, they're fine, it's really too painful to watch all at once.

He\u2019s all right, I guess, but it\u2019s all much of a muchness, the same standard high-end modernism-inflected boxes with big windows. Lots of talk about wanting to preserve the charm of some wreck and then delivering some atrium-ridden nightmare to heat. It\u2019s always an improvement, and certainly things could\u2019ve gone much worse, but...I\u2019m sorry, Dermot, you\u2019re not an artist, and frankly your interiors and additions often don\u2019t really suit the old buildings.\nFor the love of god, stop bullying the woman clients\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['David Batty'], 'Producers': ['Simon Fuller', 'Michael Caine', 'Dick Clement', 'Ian La Frenais', \"Fodhla Cronin O'Reilly\"], 'Starring': ['David Bailey', 'Michael Caine', 'Joan Collins'], 'Studio': ['Gravitas Ventures']}\nI mean....<br /><br />I get that at the end of your life you want to look back, see what it was, remember why it was, relive the good times.
