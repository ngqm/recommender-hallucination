Recognizing that its song-studded soundtrack alone makes\", 'Yellow Submarine', 'a video annuity, United Artists has lavished a frame-by-frame refurbishment of the original feature, while replacing its original monaural audio tracks with a meticulously reconstructed stereo mix that actually refines legendary original album versions.', \"What emerges is a vivid time capsule of the late '60s and a minor milestone in animation. The music represents the quartet's zenith--\", 'Rubber Soul', ',', 'Revolver', ', and', \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", \". The story line, cobbled together by producer Al Brodax and a committee of writers, is a broad, feather-light allegory set in idyllic Pepperland, where the gentle citizens are threatened by the nasty, music-hating Blue Meanies and their surreal arsenal of henchmen, with the Beatles enlisted to thwart the bad guys. Visually, designer Heinz Edelmann mixes the biomorphic squiggles, day-glo palette, and Beardsley-esque portraits of Peter Max with rotoscoped still photographs and film; Edelmann's animated collages also nod to Andy Warhol and Magritte in properly psychedelic fashion, which works wonderfully with such terrific songs.\", \"High orthodox Beatlemaniacs can still grouse that the animated Fab Four are (literally) flat archetypes, but that's missing the sheer bloom of the music or the giddy, campy fun of the visuals. Making sense of the story is second to submerging blissfully in the sights and sounds of this video treat.\", '--Sam Sutherland', 'Additional Features', 'The scope of', 'Yellow Submarine', '\\'s 1999 restoration is idealized on the DVD version, which beyond its slightly letterboxed original aspect adds a stunning 5.1 sound mix that showcases the audio team\\'s wizardry; music fans can hear the entire score without dialogue, the better to focus on such revelations as \"Nowhere Man,\" boasting a gorgeous, full-stereo chorus, and \"Only a Northern Song,\" with a first-time-ever stereo mix that exploits the full surround array for appropriately mind-blowing effect. Other special features include three storyboarded sequences, two of which are not seen in the final film; behind-the-scenes photos and featurette; a full-length audio commentary; and the original theatrical trailer.', '--Sam Sutherland', 'See more']\n{'Aspect Ratio': '1.85:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'G (General Audience)', 'Product Dimensions': '5.31 x 7.52 x 0.63 inches; 3.81 Ounces', 'Media Format': 'Animated, Color, Closed-captioned, Dolby, DVD, NTSC, Letterboxed, Widescreen', 'Run time': '1 hour and 25 minutes', 'Release date': 'September 14, 1999', 'Actors': 'George Dunning (II), John Clive, Paul McCartney, Geoffrey Hughes, Ringo Starr', 'Subtitles': 'English', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1)', 'Studio': 'MGM (Video & DVD)', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nI know this film had lousy reviews but I love the graphics and the music so for me it was a good purchase.  My 8 year old granddaughter had a birthday party with under the sea theme so she enjoyed this as well.  Not for everyone though.\nExactly what I expected and wanted.\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Daniel Alfredson'], 'Producers': ['Ole Sandberg', 'Peter Nadermann', 'Jon Mankell', 'Anni Faurbye Fernandez', 'Lone Korslund', 'Jenny Gilbertsson', 'Mikael Wallen'], 'Starring': ['Noomi Rapace', 'Michael Nyqvist', 'Lena Endre']}\nI had seen Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and now this one. There was enough carryover explaining the money and a couple of the original questions were resolved i.e. about her father. There is much more that I believe will be disclosed in the third film and I am eager to see that one. I love Amazon Prime even though the only benefit I get from it is the free films but that alone makes it worth while. Films like this series are what it is all about.<br /><br />Having seen the first film with sub-titles which left a lot to be desired in being able to read them, I was glad to find the dubbed version. I felt the dubbing was quite well done and made it far more enjoyable. I read some of the reviews and perhaps if I had read the books I might not have enjoyed this as much. I definitely will try to read them as I believe they will flesh this out with other material not shown in the film.<br /><br />I felt the acting in this, as in the first film, was excellent and Lisbeth is well portrayed. Mikael was a stronger character in the first film but his continued role carries the storyline along. This might actually be better for NOT having read the book as I read that areas were cut out. I personally liked it very much and am eager to see the last film tomorrow night.\nPowerful storyline\nWarehouse 13\nScience Fiction, Suspense, Drama\n[\"Warehouse 13 returns for its second season, picking up from season one's finale cliff-hanger episode.

At least not on any affordable TV package I have seen. Thank goodness Amazon has it available! It is creative and fun, incongruous and adventurous.\nBest space fantasy adventure\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Graeme Harper', 'Euros Lyn', 'Jamie Magnus Stone', 'Douglas Mackinnon', 'Rachel Talalay', 'James Strong', 'Charlie Palmer', 'James Hawes', 'Joe Ahearne', 'Toby Haynes'], 'Producers': ['Steven Moffat', 'Marcus Wilson', 'Sanne Wohlenberg', 'Piers Wenger', 'Beth Willis'], 'Starring': ['Matt Smith', 'Karen Gillan', 'Arthur Darvill']}\nIt is always fun to see where space and time travel will take the Dr. and his companions. The idea of new iterations of the Dr. is what has kept this going for so many years. I used to occasionally get to see the early programs many years ago, and was sad when it was out of production but it certainly has aged as well as the Dr. himselves!\nMore of the best fantasy space adventure\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Timothy Van Patten', 'Allen Coulter', 'Jeremy Podeswa', 'Ed Bianchi', 'Brad Anderson', 'Alik Sakharov', 'Jake Paltrow', 'Simon Cellan Jones', 'Brian Kirk', 'Martin Scorsese'], 'Producers': ['Rudd Simmons', 'Terence Winter', 'Martin Scorsese', 'Tim Van Patten', 'Stephen Levinson', 'Mark Wahlberg'], 'Starring': ['Steve Buscemi', 'Michael Pitt', 'Kelly Macdonald'], 'Studio': ['HBO']}\nI am really enjoying this video series, and the only thing I am unhappy about is that more seasons are not available free with Amazon prime.\nExcellent series \u2013 very well done.\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'smoking', 'foul language'], 'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Christian Tureaud', 'David Salzberg'], 'Producers': ['Christian Tureaud', 'David Salzberg', 'Mike Boettcher', 'Carlos Boettcher'], 'Starring': ['Mike Boettcher', 'Carlos Boettcher'], 'Studio': ['Anderson Digital']}\ni just finished watching this film and despite the fact that I hate war and I don't usually watch war films this one was worth the time spent. It was real and I thought it gave the viewer an unabridged sense of the fighting, the heroism, and what those soldiers went through. I happened to read some of the 1* reviews, especially written by veterans, and I must say I didn't have the sense that the correspondents were there to show themselves to be self-aggrandizing. The film showed footage of some terrible battles and there was a strong sense of sadness over those who lost their lives. It was not an easy film to watch, but it was far better than anything Hollywood could come up with.\nPowerful, poignant, disturbing and very real\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['John Fawcett', 'David Frazee', 'TJ Scott', 'Brett Sullivan', 'Ken Girotti'], 'Producers': ['John Fawcett', 'David Fortier', 'Ivan Schneeberg', 'Graeme Manson'], 'Starring': ['Tatiana Maslany', 'Jordan Gavaris', 'Maria Doyle Kennedy'], 'Studio': ['BBC America']}\nThe premise of the series is very interesting but what is more interesting is the amazing talent of the actors. Not just Tatiana Maslany  Who has done a superb job with the characters, but also Jordan Gavaris. I was sad to learn that season three is not yet included in Amazon prime but I am eagerly  waiting to be able to watch the rest of this wonderful series.\nAmazing talent!\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium', 'Espa\u00f1ol', 'Deutsch'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', 'Deutsch', 'Espa\u00f1ol'], 'Directors': ['Alex Zakrzewski', 'Ernest R.
