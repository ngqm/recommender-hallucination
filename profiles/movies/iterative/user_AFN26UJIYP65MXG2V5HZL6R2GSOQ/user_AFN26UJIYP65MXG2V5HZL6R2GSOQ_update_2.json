I felt the dubbing was quite well done and made it far more enjoyable. I read some of the reviews and perhaps if I had read the books I might not have enjoyed this as much.

The music represents the quartet's zenith--\", 'Rubber Soul', ',', 'Revolver', ', and', \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", \". The story line, cobbled together by producer Al Brodax and a committee of writers, is a broad, feather-light allegory set in idyllic Pepperland, where the gentle citizens are threatened by the nasty, music-hating Blue Meanies and their surreal arsenal of henchmen, with the Beatles enlisted to thwart the bad guys. Visually, designer Heinz Edelmann mixes the biomorphic squiggles, day-glo palette, and Beardsley-esque portraits of Peter Max with rotoscoped still photographs and film; Edelmann's animated collages also nod to Andy Warhol and Magritte in properly psychedelic fashion, which works wonderfully with such terrific songs.\", \"High orthodox Beatlemaniacs can still grouse that the animated Fab Four are (literally) flat archetypes, but that's missing the sheer bloom of the music or the giddy, campy fun of the visuals. Making sense of the story is second to submerging blissfully in the sights and sounds of this video treat.\", '--Sam Sutherland', 'Additional Features', 'The scope of', 'Yellow Submarine', '\\'s 1999 restoration is idealized on the DVD version, which beyond its slightly letterboxed original aspect adds a stunning 5.1 sound mix that showcases the audio team\\'s wizardry; music fans can hear the entire score without dialogue, the better to focus on such revelations as \"Nowhere Man,\" boasting a gorgeous, full-stereo chorus, and \"Only a Northern Song,\" with a first-time-ever stereo mix that exploits the full surround array for appropriately mind-blowing effect. Other special features include three storyboarded sequences, two of which are not seen in the final film; behind-the-scenes photos and featurette; a full-length audio commentary; and the original theatrical trailer.', '--Sam Sutherland', 'See more']\n{'Aspect Ratio': '1.85:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'G (General Audience)', 'Product Dimensions': '5.31 x 7.52 x 0.63 inches; 3.81 Ounces', 'Media Format': 'Animated, Color, Closed-captioned, Dolby, DVD, NTSC, Letterboxed, Widescreen', 'Run time': '1 hour and 25 minutes', 'Release date': 'September 14, 1999', 'Actors': 'George Dunning (II), John Clive, Paul McCartney, Geoffrey Hughes, Ringo Starr', 'Subtitles': 'English', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1)', 'Studio': 'MGM (Video & DVD)', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nI know this film had lousy reviews but I love the graphics and the music so for me it was a good purchase.
