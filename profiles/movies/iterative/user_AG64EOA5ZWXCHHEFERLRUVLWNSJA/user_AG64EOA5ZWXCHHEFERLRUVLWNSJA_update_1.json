That\\'s right: This is the show where the ladies have a Chaplinesque experience with a too-fast factory conveyor belt, forcing them to hide candies in their mouths, in their hats, and down their blouses lest a tough forewoman fire them for incompetence. A half-century later, the scene is still so fresh and funny it would grace any current sitcom. \"Lucy Goes to the Hospital,\" which received an amazing 71.7 rating on January 19, 1953, is the historic episode featuring the birth of Little Ricky and a load of wonderful slapstick. Other television series (', 'The Dick Van Dyke Show', ') and movies (', 'Nine Months', ') have tried to top', 'Lucy', \"'s time-to-go-to-the-hospital shenanigans, but there's nothing like the sight of Ricky and Fred falling all over themselves or Ricky showing up at the maternity ward (direct from a voodoo-themed show at the Tropicana) in witch doctor makeup.\", 'The other 31 episodes included in', 'I Love Lucy: The Compete Second Season', 'have choice moments, too. \"Lucy Becomes a Sculptress\" finds the ever-ambitious redhead falling for empty flattery at an art-supply store and commencing an ill-advised career working in clay.

The usual running themes in', 'I Love Lucy', \"--Lucy's misguided desire to be a part of Ricky's musical career, and her penchant for disguising herself to investigate something--are all over\", 'The Complete Second Season', '. \"Ricky Loses His Voice\" is a delightful piece in which Ricky\\'s laryngitis inspires Lucy, the Mertzes, and an aging chorus line to put on a Tropicana spectacle, and \"Ricky Has Labor Pains\" finds Lucy and Ethel going undercover as male reporters to find out what happens at a stag party. Lots to enjoy here, and the special features include bloopers, information about the guest cast, and snippets from Ball\\'s radio show.', '--Tom Keogh', 'Season Five', 'I Love Lucy: The Complete Fifth Season', 'finds Lucy Ricardo (Lucille Ball) making an international mess out of husband Ricky\\'s globe-trotting tour as an entertainer.

The hilarious \"Lucy and the Queen\" finds her angling in London for a way to meet the Royal Family after Ricky is invited to say hello at the Palladium. From there, Lucy creates chaos in Scotland (this episode includes a memorable dream sequence in which Ricky appears as Scotty MacTavish MacDougal MacCardo), Paris (where she and Ethel plot to meet guest star and good sport Charles Boyer at an outdoor caf\u00e9), Rome (the outstanding \"Lucy\\'s Italian Movie\" finds her dispatched to a vineyard, where she has to crush grapes--brilliantly--with her feet).

Things get off to a familiar start when Lucy Ricardo (Lucille Ball) gets in the middle of husband Ricky\u2019s business--in this case, disguising herself as a hot dog salesman at Yankee Stadium in order to get near Bob Hope. Hope, she believes, has ignored Ricky\u2019s offer to be the first act at his new nightclub. But, in fact, Hope had already agreed; Ricky was just sitting on the information to keep Lucy from getting typically ditzy in front of one of his celebrity pals. Not surprisingly, mayhem follows when poor Hope finds his hand slathered with condiments and his noggin bonked by a foul ball. Other celebrity sightings include Orson Welles, who copes with Lucy\u2019s aspirations as a Shakespearean actress, and George Reeves, television\u2019s Superman, who shows up unexpectedly, in costume, at Little Ricky\u2019s birthday party.
