I recently saw it with my 11 year old son, and he just loved it; this boy normally won't watch westerns.  It's that good.<br /><br />John Wayne, Dean Martin, Walter Brennan all do a great job.  Even Rick Nelson, not someone you'd expect to see in a western, does a solid job.  Angie Dickinson is very likable.  It all hangs together, and doesn't work too hard at it; just goes down nice and easy.  (Ok, I mixed my metaphors, but you get the drift.)<br /><br />What can I say, I love this movie!  If you like the classic ones, buy it, it's worth every penny.\nif you like the classic westerns, this is a must-see, must-own\nDistrict B13/District 13: Ultimatum 2-Pack\nCyril Raffaelli  (Actor),     David Belle  (Actor),     Patrick Alessandrin  (Director),     Pierre Morel  (Director)    &                   1                  more   Rated:    R    Format: Blu-ray\nMovies & TV, Blu-ray, Movies\n[\"Includes: District B13 Paris, 2010. An isolation wall surrounds the ghetto cities of District B13. Within these walls, without effective law enforcement, gang rule is absolute. Damien is a member of an elite police squadron, highly trained in martial arts. He goes undercover to infiltrate a gang in order to defuse a neutron bomb and save District B13 from annihilation. Damien recruits the help of a criminal named Leito - whose only goal is to save his sister from the clutches of the same gang. District 13: Ultimatum Two years have passed since elite police officer Damien Tomasso (Cyril Raffaelli) teamed up with reformed vigilante Leito (David Belle) to save the notorious District 13, a racially charged ghetto populated by violent drug dealing gangs and vicious killers. Despite government promises to maintain order, the state of the district has deteriorated and is causing civil unrest. A group of corrupt cops and elected officials conspire to cash in on the redevelopment of the district by proposing it's destruction under the nuclear air strike. Damien and Leito must join forces again, using their martial arts and unique physical skills, to bring peace to the neighborhood by any means necessary.\"]\n{'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 6.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'MGNO10299BR', 'Director': 'Patrick Alessandrin, Pierre Morel', 'Media Format': 'Blu-ray', 'Run time': '3 hours and 5 minutes', 'Release date': 'April 27, 2010', 'Actors': 'Cyril Raffaelli, David Belle, Philippe Torreton, Daniel Duval, Elodie Yung', 'Dubbed': 'English', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish', 'Studio': 'Magnolia Home Ent', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '2'}\nYes, I do mean that: these are among the best action movies ever made -- but I'll qualify by adding \"which involve humans doing athletic things\", such as martial arts movies.  (I like the other kinds too, BTW.)<br /><br />But if you enjoy watching incredibly gifted athletes doing great stunts done in a very believable way, and don't mind preposterous plots, then these movies might tickle your fancy.  Just being able to watch David Belle (said to be the founder of parkour/parcour) is worth the price in my opinion.<br /><br />So remember, don't expect any Profound Commentary on the Human Condition (thank goodness).  Don't get too hung up on the silliness or the stereotypes, that's part of the fun.  Just relax and enjoy great escapist fun with a good companion or two.\nsilly plots, but among the best action movies ever made\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Guy Ferland', 'Christine Moore', 'John Polson', 'Ron Fortunato', 'Seith Mann', 'Jerry Levine', 'Larry Teng', 'Lucy Liu', 'Aaron Lipstadt', 'Andrew Bernstein'], 'Studio': ['CBS']}\nIf you're a fan of the Sherlock Holmes stories, and don't object to a well-done transformation of the theme, then you are likely to really enjoy this series.  The acting is superb, the stories are compelling, and the whole thing just reeks of excellence and attention to detail.<br /><br />I've been a fan of the Holmes stories since I was a little boy, having read all of them multiple times, and have watched the various film versions over the years.  I've enjoyed some of them:  I'm not a big fan of the Basil Rathbone versions, and I quite disliked the Guy Ritchie/Robert Downey versions. I think that the recent re-imagining done in this series and in the British series (by Gatiss/Moffat, with Benedict Cumberbatch & Martin Freeman) are excellent, and hugely enjoyable if you're not offended by the variation from the canonical texts.\nVery good revised version of Holmes & Watson\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Attenborough', 'Richard'], 'Producers': ['Richard Attenborough'], 'Starring': ['Ben Kingsley', 'Candice Bergen', 'Edward Fox'], 'Studio': ['Classics']}\nGandhi was human, and had his weaknesses.  But you wouldn't know it from this movie, this is about Gandhi the soon-to-revered, and presents him as someone just barely short of being a god.  I would have preferred him presented as a great man, with all his compassion and leadership and steadfastness, but also with some human weaknesses.<br /><br />Further, although I don't want to go into the history in a brief review (there are many authoritative sources for those who might be interested), but the portrayal of events, and of the other important players, is a bit too slick and shallow.  It does great disservice to a worldwide audience that is unlikely to hear another version of the story.\nA bit too much worship.\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Michael Owen Morris', 'Robert Chetwyn', 'Martyn Friend', 'Ronald Wilson', 'Ken Hannam', 'Christopher Hodson', 'Robert Tronson'], 'Producers': ['Ken Riddington', 'Jonathan Alwyn'], 'Studio': ['BBC']}\nI read all the Allingham books & stories many years ago, and enjoyed them greatly.  So I was quite pleased to find these televised versions ... at least, until I started watching them.  They are abysmal.  The director and the actors seem to have completely missed the spirit of the stories, the acting is wooden, and the whole thing comes across as rather lame.<br /><br />If you're a Campion fan, give this a miss.  If you're not a Campion fan, give it a wide berth.\npoorly done\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Stephen Kay', 'F\u00e9lix Enr\u00edquez Alcal\u00e1', 'Allan Kroeker', 'Jamie Barber', 'Emile B.

Miller Tobin', 'Christopher Gorham', 'Larysa Kondracki', 'Ken Girotti'], 'Starring': ['Piper Perabo', 'Christopher Gorham', 'Peter Gallagher'], 'Studio': ['USA']}\nThe writers didn't even bother reading spy thrillers to learn a bit about spycraft, guess they care more about the soap opera aspects of the show.  Piper Perabo is not convincing in the role, she plays it as &#34;sorority girl tries hard in the CIA&#34;.  The surrounding cast is rather good, they help carry the show, expecially Chris Gorham in the buddy and mentor role (he's rather charming, appeals to both genders in my family).<br /><br />I gave up after Perabo's character looked confused at an airport briefcase switch (calling it a brush-pass doesn't make it authentic), because more than one person had similar briefcases.  Even trainees in an exercise would have planned it better and handled it better.\nlame.  really lame.\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Satsuo Yamamoto'], 'Producers': ['Itsuo Doi', 'Taker\u00f4 It\u00f4', 'Masaichi Nagata'], 'Starring': ['Raizo Ichikawa', 'Shiho Fujimura', 'Tomisaburo Wakayama'], 'Studio': ['AnimEigo', 'Inc']}\nDumb story, poor quality film (it's very dark and hard to see).
