So I watched it again with eager anticipation.  Sadly, I was very disappointed.  The story is dumb, really really dumb, even for the period.  The lead couple (Stewart & Day) behave irrationally, and so does everyone else -- the police, the bad guys, the bystanders -- it's just hard to take.  I also thought there was a whiff of &#34;Ugly American&#34; in the behavior of the McKennas, but there's no point belaboring that point in an old movie.  It was not a fun revisit.\nReview Title: really dumb, doesn't stand the test of time\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I recently saw it with my 11 year old son, and he just loved it; this boy normally won't watch westerns.  It's that good.<br /><br />John Wayne, Dean Martin, Walter Brennan all do a great job.  Even Rick Nelson, not someone you'd expect to see in a western, does a solid job.  Angie Dickinson is very likable.  It all hangs together, and doesn't work too hard at it; just goes down nice and easy.  (Ok, I mixed my metaphors, but you get the drift.)<br /><br />What can I say, I love this movie!

An isolation wall surrounds the ghetto cities of District B13. Within these walls, without effective law enforcement, gang rule is absolute. Damien is a member of an elite police squadron, highly trained in martial arts. He goes undercover to infiltrate a gang in order to defuse a neutron bomb and save District B13 from annihilation. Damien recruits the help of a criminal named Leito - whose only goal is to save his sister from the clutches of the same gang. District 13: Ultimatum Two years have passed since elite police officer Damien Tomasso (Cyril Raffaelli) teamed up with reformed vigilante Leito (David Belle) to save the notorious District 13, a racially charged ghetto populated by violent drug dealing gangs and vicious killers. Despite government promises to maintain order, the state of the district has deteriorated and is causing civil unrest. A group of corrupt cops and elected officials conspire to cash in on the redevelopment of the district by proposing it's destruction under the nuclear air strike. Damien and Leito must join forces again, using their martial arts and unique physical skills, to bring peace to the neighborhood by any means necessary.\"]\n{'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 6.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'MGNO10299BR', 'Director': 'Patrick Alessandrin, Pierre Morel', 'Media Format': 'Blu-ray', 'Run time': '3 hours and 5 minutes', 'Release date': 'April 27, 2010', 'Actors': 'Cyril Raffaelli, David Belle, Philippe Torreton, Daniel Duval, Elodie Yung', 'Dubbed': 'English', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish', 'Studio': 'Magnolia Home Ent', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '2'}\nYes, I do mean that: these are among the best action movies ever made -- but I'll qualify by adding \"which involve humans doing athletic things\", such as martial arts movies.  (I like the other kinds too, BTW.)<br /><br />But if you enjoy watching incredibly gifted athletes doing great stunts done in a very believable way, and don't mind preposterous plots, then these movies might tickle your fancy.  Just being able to watch David Belle (said to be the founder of parkour/parcour) is worth the price in my opinion.<br /><br />So remember, don't expect any Profound Commentary on the Human Condition (thank goodness).  Don't get too hung up on the silliness or the stereotypes, that's part of the fun.  Just relax and enjoy great escapist fun with a good companion or two.\nsilly plots, but among the best action movies ever made\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Guy Ferland', 'Christine Moore', 'John Polson', 'Ron Fortunato', 'Seith Mann', 'Jerry Levine', 'Larry Teng', 'Lucy Liu', 'Aaron Lipstadt', 'Andrew Bernstein'], 'Studio': ['CBS']}\nIf you're a fan of the Sherlock Holmes stories, and don't object to a well-done transformation of the theme, then you are likely to really enjoy this series.  The acting is superb, the stories are compelling, and the whole thing just reeks of excellence and attention to detail.<br /><br />I've been a fan of the Holmes stories since I was a little boy, having read all of them multiple times, and have watched the various film versions over the years.  I've enjoyed some of them:  I'm not a big fan of the Basil Rathbone versions, and I quite disliked the Guy Ritchie/Robert Downey versions. I think that the recent re-imagining done in this series and in the British series (by Gatiss/Moffat, with Benedict Cumberbatch & Martin Freeman) are excellent, and hugely enjoyable if you're not offended by the variation from the canonical texts.\nVery good revised version of Holmes & Watson\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Attenborough', 'Richard'], 'Producers': ['Richard Attenborough'], 'Starring': ['Ben Kingsley', 'Candice Bergen', 'Edward Fox'], 'Studio': ['Classics']}\nGandhi was human, and had his weaknesses.  But you wouldn't know it from this movie, this is about Gandhi the soon-to-revered, and presents him as someone just barely short of being a god.  I would have preferred him presented as a great man, with all his compassion and leadership and steadfastness, but also with some human weaknesses.<br /><br />Further, although I don't want to go into the history in a brief review (there are many authoritative sources for those who might be interested), but the portrayal of events, and of the other important players, is a bit too slick and shallow.  It does great disservice to a worldwide audience that is unlikely to hear another version of the story.\nA bit too much worship.\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Michael Owen Morris', 'Robert Chetwyn', 'Martyn Friend', 'Ronald Wilson', 'Ken Hannam', 'Christopher Hodson', 'Robert Tronson'], 'Producers': ['Ken Riddington', 'Jonathan Alwyn'], 'Studio': ['BBC']}\nI read all the Allingham books & stories many years ago, and enjoyed them greatly.  So I was quite pleased to find these televised versions ... at least, until I started watching them.  They are abysmal.  The director and the actors seem to have completely missed the spirit of the stories, the acting is wooden, and the whole thing comes across as rather lame.<br /><br />If you're a Campion fan, give this a miss.  If you're not a Campion fan, give it a wide berth.\npoorly done\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Stephen Kay', 'F\u00e9lix Enr\u00edquez Alcal\u00e1', 'Allan Kroeker', 'Jamie Barber', 'Emile B. Levisetti', 'Kate Woods', 'J. Miller Tobin', 'Christopher Gorham', 'Larysa Kondracki', 'Ken Girotti'], 'Starring': ['Piper Perabo', 'Christopher Gorham', 'Peter Gallagher'], 'Studio': ['USA']}\nThe writers didn't even bother reading spy thrillers to learn a bit about spycraft, guess they care more about the soap opera aspects of the show.  Piper Perabo is not convincing in the role, she plays it as &#34;sorority girl tries hard in the CIA&#34;.  The surrounding cast is rather good, they help carry the show, expecially Chris Gorham in the buddy and mentor role (he's rather charming, appeals to both genders in my family).<br /><br />I gave up after Perabo's character looked confused at an airport briefcase switch (calling it a brush-pass doesn't make it authentic), because more than one person had similar briefcases.  Even trainees in an exercise would have planned it better and handled it better.\nlame.  really lame.\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Satsuo Yamamoto'], 'Producers': ['Itsuo Doi', 'Taker\u00f4 It\u00f4', 'Masaichi Nagata'], 'Starring': ['Raizo Ichikawa', 'Shiho Fujimura', 'Tomisaburo Wakayama'], 'Studio': ['AnimEigo', 'Inc']}\nDumb story, poor quality film (it's very dark and hard to see).  Diehard fans of the genre might be interested for the historical significance of the series, but although I like many Japanese movies of the type (jidaigeki), I found this one heavy going.\navoid unless you're a true fan of old ninja movies\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Christopher Menaul', 'Gillies MacKinnon'], 'Producers': ['Lynda La Plante', 'Liz Thorburn'], 'Starring': ['Kelly Reilly', 'Ciaran Hinds', 'Shaun Dingwell'], 'Studio': ['Acorn Media']}\nFor some reason I don't quite understand, Brit thrillers are really gory and brutal -- the bad guys like to really hurt and damage people ... especially young women.  (I'm trying not to draw broad conclusions from this.)  To me that's just a kind of porn, I don't see how it adds entertainment value to a crime drama.<br /><br />Anyway, the acting and real-world feel of this series is just excellent.  Kelly Reilly does a great job of being the bright young constable who isn't always sure of herself, and the other principal characters are very believable.  However, the plots are relatively weak (maybe that's why the gore is needed, to heighten the drama?), and the finish doesn't quite live up to the promise.<br /><br />Just not compelling enough for my tastes, but again, the actors make it worth watching if you have nothing better to do.\nmeh (not wonderful, but not terrible, either)\n{'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Wolfgang Petersen'], 'Producers': ['Dieter Geissler', 'Bernd Eichinger'], 'Starring': ['Alan Oppenheimer', 'Noah Hathaway', 'Barret Oliver']}\nDumb story, poorly directed and acted, there was really nothing to redeem this horror.  I can't believe it got so many good ratings from so many viewers.  I feel I need to erase my memory, it was so bad.\nreally dumb and poorly done\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Robert Lorenz'], 'Producers': ['Tim Moore', 'Clint Eastwood', 'Michele Weisler'], 'Starring': ['Clint Eastwood', 'Amy Adams', 'Justin Timberlake']}\nWell crafted, well acted, nice mellow story.  A very enjoyable movie.  The plot is along familiar lines, but very well done, despite the somewhat fairy tale ending (all the bad people get their comeuppance, the good people triumph).  Amy Adams and Eastwood are super as a father-daughter pair trying to connect, and the supporting cast is terrific.\nA very enjoyable mellow movie (good date movie, perhaps)\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['David Hare'], 'Producers': ['David Heyman'], 'Starring': ['Ralph Fiennes', 'Rachel Weisz', 'Bill Nighy'], 'Studio': ['Warner Bros.']}\nVery well-made in a typically Brit style, but the story is stupid and shallow, there's not much to hold your attention.  (Unless you're a big fan of the fashionably lefty entertainment crowd's view of the world with the US and Israel as evil partners; I'm not.)  If you want a good Brit-style spy thriller, it would be much better to watch Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (either version).  Heck, I'd rather watch that for the 7th time than waste time on this one.\ndumb shallow story, a waste of some good actors\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Alfred Hitchcock'], 'Producers': ['Alfred Hitchcock'], 'Starring': ['James Stewart', 'Doris Day', 'Brenda de Banzie'], 'Studio': ['Universal City Studios Product']}\nI remembered seeing this some decades ago, when I was quite young, and only vaguely remembered the story, with some scenes rather vivid in my memory.
