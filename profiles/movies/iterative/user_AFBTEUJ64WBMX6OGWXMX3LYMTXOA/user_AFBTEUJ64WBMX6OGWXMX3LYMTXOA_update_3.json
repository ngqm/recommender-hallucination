The acting is superb, the stories are compelling, and the whole thing just reeks of excellence and attention to detail.<br /><br />I've been a fan of the Holmes stories since I was a little boy, having read all of them multiple times, and have watched the various film versions over the years.  I've enjoyed some of them:  I'm not a big fan of the Basil Rathbone versions, and I quite disliked the Guy Ritchie/Robert Downey versions. I think that the recent re-imagining done in this series and in the British series (by Gatiss/Moffat, with Benedict Cumberbatch & Martin Freeman) are excellent, and hugely enjoyable if you're not offended by the variation from the canonical texts.\nReview Title: Very good revised version of Holmes & Watson\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I recently saw it with my 11 year old son, and he just loved it; this boy normally won't watch westerns.  It's that good.<br /><br />John Wayne, Dean Martin, Walter Brennan all do a great job.  Even Rick Nelson, not someone you'd expect to see in a western, does a solid job.  Angie Dickinson is very likable.  It all hangs together, and doesn't work too hard at it; just goes down nice and easy.  (Ok, I mixed my metaphors, but you get the drift.)<br /><br />What can I say, I love this movie!  If you like the classic ones, buy it, it's worth every penny.\nif you like the classic westerns, this is a must-see, must-own\nDistrict B13/District 13: Ultimatum 2-Pack\nCyril Raffaelli  (Actor),     David Belle  (Actor),     Patrick Alessandrin  (Director),     Pierre Morel  (Director)    &                   1                  more   Rated:    R    Format: Blu-ray\nMovies & TV, Blu-ray, Movies\n[\"Includes: District B13 Paris, 2010. An isolation wall surrounds the ghetto cities of District B13. Within these walls, without effective law enforcement, gang rule is absolute. Damien is a member of an elite police squadron, highly trained in martial arts. He goes undercover to infiltrate a gang in order to defuse a neutron bomb and save District B13 from annihilation. Damien recruits the help of a criminal named Leito - whose only goal is to save his sister from the clutches of the same gang. District 13: Ultimatum Two years have passed since elite police officer Damien Tomasso (Cyril Raffaelli) teamed up with reformed vigilante Leito (David Belle) to save the notorious District 13, a racially charged ghetto populated by violent drug dealing gangs and vicious killers. Despite government promises to maintain order, the state of the district has deteriorated and is causing civil unrest. A group of corrupt cops and elected officials conspire to cash in on the redevelopment of the district by proposing it's destruction under the nuclear air strike. Damien and Leito must join forces again, using their martial arts and unique physical skills, to bring peace to the neighborhood by any means necessary.\"]\n{'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 6.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'MGNO10299BR', 'Director': 'Patrick Alessandrin, Pierre Morel', 'Media Format': 'Blu-ray', 'Run time': '3 hours and 5 minutes', 'Release date': 'April 27, 2010', 'Actors': 'Cyril Raffaelli, David Belle, Philippe Torreton, Daniel Duval, Elodie Yung', 'Dubbed': 'English', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish', 'Studio': 'Magnolia Home Ent', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '2'}\nYes, I do mean that: these are among the best action movies ever made -- but I'll qualify by adding \"which involve humans doing athletic things\", such as martial arts movies.  (I like the other kinds too, BTW.)<br /><br />But if you enjoy watching incredibly gifted athletes doing great stunts done in a very believable way, and don't mind preposterous plots, then these movies might tickle your fancy.  Just being able to watch David Belle (said to be the founder of parkour/parcour) is worth the price in my opinion.<br /><br />So remember, don't expect any Profound Commentary on the Human Condition (thank goodness).  Don't get too hung up on the silliness or the stereotypes, that's part of the fun.  Just relax and enjoy great escapist fun with a good companion or two.\nsilly plots, but among the best action movies ever made\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Guy Ferland', 'Christine Moore', 'John Polson', 'Ron Fortunato', 'Seith Mann', 'Jerry Levine', 'Larry Teng', 'Lucy Liu', 'Aaron Lipstadt', 'Andrew Bernstein'], 'Studio': ['CBS']}\nIf you're a fan of the Sherlock Holmes stories, and don't object to a well-done transformation of the theme, then you are likely to really enjoy this series.
