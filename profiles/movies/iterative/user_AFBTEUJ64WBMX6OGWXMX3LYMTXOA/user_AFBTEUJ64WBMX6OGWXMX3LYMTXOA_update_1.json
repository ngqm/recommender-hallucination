I recently saw it with my 11 year old son, and he just loved it; this boy normally won't watch westerns.  It's that good.<br /><br />John Wayne, Dean Martin, Walter Brennan all do a great job.  Even Rick Nelson, not someone you'd expect to see in a western, does a solid job.  Angie Dickinson is very likable.  It all hangs together, and doesn't work too hard at it; just goes down nice and easy.  (Ok, I mixed my metaphors, but you get the drift.)<br /><br />What can I say, I love this movie!  If you like the classic ones, buy it, it's worth every penny.\nReview Title: if you like the classic westerns, this is a must-see, must-own\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
