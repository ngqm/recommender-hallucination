I am \"mainstream\" LDS. It is against our beliefs to live this type of life because it is against the law. BUT, I have such respect for the Brown family and all that they stand for. They are true to the faith. I could never condemn or otherwise harrass these beautiful people. I believe in religious freedom and think the government needs to stay out of these peoples lives. They have wonderful relationships though they do have dissagreements as would any family. Those children are soooo loved and they know it. Cody is a great Dad and husband and if only more men were like him, what a better world this would be. Each and every one of these wives are amazing, kind and loving individuals. They just want peace for their family. God bless you Brown family and hang in there. I believe there will come a time when you will be allowed to practice your religion with no fear.<br /><br />I relate your situation to the persecution of the first LDS people in the early days of the restoration of the gospel. I would love to meet you one day as I'm sure I would grow as a person, just from being in the presence of each and everyone of your delightful spirits.  Hugs and love from an LDS woman.\nAmazing way of life....in a good way\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Tim Gibbons', 'Gen\u00e9a Gaudet', 'Adam Hirsch'], 'Producers': ['Tim Gibbons', 'Christopher Poole', 'Bill Hayes', 'Jen Stocks', 'Kirk Streb', 'Mary Wilcher', 'Maggie Kay', 'Deanie Wilcher'], 'Studio': ['TLC']}\nI am hooked on this darn show.
