The story lines would often suffer as well.  Not so with this series.  It has very nice acting, a great story line, and terrific special effects for the dome.  I hope this continues to be the case in season 2.\nAbove average Stephen King  :o)\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Jeremy Haft'], 'Producers': ['Chris Sievernich', 'Matt Milich', 'Martin J.
