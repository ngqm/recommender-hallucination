Edwards'], 'Starring': ['Mike Vogel', 'Rachelle Lefevre', 'Natalie Martinez'], 'Studio': ['CBS']}\nThis is a series based on Stephen King's story.  King's movies often suffer from mediocre actors.  The story lines would often suffer as well.  Not so with this series.  It has very nice acting, a great story line, and terrific special effects for the dome.  I hope this continues to be the case in season 2.\nAbove average Stephen King  :o)\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Jeremy Haft'], 'Producers': ['Chris Sievernich', 'Matt Milich', 'Martin J. Wiley', 'Danny Fisher'], 'Starring': ['Jenna Dewan', 'Matthew Marsden', 'Chad Faust']}\nHorrible plot, acting, sfx.  Even the &#34;hot&#34; girl wasn't hot.  Wow.\nOne Star\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Scott Mansfield'], 'Starring': ['Robert E. Reynolds', 'Michael Sollazzo'], 'Studio': ['Monterey Media']}\nThe house it was set in was amazing.  The acting was mediocre\nMediocre\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Hal Sutherland'], 'Producers': ['Norm Prescott', 'Lou Scheimer'], 'Studio': ['Classic Media']}\nAll cartoons.  No live cast.  I was hoping this would have the live band performing in each episode.  I wanted to reminisce about those days when I was an 11 year old boy with raging hormones.  I was curious to see if &#34;Betty&#34; and &#34;Veronica&#34; were as hot as I remembered.  But there weren't in the first episode and I couldn't sit thru any more.\nWhere's the live girls I remembered on this show?\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Norberto Barba', \"Terrence O'Hara\", 'Eric Laneuville', 'Aaron Lipstadt', 'Peter Werner', 'David Solomon', 'Steven DePaul', 'John Behring', 'Darnell Martin', 'Karen Gaviola'], 'Starring': ['David Giuntoli', 'Bitsie Tulloch', 'Russell Hornsby'], 'Studio': ['NBC']}\nI stopped watching it.  It had good acting and interesting story lines, but I'm turning away from the dark side of TV.  Demonic stuff is starting to conflict with what my God warns about in the Bible.  Not preaching, just explaining why I chose to stop watching it.\nNot my cup of tea anymore.\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Elias', 'Tomas Almgren', 'Brian Barnes', 'Brian Bernhard', 'Chvad SB', 'Grady Granros', 'Ashley Thorpe', 'Simon Ruben', 'Jane Rose'], 'Producers': ['Elias', 'Tomas Almgren', 'Rebecca Finley', 'Marissa Goldstein', 'Grady Granros', 'Dunstan Kornicki', 'Ean Murphy', 'Hanne Nordhagen', 'Joe Renz'], 'Starring': ['Elias', 'Lloyd Kaufman', 'Nick Basile'], 'Studio': ['Indie Rights']}\nI used to be big into the scary stuff and Lovecraft was a groundbreaking writer that gave me nightmares.  The movie had a tongue-in-cheek narrator trying to weave these short stories together.\nI didn't make it past the first short story\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Jack Bender', 'Peter Leto', 'David Barrett', 'Sergio Mimica-Gezzan', 'Kari Skogland', 'Eriq La Salle', 'Edward Ornelas', 'Peter Weller', 'Roxann Dawson', 'Paul A. Edwards'], 'Starring': ['Mike Vogel', 'Rachelle Lefevre', 'Alexander Koch'], 'Studio': ['CBS']}\nExcellent storylines, characters, and special effects.  Can't wait to see Season 3.  FYI:  I'm not a full-on fan that loves everything his done.  So this is a more balanced review.  I AM a fan of several of his books.  I read all his early novels as soon as they came out.  That ended in the late 80's.  I'm more selective now.  It's the same with his movie and TV productions.  They can really be hit and miss.  I think most scifi fans will enjoy this series.\nSurprisingly good for a Stephen King adaptation!\n{'Audio languages': ['Svenska'], 'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Daniel Alfredson'], 'Producers': ['Soren Staermose'], 'Starring': ['Noomi Rapace', 'Michael Nyqvist', 'Lena Endre'], 'Studio': ['Music Box Films']}\nEnglish subtitles are a turn-off for me.  But the excellent story and characters made the movie so engaging that I wasn't distracted by the fact that I was reading subtitles.  In fact, I watched the extended versions of all 3 of &#34;The Girl...&#34; movies.  Oh yeah.  There's some a bit of crude language.\nBut the excellent story and characters made the movie so engaging that ...\n{'Audio languages': ['Davvis\u00e1megiella'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Daniel Alfredson'], 'Producers': ['Soren Staermose'], 'Starring': ['Noomi Rapace', 'Michael Nyqvist', 'Lena Endre'], 'Studio': ['Music Box Films']}\nEnglish subtitles are a turn-off for me.
