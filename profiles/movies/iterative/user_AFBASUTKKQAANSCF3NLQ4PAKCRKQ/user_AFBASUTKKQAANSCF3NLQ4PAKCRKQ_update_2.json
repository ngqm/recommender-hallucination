King's movies often suffer from mediocre actors.  The story lines would often suffer as well.  Not so with this series.  It has very nice acting, a great story line, and terrific special effects for the dome.  I hope this continues to be the case in season 2.\nReview Title: Above average Stephen King  :o)\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
