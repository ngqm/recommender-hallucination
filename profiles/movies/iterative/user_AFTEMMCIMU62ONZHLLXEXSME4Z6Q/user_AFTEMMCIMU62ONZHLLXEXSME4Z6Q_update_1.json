They cover fraction terms, common factors, and reducing fractions. Everything you need to start working with fractions!']\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'MPAA rating': 'Unrated (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.5 x 0.5 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Media Format': 'NTSC, Multiple Formats, Color', 'Run time': '7 minutes', 'Release date': 'July 15, 2004', 'Actors': 'Standard Deviants School', 'Studio': 'Cerebellum Corp', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: Well, I had heard that the Standard Deviants items had changed a lot after being purchased by<br />a new company.  This is apparently very true!<br /><br />NEVER, NEVER, NEVER pay the full price for one of these DVD's. By that, I mean if you pay over $10<br />total, you'll feel a little ripped off.<br /><br />Apparently, what the new owners have done is take their basic instruction and break it down into<br />infinitesimal sections in order to sell more DVD's.  If you think this will give your child a good<br />overview of fractions, you will be disappointed.<br /><br />The DVD itself was fine.  Mine had little lines across the bottom, but I suspect that might have been<br />because this was for a regular screen and I have a widescreen, but not sure.<br /><br />What is un-be-freakin-lievable is that this DVD is only SEVEN MINUTES long!  Yup - infomercials are longer.<br />What this DOES do is introduce the CONCEPT of fractions. It explains what a fraction is, what numerators<br />and denominators are, how to get a common denominator (but that isn't explained well, IMHO. As an adult, it was<br />easy, but if a kid was watching this, I am not so sure they would really get it). It also explained equivalent<br />fractions (as in, why 1/3, 2/6 and 4/12 are all basically the same fraction of 1/3). It shows via pie charts<br />which might help a child visualize hat they are talking about with a fraction.<br /><br />But, that is where the instruction ends. Abruptly.<br />It does not show how to multiply fractions, which was the \"fraction basic\" info that I was hoping for<br />when I purchased this DVD.<br /><br />All in all, this was disappointing. I'd bought 3 SD Math Basic DVD's, and really wasn't looking at the length.<br />NONE of the newer DVD's run very long, and are apparently broken into so many sub-sets of information that you'll<br />end up having to buy a lot of their DVD's (and they hope spending a lot of money) to get all the basic information.<br />This shows a real greedy side to the company, in my opinion. Just make a DVD about fractions, period.<br />Don't make me buy 2 or 3 of the DVD's to get good fraction information for a child who is having a rough<br />time with the fraction concept.<br /><br />This is better than nothing, but that's all. You could make your own pie charts at home just as effectively,<br />or use cookies laid out in a clock format, etc, something that kids can relate to. The only benefit to this short<br />DVD is that the kid can watch it any time s/he wants to without your being involved.<br />Don't pay full price for these, because it definitely isn't worth it.\nReview Title: Great for what it is...\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
