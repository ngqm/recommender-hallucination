I am hypothyroid, and basically have had to learn everything I could medically to try to help myself, because doctors seem to blow off questions about thyroid function. I'm overweight, and have been told some of the most unbelievable whopper stories from doctors you would ever believe. I had one actually tell me that I just had &#34;elbow disease&#34;, saying my elbow bent to my mouth too often. Um, no.  My tiny mother in law could eat more food than I could hold in two days and still stay tiny. There were obviously other factors in play here, but no one ever had any real answers - just the standard &#34;eat better&#34; and &#34;exercise more&#34;.<br /><br />I also went on a low fat diet for about six months, and gained steadily the entire time, despite eating sparse plates of food, things like yogurt and grapes for lunches, etc. My dr blamed me, saying I HAD to be eating more than that. I wasn't! But heaven forbid we look deeper than the surface! And when I told him that I didn't feel good when I ate fruit, I was told that was complete nonsense, and that I was making things up just to go off my &#34;diet&#34;. To this day, fruit gives me a sugar rush that is very unpleasant!  I also don't like pies or cakes, but that's just me - I never liked them. But wave a cookie under my nose, and you have my attention!<br /><br />I also made changes myself simply because there was zero logic behind some of the &#34;medical breakthroughs&#34;, like not eating eggs and making an enemy out of butter. I just could not see how butter, made from all natural ingredients from a cow, could possibly be worse than the chemical cocktails whipped up, dyed yellow and sold as butter flavored margarine!  No freaking way. So, we ignored the medical release hype and ate real butter, eggs, meat (*gasp*), and did away with all low fat or diet drinks. Common sense tells you that if they remove the fat from a food, SOMETHING has to replace it so it doesn't fall apart or taste like cardboard. They DO replace the fat - with sugar!<br /><br />This movie goes WAY below the surface, and gives you a real experience with the world of sugar. We've long known that too much sugar could be bad for you. But other than cavities, WHY avoid it when it tastes so good? (And yes - I know many don't think it tastes good - you are missing the point, so please spare the arguments about bad tasting sweet stuff.)<br /><br />Damon walks us through the rapid and shocking changes our bodies experience when we give it the everyday diet of typical foods off the grocery store shelves. He doesn't eat candy, donuts or cake. He goes on a month long experience of eating what we normally put in our shopping carts under the guise of &#34;healthy&#34; food. Things like fruit juices, yogurts, health bars, chicken with teriyaki sauce, etc etc.<br /><br />Now, I am very aware that many foods load it with sugar to make the chemicals palatable. We became serious label readers after my husband took a year of culinary classes at an area college. That's when we started to realize the lab experiments being sold as food that loaded our grocery shelves.<br /><br />I was STUNNED by the amount of sugars hidden in our everyday foods on the shelf!  Reading labels changed the way we shopped, but we still were not feeling our best. Despite no longer buying some things like (dare I mention brands?) Hamburger Helper or Yoplait yogurt, which has so much sugar, you might as well have ice cream, we felt sluggish most of the time. We cooked more at home, choosing to control more of what we put into our bodies.<br /><br />But we still didn't feel our best. There HAD to be more to this, and while I had been trying to do some of my own research as to WHY my body acted like I was the enemy, and preferred to pack on weight instead of releasing it.<br /><br />Enter this movie.<br />Damon - THANK YOU!!<br /><br />Seeing what is taking place in our livers was a real eye-opener. Yes, we hear about diabetes (either type), triglycerides, cholesterol, etc etc, but the medical community often wants to give you a pill to control the symptoms, instead of explaining what is truly happening and helping you to fix it. After all, medication is highly profitable!<br /><br />I learned a LOT from this movie.  I have watched it twice, and will watch it several more times to get the information ingrained in my brain.<br />Damon is every personable and likeable, and the movie is well done - no yawn-worthy droning documentary-style fact recitation. He interacts with the viewers at every step in a very creative manner.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this film highly enough. I am making everyone in our house watch it at LEAST once, if not more.<br /><br />Our bodies are so adaptable to changes, and it was both a wow factor and encouraging how quickly things went downhill in his health, but also how quickly things went back to normal after returning to the sugar free foods he previously enjoyed.  Now, I don't have Damon's metabolism and mobility, but there are certainly things that I can incorporate into my daily life to begin the reversal of what could truly be called sugar poisoning with being too far off!<br /><br />Again - thank you Damon.<br />You did us all a great service!\nReview Title: A MUST VIEW if you cycle through tired and energized, or experience lethargy that won't leave\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

They cover fraction terms, common factors, and reducing fractions. Everything you need to start working with fractions!']\n{'MPAA rating': 'Unrated (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.5 x 0.5 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Media Format': 'NTSC, Multiple Formats, Color', 'Run time': '7 minutes', 'Release date': 'July 15, 2004', 'Actors': 'Standard Deviants School', 'Studio': 'Cerebellum Corp', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nWell, I had heard that the Standard Deviants items had changed a lot after being purchased by<br />a new company.  This is apparently very true!<br /><br />NEVER, NEVER, NEVER pay the full price for one of these DVD's. By that, I mean if you pay over $10<br />total, you'll feel a little ripped off.<br /><br />Apparently, what the new owners have done is take their basic instruction and break it down into<br />infinitesimal sections in order to sell more DVD's.  If you think this will give your child a good<br />overview of fractions, you will be disappointed.<br /><br />The DVD itself was fine.  Mine had little lines across the bottom, but I suspect that might have been<br />because this was for a regular screen and I have a widescreen, but not sure.<br /><br />What is un-be-freakin-lievable is that this DVD is only SEVEN MINUTES long!  Yup - infomercials are longer.<br />What this DOES do is introduce the CONCEPT of fractions. It explains what a fraction is, what numerators<br />and denominators are, how to get a common denominator (but that isn't explained well, IMHO. As an adult, it was<br />easy, but if a kid was watching this, I am not so sure they would really get it). It also explained equivalent<br />fractions (as in, why 1/3, 2/6 and 4/12 are all basically the same fraction of 1/3). It shows via pie charts<br />which might help a child visualize hat they are talking about with a fraction.<br /><br />But, that is where the instruction ends. Abruptly.<br />It does not show how to multiply fractions, which was the \"fraction basic\" info that I was hoping for<br />when I purchased this DVD.<br /><br />All in all, this was disappointing. I'd bought 3 SD Math Basic DVD's, and really wasn't looking at the length.<br />NONE of the newer DVD's run very long, and are apparently broken into so many sub-sets of information that you'll<br />end up having to buy a lot of their DVD's (and they hope spending a lot of money) to get all the basic information.<br />This shows a real greedy side to the company, in my opinion. Just make a DVD about fractions, period.<br />Don't make me buy 2 or 3 of the DVD's to get good fraction information for a child who is having a rough<br />time with the fraction concept.<br /><br />This is better than nothing, but that's all. You could make your own pie charts at home just as effectively,<br />or use cookies laid out in a clock format, etc, something that kids can relate to. The only benefit to this short<br />DVD is that the kid can watch it any time s/he wants to without your being involved.<br />Don't pay full price for these, because it definitely isn't worth it.\nGreat for what it is...\nValentine's Day\nBradley Cooper  (Actor),     Jennifer Garner  (Actor),     Garry Marshall  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Studio Specials, Warner Home Video, All Titles\n['Product Description', 'The starriest cast you may ever see sparkles in a hilarious and heartwarming romcom from the director of Pretty Woman and The Princess Diaries.

The \"I\\'ll show up and surprise him\" that ended up surprising her. Fights, kisses, wrong turns, right moves and more.

Director Garry Marshall must have called in every favor he had in Hollywood to line up this amazing cast. Much as Robert Altman does in his best films, Marshall follows intertwining and intersecting couples around Los Angeles as they hook up, break up, and act up as Valentine's Day--with all its intense expectations--looms. Bradley Cooper plays one half of a couple struggling to get back on track. Julia Roberts plays an army officer en route from Iraq (!) to visit a lover halfway around the world. Jennifer Garner is appealing as the girlfriend of a cad (Patrick Dempsey), who managed to overlook telling her he was married; will Garner's character go all\", 'Fatal Attraction', \"? Standouts include the always-charming Anne Hathaway, whose character supplements her income with a freelance gig that, shall we say, involves using multiple accents over the phone--much to the consternation of her beau, played by Topher Grace. Shirley MacLaine and Hector Elizondo play a long-married couple whose strong marriage may be rocked by an old and very inconvenient truth. And young stars Emma Roberts, Taylor Lautner, and Taylor Swift sparkle enough to draw in younger viewers. And if love doesn't always go as planned for these couples (and singles), it's Marshall's deftness as a director that keeps the scenes moving along crisply to the next lovers, or victims. Marshall seems to be aiming to achieve for Valentine's Day what Richard Curtis did for Christmas in\", 'Love Actually', '--and if he falls a little short, it\\'s not due to any lack of star power or onscreen dazzle. \"Love is the only shocking act left on the planet!\" exclaims Ashton Kutcher\\'s character.

We've been trying out a few of them, and they are fun for movie buffs or anyone interested in the behind-the-scenes information.<br /><br />The only thing that didn't make much sense about it was that we bought a brand new DVD, but the Infinifilm part refers to something being on &#34;Disc 2&#34;.  There was only ONE disc in the package. So, not sure what the scoop is on that one.<br /><br />I believe this is a fun addition to everyone's holiday viewing movie collection.  Good old fashioned holiday fun.<br />No worries about those who do not like the religious aspect - there is nothing mentioned in here on that one.<br />And the nice part about owning the movie is that you get to see the entire thing, instead of whatever scenes the tv stations have decided to show you. We have seen this movie several times on tv over the last few years, but with the DVD, we've seen quite a few smaller scenes that were never included in the tv versions.  (And one of my favorite parts that we've used at our house is the big cola belch, followed by &#34;did you hear that?&#34;  Haha!<br /><br />Fun for the family, nothing dirty, no visible nudity, just holiday entertainment.\nTwo thumbs up for a really fun holiday movie\nThat Sugar Film\nInternational, Documentary, Cerebral, Contemplative\n['Damon Gameau embarks on an experiment to document the effects of a high sugar diet on a healthy body.']\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Samuel Goldwyn Films'], 'Producers': ['Samuel Goldwyn Films'], 'Starring': ['Damon Gameau']}\nIt doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that the better you can eat, the better you will feel.<br />Of course, broccoli is better for you than donuts, but ... donuts!<br />But sometimes, we need to know WHY, instead of just being told to put something down.<br /><br />I know a lot about nutrition and a lot about body processes. I am hypothyroid, and basically have had to learn everything I could medically to try to help myself, because doctors seem to blow off questions about thyroid function. I'm overweight, and have been told some of the most unbelievable whopper stories from doctors you would ever believe. I had one actually tell me that I just had &#34;elbow disease&#34;, saying my elbow bent to my mouth too often. Um, no.  My tiny mother in law could eat more food than I could hold in two days and still stay tiny. There were obviously other factors in play here, but no one ever had any real answers - just the standard &#34;eat better&#34; and &#34;exercise more&#34;.<br /><br />I also went on a low fat diet for about six months, and gained steadily the entire time, despite eating sparse plates of food, things like yogurt and grapes for lunches, etc. My dr blamed me, saying I HAD to be eating more than that. I wasn't! But heaven forbid we look deeper than the surface! And when I told him that I didn't feel good when I ate fruit, I was told that was complete nonsense, and that I was making things up just to go off my &#34;diet&#34;. To this day, fruit gives me a sugar rush that is very unpleasant!  I also don't like pies or cakes, but that's just me - I never liked them. But wave a cookie under my nose, and you have my attention!<br /><br />I also made changes myself simply because there was zero logic behind some of the &#34;medical breakthroughs&#34;, like not eating eggs and making an enemy out of butter. I just could not see how butter, made from all natural ingredients from a cow, could possibly be worse than the chemical cocktails whipped up, dyed yellow and sold as butter flavored margarine!  No freaking way. So, we ignored the medical release hype and ate real butter, eggs, meat (*gasp*), and did away with all low fat or diet drinks. Common sense tells you that if they remove the fat from a food, SOMETHING has to replace it so it doesn't fall apart or taste like cardboard. They DO replace the fat - with sugar!<br /><br />This movie goes WAY below the surface, and gives you a real experience with the world of sugar. We've long known that too much sugar could be bad for you. But other than cavities, WHY avoid it when it tastes so good? (And yes - I know many don't think it tastes good - you are missing the point, so please spare the arguments about bad tasting sweet stuff.)<br /><br />Damon walks us through the rapid and shocking changes our bodies experience when we give it the everyday diet of typical foods off the grocery store shelves. He doesn't eat candy, donuts or cake. He goes on a month long experience of eating what we normally put in our shopping carts under the guise of &#34;healthy&#34; food. Things like fruit juices, yogurts, health bars, chicken with teriyaki sauce, etc etc.<br /><br />Now, I am very aware that many foods load it with sugar to make the chemicals palatable. We became serious label readers after my husband took a year of culinary classes at an area college. That's when we started to realize the lab experiments being sold as food that loaded our grocery shelves.<br /><br />I was STUNNED by the amount of sugars hidden in our everyday foods on the shelf!  Reading labels changed the way we shopped, but we still were not feeling our best. Despite no longer buying some things like (dare I mention brands?) Hamburger Helper or Yoplait yogurt, which has so much sugar, you might as well have ice cream, we felt sluggish most of the time. We cooked more at home, choosing to control more of what we put into our bodies.<br /><br />But we still didn't feel our best. There HAD to be more to this, and while I had been trying to do some of my own research as to WHY my body acted like I was the enemy, and preferred to pack on weight instead of releasing it.<br /><br />Enter this movie.<br />Damon - THANK YOU!!<br /><br />Seeing what is taking place in our livers was a real eye-opener. Yes, we hear about diabetes (either type), triglycerides, cholesterol, etc etc, but the medical community often wants to give you a pill to control the symptoms, instead of explaining what is truly happening and helping you to fix it. After all, medication is highly profitable!<br /><br />I learned a LOT from this movie.  I have watched it twice, and will watch it several more times to get the information ingrained in my brain.<br />Damon is every personable and likeable, and the movie is well done - no yawn-worthy droning documentary-style fact recitation. He interacts with the viewers at every step in a very creative manner.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this film highly enough. I am making everyone in our house watch it at LEAST once, if not more.<br /><br />Our bodies are so adaptable to changes, and it was both a wow factor and encouraging how quickly things went downhill in his health, but also how quickly things went back to normal after returning to the sugar free foods he previously enjoyed.  Now, I don't have Damon's metabolism and mobility, but there are certainly things that I can incorporate into my daily life to begin the reversal of what could truly be called sugar poisoning with being too far off!<br /><br />Again - thank you Damon.<br />You did us all a great service!\nA MUST VIEW if you cycle through tired and energized, or experience lethargy that won't leave",
