The Magic Pill follows doctors, patients, scientists, chefs, farmers and journalists from around the globe who are combating illness through a paradigm shift in eating. And this simple change - embracing fat as our main fuel - is showing profound promise in improving the health of people, animals and the planet.']\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Rob Tate'], 'Producers': ['Pete Evans', 'Rob Tate', 'Colin Gara'], 'Starring': ['Pete Evans', 'Rob Tate', 'Nora Gedgaudas']}\nReview Text: Along with many, many, many people, we faithfully followed the AHA guideline diet, and low fat in everything.<br />What a bamboozle!<br /><br />What we ended up with was extra weight, and after YEARS of cutting out good foods to replace with low fat junk, we ended up with Type 2 diabetes as well. My husband was given medication to help his levels, and I was told I should try dietary first, and if it didn't change, then I'd be put on medication. (My dr tried to put me on insulin for Type 2, which I refused - there wasn't even a trial dietary change period before he wanted to do this. Nope!)<br /><br />So, both my husband and I did our research and chose to try a low carbohydrate high fat diet (LCHF).<br />What a change!<br /><br />We have both improved our bloodwork, not taking any diabetes medication and have lost weight.<br />My husband feels better than he has in years.<br /><br />The facts are that the AHA diet CREATES customers, not health.<br /><br />This documentary helps to explain what is going on in our bodies and why we NEED good fats in our diet. Our brains use fats to work every day (the low fat nonsense could explain why so much &#34;stoopit&#34; abounds these days!), and how we have been starving ourselves. This shows how we really do not need grains in our diet at all. Doctors encourage a bad diet (via the AHA) then prescribe pills to \"help\" when the AHA diet makes you feel even worse.<br /><br />While The film is a little slow at times, the information is a must-see for anyone dealing with blood glucose issues or metabolic syndrome.<br /><br />I also HIGHLY recommend viewing That Sugar Film [[ASIN:B010I4O6ZW That Sugar Film]], which FINALLY explains  clearly what our doctors have never been able to explain (how to lower triglycerides without medication, WHY triglycerides get high to begin with, and for myself, how I went from being hypoglycemic  for decades to suddenly flipping to the other side of that coin, Type 2 diabetic).  Since changing to LCHF diet, I have lost over 60 lbs without once counting a calorie.<br />But I DO read every label!<br /><br />It is past time to educate ourselves about HOW our bodies truly use what we eat, and most importantly, to READ THE LABELS on our foods.<br />It is amazing the pure garbage and massive amount of chemicals that the FDA allows food manufacturers to put into our foods.  Amazing, and disgusting. But the pharmaceutical industry is highly profitable, so they don't mind making more customers!<br /> :-(<br /><br />Please watch this one and &#34;That Sugar Film&#34;. If you struggle with your weight (excess), high blood sugar or been told you have metabolic syndrome, these two films will change your life. Literally.\nReview Title: You owe it to yourself to watch this if you take medication for diabetes or high cholesterol\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

They cover fraction terms, common factors, and reducing fractions. Everything you need to start working with fractions!']\n{'MPAA rating': 'Unrated (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.5 x 0.5 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Media Format': 'NTSC, Multiple Formats, Color', 'Run time': '7 minutes', 'Release date': 'July 15, 2004', 'Actors': 'Standard Deviants School', 'Studio': 'Cerebellum Corp', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nWell, I had heard that the Standard Deviants items had changed a lot after being purchased by<br />a new company.  This is apparently very true!<br /><br />NEVER, NEVER, NEVER pay the full price for one of these DVD's. By that, I mean if you pay over $10<br />total, you'll feel a little ripped off.<br /><br />Apparently, what the new owners have done is take their basic instruction and break it down into<br />infinitesimal sections in order to sell more DVD's.  If you think this will give your child a good<br />overview of fractions, you will be disappointed.<br /><br />The DVD itself was fine.  Mine had little lines across the bottom, but I suspect that might have been<br />because this was for a regular screen and I have a widescreen, but not sure.<br /><br />What is un-be-freakin-lievable is that this DVD is only SEVEN MINUTES long!  Yup - infomercials are longer.<br />What this DOES do is introduce the CONCEPT of fractions. It explains what a fraction is, what numerators<br />and denominators are, how to get a common denominator (but that isn't explained well, IMHO. As an adult, it was<br />easy, but if a kid was watching this, I am not so sure they would really get it). It also explained equivalent<br />fractions (as in, why 1/3, 2/6 and 4/12 are all basically the same fraction of 1/3). It shows via pie charts<br />which might help a child visualize hat they are talking about with a fraction.<br /><br />But, that is where the instruction ends. Abruptly.<br />It does not show how to multiply fractions, which was the \"fraction basic\" info that I was hoping for<br />when I purchased this DVD.<br /><br />All in all, this was disappointing. I'd bought 3 SD Math Basic DVD's, and really wasn't looking at the length.<br />NONE of the newer DVD's run very long, and are apparently broken into so many sub-sets of information that you'll<br />end up having to buy a lot of their DVD's (and they hope spending a lot of money) to get all the basic information.<br />This shows a real greedy side to the company, in my opinion. Just make a DVD about fractions, period.<br />Don't make me buy 2 or 3 of the DVD's to get good fraction information for a child who is having a rough<br />time with the fraction concept.<br /><br />This is better than nothing, but that's all. You could make your own pie charts at home just as effectively,<br />or use cookies laid out in a clock format, etc, something that kids can relate to. The only benefit to this short<br />DVD is that the kid can watch it any time s/he wants to without your being involved.<br />Don't pay full price for these, because it definitely isn't worth it.\nGreat for what it is...\nValentine's Day\nBradley Cooper  (Actor),     Jennifer Garner  (Actor),     Garry Marshall  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Studio Specials, Warner Home Video, All Titles\n['Product Description', 'The starriest cast you may ever see sparkles in a hilarious and heartwarming romcom from the director of Pretty Woman and The Princess Diaries. Stories crisscross, collide and boomerang in this look at a day in the life of love. There\\'s a proposal. Flowers that didn\\'t get sent. A big fat secret that\\'s finally told. The \"I\\'ll show up and surprise him\" that ended up surprising her. Fights, kisses, wrong turns, right moves and more. Whether new to or through with love, you\\'ll fall in love with this 19-star, funny-side-up celebration of romance.', 'Amazon.com', \"For those in love with love--and even for those who think they're jaded and over it--\", \"Valentine's Day\", \"and its superb cast are the uplifting elixir that's called for. Director Garry Marshall must have called in every favor he had in Hollywood to line up this amazing cast. Much as Robert Altman does in his best films, Marshall follows intertwining and intersecting couples around Los Angeles as they hook up, break up, and act up as Valentine's Day--with all its intense expectations--looms. Bradley Cooper plays one half of a couple struggling to get back on track. Julia Roberts plays an army officer en route from Iraq (!) to visit a lover halfway around the world. Jennifer Garner is appealing as the girlfriend of a cad (Patrick Dempsey), who managed to overlook telling her he was married; will Garner's character go all\", 'Fatal Attraction', \"? Standouts include the always-charming Anne Hathaway, whose character supplements her income with a freelance gig that, shall we say, involves using multiple accents over the phone--much to the consternation of her beau, played by Topher Grace. Shirley MacLaine and Hector Elizondo play a long-married couple whose strong marriage may be rocked by an old and very inconvenient truth. And young stars Emma Roberts, Taylor Lautner, and Taylor Swift sparkle enough to draw in younger viewers. And if love doesn't always go as planned for these couples (and singles), it's Marshall's deftness as a director that keeps the scenes moving along crisply to the next lovers, or victims. Marshall seems to be aiming to achieve for Valentine's Day what Richard Curtis did for Christmas in\", 'Love Actually', '--and if he falls a little short, it\\'s not due to any lack of star power or onscreen dazzle. \"Love is the only shocking act left on the planet!\" exclaims Ashton Kutcher\\'s character.

There were obviously other factors in play here, but no one ever had any real answers - just the standard &#34;eat better&#34; and &#34;exercise more&#34;.<br /><br />I also went on a low fat diet for about six months, and gained steadily the entire time, despite eating sparse plates of food, things like yogurt and grapes for lunches, etc. My dr blamed me, saying I HAD to be eating more than that. I wasn't! But heaven forbid we look deeper than the surface! And when I told him that I didn't feel good when I ate fruit, I was told that was complete nonsense, and that I was making things up just to go off my &#34;diet&#34;. To this day, fruit gives me a sugar rush that is very unpleasant!  I also don't like pies or cakes, but that's just me - I never liked them. But wave a cookie under my nose, and you have my attention!<br /><br />I also made changes myself simply because there was zero logic behind some of the &#34;medical breakthroughs&#34;, like not eating eggs and making an enemy out of butter. I just could not see how butter, made from all natural ingredients from a cow, could possibly be worse than the chemical cocktails whipped up, dyed yellow and sold as butter flavored margarine!  No freaking way. So, we ignored the medical release hype and ate real butter, eggs, meat (*gasp*), and did away with all low fat or diet drinks. Common sense tells you that if they remove the fat from a food, SOMETHING has to replace it so it doesn't fall apart or taste like cardboard. They DO replace the fat - with sugar!<br /><br />This movie goes WAY below the surface, and gives you a real experience with the world of sugar. We've long known that too much sugar could be bad for you. But other than cavities, WHY avoid it when it tastes so good? (And yes - I know many don't think it tastes good - you are missing the point, so please spare the arguments about bad tasting sweet stuff.)<br /><br />Damon walks us through the rapid and shocking changes our bodies experience when we give it the everyday diet of typical foods off the grocery store shelves. He doesn't eat candy, donuts or cake. He goes on a month long experience of eating what we normally put in our shopping carts under the guise of &#34;healthy&#34; food. Things like fruit juices, yogurts, health bars, chicken with teriyaki sauce, etc etc.<br /><br />Now, I am very aware that many foods load it with sugar to make the chemicals palatable. We became serious label readers after my husband took a year of culinary classes at an area college. That's when we started to realize the lab experiments being sold as food that loaded our grocery shelves.<br /><br />I was STUNNED by the amount of sugars hidden in our everyday foods on the shelf!  Reading labels changed the way we shopped, but we still were not feeling our best. Despite no longer buying some things like (dare I mention brands?) Hamburger Helper or Yoplait yogurt, which has so much sugar, you might as well have ice cream, we felt sluggish most of the time. We cooked more at home, choosing to control more of what we put into our bodies.<br /><br />But we still didn't feel our best. There HAD to be more to this, and while I had been trying to do some of my own research as to WHY my body acted like I was the enemy, and preferred to pack on weight instead of releasing it.<br /><br />Enter this movie.<br />Damon - THANK YOU!!<br /><br />Seeing what is taking place in our livers was a real eye-opener. Yes, we hear about diabetes (either type), triglycerides, cholesterol, etc etc, but the medical community often wants to give you a pill to control the symptoms, instead of explaining what is truly happening and helping you to fix it. After all, medication is highly profitable!<br /><br />I learned a LOT from this movie.  I have watched it twice, and will watch it several more times to get the information ingrained in my brain.<br />Damon is every personable and likeable, and the movie is well done - no yawn-worthy droning documentary-style fact recitation. He interacts with the viewers at every step in a very creative manner.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this film highly enough. I am making everyone in our house watch it at LEAST once, if not more.<br /><br />Our bodies are so adaptable to changes, and it was both a wow factor and encouraging how quickly things went downhill in his health, but also how quickly things went back to normal after returning to the sugar free foods he previously enjoyed.  Now, I don't have Damon's metabolism and mobility, but there are certainly things that I can incorporate into my daily life to begin the reversal of what could truly be called sugar poisoning with being too far off!<br /><br />Again - thank you Damon.<br />You did us all a great service!\nA MUST VIEW if you cycle through tired and energized, or experience lethargy that won't leave\nThe Perfect Holiday\nMorris Chestnut  (Actor),     Gabrielle Union  (Actor),     Lance Rivera  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Studio Specials, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, All Sony Pictures Titles\n[\"Laughter, love and a just a hint of magic make for THE PERFECT HOLIDAY a fun-filled comedy romance starring Morris Chestnut, Gabrielle Union, Charlie Murphy, Katt Williams, Faizon Love, Terrence Howard and Queen Latifah.

(Yeah, not obsessive at all.)<br />This was just not as good as the first.  Somehow, people think Rebel Wilson is hilarious. We don't. There's too much of her,<br />not enough of the other girls. It felt very out of balance, much like some editor who had seen the parts for the 300th time decided certain parts of the story could easily be cut out. However, it left gaps in the storyline where we would have liked to have seen more, and way too much of things that were not necessary. (How did Boomer end up in the old man's a capella group that he used to make fun of?).<br /><br />Overall, worth watching once, but we won't be buying this one like we did the first PP.  Nowhere near the quality of the first one.\nThey couldn't quite make it to the level of PP1.

The previews looked adorable.<br />Glad we rented it first - the previews were almost all of the movie!<br /><br />Cute animation, cute characters, lazy script.  They could have done so much more with these characters.<br />As it is, this isn't one of those movies your family needs to own unless you have little ones (think elementary school), who will likely enjoy it a lot.<br />The jokes are mostly tired or clich\u00e9.  So basically, they invented new characters and spent their time and effort on animation, instead of a clever or funny storyline. I actually found myself dozing a couple times.  It was a yawn-fest for the most part.<br /><br />Since there will be others reading this who don't want to know the entire movie, I won't post spoilers. Wait - not much of any spoilers to provide!<br />If you've seen the various ads, like the cat kicking the food dish, the dog kicking a vase and papers off the table, and the bunny chewing a key, you've seen most of the funny parts of the movie. The only really good part of the movie is how two of the dogs who started out resenting each other learned to get along and like each other.<br /><br />So, unless you have little ones in your house, there's no real point in owning this one first. But that's my opinion and review. If you just like watching animated critters, you might want to own it. But take my advice and rent it first, then decide. Zero regrets on the rental, because it saved us an additional $14 to own the movie!<br />Seriously, the writers were lazy lazy lazy on this movie that could have been so much more!\n*yawwwwwnnnnnn*  WAKE UP!

I am a HUGE Doctor Who fan.<br />I came in on Doctor #10 and worked my way backwards while continuing to watch the current ones.<br /><br />This season is the WORST I've ever seen.<br />Nothing creative and new. No exciting monsters.  The closest it comes is the &#34;puddle girl&#34;.<br /><br />I watch SciFi for entertainment and Doctor Who has never failed to provide that, until this season.<br />It seems like the writers are on vacation, so the social media people wrote the series. Tiresome to have<br />the current agendas and &#34;hot topics&#34; shoved in my face every episode. Not what I tune in for. Much like I don't<br />want to hear any actor/actress telling me how to vote, I don't like Doctor Who trying to push an agenda on<br />me via &#34;Bill&#34;.  Perhaps if the writing had been really good, it would not have been as annoying. But when the<br />character's only focus is her sexual preference, hard pass.<br /><br />The only show this season that reminded me of the older Doctor Who's was the 11th episode.<br />Made me really want to tune in for #12, the season finale.<br />I won't put in any spoilers here for those who have not yet seen it. But I WILL say that there were<br />so many commercials this time, even my husband, a non-Whovian, asked what the heck the deal was<br />on this episode!  Too little story I guess.<br /><br />Overall, will be very glad to see Bill disappear. She brought nothing to the table really. Lots of looking<br />dumbfounded and staring, and plenty of comments about her sexual prefs, like anyone cares. I don't<br />recall any other character being so obsessed with their own selves!  Spare the agendas please!<br /><br />Hoping this year's Christmas episode is good. Crossing my fingers.<br />But if they have this season's writers, well, better buy a lottery ticket instead.\nWhat a lousy season!

And this simple change - embracing fat as our main fuel - is showing profound promise in improving the health of people, animals and the planet.']\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Rob Tate'], 'Producers': ['Pete Evans', 'Rob Tate', 'Colin Gara'], 'Starring': ['Pete Evans', 'Rob Tate', 'Nora Gedgaudas']}\nAlong with many, many, many people, we faithfully followed the AHA guideline diet, and low fat in everything.<br />What a bamboozle!<br /><br />What we ended up with was extra weight, and after YEARS of cutting out good foods to replace with low fat junk, we ended up with Type 2 diabetes as well. My husband was given medication to help his levels, and I was told I should try dietary first, and if it didn't change, then I'd be put on medication. (My dr tried to put me on insulin for Type 2, which I refused - there wasn't even a trial dietary change period before he wanted to do this. Nope!)<br /><br />So, both my husband and I did our research and chose to try a low carbohydrate high fat diet (LCHF).<br />What a change!<br /><br />We have both improved our bloodwork, not taking any diabetes medication and have lost weight.<br />My husband feels better than he has in years.<br /><br />The facts are that the AHA diet CREATES customers, not health.<br /><br />This documentary helps to explain what is going on in our bodies and why we NEED good fats in our diet. Our brains use fats to work every day (the low fat nonsense could explain why so much &#34;stoopit&#34; abounds these days!), and how we have been starving ourselves. This shows how we really do not need grains in our diet at all. Doctors encourage a bad diet (via the AHA) then prescribe pills to \"help\" when the AHA diet makes you feel even worse.<br /><br />While The film is a little slow at times, the information is a must-see for anyone dealing with blood glucose issues or metabolic syndrome.<br /><br />I also HIGHLY recommend viewing That Sugar Film [[ASIN:B010I4O6ZW That Sugar Film]], which FINALLY explains  clearly what our doctors have never been able to explain (how to lower triglycerides without medication, WHY triglycerides get high to begin with, and for myself, how I went from being hypoglycemic  for decades to suddenly flipping to the other side of that coin, Type 2 diabetic).  Since changing to LCHF diet, I have lost over 60 lbs without once counting a calorie.<br />But I DO read every label!<br /><br />It is past time to educate ourselves about HOW our bodies truly use what we eat, and most importantly, to READ THE LABELS on our foods.<br />It is amazing the pure garbage and massive amount of chemicals that the FDA allows food manufacturers to put into our foods.  Amazing, and disgusting. But the pharmaceutical industry is highly profitable, so they don't mind making more customers!<br /> :-(<br /><br />Please watch this one and &#34;That Sugar Film&#34;. If you struggle with your weight (excess), high blood sugar or been told you have metabolic syndrome, these two films will change your life. Literally.\nYou owe it to yourself to watch this if you take medication for diabetes or high cholesterol",
