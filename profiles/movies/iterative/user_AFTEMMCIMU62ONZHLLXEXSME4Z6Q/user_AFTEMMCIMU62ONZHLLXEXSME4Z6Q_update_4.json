Of course, I find it even more entertaining, since we were living in Houston during the whole Enron/Arthur Andersen debacle. If you've ever worked in a cube farm situation for a faceless corporation, then you'll truly relate to and enjoy this movie.<br /><br />I had already seen it many, many times. We bought it because my daughter needed to see it for a class assignment, and no one had it playing.<br />I was surprised to see who was actually playing Milton!  I'll leave that for you to find out.<br /><br />Overall, funny movie, not too raunchy, and a fun way to spend a couple hours trying to not think about your own job.\nReview Title: Definitely worth watching. Completely relatable for all cube farm workers\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Standard Deviants School - Basic Math, Program 7 - Fraction Basics (Classroom Edition)\nStandard Deviants School  (Actor)    Rated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Special Interests\n['The Standard Deviants set the groundwork for learning fractions. They cover fraction terms, common factors, and reducing fractions. Everything you need to start working with fractions!']\n{'MPAA rating': 'Unrated (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.5 x 0.5 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Media Format': 'NTSC, Multiple Formats, Color', 'Run time': '7 minutes', 'Release date': 'July 15, 2004', 'Actors': 'Standard Deviants School', 'Studio': 'Cerebellum Corp', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nWell, I had heard that the Standard Deviants items had changed a lot after being purchased by<br />a new company.  This is apparently very true!<br /><br />NEVER, NEVER, NEVER pay the full price for one of these DVD's. By that, I mean if you pay over $10<br />total, you'll feel a little ripped off.<br /><br />Apparently, what the new owners have done is take their basic instruction and break it down into<br />infinitesimal sections in order to sell more DVD's.  If you think this will give your child a good<br />overview of fractions, you will be disappointed.<br /><br />The DVD itself was fine.  Mine had little lines across the bottom, but I suspect that might have been<br />because this was for a regular screen and I have a widescreen, but not sure.<br /><br />What is un-be-freakin-lievable is that this DVD is only SEVEN MINUTES long!  Yup - infomercials are longer.<br />What this DOES do is introduce the CONCEPT of fractions. It explains what a fraction is, what numerators<br />and denominators are, how to get a common denominator (but that isn't explained well, IMHO. As an adult, it was<br />easy, but if a kid was watching this, I am not so sure they would really get it). It also explained equivalent<br />fractions (as in, why 1/3, 2/6 and 4/12 are all basically the same fraction of 1/3). It shows via pie charts<br />which might help a child visualize hat they are talking about with a fraction.<br /><br />But, that is where the instruction ends. Abruptly.<br />It does not show how to multiply fractions, which was the \"fraction basic\" info that I was hoping for<br />when I purchased this DVD.<br /><br />All in all, this was disappointing. I'd bought 3 SD Math Basic DVD's, and really wasn't looking at the length.<br />NONE of the newer DVD's run very long, and are apparently broken into so many sub-sets of information that you'll<br />end up having to buy a lot of their DVD's (and they hope spending a lot of money) to get all the basic information.<br />This shows a real greedy side to the company, in my opinion. Just make a DVD about fractions, period.<br />Don't make me buy 2 or 3 of the DVD's to get good fraction information for a child who is having a rough<br />time with the fraction concept.<br /><br />This is better than nothing, but that's all. You could make your own pie charts at home just as effectively,<br />or use cookies laid out in a clock format, etc, something that kids can relate to. The only benefit to this short<br />DVD is that the kid can watch it any time s/he wants to without your being involved.<br />Don't pay full price for these, because it definitely isn't worth it.\nGreat for what it is...\nValentine's Day\nBradley Cooper  (Actor),     Jennifer Garner  (Actor),     Garry Marshall  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Studio Specials, Warner Home Video, All Titles\n['Product Description', 'The starriest cast you may ever see sparkles in a hilarious and heartwarming romcom from the director of Pretty Woman and The Princess Diaries. Stories crisscross, collide and boomerang in this look at a day in the life of love. There\\'s a proposal. Flowers that didn\\'t get sent. A big fat secret that\\'s finally told. The \"I\\'ll show up and surprise him\" that ended up surprising her. Fights, kisses, wrong turns, right moves and more. Whether new to or through with love, you\\'ll fall in love with this 19-star, funny-side-up celebration of romance.', 'Amazon.com', \"For those in love with love--and even for those who think they're jaded and over it--\", \"Valentine's Day\", \"and its superb cast are the uplifting elixir that's called for. Director Garry Marshall must have called in every favor he had in Hollywood to line up this amazing cast. Much as Robert Altman does in his best films, Marshall follows intertwining and intersecting couples around Los Angeles as they hook up, break up, and act up as Valentine's Day--with all its intense expectations--looms. Bradley Cooper plays one half of a couple struggling to get back on track. Julia Roberts plays an army officer en route from Iraq (!) to visit a lover halfway around the world. Jennifer Garner is appealing as the girlfriend of a cad (Patrick Dempsey), who managed to overlook telling her he was married; will Garner's character go all\", 'Fatal Attraction', \"? Standouts include the always-charming Anne Hathaway, whose character supplements her income with a freelance gig that, shall we say, involves using multiple accents over the phone--much to the consternation of her beau, played by Topher Grace. Shirley MacLaine and Hector Elizondo play a long-married couple whose strong marriage may be rocked by an old and very inconvenient truth. And young stars Emma Roberts, Taylor Lautner, and Taylor Swift sparkle enough to draw in younger viewers. And if love doesn't always go as planned for these couples (and singles), it's Marshall's deftness as a director that keeps the scenes moving along crisply to the next lovers, or victims. Marshall seems to be aiming to achieve for Valentine's Day what Richard Curtis did for Christmas in\", 'Love Actually', '--and if he falls a little short, it\\'s not due to any lack of star power or onscreen dazzle. \"Love is the only shocking act left on the planet!\" exclaims Ashton Kutcher\\'s character. If so, viewers of', \"Valentine's Day\", 'can expect to be shocked--into a warm romance with this, yes, valentine to love. --', 'A.T.
