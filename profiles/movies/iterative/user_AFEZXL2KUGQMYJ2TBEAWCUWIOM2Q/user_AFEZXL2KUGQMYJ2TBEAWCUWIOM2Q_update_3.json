It never gets old and still moves and resonats after all of these years.<br />The acting was so good that you really believed that this was Prince's biography. Althought it was loosely based on his life, fact or fiction, Purple Rain will always be one of the greatest rock movies ever made. The wardrobe, the cinematography, the music, and the Minneapolis backdrop and culture of that time all created the perfect purple storm of musical genius.

There is the power offaith--in oneself and in a higher power. There is the power of love.There is the never-ending struggle between good and bad. And there isthe power of music.

His performance suffers on all fronts. The film isn't a disaster, but it's safe to predict completist fans will make up most of its viewers. In the earlier film, Prince (known as the Kid) was fighting for his place on stage. This time he's fighting to keep his club safe from the money-grubbing hands of his musical rival, the Time's Morris Day, now a nightclub mogul. Day embodies spiritual, sexual, and economic corruption, while the Kid stands for salvation through music and a more redemptive form of lust.\", 'The graffiti bridge conceit--a metaphor for a place of rejuvenation and artistic inspiration--is intriguing. Unfortunately, the bridge itself is merely a prop in a Paisley Park soundstage.

Haha) and it was just what I needed. This isnt the greatest film but I enjoy it because it's Prince-what can i say?<br /><br />It was nice to see him reprise his roll as The Kid but it is not as visually appealing and sexy or dramatic as Purple Rain or funny and cinematic as Under the Cherry Moon.\nPrince can do no wrong.\nPurple Rain (DVD)\nPrince  (Actor),     Apollonia Kotero  (Actor),     Albert Magnoli  (Director, Writer)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Drama\n['Product Description', 'Purple Rain (DVD)', 'Rock star Prince makes a spectacular feature film debut in this highly autobiographical blockbuster that won both an Oscar and a Grammy award.
