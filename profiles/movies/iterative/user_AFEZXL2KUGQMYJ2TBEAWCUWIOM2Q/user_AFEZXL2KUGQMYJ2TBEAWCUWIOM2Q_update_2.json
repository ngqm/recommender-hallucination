This isnt the greatest film but I enjoy it because it's Prince-what can i say?<br /><br />It was nice to see him reprise his roll as The Kid but it is not as visually appealing and sexy or dramatic as Purple Rain or funny and cinematic as Under the Cherry Moon.\nReview Title: Prince can do no wrong.\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
