The movie is entirely placed when the monsters were in school.  The quality is awesome and it's worth watching, but be prepared for an understated plot.  I would like to have seen more ties to their work after school and getting hired.  This flew by in about a 30 second window in this movie.\nNot as good as the first one...\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Matthew Vaughn'], 'Producers': ['Stephen Marks', 'Peter Morton', 'David Womark', 'Matthew Vaughn', 'Lorenzo Di Bonaventura', 'Michael Dreyer', 'Neil Gaiman'], 'Starring': ['Claire Danes', 'Charlie Cox', 'Sienna Miller']}\nI enjoyed the setting and plot of this movie.  Of course, in the end, we knew the hero would make it.  There were some other surprising plot twists that I hadn't expected.  It was an enjoyable find.<br /><br />If you like movies that contain magic, witches, and some humor, you will probably enjoy this movie.\nSurprisingly good find....\nStar Trek: The Next Generation: Season 3 [Blu-ray]\nMichael Dorn  (Actor),     Gates McFadden  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: Blu-ray\nMovies & TV, Blu-ray, TV\n['Season Three of STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION took televised science fiction storytelling to new heights.
