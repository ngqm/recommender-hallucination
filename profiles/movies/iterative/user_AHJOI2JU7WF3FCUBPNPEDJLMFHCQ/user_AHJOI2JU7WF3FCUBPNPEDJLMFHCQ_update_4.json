As always, the quality and speed from Amazon is awesome.  If you're a top gear fan, this is a must see!  This particular episode was hilarious.\nGreat program\n{'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Dan Scanlon'], 'Producers': ['Kori Rae'], 'Starring': ['Billy Crystal', 'John Goodman', 'Steve Buscemi'], 'Studio': ['Pixar']}\nIt was good, not as good as the first Monsters Inc., movie, but good.  The movie is entirely placed when the monsters were in school.  The quality is awesome and it's worth watching, but be prepared for an understated plot.  I would like to have seen more ties to their work after school and getting hired.  This flew by in about a 30 second window in this movie.\nNot as good as the first one...\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Matthew Vaughn'], 'Producers': ['Stephen Marks', 'Peter Morton', 'David Womark', 'Matthew Vaughn', 'Lorenzo Di Bonaventura', 'Michael Dreyer', 'Neil Gaiman'], 'Starring': ['Claire Danes', 'Charlie Cox', 'Sienna Miller']}\nI enjoyed the setting and plot of this movie.  Of course, in the end, we knew the hero would make it.  There were some other surprising plot twists that I hadn't expected.  It was an enjoyable find.<br /><br />If you like movies that contain magic, witches, and some humor, you will probably enjoy this movie.\nSurprisingly good find....\nStar Trek: The Next Generation: Season 3 [Blu-ray]\nMichael Dorn  (Actor),     Gates McFadden  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: Blu-ray\nMovies & TV, Blu-ray, TV\n['Season Three of STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION took televised science fiction storytelling to new heights.
