This flew by in about a 30 second window in this movie.\nNot as good as the first one...\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Matthew Vaughn'], 'Producers': ['Stephen Marks', 'Peter Morton', 'David Womark', 'Matthew Vaughn', 'Lorenzo Di Bonaventura', 'Michael Dreyer', 'Neil Gaiman'], 'Starring': ['Claire Danes', 'Charlie Cox', 'Sienna Miller']}\nI enjoyed the setting and plot of this movie.
