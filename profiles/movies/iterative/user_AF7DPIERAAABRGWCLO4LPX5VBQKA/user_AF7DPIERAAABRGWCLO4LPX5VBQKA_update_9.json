Of course, I missed Lady Felicia .. but Bunty is just such a great addition.  I love her character.  Many great episodes this season complete with strawberry scones- including a Flambeau finale.  As an American - I just can't get enough of this show!  I've seem most episodes at least twice. I wish they had French subtitles so I could try and improve my language skills and watch it a third time. Can't wait for season 8.\nReview Title: the truth will out :)\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
