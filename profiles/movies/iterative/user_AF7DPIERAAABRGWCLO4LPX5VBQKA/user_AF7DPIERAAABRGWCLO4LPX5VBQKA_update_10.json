I love these women working together with their respective super powers. Its beautifully done and really a joy to watch. Its lovely to see strong female leads is such a compelling story. Season 1 is a bit scary - so be warned. That being said. -the acting, cinematography, and costume design are perfection.

Fabulous all around.\nspectacular show\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Paul Gibson'], 'Starring': ['Mark Williams', 'Sorcha Cusack', 'Jack Deam'], 'Studio': ['BritBox']}\nAnother spectacular season.  Of course, I missed Lady Felicia .. but Bunty is just such a great addition.  I love her character.  Many great episodes this season complete with strawberry scones- including a Flambeau finale.  As an American - I just can't get enough of this show!  I've seem most episodes at least twice. I wish they had French subtitles so I could try and improve my language skills and watch it a third time. Can't wait for season 8.\nthe truth will out :)\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['David Caffrey'], 'Producers': ['Camilla Campbell', 'Rebecca Eaton', 'Chris Lahr', 'Rhonda Smith', 'Robert Wulff-Cochrane']}\nReally?
