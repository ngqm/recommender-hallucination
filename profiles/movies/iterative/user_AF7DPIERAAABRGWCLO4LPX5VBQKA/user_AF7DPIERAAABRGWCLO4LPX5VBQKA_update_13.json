The main characters are just so charming ... I love that Ron Weasley's dad is a priest tracking down criminals.  I also love that if you are watching closely - you can usually figure out a few of the clues. The final episode with all thee former detectives was epic.  I loved it. .. a departure from the classic Flabeau finale.  I have watched and rewatched all episodes in all 8 seasons .. and I can't wait for more.

Its everything I want.<br />Its beautiful music, directing, and acting. All of the actors are perfection.<br />Its hard to describe - but its a Must watch.  As someone who votes - I'm surprised it hasn't gotten more awards.<br />It doesn't have to rely on anything grotesque or sexually subversive to achieve its humor.<br />Dark comedy at its best.\nSpectacular in Every Way!\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Andy De Emmony', 'Sarah Harding', 'Jamie Payne'], 'Producers': ['Jake Lushington', 'Trevor Hopkins', 'Matthew Patnick', 'Greg Phillips', 'Geoff Webb', 'Christine Healy', 'Simon Heath']}\nAbsolutely brilliant! I love these women working together with their respective super powers. Its beautifully done and really a joy to watch. Its lovely to see strong female leads is such a compelling story. Season 1 is a bit scary - so be warned. That being said. -the acting, cinematography, and costume design are perfection. Enjoy!\nOutstanding - We need more of this show!\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['David Frazee', 'Gary Harvey'], 'Starring': ['Julie Graham', 'Peter Benson', 'Rachael Stirling']}\nI've watched all the seasons .  While I do prefer the show when in London (seasons 1,2) - this season was also spectacular. I loved it.  Fabulous all around.\nspectacular show\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Paul Gibson'], 'Starring': ['Mark Williams', 'Sorcha Cusack', 'Jack Deam'], 'Studio': ['BritBox']}\nAnother spectacular season.  Of course, I missed Lady Felicia .. but Bunty is just such a great addition.  I love her character.  Many great episodes this season complete with strawberry scones- including a Flambeau finale.  As an American - I just can't get enough of this show!  I've seem most episodes at least twice. I wish they had French subtitles so I could try and improve my language skills and watch it a third time. Can't wait for season 8.\nthe truth will out :)\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['David Caffrey'], 'Producers': ['Camilla Campbell', 'Rebecca Eaton', 'Chris Lahr', 'Rhonda Smith', 'Robert Wulff-Cochrane']}\nReally?  Do we actually need yet another P.O.S. show out there filled with violence and darkness.  Actors are good- but I just don't need to put depressing images into my brain.  When will people realize that (most) Television really is so depressing.  Why create this content? Why watch it?  After 1 episode , I am out.\nJust another dark, violent show meant to instill fear\nBruce Almighty\nComedy, Fantasy, Inspiring, Outrageous\n['A guy who complains about God too often is given almighty powers to teach him how difficult it is to run the world.']\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Tom Shadyac'], 'Producers': ['Tom Shadyac', 'Jim Carrey', 'James D.

Therefore - this show is essentially the perfect combination.  Shaun Evans is just so fascinating to watch - even in the season when he has a monstrous mustache.  The characters, Fred Thursday and DI Strange are just so relatable and lovable.  I just want to keep watching them.<br />The episodes always start of with a set of seeming random images.. and how they come together is just the right amount surprising.  I can't wait to watch more.  When will Amazon get season 7?  And when will season 8 be released? For what its worth - I really liked the episode directed by the main actor himself... and can't wait for more of Ms. Thursday.  Beautiful attention to detail with respect to costumes, set design and all things related to the era.... I would say on the level of \"Once Upon A Time in Hollywood\".  Brilliant acting all around, and the bucolic setting of Oxford makes me long for a visit to the UK.\nAn Oxford Masterpiece\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Paul Gibson', 'Lol Fletcher'], 'Producers': ['Peter Bullock'], 'Starring': ['Mark Williams', 'Sorcha Cusack', 'Jack Deam'], 'Studio': ['BritBox']}\nI really cannot express how much I adore this show .
