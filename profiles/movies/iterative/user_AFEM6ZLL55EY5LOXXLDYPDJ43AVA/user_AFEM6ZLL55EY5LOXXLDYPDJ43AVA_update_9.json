  "reference_summary": "{'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Richard Starzak', 'Christopher Sadler', 'Jay Grace', 'Lee Wilton', 'Seamus Malone', 'Jean-Philippe Vine', 'Richard Webber', 'Will Becher', 'Mike Mort', 'Dave Osmand'], 'Starring': ['John Sparkes', 'Justin Fletcher', 'Kate Harbour'], 'Studio': ['Aardman Animations']}\nThese shows are so clever. My little 3 year old grand daughter & I had a grand time watching all the high jinks. The humor, the expressions & grumbled by the characters is most enjoyable. I highly recommend this series for all ages.\nShaun the Sheep Season 1\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Nigel Stafford-Clark'], 'Producers': ['Nigel Stafford-Clark'], 'Starring': ['Gillian Anderson', 'Denis Lawson', 'Charles Dance'], 'Studio': ['BBC America']}\nThe plot and subplots were interesting and mysterious.  The acting was super! The costumes and setting we're excellent.  Charles D. knows how to craft a good story. PBS does a great job of telling it.\nSuperb tale.\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Susan Tully', 'Patrick Lau', 'Alan Grint', 'John Greening', 'Charlie Palmer', 'Moira Armstrong', 'Marc Jobst', 'David Tucker', 'Julian Holmes', 'Paul Marcus'], 'Producers': ['Grainne Marmion', 'Sue Hogg'], 'Starring': ['Brendan Coyle', 'Claudia Blakley', 'Dawn French'], 'Studio': ['BBC America']}\nIf you want to see some positive and mentally healthy entertainment...then enjoy this series. This is a refreshing alternative to some of the poor quality and violent shows of today. I find the way relationships are strengthened by honest communication within the communities of caring people so uplifting. The acting is to quality.\nWonderful entertainment.\nLark Rise to Candleford\nDrama\n[\"Following critical acclaim, the residents of Lark Rise and Candleford return to the screen in this warm-hearted adaptation of Flora Thompson's novels. This series sees the arrival of a dashing and elegant stranger in Candleford. Rich, enterprising, worldly and without a wife, James Dowling is a successful businessman with a string of London hotels, and has come to transform Candleford and bring it new prosperity. But not everyone welcomes his entrepreneurial qualities and it isn't long before he is sparring with the spirited, yet suddenly unusually flustered, Dorcas and aggravating the pride of the male Lark Risers with his superior business acumen and somewhat overbearing manner.\"]\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Susan Tully', 'Patrick Lau', 'Alan Grint', 'John Greening', 'Charlie Palmer', 'Moira Armstrong', 'Marc Jobst', 'David Tucker', 'Julian Holmes', 'Paul Marcus'], 'Producers': ['Grainne Marmion', 'Sue Hogg'], 'Starring': ['Brendan Coyle', 'Claudia Blakley', 'Dawn French']}\nGreat first class entertainment and I am hooked on the stories. There is wonderful acting, authentic costumes and beautiful setting.\nHooked on the series\nThe Boy in the Striped Pajamas\nDrama, Military and War, Compelling, Sad\n['A forbidden friendship forms between Bruno, the son of a Nazi commandant, and Schmuel, a Jewish boy held captive in a concentration camp. Though separated physically by a barbed wire fence, their lives become inescapably intertwined.']\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Sean Penn'], 'Producers': ['David Heyman'], 'Starring': ['Vera Farmiga', 'David Thewlis', 'Rupert Friend']}\nThe story was a dark reminder of a horrific event in world history. What I found difficult to believe that the border of the camp would be unpatrolled for any length of time for the story to happen as it did.  That said,  it had an interesting and sad twist that I found thought provoking.\nSad but a good reminder.\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Patrice Leconte'], 'Producers': ['Fr\ufffd\ufffdd\ufffd\ufffdric Brillion', 'Gilles Legrand', 'Daniel Louis', 'Denise Robert'], 'Starring': ['Juliette Binoche', 'Daniel Auteuil', 'Emir Kusturica']}\nA very interesting story based on a true event.  Wonderful acting.\nFeench Canadian historical film\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu'], 'Producers': ['Anne Ruark', 'Steven Golin', 'Jon Kilik'], 'Starring': ['Brad Pitt', 'Cate Blanchett', 'Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal'], 'Studio': ['Paramount']}\nThis is a very compelling story.  There are three separate plots that progress separately which are tense and terrible situations.  The stories are real cliff hangers.  This is a film that will replay in your brain long after you see it. Hang in there with this story because the ending pulls things together.\nTense drama\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Ken Burns']}\nThe series on Mark Twain was very interesting and informative.\nFive Stars\n{'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Angelina Jolie'], 'Producers': ['Matthew Baer', 'Angelina Jolie', 'Erwin Stoff', 'Clayton Townsend', 'Mick Garris', 'Jon Jashni', 'Thomas Tull'], 'Starring': [\"Jack O'Connell\", 'Domhnall Gleeson', 'Miyavi'], 'Studio': ['Universal']}\nWell done movie.
