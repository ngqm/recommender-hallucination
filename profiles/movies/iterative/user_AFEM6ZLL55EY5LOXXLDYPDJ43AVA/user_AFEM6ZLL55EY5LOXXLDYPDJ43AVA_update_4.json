My little 3 year old grand daughter & I had a grand time watching all the high jinks. The humor, the expressions & grumbled by the characters is most enjoyable. I highly recommend this series for all ages.\nShaun the Sheep Season 1\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Nigel Stafford-Clark'], 'Producers': ['Nigel Stafford-Clark'], 'Starring': ['Gillian Anderson', 'Denis Lawson', 'Charles Dance'], 'Studio': ['BBC America']}\nThe plot and subplots were interesting and mysterious.  The acting was super! The costumes and setting we're excellent.  Charles D. knows how to craft a good story. PBS does a great job of telling it.\nSuperb tale.\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Susan Tully', 'Patrick Lau', 'Alan Grint', 'John Greening', 'Charlie Palmer', 'Moira Armstrong', 'Marc Jobst', 'David Tucker', 'Julian Holmes', 'Paul Marcus'], 'Producers': ['Grainne Marmion', 'Sue Hogg'], 'Starring': ['Brendan Coyle', 'Claudia Blakley', 'Dawn French'], 'Studio': ['BBC America']}\nIf you want to see some positive and mentally healthy entertainment...then enjoy this series. This is a refreshing alternative to some of the poor quality and violent shows of today. I find the way relationships are strengthened by honest communication within the communities of caring people so uplifting. The acting is to quality.\nWonderful entertainment.\nLark Rise to Candleford\nDrama\n[\"Following critical acclaim, the residents of Lark Rise and Candleford return to the screen in this warm-hearted adaptation of Flora Thompson's novels.
