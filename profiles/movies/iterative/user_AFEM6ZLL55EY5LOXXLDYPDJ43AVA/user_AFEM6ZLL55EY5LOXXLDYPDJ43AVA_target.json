My little 3 year old grand daughter & I had a grand time watching all the high jinks. The humor, the expressions & grumbled by the characters is most enjoyable. I highly recommend this series for all ages.\nShaun the Sheep Season 1\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Nigel Stafford-Clark'], 'Producers': ['Nigel Stafford-Clark'], 'Starring': ['Gillian Anderson', 'Denis Lawson', 'Charles Dance'], 'Studio': ['BBC America']}\nThe plot and subplots were interesting and mysterious.  The acting was super! The costumes and setting we're excellent.  Charles D. knows how to craft a good story. PBS does a great job of telling it.\nSuperb tale.\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Susan Tully', 'Patrick Lau', 'Alan Grint', 'John Greening', 'Charlie Palmer', 'Moira Armstrong', 'Marc Jobst', 'David Tucker', 'Julian Holmes', 'Paul Marcus'], 'Producers': ['Grainne Marmion', 'Sue Hogg'], 'Starring': ['Brendan Coyle', 'Claudia Blakley', 'Dawn French'], 'Studio': ['BBC America']}\nIf you want to see some positive and mentally healthy entertainment...then enjoy this series. This is a refreshing alternative to some of the poor quality and violent shows of today. I find the way relationships are strengthened by honest communication within the communities of caring people so uplifting. The acting is to quality.\nWonderful entertainment.\nLark Rise to Candleford\nDrama\n[\"Following critical acclaim, the residents of Lark Rise and Candleford return to the screen in this warm-hearted adaptation of Flora Thompson's novels. This series sees the arrival of a dashing and elegant stranger in Candleford. Rich, enterprising, worldly and without a wife, James Dowling is a successful businessman with a string of London hotels, and has come to transform Candleford and bring it new prosperity. But not everyone welcomes his entrepreneurial qualities and it isn't long before he is sparring with the spirited, yet suddenly unusually flustered, Dorcas and aggravating the pride of the male Lark Risers with his superior business acumen and somewhat overbearing manner.\"]\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Susan Tully', 'Patrick Lau', 'Alan Grint', 'John Greening', 'Charlie Palmer', 'Moira Armstrong', 'Marc Jobst', 'David Tucker', 'Julian Holmes', 'Paul Marcus'], 'Producers': ['Grainne Marmion', 'Sue Hogg'], 'Starring': ['Brendan Coyle', 'Claudia Blakley', 'Dawn French']}\nGreat first class entertainment and I am hooked on the stories. There is wonderful acting, authentic costumes and beautiful setting.\nHooked on the series\nThe Boy in the Striped Pajamas\nDrama, Military and War, Compelling, Sad\n['A forbidden friendship forms between Bruno, the son of a Nazi commandant, and Schmuel, a Jewish boy held captive in a concentration camp.

What I found difficult to believe that the border of the camp would be unpatrolled for any length of time for the story to happen as it did.  That said,  it had an interesting and sad twist that I found thought provoking.\nSad but a good reminder.\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Patrice Leconte'], 'Producers': ['Fr\ufffd\ufffdd\ufffd\ufffdric Brillion', 'Gilles Legrand', 'Daniel Louis', 'Denise Robert'], 'Starring': ['Juliette Binoche', 'Daniel Auteuil', 'Emir Kusturica']}\nA very interesting story based on a true event.  Wonderful acting.\nFeench Canadian historical film\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu'], 'Producers': ['Anne Ruark', 'Steven Golin', 'Jon Kilik'], 'Starring': ['Brad Pitt', 'Cate Blanchett', 'Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal'], 'Studio': ['Paramount']}\nThis is a very compelling story.  There are three separate plots that progress separately which are tense and terrible situations.  The stories are real cliff hangers.  This is a film that will replay in your brain long after you see it. Hang in there with this story because the ending pulls things together.\nTense drama\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Ken Burns']}\nThe series on Mark Twain was very interesting and informative.\nFive Stars\n{'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Angelina Jolie'], 'Producers': ['Matthew Baer', 'Angelina Jolie', 'Erwin Stoff', 'Clayton Townsend', 'Mick Garris', 'Jon Jashni', 'Thomas Tull'], 'Starring': [\"Jack O'Connell\", 'Domhnall Gleeson', 'Miyavi'], 'Studio': ['Universal']}\nWell done movie.

Set at the end of the 19th century, this visually stunning hit BBC/PBS drama sees newcomer Gabriel Cochrane arrive in Candleford with a vendetta against the evil banker Steerforth, who he feels has tricked him into losing his business. Elsewhere, Dorcas makes an ill-judged intervention, Minnie becomes worried that Alfie might fall out of love with her and Emma is left in a precarious financial position.\"]\n{'Genre': 'Drama', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Various', 'Language': 'English', 'Number Of Discs': '2', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'Unrated (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 3.68 Ounces', 'Director': 'Various', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, NTSC', 'Run time': '5 hours and 51 minutes', 'Release date': 'April 5, 2011', 'Actors': 'Various', 'Studio': 'BBC Home Entertainment', 'Number of discs': '2'}\nThe entire series is a very pleasant watch. I like the way the two levels of society are depicted and the conflicts between then.  I like how the stories show conflict resolution. The other pleasant thing is no blood and guts! This is series of good stories, wonderful acting and authentic costumes and setting.\nThe entire series is a very pleasantwatch. I like the way the two levels of ...\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['20th_century_fox'], 'Producers': ['Karen Rosenfelt', 'Ken Blancato'], 'Starring': ['Emily Watson', 'Brian Percival', 'Fox'], 'Studio': ['20th Century Fox']}\nThe invasion by the Nazi military is so eloquently profoundly shown in the film and how significant something as simple as access to good books to read, can be in surviving such an atrocity. The story is beautifully written and wonderfully acted.\n... and how significant something as simple as access to good books to read\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Nicholas Fackler'], 'Producers': ['Jay Van Hoy', 'Dana Altman', 'Lars Knudsen', 'James Lawler', 'Jack Turner', 'Virgil Price', 'Ian McGloin', 'Dany Garcia', 'Martin Landau', 'Charles Ledley', 'Jamie Mai', 'Antonio Ortega', 'Emery Sheer', 'Leslie Zigel'], 'Starring': ['Martin Landau', 'Ellen Burstyn', 'Elizabeth Banks']}\nThis story was a bit strange showing some awkward relationships between characters. The twist in the ending makes these relationships make a little more sense but still a confusing ending. I may have to watch this one twice...\nConfusing and poignant\nI Am Big Bird: The Caroll Spinney Story\nDrama, Documentary, Optimistic, Touching\n[\"An affectionate portrait of Caroll Spinney, the beloved puppeteer responsible for creating worldwide icons out of Sesame Street's Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch for the last 45 years.\"]\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Dave LaMattina', 'Chad Walker'], 'Producers': ['Katherine Andrews', 'Clay Frost', 'Dave LaMattina', 'Chad Walker'], 'Starring': ['Caroll Spinney', 'Frank Oz']}\nWhat an interesting biography of the mab who brought to life our dear Big Bird. The movie showed what a sensitive, caring and talented person he is. There were many home movies of Carroll relaxing and spending time with his family. Lots of behind the scene recordings of how Big Bird works and thinks.  I would recommend this to everyone who grew up loving Big Bird.\nGreat biography\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Mitchell Leisen'], 'Producers': ['Richard Maibaum'], 'Starring': ['Barbara Stanwyck', 'John Lund']}\nThis is a very interesting mystery with numerous twists and turns. Movie starts slowly but stick with it, it's worth it!\nGreat movie.!\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Philip Kaufman'], 'Producers': ['Peter Kaufman', 'Trish Hofmann', 'James Gandolfini', 'Alexandra Ryan', 'Barbara Turner'], 'Starring': ['Nicole Kidman', 'Clive Owen', 'David Strathairn'], 'Studio': ['HBO']}\nLots of sex and drinking but a look at an amazing woman reporter I had never heard of in my history lessons. So glad they made a movie about this strong, brave and diligent female world reporter. Great story.\nA profile of an amazing female world reporter and her time with Hemingway.\nMaudie\nDrama, Romance, Gentle, Touching\n['MAUDIE, is based on the true story of arthritic folk artist Maud and the unlikely romance between Maud and a hardened reclusive bachelor.']\n{'Audio languages': ['English (US)', 'English (UK) [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Aisling Walsh'], 'Producers': ['Bob Cooper', 'Susan Mullen', 'Mary Leckie'], 'Starring': ['Ethan Hawke', 'Sally Hawkins', 'Kari Matchett']}\nThe movie depicts the life of Maud Lewis, a true story.
