The characters are wooden and unbelievable. I stopped reading the book half way through and knew enough after the first episode to stop the series. The British with their superlative actors, stately homes surrounded by beautiful scenery can make even mediocre material look good, but not this time.\nReview Title: Couldn't get into it\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
