The characters are wooden and unbelievable. I stopped reading the book half way through and knew enough after the first episode to stop the series. The British with their superlative actors, stately homes surrounded by beautiful scenery can make even mediocre material look good, but not this time.\nCouldn't get into it\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: Low', 'English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a)', 'Italiano', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', '\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e', 'Portugu\u00eas', 'Deutsch', 'Fran\u00e7ais'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', '\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629', '\u010ce\u0161tina', 'Dansk', 'Deutsch', '\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a)', 'Suomi', 'Filipino', 'Fran\u00e7ais', '\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea', '\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940', 'Magyar', 'Indonesia', 'Italiano', '\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e', '\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4', 'Bahasa Melayu', 'Norsk Bokm\u00e5l', 'Nederlands', 'Polski', 'Portugu\u00eas (Brasil)', 'Portugu\u00eas (Portugal)', 'Rom\u00e2n\u0103', '\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439', 'Svenska', '\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bcd', '\u0c24\u0c46\u0c32\u0c41\u0c17\u0c41', '\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22', 'T\u00fcrk\u00e7e', '\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7b80\u4f53\uff09', '\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7e41\u9ad4\uff09'], 'Directors': ['Marc Forster'], 'Producers': ['Deborah Schoeneman', 'Mark Hudis', 'Becky Hartman Edwards', 'Jillian Kugler', 'Jeff King', 'Ron Perlman', 'Brian Wilkins', 'Marc Forster', 'Ben Watkins'], 'Starring': ['Ron Perlman', 'Dana Delany', 'Andre Royo'], 'Studio': ['Amazon Studios']}\nWe only lasted about five minutes.\nIt looked like a variation on a hackneyed theme.\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Jan Troell'], 'Producers': ['Thomas Stenderup'], 'Starring': ['Maria Heiskanen', 'Jesper Christensen', 'Mikael Persbrant'], 'Studio': ['IFC Films']}\nEverlasting movie is more like it.\nTwo Stars\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Silvio Soldini'], 'Producers': ['Daniele Maggioni'], 'Starring': ['Licia Maglietta', 'Bruno Ganz', 'Giuseppe Battiston'], 'Studio': ['First Look Studios']}\nI don't think the Italians do comedy well.
