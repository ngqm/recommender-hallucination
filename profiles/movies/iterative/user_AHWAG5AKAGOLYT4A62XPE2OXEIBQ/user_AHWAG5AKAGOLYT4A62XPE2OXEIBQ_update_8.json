The board hopes his failed experience will keep him from digging too deep into the town\\'s secrets. Hungover on his first day on the job, he must investigate a domestic abuse case that ends up leaduing to a money laundering scheme perpetuated by a manager of a local bank.', 'Amazon.com', \"How Tom Selleck's world-weary cop Jesse Stone became the police chief of sleepy Paradise, Mass., is revealed in this engaging prequel to the first made-for-TV Stone feature,\", 'Stone Cold', \"(2005). Selleck is once again well cast as the rough-around-the-edges Stone, whose drinking problem gets him ejected from the Los Angeles police force; he soon finds himself the head lawman in a small New England fishing village, where his slow dissolution continues until a routine domestic disturbance case reveals connections to money laundering and murder, with several of the town's most affluent names as possible suspects. Selleck is well-matched by veteran scene stealer Saul Rubinek, and there's good work by Polly Shannon as a city attorney who becomes Stone's romantic interest, and Stephen Baldwin as an ill-tempered local.
