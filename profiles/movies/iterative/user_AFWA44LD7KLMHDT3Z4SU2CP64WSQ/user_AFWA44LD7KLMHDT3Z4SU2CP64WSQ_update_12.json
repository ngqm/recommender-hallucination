I also had a boy and he was 7 y old...and we had a peanut butter from the jar (only no double dipping lol)<br />  I also was fired because my &#34;host mom&#34; became jealous of kid's love towards me...He started to call me my mommy and the best friend. I tried to explain him the difference, BUT he said..mommy is who takes care of you and loves you, and you the only person who is....<br />  I guess nothing else to add....Nanny cam and I was fired...<br />So many similarities in a movie...omg...<br />Anyway, the best part is I met my hubby. He also lived almost  &#34;next door&#34;..and &#34;my host mom&#34; did not like our relationship, saying he is out of my class....<br />Now I am happily married for almost 8 years and became a doctor. Still live in NY next door to my EX-&#34;host mom&#34; -))))\nExactly how life is behind closed doors of rich families in NYC\nAngelina Ballerina - The Lucky Penny\nFinty Williams  (Actor),     Judi Dench  (Actor),     Kitty Taylor  (Director),     Roger McIntosh  (Director)    &                   1                  more   Rated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Studio Specials, Universal Studios Home Entertainment, All Universal Studios Titles\n['When Angelina finds a lucky penny, she decides she doesn\\x92t need to practice for an important audition.
