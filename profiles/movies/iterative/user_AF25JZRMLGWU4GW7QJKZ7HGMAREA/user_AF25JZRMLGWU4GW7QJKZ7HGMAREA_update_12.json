Written and directed by Gabriel Axel, from a short story by Out of Africa\\'s Isak Dinesen, this Oscar(r)-winning*film offers \"an irresistible mixture of dry wit and robust humanity\" (Newsweek). Onthe desolate coast of Denmark live Martina and Philippa, the beautiful daughters of a devout clergyman who preaches salvation through self-denial. Both girls sacrifice youthful passion to faith and duty, and even many years after their father\\'s death, they keep his austere teachings alive among thetownspeople. But with the arrival of Babette, a mysterious refugee from France\\'s civil war, life for the sisters and their tiny hamlet begins to change. Soon, Babette has convinced them to try something truly outrageousa gourmet French meal! Her feast, of course, scandalizes the local elders.

Joining them for the meal will be a Danish general who, as a young soldier, courted one of the sisters, but she turned him away because of her religion.

Summer 1936. Bearing the expectations of a nation and their Fuhrer, two climbers set out to be the first to conquer the last great problem. But soon their ascent becomes a race for survival threatened by injury and extreme storms.

Toni Kurz (Benno F\u00fcrmann) and Andi Hinterstoisser (Florian Lukas) are cocky mountaineers who \"will scale anything that\\'s tall.\" In 1936 they are prevailed upon to climb the unconquered 13,000-foot north face of the Eiger, \"the death wall\" and \"the last problem of the Alps,\" as a heroic and glorious prelude to the Berlin Olympic Games. Toni and Andi are not true believers (they ignore greetings of \"Heil Hitler\" as they quit the Bavarian Mountain Brigade). They\\'ve got company on their treacherous quest, two Austrian climbers. As long as', 'North Face', \"sticks to the mountain, it is viscerally thrilling and grueling. But the movie adds unnecessary baggage, a romantic subplot. Why is there a love story? Because it's there. Johanna Wokalek costars as Luise, an aspiring photojournalist and Toni's former girlfriend, who is covering the story with her boss, a Nazi sympathizer whose paper is a cog in the propaganda machine.

This year, a plethora of compelling storylines will play out to their inevitable, and bloody, conclusions. As the season begins, encouraged by the Red Wedding slaughter in the Riverlands that wiped out many of their Stark nemeses, the Lannisters\u2019 hold on the Iron Throne remains intact \u2026 but can they survive their own egos as well as new and ongoing threats from the south, north and east?

You got the basic idea of what it was like for a &#34;broken&#34; person to try and heal herself by re-inventing herself.  I've known people who hiked the PCT and it is NOT for a beginner, as she was.  I've heard people say there was too much sex, but really -- broken women sometimes try to find human touch wherever they can, to feel closeness.  Having gone through a divorce, and much loss in her life; her mom at a young age,, as well as no real relationship with a father figure, it is really understandable.  The movie tries to deal with this aspect without dwelling on it.  The focus is on her journey to heal.  I recommend.\nJourney of one woman to find healing.\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Sam Taylor-Johnson'], 'Producers': ['Michael De Luca', 'E L James', 'Dana Brunetti'], 'Starring': ['Dakota Johnson', 'Jamie Dornan', 'Jennifer Ehle'], 'Studio': ['Universal Pictures']}\nThe book was so very much better.  The movie leaves out a lot of their thoughts and the reasons for Grey's hangups.  The movie just touches the surface...  there is so much lost in the movie.  In addition to this, for some reason every three minutes the movie cut out on me and I had to back out of it and then resume.  I have a newer powerful computer and this has never happened with any other movies i've watched on here.  That my have colored my view a bit.
