Written and directed by Gabriel Axel, from a short story by Out of Africa\\'s Isak Dinesen, this Oscar(r)-winning*film offers \"an irresistible mixture of dry wit and robust humanity\" (Newsweek). Onthe desolate coast of Denmark live Martina and Philippa, the beautiful daughters of a devout clergyman who preaches salvation through self-denial. Both girls sacrifice youthful passion to faith and duty, and even many years after their father\\'s death, they keep his austere teachings alive among thetownspeople. But with the arrival of Babette, a mysterious refugee from France\\'s civil war, life for the sisters and their tiny hamlet begins to change. Soon, Babette has convinced them to try something truly outrageousa gourmet French meal! Her feast, of course, scandalizes the local elders. Just who is this strangely talented Babette, who has terrified this pious town with the prospect of losing their souls for enjoying too much earthly pleasure? *1987: Foreign Language Film', 'Amazon.com', 'Some movies can only be described as delicious. In', \"Babette's Feast\", \", a woman flees the French civil war and lands in a small seacoast village in Denmark, where she comes to work for two spinsters, devout daughters of a puritan minister. After many years, Babette unexpectedly wins a lottery, and decides to create a real French dinner--which leads the sisters to fear for their souls. Joining them for the meal will be a Danish general who, as a young soldier, courted one of the sisters, but she turned him away because of her religion. The village elders all resolve not to enjoy the meal, but can their moral fiber resist the sensual pleasure of Babette's cooking?\", \"Babette's Feast\", 'deservedly won the 1987 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

But soon their ascent becomes a race for survival threatened by injury and extreme storms.

Toni Kurz (Benno F\u00fcrmann) and Andi Hinterstoisser (Florian Lukas) are cocky mountaineers who \"will scale anything that\\'s tall.\" In 1936 they are prevailed upon to climb the unconquered 13,000-foot north face of the Eiger, \"the death wall\" and \"the last problem of the Alps,\" as a heroic and glorious prelude to the Berlin Olympic Games. Toni and Andi are not true believers (they ignore greetings of \"Heil Hitler\" as they quit the Bavarian Mountain Brigade). They\\'ve got company on their treacherous quest, two Austrian climbers. As long as', 'North Face', \"sticks to the mountain, it is viscerally thrilling and grueling. But the movie adds unnecessary baggage, a romantic subplot. Why is there a love story? Because it's there.
