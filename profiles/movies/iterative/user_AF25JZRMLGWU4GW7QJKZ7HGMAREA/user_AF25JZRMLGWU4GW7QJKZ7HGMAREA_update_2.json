Written and directed by Gabriel Axel, from a short story by Out of Africa\\'s Isak Dinesen, this Oscar(r)-winning*film offers \"an irresistible mixture of dry wit and robust humanity\" (Newsweek). Onthe desolate coast of Denmark live Martina and Philippa, the beautiful daughters of a devout clergyman who preaches salvation through self-denial. Both girls sacrifice youthful passion to faith and duty, and even many years after their father\\'s death, they keep his austere teachings alive among thetownspeople. But with the arrival of Babette, a mysterious refugee from France\\'s civil war, life for the sisters and their tiny hamlet begins to change. Soon, Babette has convinced them to try something truly outrageousa gourmet French meal! Her feast, of course, scandalizes the local elders. Just who is this strangely talented Babette, who has terrified this pious town with the prospect of losing their souls for enjoying too much earthly pleasure? *1987: Foreign Language Film', 'Amazon.com', 'Some movies can only be described as delicious.

Joining them for the meal will be a Danish general who, as a young soldier, courted one of the sisters, but she turned him away because of her religion.
