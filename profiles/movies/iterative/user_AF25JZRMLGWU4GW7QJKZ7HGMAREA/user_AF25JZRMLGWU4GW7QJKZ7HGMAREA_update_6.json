I've known people who hiked the PCT and it is NOT for a beginner, as she was.  I've heard people say there was too much sex, but really -- broken women sometimes try to find human touch wherever they can, to feel closeness.  Having gone through a divorce, and much loss in her life; her mom at a young age,, as well as no real relationship with a father figure, it is really understandable.  The movie tries to deal with this aspect without dwelling on it.  The focus is on her journey to heal.

Onthe desolate coast of Denmark live Martina and Philippa, the beautiful daughters of a devout clergyman who preaches salvation through self-denial. Both girls sacrifice youthful passion to faith and duty, and even many years after their father\\'s death, they keep his austere teachings alive among thetownspeople. But with the arrival of Babette, a mysterious refugee from France\\'s civil war, life for the sisters and their tiny hamlet begins to change. Soon, Babette has convinced them to try something truly outrageousa gourmet French meal! Her feast, of course, scandalizes the local elders.
