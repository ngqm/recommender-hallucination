Recorded over three days in June of 2004 to benefit Eric Clapton's Crossroads Center in Antigua (as do the sales of this set), the show is not surprisingly heavy on the rootsy blues and country that comprise Clapton's primary inspirations.

It was a great concert, and the quality of the recording is supremo, especially if you play it through a HD upconverting player and watch it on a HDTV. Absolutely brilliant video and sound!!!<br /><br />The only thing that is keeping me from giving it 5 stars is simply prejudice - I am a classical guitarist and there was not a single classical player in the entire concert.  There was a sitar player who played on forever - please stop already!!! AND that's NOT a guitar! It's a SITAR! Not even a hint of a classical guitarist.  But, nonetheless, it's very entertaining, and the concert was for a very good cause - help for drug/alcohol abuse.\nReview Title: Eric Clapton - CrossRoads\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
