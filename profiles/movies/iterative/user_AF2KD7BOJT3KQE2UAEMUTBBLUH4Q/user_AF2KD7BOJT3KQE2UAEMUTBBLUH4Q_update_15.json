Will the acting improve? (it does just a tiny bit every episode.), Will the script improve? (Sort of, with increasing attempts at dry humor,)  The premise of the story has just the right mix of plausibility to make you keep staring at your screen, trying to decide if this is worth watching.  It has potential, lots of potential in the way a glass teetering on the edge of a table has potential.  When the acting is this bad and the actors seem like they are reading their lines for maybe only the first time out loud, that's generally all you have; potential.  Oddly, if there is a season 2, I think I want to watch it.  I actually cared what might happen to the characters. These terrible actors somehow grew on me, and I found myself cheering for their careers and willing to go along for the ride.\nReview Title: Interesting Story with Potential\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Complex characters.  Great costumes and attention to visual historical & social details.  Love to adore some characters, love to despise others.  It's a great indulgence to escape into Downton while their situations are still related to day to life today, but one forgets that while watching this other time and place.\nGood series.

I'm fond of characters who talk directly to the audience, sharing those inner snark comments one only shares with their most trusted accomplice.  I haven't watched enough to get hooked yet.  I'm only one episode into this.\nOK so far.\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'frightening scenes', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Chris Long', 'Daniel Sackheim', 'Thomas Schlamme', 'Daniel Attias', 'Stefan Schwartz', 'Kevin Dowling', 'Nicole Kassell', 'Adam Arkin', 'Noah Emmerich', 'Matthew Rhys'], 'Starring': ['Keri Russell', 'Matthew Rhys', 'Annet Mahendru'], 'Studio': ['FX']}\nVEry interesting story.  I recently read in the Observer that this is based on a true story from the son of one of the couples who were spies.\nBased on real events\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Chris Long', 'Daniel Sackheim', 'Thomas Schlamme', 'Daniel Attias', 'Stefan Schwartz', 'Kevin Dowling', 'Nicole Kassell', 'Adam Arkin', 'Noah Emmerich', 'Matthew Rhys'], 'Starring': ['Keri Russell', 'Matthew Rhys', 'Lev Gorn'], 'Studio': ['FX']}\nThis is a very interesting story line based on true events, but it is so dark and dreary that one must mix viewing with some comedy.  I will stick with this though as it is just too darn intriguing, considering it is based on real happenings.\nStory is not very cheerful but is very interesting.\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Chris Bould', 'Paul Donovan'], 'Producers': ['Paul Donovan', 'Wolfram Tichy'], 'Starring': ['Brian Downey', 'Michael McManus', 'Xenia Seeberg'], 'Studio': ['FilmRise']}\nTo be fair, I only wallowed through about 20 minutes of the first episode.  Cheesey story line garnished with unapetizing gore and dismal wallowing noise that is supposed to be music is not my definition of entertainment.  Watching this felt like a Monday morning at work, only not getting paid for the misery.\nWatching this felt like a Monday morning at work\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Sam Miller', 'Hettie Macdonald', 'Nick Hurran', 'Richard Laxton'], 'Producers': ['Patrick Spence', 'Matthew Bird'], 'Starring': ['Stanley Tucci', 'Richard Dormer', 'Michael Gambon'], 'Studio': ['Pivot']}\nI really tried to like this, and honestly did not watch beyond the first 4 episodes. I quit in S1E5.  The acting is very good, but the story line nearly runs in realtime.  I ran out of patience.\nGood scenery, but just too dark, dreary and slow.\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Jamin Winans'], 'Producers': ['Kiowa Winans'], 'Starring': ['David Carranza', 'Tiffany Mualem', 'Christopher Soren Kelly'], 'Studio': ['Double Edge Films', 'Co.']}\nVery thoughtful interesting movie that kept reeling me in. Initially I was about to give up in the first 10 minutes, but the reward of sticking with it and getting caught in the thoughtful unpredictable current was well worth the experience.\nGreat movie\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['John Lyde'], 'Producers': ['Jason Faller'], 'Starring': ['Kevin Sorbo', 'Danielle Chuchran', 'Rocky Myers'], 'Studio': ['Distribber']}\nIf you are stuck home on a rainy Saturday and want something to watch, then, OK, this will do. It made me want to rock climb, run and maybe do some boxing.  Oh, and ride a horse too, and maybe plan a trip to Zion, Bryce and maybe Moab.\nFitness video with a sci-fy motif\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Christopher McQuarrie'], 'Producers': ['David Ellison', 'Dana Goldberg'], 'Starring': ['Tom Cruise', 'Henry Cavill', 'Ving Rhames'], 'Studio': ['Paramount Pictures']}\nIt's a Tom Cruise, Mission Impossible Movie.

It really is not about the Flat Earth stuff and more about the stuff of human dreaming and fortitude.  Watch this with an open mind and an open heart.  You will wear a smile by the end. Peace In, Ya'll.\nNot what you expect\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language'], 'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Bracey Smith'], 'Starring': ['James Rich', 'Jack Haley', 'Alexandra Blatt'], 'Studio': ['LastSat Productions']}\nReally crappy acting, a crappy script, but somehow this is a pretty good storyline that hooks you, and does make you wonder what will happen next.
