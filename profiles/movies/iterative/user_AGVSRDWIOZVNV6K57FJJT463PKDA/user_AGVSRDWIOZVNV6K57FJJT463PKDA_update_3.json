What a stinker. Plot is awful. Characters thin. Effects cheesy. \"Sets\" phony. The very idea of buying this on Blu-ray is laughable. Sheen is a joke. He should stick to what he knows: one-line sex jokes, hookers and beating up his wives.<br /><br />This is a third world-produced \"film\" that should have gone straight to video that I'd perhaps buy used for $1 at a garage sale, and then throw away to save space. This makes Plan 9 From Outer Space look plausible.<br /><br />Man am I glad I saw it on a backwater channel and didn't put any money out on this turkey, even as a rental. There is no doubt why it failed at the box office. It would have failed at 2:00 AM on Syfy channel.<br /><br />If this is what passes for good sci-fi, y'all have a pretty low threshold for quality.\nStinker\nAmerican Horror Story: Season 1\nConnie Britton  (Actor),     Dylan McDermott  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Boxed Sets, Television\n[\"Brace yourself for an addictive thrill ride!
