What a stinker. Plot is awful. Characters thin. Effects cheesy. \"Sets\" phony. The very idea of buying this on Blu-ray is laughable. Sheen is a joke. He should stick to what he knows: one-line sex jokes, hookers and beating up his wives.<br /><br />This is a third world-produced \"film\" that should have gone straight to video that I'd perhaps buy used for $1 at a garage sale, and then throw away to save space. This makes Plan 9 From Outer Space look plausible.<br /><br />Man am I glad I saw it on a backwater channel and didn't put any money out on this turkey, even as a rental. There is no doubt why it failed at the box office. It would have failed at 2:00 AM on Syfy channel.<br /><br />If this is what passes for good sci-fi, y'all have a pretty low threshold for quality.\nReview Title: Stinker\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
