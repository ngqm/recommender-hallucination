But the first DVD did not work and I had to get a refund.  Doesn't mean you should not buy them, I just got a lemon.  Oh well, better luck next time.  I've met the actress who plays Judy and the Robinson Mother, June Lockhart.  Billy Mumy is next on my list.<br /><br />These are remastered and better than when I first watched them.

Or so he hopes.  By sarcastically saying \u201cpeace in our time\u201d (alluding to the same phrase spoken by Chamberlain as he signed a non-aggression treaty with Hitler in 1938 \u2013 we know how that went down!) Ultron clicks on it and finds that Man, full of the lust of war and greed, decides he will bring that kind of peace, too \u2013 the quiet of a graveyard!<br /><br />Special effects:  Great stuff with Jarvis and Ultron.  Even the colors contrasted well!  The banter scripted was at times annoying as Jarvis slowly (too slowly to save himself) realizes Ultron, coming online faster than anyone realized, begins assimilating Jarvis!  Yikes!<br /><br />Evil large supply of robots built by Ultron, flying through the sky.  Only one instance of an exploding fireball.  Always must include one fireball in these kinds of films.<br /><br />Pathos:  The beautiful sadness of Bruce Banner and Black Widow (yikes, what would Kirby say?) was a bit maudlin and sad.  Your girlfriend would probably like this part.  It was \u201cOK.\u201d<br /><br />Revenge:  The whole film was based to a greater or lesser degree on revenge.  Is revenge a good enough motivation for killing?  Only Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver can answer that.<br /><br />Take Over the World:  There\u2019s always an element like that.  Love how the origin of the Vision has changed to a Stark/Ultron hybrid who has none of Stark\u2019s smart-aleck jokes, nor Ultron\u2019s death wish.  Vision was the most under-rated character of this film as he brings the team together.<br /><br />Credit Scene:  In this film, the credit scene is in the middle of the credits, not the end.<br /><br />Final Words:<br /><br />Whedon did a great job putting this together.  He gave just enough to the fan boys to make us wanting more; he appealed to a general audience that does not read comic books (Muggles); and he didn\u2019t overdo it on the special effects.<br /><br />Pro: Dream sequences and Easter eggs.  See the Roy Thomas Band in Cap\u2019s dream?<br />Con: Tony Stark\u2019s bad jokes; Hawkeye\u2019s scenes slowed the film considerably.<br />Great: Stan Lee Cameo!  Iron-man\u2019s Hulk-buster!<br />Not so Great: No Pepper Potts!  Wait until the year 2018 for an Infinity Gauntlet!<br /><br />Recommended from this DC fan!\nWhedon Does the Avengers Proud!  Review from a DC Fan!\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Don Medford'], 'Producers': ['Mort Abrahams'], 'Starring': ['Leslie Nielson', 'Virginia Vincent', 'Robert Middleton']}\nLeslie Nielson was a character actor in the '50s, not anything like his comedy films of later decades.  He's a bit over the top in this anthology of stories, predating Twilight Zone and not nearly as good.<br /><br />He plays a guy who has just committed a murder and wants out.  A devilish man offers him a way out by going back in time and reliving 7 years.  We never see the 7 years relived, just the last scene where he commits the same murder, saying almost the same words.  Fails for me since the TV episode says basically 'don't ask what you wish for' and 'Fate is unchanging' and a bit of a downer.\nFair Attempt at Horror\nBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Ultimate Edition\nZack Snyder  (Director),     Ben Affleck  (Actor),     Henry Cavill  (Actor)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: Blu-ray\nMovies & TV, Featured Categories, Blu-ray, Action & Adventure\n['Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (Ultimate Edition Blu-ray + Theatrical Blu-ray)', 'The extended cut of \u201cBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\u201d includes 30 more minutes of story and action not seen in theaters!

Angst, excitement, personal conflict, personal conviction, the specific material recognized by any DC fan (Death of Superman, Dark Knight Returns), and a psychotic Lex Luthor who is nearly on par with the Joker!<br /><br />Story and Plot:<br /><br />The beginning of the show with Batman\u2019s origin was really well done, the criminal (Joe Chill?) ruthless; Dad steps in front of his wife and child ready to do whatever it takes to protect them; Bruce running away and falling into a pit \u2013 a pit of bats!  Holy Flashback!<br /><br />Batman\u2019s brooding is further enhanced by Lex Luthor, a rich brat who is also a scientific genius, who plays Superman and Batman against each other, via their \u201csecret\u201d identities to get them both riled up to where they want to kill each other. And let\u2019s not forget the pawns in the chessgame \u2013 Lois Lane and Superman\u2019s mother, Martha Kent.<br /><br />The whole terrorist theme was well-played, and a beautiful yet explosive car chase showing us what the Batmobile is capable of.<br /><br />Alfred, played by another, more sarcastic character than in earlier Batman films, really knew his stuff and as well confided in Batman and steered him when the Bats was losing his fight with the Belfrey, if you know what I mean.<br /><br />And Superman, conflicted.  Is he worshiped as a god, or is he an alien menace, or just a man who wants to do what is right.  The conversation with his Dad (Kevin Costner especially poignant acting) and the calming base of his mother, Martha (played with conviction by actress Diane Lane) come together in a mix of emotion, love, and heartache.  Quite nice!<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br /><br />A movie worth watching.  The flashbacks Batman was experiencing while playing back Luthor\u2019s drive were a bit confusing, but overall Affleck\u2019s Batman was characterized in a way that would make writer Frank Miller proud.  The conflicted version of Superman was more real and down to earth a portrayal.  And the excitement &amp; power of Gadot as Wonder Woman made me want a solo film of her so much more.<br /><br />Well done to Zach Snyder, cast and crew!<br /><br />CAST<br />Henry Cavill ...

I really liked their cat & mouse conversations.<br /><br />Doug\u2019s character has to get this scientist across the border and back to the UK for research that will create a weapon that will \u201cend the war\u201d, implying the USA\u2019s Manhattan Project and atomic research.<br /><br />Old favorite character actors such as Rene (whom I remember from Star Trek:Deep Space Nine) and Max (from Beverly Hillbillies) with a very odd moustache, and finally Chuck Connors (one of the best Western actors on television at that time).<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br /><br />Was not as exciting as I remember.  The theme song is played pretty much throughout the film.  Would have been nice to have some musical variety of soundtrack.  Richard Basehart (of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea) makes a convincing Nazi (and he also played in a film called \u2018Hitler\u2019).<br /><br />Overall a good entry into network TV.<br /><br />The DVD has no extras, just the movie.\nGlider to Freedom\nSideways (Widescreen Edition)\nPaul Giamatti  (Actor),     Thomas Haden Church  (Actor),     Alexander Payne  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Comedy\n['Product Description', \"A divorced school teacher, and failed author, joins up with his buddy who is about to get married and head to wine country for a week of male bonding and wine tasting.

It's only my opinion.<br /><br />About a wine connoisseur who goes on a weekend wine trip with his friend Jack.  Except Jack is getting married and wants to cheat on his fiance.  Jack gets into all sorts of trouble when doing this and pulls Miles into the fray as well.<br /><br />Miles is an insecure wine lover who takes anti depressants and gets drunk whenever he thinks about his two year old divorce, especially when he finds out his ex is getting married.  His friend Jack is a pig who gets girls into bed with him with disasterous results!<br /><br />Overall, good cinematography and you learn a lot about the wine industry, but the unneeded sex images and the clearly immoral Jack make for a tough watch.  The ending is sweet though, so worth one watch.\nShould Be Called Wino & Pig\nStar Trek Beyond (BD/DVD/Digital HD Combo)\nChris Pine  (Actor),     Zachary Quinto  (Actor)    Rated:    PG-13    Format: Blu-ray\nMovies & TV, Featured Categories, Blu-ray\n['\"Star Trek Beyond,\" the highly anticipated next installment in the globally popular Star Trek franchise, created by Gene Roddenberry and reintroduced by J.J.

Director Justin Li (Fast & Furious 6) kept the lens flares to minimum.<br /><br />Chris Pine is growing into his Kirk role.  He really got the Shatner vibe down and adds his own flair to it.<br /><br />As I have enjoyed in Trek over the last four decades, the character-driven characters, the relationship between Spock & Kirk as they come to grips with not only the possibility of their breaking up and taking other opportunities but also to do the standard save-the-universe story with some original twists.<br /><br />Details:<br /><br />Love the details.  What would the 25th century use as phones?  Would they consider our current hard rock music \u201cclassical\u201d?  Right down to the make-up, the costumes, the occasional cars & trains, all makes for a world as real as Roddenberry could have envisioned.<br /><br />It\u2019s a story of revenge, of greed, and of sacrificing others so that you may achieve immortality.  Or so it seems.<br /><br />Action:<br /><br />The movie is a bit too fast paced, and gets to the action pretty quick with just a bit of backstory and set-up.  It got a bit too fast for me, so I had to rewind and make sure I didn\u2019t miss anything.  Illusion weaponry and clever dealings with the bad guy makes this a tough world for Kirk!<br /><br />Final thoughts:<br /><br />Tributes to Leonard Nimoy and Anton Yelchin (played Chekov, and recently died in a freak home accident) were touching without being maudlin.  And yes, this film is much better than the other two.  Looking forward to more!<br /><br />DVD:  The DVD, not blu-ray, was devoid of features, just your basic set up of chapters, episodes and future feature film trailers.

These events happen while Luke is still hanging out on Tatooine making his moisture farm work.  Who whodathought?<br /><br />We get some cameos of R2D2 and C3PO and even an unwinnable Rebel battle against the Empire on an Imperial-owned planet, to get the plans (as mentioned in A New Hope).  The graphic violence and characters we'd begun to know all pretty much make the final sacrifice to get the plans to the Princess to make Luke possible.<br /><br />Overall, an excellent entry in the Star Wars mythos.

And \u201cfigures\u201d as in notable persons.<br /><br />Story:<br /><br /> The film covers several themes which I found fascinating.  I\u2019ve always loved NASA\u2019s early space program and even what they\u2019re accomplishing now, regardless of government cut-backs they still make something happen:  flyby of Saturn, discoveries on Pluto, and landing on the Moon often which no nation has yet accomplished.<br /><br /> But the historic backdrop is blurred by the underlying racial prejudice of those times, in the South, in the state of Virginia.<br /><br /> Separate sections in the library for whites and \u201ccoloreds\u201d.  Separate bathrooms, waterfountains, busses, etc. etc.  This was in the 1960s as Dr. King was calling for equal rights among all races.<br /><br /> The characters in our play are confronting these sitauations daily and it\u2019s fascinating watching them counteract each, as their counterparts tell them that \u201cthat\u2019s the way it is!\u201d<br /><br /> The film is based on actual occurrences.<br /><br /> The acting was superb.

I guess we\u2019re tiring of the Nazi character in WWII films and yet still wanted to have German evil genius at work.<br /><br />Themyscra \u2013 an island for women only \u2013 but their island is invaded by a man \u2013 following by a platoon of Germans!  The Amazons are true to the task with arrows buring air and finding targets.<br /><br />Diana goes out into the world of men with some funny results.  English fashion bears scrutiny of the goddess princess and her commentary on the way women (and secretaries) are treated give some much-needed comedy to avoid the dark, darkness of the last DC films.<br /><br />Who Ares the god of War is was a shock and I liked the misdirection.  The film was not predicable.  Loved that.<br /><br />World War I was known for its dangerous gasses that were released during those battles.  My grandfather fought at the front and so I know something of this.  Dr. Poison, a woman with a mission \u2013 there is more to her than the film leads on and I would have liked to see more of this character.<br /><br />Final Thoughts:  DC did a great job with pushing out this origin story.  Let\u2019s hope they can top this with the Justice League film coming soon.<br /><br />Recommended!\nGal Gadot and Chris Pine Blew Me Away!\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English'], 'Directors': ['Zack Snyder'], 'Producers': ['Deborah Snyder'], 'Starring': ['Ben Affleck', 'Amy Adams', 'Gal Gadot'], 'Studio': ['WARNER HOME VIDEO']}\nJustice League<br /><br />First Thoughts:<br /><br />If you want to be entertained and better yet know something about DC Comics, you will have a fun time watching Justice League.<br /><br />Story & Plot:<br /><br /> Batman and Wonder Woman are trying to put a team together to fight a battle with an invader coming to take over the Earth.  A good third of the film involves Batman recruiting these players and though somewhat spoiled by the trailers of late, makes for an interesting start to the film.<br /><br /> I really wish they gave more info on the characters they\u2019re picking up for those who know nada about comics.<br /><br /> Aquaman, never got the respect he deserved in the comics.  He\u2019s brunette rather than the blonde guy we knew, but Jason Moma (\u201cStargate\u201d) makes a bad ass Aquaman.  Teasers included showing Atlantis and a cameo of Mera.  We even get to see her flex her muscle with her water powers.<br /><br /> Almost nothing on Atlantis, why it\u2019s important, who Mera is, etc.  I can see an uneducated audience would puzzle on that.<br /><br /> Cyborg, an unknown in a lot of circles, who is part machine, part man.  We see some relationship with his father who saved his life, conflicting emotion \u2013 Am I a freak or a hero?  How will I fit in?  Cyborg struggles with this which I thought was a great plot line but then it was not followed up!  Could have spent more time on this.<br /><br /> Ben Affleck\u2019s Batman delivers and his acting and his hot Batmobile and tricks you never tire of him.<br /><br /> Wonder Woman is her usual personable self, a woman who doesn\u2019t put up with the bad guys, and knows Amazon fighting skills and bouncing bullets off her bracelets that\u2019s cool to watch.<br /><br /> The Flash is the most enjoyable character.  He is the viewpoint of the audience, enamored to work with such powerful people, and though he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have friends\u201d fits in well with the group.  He represents the hero worshipped kid we all would experience if we were in his shoes.<br /><br /> The way they brought Superman back (that\u2019s not a spoiler, that\u2019s a given) differed greatly from the comics \u2013 I guess I was expecting something more spiritual or going to the Fortress in the North to do it.<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br /><br /> Yes there are fights, explosions and CGI.  But there is also a decent plot that carries through well.<br /><br /> Not perfect.  Why use Steppenwolf?  But the mid and end credit scenes portend a much better future for Justice League II.<br /><br /> Remember, Star Trek the Movie was dull but the second one was awesome.  Let\u2019s hope history repeats itself!<br /><br /> Recommended.\nEpic Team-Up of the Anticipated Release of DC's Newest Movie!\n{'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Rian Johnson'], 'Producers': ['Kathleen Kennedy', 'Ram Bergman'], 'Starring': ['Oscar Isaac', 'Mark Hamill', 'Daisy Ridley'], 'Studio': ['Lucasfilm']}\nStar Wars:  The Last Jedi<br /><br />Directed by  Rian Johnson<br /> Cast (in part)<br /> Mark Hamill  Luke Skywalker<br />Carrie Fisher  Leia Organa<br /> Adam Driver  Kylo Ren<br /> Daisy Ridley  Rey<br /> John Boyega  Finn<br /> Oscar Isaac Poe Dameron<br /> Andy Serkis  Snoke<br /><br />First Thoughts:  I was excited to see this film since I\u2019m an original, waiting blocks for the 1977 Star Wars film.  And I was NOT disappointed!<br /><br />Though Rian Johnson\u2019s story and direction are somewhat controversial in some circles, overall I liked the direction we are going in.<br /><br />We left Rey with Luke in The Force Awakens and find Luke as a dissolutioned former Jedi who just wants to die on an island in the armpit of the galaxy far far away.  And Rey, shocked by this attitude of a man she\u2019s idolized, tries to wake him up.<br /><br />You can\u2019t walk away from trouble and though you may have inadvertently caused it, you still have responsibility to make it right.  I feel that\u2019s the lesson between Luke and Rey.<br /><br />Legends change \u2013 we find anyone can use the Force, not just certain individuals.  And Rey has the most sensitivity and the most power, and is on par with her antagonist Kylo Ren.<br /><br />Ren, like Luke, is a torn individual.  He has a Force connection with Rey who communicates with him.  That Rey tries to see Ren\u2019s side of the story is telling and so is Luke\u2019s tale with a lot to do with his relationship with both Ren and Rey.  Flawed characters trying to do what they think is \u201cthe best\u201d but eventually Rey decides \u2013 in the main throne room of Snoke\u2019s ship.<br /><br />Snoke comes across as a villain who seems to have all the cards in his favor.  His Dark Side Force power is more powerful than Rey and Ren.  They both have a plan for Snoke.  And their lightsaber battle with the Praetorian Guard is worth the price of admission!<br />Forced?<br /><br />We finally get to see a final confrontation with Ren and Luke Skywalker himself.  Luke seems invincible, and Ren wants his blood.  How this turns out with shock you.<br /><br />Another controversial scene must do with the remnants of the Rebel Alliance attempting to escape from the First Order armada and are getting picked off, one at a time, as the Rebels limp towards their base.<br /><br />There are side adventures with Rose (new character, she really steps up and takes the film) and her relationship with Finn \u2013 at first seems to have hero worship and later saves his life.<br /><br />Final Thoughts\u201d<br /><br />OK, I\u2019m rambling , but really guys and gals remember this is fiction!  Some suspension of disbelief is required.  Johnson turns the Force mythology on its ear.  And who is the Last Jedi?  Can you guess?<br /><br />Highly recommended!\nLast Jedi -- End of Some Mythology, The Beginning of a New Adventure for Rey and Ren!\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Anthony Russo', 'Joe Russo'], 'Producers': ['Kevin Feige'], 'Starring': ['Robert Downey Jr.', 'Chris Hemsworth', 'Mark Ruffalo'], 'Studio': ['Marvel']}\nAvengers, Infinity War Part I<br /><br />First thoughts:<br /><br />A film of great action, character-driven story, but depends on knowledge of previous Marvel Cinema films to truly follow along.<br /><br />Basic Plot:<br /><br />Thanos in the past has sent his various henchmen, who themselves are formidable, to get the Infinity stones so Thanos can trick out his special Gauntlet, forged from the fires that made Thor\u2019s hammer!<br /><br />Mixing various characters and giving them, some movie time has always been tough, with some directors creating a character alphabet soup of confusing plotlines aka Green Lantern.  Not so Avengers.  From the jungle country of Wakanda, which becomes a battlefield between the hordes of evil and the outnumbered Avengers & allies.<br /><br />Tony Stark and Captain America had a falling out in Civil War and yet the film tries to bring them back in the picture to fight a new battle.<br /><br />The Guardians of the Galaxy come in and not just for comic relief, though some jokes fall short of the whole pace and plot of the Infinity War film.  They fight with Spider-man, Iron-man and Dr. Strange upon Titan, Saturn\u2019s moon as their last battlefield.<br /><br />A side story between Vision and Wanda, the Scarlet Witch occurs, with Vision worrying about what he will do when Thanos comes looking for him to take his Mind Stone.  He doesn\u2019t have long to wait!<br /><br />Final Thoughts:  From the deepest jungles of Africa to the space scenes at Titan the movie is a nonstop thrill a minute action film \u2013 at least until the end, when we get a cliffhanger.  I hate cliffhangers!<br /><br />Great after credit scene, don\u2019t miss it!\nLike the Merging of the Marvel Universe against Thanos!\n{'Audio languages': ['English', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)'], 'Subtitles': ['English', 'English [CC]', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica) [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Ryan Coogler', 'Marc Forster'], 'Producers': ['Kevin Feige', 'Brigham Taylor', 'Kristin Burr'], 'Starring': ['Chadwick Boseman', 'Michael B. Jordan', \"Lupita Nyong'o\"]}\nBlack Panther<br /><br />First Thoughts:<br /><br />I was really impressed with theproduction quality of the film as well as the gripping story that kept you interested throughout.<br /><br />Story:<br /><br />I remember the Black Panther character from his stint in the old Fantastic Four comics and later in his own issue, Black Panther, by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.  The movie detracts from the comic in scenery and a few characters are different.  In the comics his sister was a general, in the movie she\u2019s a scientist with teenaged reactions to tradition.<br /><br />T'challa lost his father and is coming to grips with what it means to be King.  After some great fight scenes he gets his dream as King of the country of Wakanda.<br /><br />However an old enemy created by his father decades before in Oakland, CA grows to be a muscle-bound killer.  He ousts the Panther and claims to turn things around in starting a world war against civilization.<br /><br />The rest of the tale deals with T\u2019challa\u2019s reactions to this and how he rallies his friends in a final thrust to win back the throne.  Who wins?<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br /><br />Great film.  I wish Kirby could be alive today to see his dream come true; an advanced civilization in the jungles of Africa and will they get revenge through blood or change Man\u2019s way of life through beneficial actions?
