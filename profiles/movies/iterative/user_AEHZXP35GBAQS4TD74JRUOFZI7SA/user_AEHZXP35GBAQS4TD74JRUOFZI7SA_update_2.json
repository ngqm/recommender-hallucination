Or so he hopes.  By sarcastically saying \u201cpeace in our time\u201d (alluding to the same phrase spoken by Chamberlain as he signed a non-aggression treaty with Hitler in 1938 \u2013 we know how that went down!) Ultron clicks on it and finds that Man, full of the lust of war and greed, decides he will bring that kind of peace, too \u2013 the quiet of a graveyard!<br /><br />Special effects:  Great stuff with Jarvis and Ultron.  Even the colors contrasted well!  The banter scripted was at times annoying as Jarvis slowly (too slowly to save himself) realizes Ultron, coming online faster than anyone realized, begins assimilating Jarvis!  Yikes!<br /><br />Evil large supply of robots built by Ultron, flying through the sky.  Only one instance of an exploding fireball.  Always must include one fireball in these kinds of films.<br /><br />Pathos:  The beautiful sadness of Bruce Banner and Black Widow (yikes, what would Kirby say?) was a bit maudlin and sad.  Your girlfriend would probably like this part.  It was \u201cOK.\u201d<br /><br />Revenge:  The whole film was based to a greater or lesser degree on revenge.  Is revenge a good enough motivation for killing?  Only Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver can answer that.<br /><br />Take Over the World:  There\u2019s always an element like that.  Love how the origin of the Vision has changed to a Stark/Ultron hybrid who has none of Stark\u2019s smart-aleck jokes, nor Ultron\u2019s death wish.  Vision was the most under-rated character of this film as he brings the team together.<br /><br />Credit Scene:  In this film, the credit scene is in the middle of the credits, not the end.<br /><br />Final Words:<br /><br />Whedon did a great job putting this together.  He gave just enough to the fan boys to make us wanting more; he appealed to a general audience that does not read comic books (Muggles); and he didn\u2019t overdo it on the special effects.<br /><br />Pro: Dream sequences and Easter eggs.  See the Roy Thomas Band in Cap\u2019s dream?<br />Con: Tony Stark\u2019s bad jokes; Hawkeye\u2019s scenes slowed the film considerably.<br />Great: Stan Lee Cameo!  Iron-man\u2019s Hulk-buster!<br />Not so Great: No Pepper Potts!  Wait until the year 2018 for an Infinity Gauntlet!<br /><br />Recommended from this DC fan!\nWhedon Does the Avengers Proud!
