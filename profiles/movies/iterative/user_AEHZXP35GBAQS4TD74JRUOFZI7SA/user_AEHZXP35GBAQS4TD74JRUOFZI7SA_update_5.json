It's only my opinion.<br /><br />About a wine connoisseur who goes on a weekend wine trip with his friend Jack.  Except Jack is getting married and wants to cheat on his fiance.  Jack gets into all sorts of trouble when doing this and pulls Miles into the fray as well.<br /><br />Miles is an insecure wine lover who takes anti depressants and gets drunk whenever he thinks about his two year old divorce, especially when he finds out his ex is getting married.  His friend Jack is a pig who gets girls into bed with him with disasterous results!<br /><br />Overall, good cinematography and you learn a lot about the wine industry, but the unneeded sex images and the clearly immoral Jack make for a tough watch.  The ending is sweet though, so worth one watch.\nReview Title: Should Be Called Wino & Pig\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Joss Whedon'], 'Producers': ['Kevin Feige'], 'Starring': ['Robert Downey Jr.', 'Chris Hemsworth', 'Mark Ruffalo'], 'Studio': ['Marvel']}\nThe Avengers: Age of Ultron<br /><br />First Impressions:  Full of action, pathos and humor, not canon but I didn\u2019t care.<br /><br />Storyline:<br /><br />Basically Tony Stark comes up with a perfect machine capable of protecting the Earth.  Or so he hopes.  By sarcastically saying \u201cpeace in our time\u201d (alluding to the same phrase spoken by Chamberlain as he signed a non-aggression treaty with Hitler in 1938 \u2013 we know how that went down!) Ultron clicks on it and finds that Man, full of the lust of war and greed, decides he will bring that kind of peace, too \u2013 the quiet of a graveyard!<br /><br />Special effects:  Great stuff with Jarvis and Ultron.  Even the colors contrasted well!  The banter scripted was at times annoying as Jarvis slowly (too slowly to save himself) realizes Ultron, coming online faster than anyone realized, begins assimilating Jarvis!  Yikes!<br /><br />Evil large supply of robots built by Ultron, flying through the sky.  Only one instance of an exploding fireball.  Always must include one fireball in these kinds of films.<br /><br />Pathos:  The beautiful sadness of Bruce Banner and Black Widow (yikes, what would Kirby say?) was a bit maudlin and sad.  Your girlfriend would probably like this part.  It was \u201cOK.\u201d<br /><br />Revenge:  The whole film was based to a greater or lesser degree on revenge.  Is revenge a good enough motivation for killing?  Only Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver can answer that.<br /><br />Take Over the World:  There\u2019s always an element like that.  Love how the origin of the Vision has changed to a Stark/Ultron hybrid who has none of Stark\u2019s smart-aleck jokes, nor Ultron\u2019s death wish.  Vision was the most under-rated character of this film as he brings the team together.<br /><br />Credit Scene:  In this film, the credit scene is in the middle of the credits, not the end.<br /><br />Final Words:<br /><br />Whedon did a great job putting this together.  He gave just enough to the fan boys to make us wanting more; he appealed to a general audience that does not read comic books (Muggles); and he didn\u2019t overdo it on the special effects.<br /><br />Pro: Dream sequences and Easter eggs.  See the Roy Thomas Band in Cap\u2019s dream?<br />Con: Tony Stark\u2019s bad jokes; Hawkeye\u2019s scenes slowed the film considerably.<br />Great: Stan Lee Cameo!  Iron-man\u2019s Hulk-buster!<br />Not so Great: No Pepper Potts!  Wait until the year 2018 for an Infinity Gauntlet!<br /><br />Recommended from this DC fan!\nWhedon Does the Avengers Proud!  Review from a DC Fan!\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Don Medford'], 'Producers': ['Mort Abrahams'], 'Starring': ['Leslie Nielson', 'Virginia Vincent', 'Robert Middleton']}\nLeslie Nielson was a character actor in the '50s, not anything like his comedy films of later decades.  He's a bit over the top in this anthology of stories, predating Twilight Zone and not nearly as good.<br /><br />He plays a guy who has just committed a murder and wants out.  A devilish man offers him a way out by going back in time and reliving 7 years.  We never see the 7 years relived, just the last scene where he commits the same murder, saying almost the same words.  Fails for me since the TV episode says basically 'don't ask what you wish for' and 'Fate is unchanging' and a bit of a downer.\nFair Attempt at Horror\nBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Ultimate Edition\nZack Snyder  (Director),     Ben Affleck  (Actor),     Henry Cavill  (Actor)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: Blu-ray\nMovies & TV, Featured Categories, Blu-ray, Action & Adventure\n['Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (Ultimate Edition Blu-ray + Theatrical Blu-ray)', 'The extended cut of \u201cBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\u201d includes 30 more minutes of story and action not seen in theaters!

Angst, excitement, personal conflict, personal conviction, the specific material recognized by any DC fan (Death of Superman, Dark Knight Returns), and a psychotic Lex Luthor who is nearly on par with the Joker!<br /><br />Story and Plot:<br /><br />The beginning of the show with Batman\u2019s origin was really well done, the criminal (Joe Chill?) ruthless; Dad steps in front of his wife and child ready to do whatever it takes to protect them; Bruce running away and falling into a pit \u2013 a pit of bats!  Holy Flashback!<br /><br />Batman\u2019s brooding is further enhanced by Lex Luthor, a rich brat who is also a scientific genius, who plays Superman and Batman against each other, via their \u201csecret\u201d identities to get them both riled up to where they want to kill each other. And let\u2019s not forget the pawns in the chessgame \u2013 Lois Lane and Superman\u2019s mother, Martha Kent.<br /><br />The whole terrorist theme was well-played, and a beautiful yet explosive car chase showing us what the Batmobile is capable of.<br /><br />Alfred, played by another, more sarcastic character than in earlier Batman films, really knew his stuff and as well confided in Batman and steered him when the Bats was losing his fight with the Belfrey, if you know what I mean.<br /><br />And Superman, conflicted.  Is he worshiped as a god, or is he an alien menace, or just a man who wants to do what is right.  The conversation with his Dad (Kevin Costner especially poignant acting) and the calming base of his mother, Martha (played with conviction by actress Diane Lane) come together in a mix of emotion, love, and heartache.  Quite nice!<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br /><br />A movie worth watching.  The flashbacks Batman was experiencing while playing back Luthor\u2019s drive were a bit confusing, but overall Affleck\u2019s Batman was characterized in a way that would make writer Frank Miller proud.  The conflicted version of Superman was more real and down to earth a portrayal.  And the excitement &amp; power of Gadot as Wonder Woman made me want a solo film of her so much more.<br /><br />Well done to Zach Snyder, cast and crew!<br /><br />CAST<br />Henry Cavill ...

I really liked their cat & mouse conversations.<br /><br />Doug\u2019s character has to get this scientist across the border and back to the UK for research that will create a weapon that will \u201cend the war\u201d, implying the USA\u2019s Manhattan Project and atomic research.<br /><br />Old favorite character actors such as Rene (whom I remember from Star Trek:Deep Space Nine) and Max (from Beverly Hillbillies) with a very odd moustache, and finally Chuck Connors (one of the best Western actors on television at that time).<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br /><br />Was not as exciting as I remember.  The theme song is played pretty much throughout the film.  Would have been nice to have some musical variety of soundtrack.  Richard Basehart (of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea) makes a convincing Nazi (and he also played in a film called \u2018Hitler\u2019).<br /><br />Overall a good entry into network TV.<br /><br />The DVD has no extras, just the movie.\nGlider to Freedom\nSideways (Widescreen Edition)\nPaul Giamatti  (Actor),     Thomas Haden Church  (Actor),     Alexander Payne  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Comedy\n['Product Description', \"A divorced school teacher, and failed author, joins up with his buddy who is about to get married and head to wine country for a week of male bonding and wine tasting.
