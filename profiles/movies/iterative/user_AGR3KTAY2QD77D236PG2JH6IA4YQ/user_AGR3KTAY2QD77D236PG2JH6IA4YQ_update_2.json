But the future Connor was raised to believe in is altered in part by the appearance of Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), a stranger whose last memory is of being on death row. Connor must decide whether Marcus has been sent from the future, or rescued from the past. As Skynet prepares its final onslaught, Connor and Marcus both embark on an odyssey that takes them into the heart of Skynets operations, where they uncover the terrible secret behind the possible annihilation of mankind.', ']]>', 'Amazon.com', 'Terminator Salvation', \"restores some of the balance of huge freakin' explosions and emotionally compelling plot to the\", 'Terminator', 'series. Set entirely after the nuclear assault that left the computer system Skynet in control of the world,', 'Terminator Salvation', \"follows John Connor (Christian Bale) as he grapples with both murderous robots and his superiors in the resistance, who aren't sure they believe the prophecies that Connor is destined to save humanity. Into the midst of this struggle tumbles Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington, who would later star in James Cameron's\", 'Avatar', '); the last thing he remembers was being executed in prison decades before. Baffled, he falls into company with Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin,', 'Star Trek', ') and a mute little girl, who soon get captured--but Wright then meets and bonds with Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood,', 'Eight Below', \"), a resistance fighter who remains loyal to the confused Wright even though Connor suspects he's not what he seems--or what he believes himself to be.\", 'Terminator Salvation', \"isn't the astonishing synthesis of action and feeling that either\", 'The Terminator', 'or', 'T2', 'were; the plot threads are poorly woven and fray completely in the last third of the movie. Despite this,', 'Terminator Salvation', \"has at least two skillfully orchestrated action sequences that will get your heart racing, and Worthington\u2019s beguiling mixture of toughness and vulnerability gives his relationship with Bloodgood a genuine pulse. It's imperfect, but compared with the hollow carcasses that most action movies (including\", 'Terminator 3', \") turn out to be, it's worth seeing.\", '--Bret Fetzer', 'On the Blu-ray disc', \"The director's cut is a mere three minutes longer than the theatrical cut. Many of these additions are just a few seconds of extra violence (e.g., a knife thrust into a body then pulled out), but there are a few more-substantial sequences: A longer conversation in Resistance Command Headquarters; a brief topless scene by Moon Bloodgood when her Blair Williams character and Sam Worthington's Marcus return to her base (reminiscent of Kelly McGillis and Harrison Ford in\", 'Witness', '); an extended conversation between those two characters afterward (Blair: \"You can focus on what you\\'ve lost or you can fight for what\\'s left\"); and a longer radio address by John Connor in which he mentions his mother. Even though it\\'s not all that different, it should be the preferred way to watch the movie.', 'The big extra feature, Maximum Movie Mode, is only on disc 2\\'s original theatrical cut. In front of two large TV screens, director McG introduces the movie then makes periodic appearances to discuss key concepts. Interspersed along the way are various pop-ups with the Terminator mythology timeline, picture-in-picture with cast and crew interviews and behind-the-scenes footage, and stills galleries. You can also, when prompted, exit out of the movie to watch any of 11 Focus Points, which are two- to three-minute featurettes. Conveniently, you can also access these from the main menu. Two other features are watchable separate from Maximum Movie Mode: \"Reforging the Future\" (19 minutes), discussing the new film\\'s take on the Terminator legacy, and \"The Moto-Terminator\" (8:33), focusing on the motorcycle-like robots.', '--David Horiuchi']\n{'Genre': 'Science Fiction & Fantasy, Action & Adventure', 'Format': \"Multiple Formats, Blu-ray, Color, Widescreen, Dubbed, Subtitled, Director's Cut\", 'Contributor': 'McG, Christian Bale, Anton Yelchin, Helena Bonham Carter, Jane Alexander, Moon Bloodgood, Bryce Dallas Howard, Sam Worthington, CommonMcG, Christian Bale, Anton Yelchin, Helena Bonham Carter, Jane Alexander, Moon Bloodgood, Bryce Dallas Howard, Sam Worthington, Common   See more', 'Language': 'English (DTS-HD High Res Audio), French (Dolby Digital 5.1), Spanish (Dolby Digital 5.1)', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 57 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '2.40:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '7 x 5.5 x 0.5 inches; 3.52 Ounces', 'Director': 'McG', 'Media Format': \"Multiple Formats, Blu-ray, Color, Widescreen, Dubbed, Subtitled, Director's Cut\", 'Run time': '1 hour and 57 minutes', 'Release date': 'December 1, 2009', 'Actors': 'Christian Bale, Sam Worthington, Anton Yelchin, Moon Bloodgood, Helena Bonham Carter', 'Subtitles': 'English, French, Spanish', 'Studio': 'Warner Home Video', 'Number of discs': '2'}\nThe movie is not what I have come to expect from a terminator movie.  I think that all the Terminator movies had a story line that was pretty plausible for an everyday event that could happen.  That coupled along with some points along the way that can only be overcome with some major action.  I guess without Arnold Schwarzenegger I should have already known there would not be much good action.<br /> The entire movie is all about the big `Time Paradox' that brings the `John Conner' guy into existence.  How he sent his father back to his mom.  And if he doesn't do this then he will not `be'.  Arnold does make a walk on appearance toward the end but it is really nothing.  I guess I watched it so I can join in the conversation whenever this title is up for discussion.  Just don't expect any action.  It's not a `fun' kill em' all kind of film; but rather a complex theoretical kind of head trip.\nWhat a let down!!\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Tony Tilse', 'Rowan Woods', 'Andrew Prowse', 'Ian Watson', 'Peter Andrikidis', 'Geoff Bennett', 'Catherine Millar', 'Pino Amenta', 'Ian Barry', 'Brian Henson'], 'Studio': ['New Video']}\nJust the, idea, alone, of trying to make a sci-fi fiction about a space adventure.
