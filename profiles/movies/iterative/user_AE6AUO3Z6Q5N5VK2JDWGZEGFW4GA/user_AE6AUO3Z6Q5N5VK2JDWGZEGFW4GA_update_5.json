Though this may be true in some regards, the majority of the people who fought in this war fought for other reasons, whether it was for state's rights, protecting their homeland, or because they were asked to.  To understand this, you can better appreciate the sacrafice soldiers on both sides had to endure, and this movie captures that idea.<br />There are plenty of extras on this 1 disk DVD, from documentaries on the making of the film, to an interesting biography of Thomas Jackson.  Very interesting is the slave perspective, with viewpoints from the actors who played Martha and Jim, two prominant slave characters in the movie.  The DVD also includes 2 music videos of songs featured in the movie.<br />If you are a history buff, you will most definately love this movie and cherish its themes.  Fans of DVD extras will love the many extra featurettes.  Either way, you can't lose.\nReview Title: Great movie, DVD would be better on 2 disk set\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Billed as a special-effects comedy, the imaginative film (the top box-office smash of 1985) has staying power because of the heart behind Zemeckis and Bob Gale's script. High schooler Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox, during the height of his TV success) is catapulted back to the '50s where he sees his parents in their teens, and accidentally changes the history of how Mom and Dad met. Filled with the humorous ideology of the '50s, filtered through the knowledge of the '80s (actor Ronald Reagan is president, ha!), the film comes off as a\", 'Twilight Zone', \"episode written by Preston Sturges.

Producer-writer Bob Gale is the star of the extra features, candidly presenting the original ideas and many deleted scenes (a few with doses of crude humor). Much of the inside stuff is repeated in the various pieces, but that's to be expected with such exhaustive materials. Michael J. Fox chimes in with a video commentary presented in a picture-in-picture format (which would have worked better as a straight interview) and the producers tackle the main commentary track, but the highlight audio commentary is a free-flowing Q&A with Gale and director Robert Zemeckis in front of a USC film-school audience.

This DVD is probably the best quality DVD to date.  Great for showing off a high quality home theater.  Since the movie was shot on digital film, there was almost no ghosting or image quality lost.<br />Now the negatives:<br />What made the original Star Wars movies so spectatular was their campy dialog, fake but realistic special effects (even though you knew it was a fake spaceship you still knew it was a picture of a real model).  The older Star Wars films were mostly a tribute to the cheesey sci-fi movies of the 50's and 60's.  A true space opera, they were classics.<br />Episode II relies mostly on the impressive special effects to mesmerize and entertain.  Acting and story are second to this.  The totally cardboard acting of Haeden Christianson is so bad, that it makes you wonder if he should play an emotionally repressed andriod instead of the future Darth Vader. It made me miss Jar Jar.<br />Oustanding special effects that circumvent the rest of the movie.  This movie seems to be made mostly just to fill a quota and to set up the clearly superior episodes 3-6.  Makes you sad to see a performer past his prime, and Star Wars is way past its prime.\nGeorge Lucas has lost his mind.\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Widescreen Edition)\nDaniel Radcliffe  (Actor),     Rupert Grint  (Actor),     Chris Columbus  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Characters & Series, Harry Potter, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\n['Product Description', 'The next installment in the Harry Potter series finds young wizard Harry Potter (DANIEL RADCLIFFE) and his friends Ron Weasley (RUPERT GRINT) and Hermione Granger (EMMA WATSON) facing new challenges during their second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as they try to uncover a dark force that is terrorizing the school.', 'HARRY POTTER characters, names, and related indicia are trademarks of and (c) Warner Bros.
