Billed as a special-effects comedy, the imaginative film (the top box-office smash of 1985) has staying power because of the heart behind Zemeckis and Bob Gale's script. High schooler Marty McFly (Michael J.

Much of the inside stuff is repeated in the various pieces, but that's to be expected with such exhaustive materials. Michael J. Fox chimes in with a video commentary presented in a picture-in-picture format (which would have worked better as a straight interview) and the producers tackle the main commentary track, but the highlight audio commentary is a free-flowing Q&A with Gale and director Robert Zemeckis in front of a USC film-school audience.

This DVD is probably the best quality DVD to date.  Great for showing off a high quality home theater.  Since the movie was shot on digital film, there was almost no ghosting or image quality lost.<br />Now the negatives:<br />What made the original Star Wars movies so spectatular was their campy dialog, fake but realistic special effects (even though you knew it was a fake spaceship you still knew it was a picture of a real model).  The older Star Wars films were mostly a tribute to the cheesey sci-fi movies of the 50's and 60's.  A true space opera, they were classics.<br />Episode II relies mostly on the impressive special effects to mesmerize and entertain.  Acting and story are second to this.  The totally cardboard acting of Haeden Christianson is so bad, that it makes you wonder if he should play an emotionally repressed andriod instead of the future Darth Vader. It made me miss Jar Jar.<br />Oustanding special effects that circumvent the rest of the movie.  This movie seems to be made mostly just to fill a quota and to set up the clearly superior episodes 3-6.  Makes you sad to see a performer past his prime, and Star Wars is way past its prime.\nGeorge Lucas has lost his mind.\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Widescreen Edition)\nDaniel Radcliffe  (Actor),     Rupert Grint  (Actor),     Chris Columbus  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Characters & Series, Harry Potter, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\n['Product Description', 'The next installment in the Harry Potter series finds young wizard Harry Potter (DANIEL RADCLIFFE) and his friends Ron Weasley (RUPERT GRINT) and Hermione Granger (EMMA WATSON) facing new challenges during their second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as they try to uncover a dark force that is terrorizing the school.', 'HARRY POTTER characters, names, and related indicia are trademarks of and (c) Warner Bros.

Continually contradictory, the common thesis that the lack of social programs in this country contribute to gun violence.<br />Michael Moore uses sappy music, and saavy editing to pull at the heartstrings while totally disregarding facts.<br />One such misleading fact is the number of gun murders he states.  While our gun deaths are much higher than countries like Germany, France, or Canada, it is actually smaller per capita according to FBI statistics.<br />Also, he takes only homicides for countries like Germany and Canada, but lumps justifiable shootings (cops shooting bad guys), and accidental deaths for the United States.<br />He blames the United State's welfare to work program for the shooting death of 8 year old Kayla Rolland by a classmate. He says the welfare to work program made the shooter's mother work, instead of stay home with her child.<br />He fails to point out that the boy lived in a known crackhouse, where numerous weapons were readily available along with drugs and passed-out drug addicts.<br />These are two of dozens of facts that mislead.

Two years later, an ailing Franklin enters the constitutional convention to guide rancorous delegates.\"]\n{'Aspect Ratio': '1.66:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 2.72 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'Relay Time: 210 min', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Closed-captioned, Color, NTSC', 'Run time': '3 hours and 30 minutes', 'Release date': 'January 24, 2006', 'Actors': 'Richard Easton', 'Language': 'Unqualified', 'Studio': 'PBS', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nThis clever and entertaining look at the life and times of Benjamin Franklin would be a great addition to the library of any Franklin buff or history buff for that matter.<br /><br />It is well written, and entertainingly presented with a mix of narration and live action.  Richard Easton does a fantastic job portraying Franklin and the cast does well acting out actual correspondences and written first hand accounts from the time.<br /><br />The film is broken down into three segments showing the life of Franklin. Let the Experiment Be Made, The Making of a Revolutionary, and The Chessmaster.<br /><br />Let the experiment be made shows the early life of Franklin, how a genius was made and his contributions to science.<br /><br />The Making of a Revolutionary shows how a man who once considered himself a loyalist became a fierce proponent of independence.<br /><br />The Chessmaster detailed his years in France gaining support for the war, the treaty of France, and the building of the American Experiment in democracy.<br /><br />Ultimately this film does a great job portraying Franklin as a man.  Sometimes flawed, as we all are, but a man who contributed so many things to making America what we know today.<br />It does it with wit, humor, and narration that moves quick and keeps you interested.\nNear perfect account of an American Icon\nTeam Baby: Baby Nittany Lion [DVD]\nBaby Nittany Lion-Penn State University-Raising to  (Actor),     Wyatt Cagle  (Director)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Kids & Family\n[\"You love your kids, you love your family and you love your Nittany Lions!

Occasionally we'll let him watch it when he sits and plays with his toys.<br /><br />There are sections on Penn State traditions, music, colors, and numbers. It is very basic and kids are drawn to the movement and colors.<br /><br />One thing I like about this as opposed to the Baby Enisten DVDs is that it is basically put in and play. You don't have to sit through trailers or advertisements to get to the stuff baby loves.<br /><br />The video is quick moving, well made. Sound is great!!<br /><br />Wonderful for any Nittany Lion.\nThis is a great product\nExtreme Trains: Season 1\nMatt Bown  (Actor),     History Channel  (Director)    Rated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Special Interests\n['Your ticket to some of the most thrilling, high-octane train rides in history is here!

It's the favorite show of my 4 year old who watches an episode at least daily, and knows more about the operations of railroads than most adults because of this show.<br /><br />The camera work is well done, and captures the hard steel and movement of a train. Matt Bown is a great host who adds excitement and his love of trains with the audience, giving great descriptions of the technical aspects of railroading.  You'll walk away from the show with a greater understanding of trains and a deeper love for them as well.<br /><br />The extras are nice, as there are some scenes from nearly every episode that never aired. I would liked to have seen some audio commentary though.\nA must for the Railfans, kids, and transpotters\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Rodney Ascher'], 'Producers': ['Tim Kirk'], 'Starring': ['Bill Blakemore', 'Geoffrey Cocks', 'Juli Kearns'], 'Studio': ['IFC Films', 'AMC Plus Documentaries']}\nI was hoping this movie would be a serious look at the symbolism and making of The Shining. Instead it is a poorly made and laughable look at the ideas of numerous crackpots who think cans of baking soda are references to genocide.<br /><br />Basically the film makers spliced together B-roll from other movies, dubbed over tinny recorded interviews of crackpots and made a movie. The opinions and ideas from those interviewed are similar to what you would find in a south philly bar at 3pm.<br /><br />Unwatchable...\nPoorly done, boring, interviewees are crazy\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Euros Lyn', 'Paul McGuigan'], 'Producers': ['Sue Vertue', 'Beryl Vertue', 'Steven Moffat', 'Mark Gatiss', 'Rebecca Eaton', 'Bethan Jones'], 'Starring': ['Benedict Cumberbatch', 'Martin Freeman'], 'Studio': ['BBC America']}\nI finally watched Sherlock, and I am hooked. From the first episode, I am a big fan. The first story is so well done, characters are written perfectly, acting is superb, and the way they illustrate the way Sherlock's mind works with superimposed text is a stroke of genious. The first episode is written by Stephen Moffet, so fans of Doctor Who can relate to the quality and depth of the story telling. Masterfully done on all levels. Not a bad episode in either season (Series)\nFantastic story, writing, it will suck you in!\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Martha Coolidge'], 'Producers': ['Brian Grazer'], 'Starring': ['Val Kilmer', 'Gabe Jarret', 'William Atherton'], 'Studio': ['COLUMBIA']}\nMoles and Trolls Moles and Trolls.
