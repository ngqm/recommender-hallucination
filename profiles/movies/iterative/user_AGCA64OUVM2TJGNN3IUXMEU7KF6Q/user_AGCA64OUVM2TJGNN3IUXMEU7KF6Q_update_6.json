Reza left Belgrade more than 30 years ago to seek a new life in Zurich. Now in her 50s, she has completely detached herself from the past.', 'Review', \"Most people, upon reading that this is a Swiss film about women rebuilding their lives in Zurich after fleeing the former Yugoslavia, will feel their eyes involuntarily rolling up into their heads.But despite the occasional sluggish passage, Fraulein is an intriguing picture about people struggling in ways that are so personal that they become universal.Ana (Marija Skaricic) is young and pretty, and has fled the Balkans without a plan she lives out of a bus station locker until she gets a job at a cafe. Her boss, Ruza (Mirjana Karanovic), is older and has had more time to adjust to her new life, adopting a hard-as-nails Germanic attitude. Another cafe employee, Mila (Ljubica Jovic), dreams of returning to Croatia where her husband is building a house. It s primarily a character study, and an excellent one. Director Andrea Staka plays the actors like a fine instrument, eliciting anxiety, pain, passion and joy that feel genuine. --Portland TribuneLOCARNO, Switzerland -- The heartache that accompanies reluctant exile as experienced by three women from the former Yugoslavia underpins Andrea Staka's poignant drama Fraulein which won the Golden Leopard for best film in competition at the Locarno International Film Festival. The film is set in Zurich, where one woman from Belgrade, in what is now Serbia, and another from a seaside town in what is now Croatia have spent about 25 years acclimating to life in Switzerland. Their carefully constructed lives are shaken by the arrival of a vivacious young woman from Sarajevo, in what is now Bosnia, who spurns the older pair's cautious way of life. The clash of viewpoints is explored in touching scenes as the three find their assumptions about survival challenged by a jolting reminder of life's unfairness. Making her feature debut, Swiss-born writer-director Staka, whose parents were Yugoslavian exiles, uses the Zurich locations evocatively, writes in-sightful dialogue and draws naturalistic acting from the principals. The result is a picture that should thrive in Europe and at art houses and suggests a bright future for the filmmaker. The contrasts be-tween the two older women are established quickly with Ruza (Mirjana Karanovic), the stern and disciplined unmarried owner of a charmless but busy diner, and Mila (Ljubica Jovic), a jovial and happily married waitress. Both long exiled, Ruza has put Belgrade behind her and is focused on being totally efficient both in her business and her joyless single life, while Mila dreams of retiring to a house on the Adriatic in Croatia. Into the diner one day comes Ana (Marija Skaricic), who drifts contentedly but proves helpful at the restaurant and is offered a job. Her high spirits and engaging willingness to break the rules, even Ruza's, endear her not only to the others in the place but also to its chilly owner. Ana brings a refreshing indifference to flags and borders, and her ability to enjoy life proves infectious. All three women begin to embrace life more until fate deals another bad hand. The scenes of expatriates torn by nostalgic yearning yet determined to make new lives are well drawn, and the sequences in which Ana helps Ruza shake off her inhibitions also have a keen edge. Skaricic and Jovic show how wisdom and joy are not determined by age. And Karanovic is moving as a woman who has buried both her emotions and any ability to connect with life beyond work until suddenly freed by youthful exuberance. --The Hollywood ReporterWar-torn countries are a popular setting for drama after all war is, perhaps unfortunately, a great dramatic device. But what of the long-term aftermath? What happens to those who flee? Set in Switzerland, this feature debut from Andrea Staka tells the story of three former Yugoslavians not focusing directly on their past but showing, through a complex character study, how that past has shaped their present. Ruza (Mirjana Karanovic) is fiftysomething Serbian, who has filled her life with daily routine. She runs a caf\u00e9 and has no time for frivolity, or the past. She is like a piece of piano wire, which you sense could snap with disastrous consequences. One of her staff, Mila (Ljubica Jovic), is Croatian. Anxious and fussy, she dreams of a return to her homeland and frets about the money her husband is spending on their house back in the old country. Into their lives comes Ana (Marija Skaricic). Fresh from Bosnia, she lives out of a railway station locker, living fast at night, so she can bed hop for comfort. A chance encounter sees her get a job at the caf\u00e9, at which point she begins to reshape Ruza and Mila s routine and perception of their lives, as Ana brings a joie de vivre, even as she struggles with her own pain and past. As a character study, this feels as real as a knife cut, slicing to the heart of shattered dreams, long-forgotten hopes and aspirations which may go unfulfilled. Staka gets to the heart of things. Emotion is kept locked in a box, but when it surfaces, the joy is palpable, like a rainbow on a stormy day. Ruza finds passion and compassion, which well up like an oil strike, bursting to the surface in a blaze of glory. Life and relationships are complex Staka shows us just how much. --Amber Wilkinson, Eye for Film\"]\nAverage Rating: 3.6\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Drama', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Pablo Aguilar, Kenneth Huber, Sebastian Krahenbuehl, Annette Wunsch, David Imhoof, Aniko Donath, Marija Skaricic, Oliver Zgorelec, Andrea Staka, Andrea Zogg, Ljubica Jovic, Mirjana Karanovic, Zdenko JelcicPablo Aguilar, Kenneth Huber, Sebastian Krahenbuehl, Annette Wunsch, David Imhoof, Aniko Donath, Marija Skaricic, Oliver Zgorelec, Andrea Staka, Andrea Zogg, Ljubica Jovic, Mirjana Karanovic, Zdenko Jelcic   See more', 'Language': 'German, Croatian, Serbian', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 21 minutes', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 2.72 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'FILM1502DVD', 'Director': 'Andrea Staka', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, NTSC', 'Run time': '1 hour and 21 minutes', 'Release date': 'November 4, 2008', 'Actors': 'Mirjana Karanovic, Andrea Zogg, Zdenko Jelcic, Marija Skaricic, Pablo Aguilar', 'Studio': 'Film Movement', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: Mirjana Karanovic gives a stellar performance in \"Das Fraulein.\"  Actually every actor is superb and although this story leaves much to the imagination, as a lover of simplicity, I adore this character driven film.  Every frame is intentional, each action is necessary, there is not a thing wasted in this low budget production which surpasses many films that cost ten times its budget.  The audio effects were expertly done, including even the background movement of cars in a parking lot.  From a production standpoint, this was a ten.  In less than an hour and a half, we learned how humans share their lives with only a few words spoken relying on their gestures and actions to propel the story.  Where Woody Allen's characters erupt in verbose thoughts, these characters internalize, reminiscent of New Wave films.  As an example, rather than carry on about a woman watching her life go down the drain, we see her watch the sudsy water flow from the sink.  What could be a morose story becomes uplifting and I'm going to watch this again.\nReview Title: Still thinking about this superb film\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Though the film was not long, I felt it drag and assumed I had missed something critical perhaps while putting my hand into the popcorn or jordan almonds which I'd prepared in advance.  Every aspect of the script seemed to be contrived and the language grew thin with Juno's quips becoming boring after awhile.  The tension never actually climaxed and I was more entertained by the music than the story.  In a nutshell, this movie is far from a classic and weak in the entertainment.

Our hero is Remy, a French rat (voiced by Patton Oswalt) with a cultivated palate, who rises from his humble beginnings to become head chef at a Paris restaurant. How this happens is the stuff of Pixar magic, that ineffable blend of headlong comedy, seamless technology, and wonder (in the latter department, this movie's views of nighttime Paris are on a par with French cinema at its most lyrical). Director Brad Bird (\", 'The Incredibles', \") doesn't quite keep all his spinning plates in the air, but the gags are great and the animation amazingly expressive--Remy's shrugs and nods are nimbler than many flesh-and-blood actors can manage. Refreshingly, the movie's characters aren't celebrity-reliant, with the most recognizable voice coming from Peter O'Toole's snide food critic. (This fellow provides the film's sole sour note--an oddly pointed slap at critics, those craven souls who have done nothing but rave about Pixar's movies over the years.) Brad Bird's style is more quick-hit and less resonant than the approach of Pixar honcho John Lasseter, but it's hard to complain about a movie that cooks up such bountiful pleasure. --\", 'Robert Horton', 'Beyond', 'Ratatouille', 'on DVD', 'Ratatouille', 'on Blu-ray', 'Ratatouille', 'Toys & More', 'Other Classic Pixar Hits', 'Stills from', 'Ratatouille', '(Click for larger image)']\n{'Aspect Ratio': '2.40:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'G (General Audience)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.5 x 0.5 inches; 4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'WD05371400DVD', 'Director': 'Brad Bird, Jan Pinkava', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Dolby, NTSC, Widescreen, Digital Sound', 'Run time': '1 hour and 51 minutes', 'Release date': 'November 6, 2007', 'Actors': 'Brad Garrett, Lou Romano, Patton Oswalt', 'Dubbed': 'English', 'Subtitles': 'English', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround), English (Dolby Digital 5.1), Unqualified (DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1)', 'Studio': 'DISNEY/PIXAR', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nAs a child, I think I would not have been scared of animated rats in the kitchen.  Mice made the most entertaining cartoon characters.  Despite my understanding the magic of animation and being that I did indeed have an unwelcome rat in my kitchen a couple years ago, the notion of rats running through the food, let alone cooking, nauseates me beyond any level of comfort and I found myself cringing throughout \"Ratatouille.\"  Each time I saw the Little Chef on the head of Linguini, I thought it as creepy as the scariest of horror films, particularly since they resembled each other in profile.  I couldn't erase from memory the vision of a three dimensional rodent I photographed running across my balcony.  Nevertheless, I think this film is an outstanding representation of an imaginative story that was successfully translated to film via the collaborative efforts of creative artists.  Mickey Mouse and Mighty Mouse never frightened me as did this film, so I can only assume that had I retained the innocence of youth, I would have been thrilled with the success of the film's heroic underdog, er rather, rat, and not repulsed.  I think kids will love this film.\nMice never scared me like Ratatouille\nI'm Not There (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)\nChristian Bale  (Actor),     David Cross  (Actor),     Todd Haynes  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Musicals & Performing Arts, Musicals\n[\"Since arriving in New York City's folk music scene in the 1960s, American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan has become a major figure in popular music, influencing millions with his chart topping songs.

Language and rhythm.  The poetry and music of the man are the foundation of this film, but, \"I'm Not There,\" offers an architectural disaster built upon that base.  I'm a fan of black and white films, particularly of the fifties and sixties, genres which this attempts to mimic, so I was disappointed when scenes and characters bounced around more haphazardly than kids in the bubble room at Ikea.  Rather than go with the flow, I wanted to stop the DVD and do some research to make sense of the random personas and make some sense of chaos.  My mind set is different now than it was in decades past and I'm less impressed by free-interpretation without reason.  As a college student, I'd studied and written about the art of Bob Dylan, so his words and delivery are not unfamiliar.  I played his music on the guitar and hi-fi, in pre-iPod times.  I've been a fan for many years and have friends who were neighbors of Bob Dylan in Minnesota when he was Robert Allen Zimmerman.  I expected much from this film but basically received flashbacks of the music with allusions to times past.  I gave this film 3 stars for the following positive reasons:  1. Cate Blanchett as Jude Quinn, 2. Richie Havens in the opening scene, 3. Throw away lines that are actually Dylan's lyrics, 4. Remembering the time I had a conversation with Joan Baez at the University of Florida, and 5. The impetus to listen to Bob Dylan on my iPod, then read Allen Ginsberg.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Dylan, I recommend the film/DVD and expect that you too will find things to like even if you may not care for the assembly of this abstract interpretation of the artist as a young/er/est man.\nThe muse of the music was the times.

Before I realized he was the director, as I watched this film, I felt the cinematography, bright colors, and wonderful performances by children were similar to \"Slumdog Millionaire,\" which I saw last month.  Although I'm also a fan of \"Trainspotting,\" I didn't even connect Mr. Boyle to all three films until a few minutes ago.<br /><br />This story is lovely, inspiring, surprising and educational.  Each time the character Damian met a Saint, I learned a little about religion and was amazed at the delivery by this innocent young boy with his lovely and stoic face.  The older brother, Anthony was equally as excellent, showing the determination and strength of the character, but not detracting from his sometimes obscured brotherly love.  The Saints were perfect delusions and the Latter-Day \"Saints\" were not.  The plot inspires discussion and reminds me of the time my sister and I found money outside of a department store and we were fortunate enough to receive it two weeks after we turned it in to security.  Some people thought we should have kept it, but I turned it in without a second's hesitation.  I don't know if I'd do that now as an adult, particularly since well over a hundred dollars can buy a lot of goods off Amazon if you're a seasoned shopper.  Or I could donate it to charity.  Or I could keep half and donate half.<br /><br />Directing child actors is not an easy task and Danny Boyle excels time and again.

The story takes place in Holland nearing the end of World War II and the main character is a young Jewish woman, but Anne Frank this is not.  The film opens with a young woman teaching a class in an Israeli kibbutz as another woman who photographs her after exiting a tourist bus recognizes her.  Following a brief interlude, we move into flashback of over a decade earlier, 1944, and we are introduced to Rachel who lives in a farmhouse.  Immediately, we understand that Rachel is Jewish and she lives with a family that is protecting her from the Nazis.  Verhoeven creates in this film a realistic story that apparently is based on true events and since we saw Rachel in the 1956 opening scene, we know she survived WWII and emigrated from Holland to Israel.  This relieves any tension regarding her possible demise as we watch the next two hours of the film, spoiler unnecessary.<br /><br />The photography was beautiful, the acting superb, the story interesting, and it was rewarding to know that digital effects were kept at an absolute minimum in producing the film, \"Black Book.\"  Verhoeven's commentary was filled with interesting information regarding the filming as well as the history, past and more current, so I also recommend listening after viewing the film.  Details were exceptional and I was mesmerized by the makeup, although I did find it rather annoying to see van Houten always with beautiful makeup regardless of the fact that she endured some horrible experiences.  Her comfort in the naked scenes was exceptional and done very tastefully in each case.  I describe these as \"naked\" rather than \"nude\" because I really felt as though I was observing her and not watching from afar.  This film was part history, part war, part romance, part adventure, and a small part mystery.  All in all, watching this was a rewarding way to spend an afternoon.  It has given me much to think about regarding the humanity of people who demonstrate inhumane actions.

Reza left Belgrade more than 30 years ago to seek a new life in Zurich. Now in her 50s, she has completely detached herself from the past.', 'Review', \"Most people, upon reading that this is a Swiss film about women rebuilding their lives in Zurich after fleeing the former Yugoslavia, will feel their eyes involuntarily rolling up into their heads.But despite the occasional sluggish passage, Fraulein is an intriguing picture about people struggling in ways that are so personal that they become universal.Ana (Marija Skaricic) is young and pretty, and has fled the Balkans without a plan she lives out of a bus station locker until she gets a job at a cafe. Her boss, Ruza (Mirjana Karanovic), is older and has had more time to adjust to her new life, adopting a hard-as-nails Germanic attitude. Another cafe employee, Mila (Ljubica Jovic), dreams of returning to Croatia where her husband is building a house. It s primarily a character study, and an excellent one. Director Andrea Staka plays the actors like a fine instrument, eliciting anxiety, pain, passion and joy that feel genuine. --Portland TribuneLOCARNO, Switzerland -- The heartache that accompanies reluctant exile as experienced by three women from the former Yugoslavia underpins Andrea Staka's poignant drama Fraulein which won the Golden Leopard for best film in competition at the Locarno International Film Festival. The film is set in Zurich, where one woman from Belgrade, in what is now Serbia, and another from a seaside town in what is now Croatia have spent about 25 years acclimating to life in Switzerland. Their carefully constructed lives are shaken by the arrival of a vivacious young woman from Sarajevo, in what is now Bosnia, who spurns the older pair's cautious way of life. The clash of viewpoints is explored in touching scenes as the three find their assumptions about survival challenged by a jolting reminder of life's unfairness. Making her feature debut, Swiss-born writer-director Staka, whose parents were Yugoslavian exiles, uses the Zurich locations evocatively, writes in-sightful dialogue and draws naturalistic acting from the principals. The result is a picture that should thrive in Europe and at art houses and suggests a bright future for the filmmaker. The contrasts be-tween the two older women are established quickly with Ruza (Mirjana Karanovic), the stern and disciplined unmarried owner of a charmless but busy diner, and Mila (Ljubica Jovic), a jovial and happily married waitress. Both long exiled, Ruza has put Belgrade behind her and is focused on being totally efficient both in her business and her joyless single life, while Mila dreams of retiring to a house on the Adriatic in Croatia. Into the diner one day comes Ana (Marija Skaricic), who drifts contentedly but proves helpful at the restaurant and is offered a job. Her high spirits and engaging willingness to break the rules, even Ruza's, endear her not only to the others in the place but also to its chilly owner. Ana brings a refreshing indifference to flags and borders, and her ability to enjoy life proves infectious. All three women begin to embrace life more until fate deals another bad hand. The scenes of expatriates torn by nostalgic yearning yet determined to make new lives are well drawn, and the sequences in which Ana helps Ruza shake off her inhibitions also have a keen edge. Skaricic and Jovic show how wisdom and joy are not determined by age. And Karanovic is moving as a woman who has buried both her emotions and any ability to connect with life beyond work until suddenly freed by youthful exuberance. --The Hollywood ReporterWar-torn countries are a popular setting for drama after all war is, perhaps unfortunately, a great dramatic device. But what of the long-term aftermath? What happens to those who flee? Set in Switzerland, this feature debut from Andrea Staka tells the story of three former Yugoslavians not focusing directly on their past but showing, through a complex character study, how that past has shaped their present. Ruza (Mirjana Karanovic) is fiftysomething Serbian, who has filled her life with daily routine. She runs a caf\u00e9 and has no time for frivolity, or the past. She is like a piece of piano wire, which you sense could snap with disastrous consequences. One of her staff, Mila (Ljubica Jovic), is Croatian. Anxious and fussy, she dreams of a return to her homeland and frets about the money her husband is spending on their house back in the old country. Into their lives comes Ana (Marija Skaricic). Fresh from Bosnia, she lives out of a railway station locker, living fast at night, so she can bed hop for comfort. A chance encounter sees her get a job at the caf\u00e9, at which point she begins to reshape Ruza and Mila s routine and perception of their lives, as Ana brings a joie de vivre, even as she struggles with her own pain and past. As a character study, this feels as real as a knife cut, slicing to the heart of shattered dreams, long-forgotten hopes and aspirations which may go unfulfilled. Staka gets to the heart of things. Emotion is kept locked in a box, but when it surfaces, the joy is palpable, like a rainbow on a stormy day. Ruza finds passion and compassion, which well up like an oil strike, bursting to the surface in a blaze of glory. Life and relationships are complex Staka shows us just how much. --Amber Wilkinson, Eye for Film\"]\n{'Genre': 'Drama', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Pablo Aguilar, Kenneth Huber, Sebastian Krahenbuehl, Annette Wunsch, David Imhoof, Aniko Donath, Marija Skaricic, Oliver Zgorelec, Andrea Staka, Andrea Zogg, Ljubica Jovic, Mirjana Karanovic, Zdenko JelcicPablo Aguilar, Kenneth Huber, Sebastian Krahenbuehl, Annette Wunsch, David Imhoof, Aniko Donath, Marija Skaricic, Oliver Zgorelec, Andrea Staka, Andrea Zogg, Ljubica Jovic, Mirjana Karanovic, Zdenko Jelcic   See more', 'Language': 'German, Croatian, Serbian', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 21 minutes', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 2.72 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'FILM1502DVD', 'Director': 'Andrea Staka', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, NTSC', 'Run time': '1 hour and 21 minutes', 'Release date': 'November 4, 2008', 'Actors': 'Mirjana Karanovic, Andrea Zogg, Zdenko Jelcic, Marija Skaricic, Pablo Aguilar', 'Studio': 'Film Movement', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nMirjana Karanovic gives a stellar performance in \"Das Fraulein.\"  Actually every actor is superb and although this story leaves much to the imagination, as a lover of simplicity, I adore this character driven film.  Every frame is intentional, each action is necessary, there is not a thing wasted in this low budget production which surpasses many films that cost ten times its budget.  The audio effects were expertly done, including even the background movement of cars in a parking lot.  From a production standpoint, this was a ten.  In less than an hour and a half, we learned how humans share their lives with only a few words spoken relying on their gestures and actions to propel the story.  Where Woody Allen's characters erupt in verbose thoughts, these characters internalize, reminiscent of New Wave films.  As an example, rather than carry on about a woman watching her life go down the drain, we see her watch the sudsy water flow from the sink.  What could be a morose story becomes uplifting and I'm going to watch this again.\nStill thinking about this superb film",
