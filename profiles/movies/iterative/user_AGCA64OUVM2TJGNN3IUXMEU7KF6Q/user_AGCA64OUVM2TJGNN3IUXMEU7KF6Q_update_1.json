Instead, she makes a one-time trip into the arms of her best friend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera).

Though the film was not long, I felt it drag and assumed I had missed something critical perhaps while putting my hand into the popcorn or jordan almonds which I'd prepared in advance.  Every aspect of the script seemed to be contrived and the language grew thin with Juno's quips becoming boring after awhile.  The tension never actually climaxed and I was more entertained by the music than the story.  In a nutshell, this movie is far from a classic and weak in the entertainment.  I prefer my films to be more full bodied than light unless the characters or story can carry them to fruition as entertainment.\nReview Title: Napolean Dynamite it's not\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
