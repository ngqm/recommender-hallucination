Language and rhythm.  The poetry and music of the man are the foundation of this film, but, \"I'm Not There,\" offers an architectural disaster built upon that base.  I'm a fan of black and white films, particularly of the fifties and sixties, genres which this attempts to mimic, so I was disappointed when scenes and characters bounced around more haphazardly than kids in the bubble room at Ikea.  Rather than go with the flow, I wanted to stop the DVD and do some research to make sense of the random personas and make some sense of chaos.  My mind set is different now than it was in decades past and I'm less impressed by free-interpretation without reason.  As a college student, I'd studied and written about the art of Bob Dylan, so his words and delivery are not unfamiliar.  I played his music on the guitar and hi-fi, in pre-iPod times.  I've been a fan for many years and have friends who were neighbors of Bob Dylan in Minnesota when he was Robert Allen Zimmerman.  I expected much from this film but basically received flashbacks of the music with allusions to times past.  I gave this film 3 stars for the following positive reasons:  1. Cate Blanchett as Jude Quinn, 2. Richie Havens in the opening scene, 3. Throw away lines that are actually Dylan's lyrics, 4. Remembering the time I had a conversation with Joan Baez at the University of Florida, and 5. The impetus to listen to Bob Dylan on my iPod, then read Allen Ginsberg.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Dylan, I recommend the film/DVD and expect that you too will find things to like even if you may not care for the assembly of this abstract interpretation of the artist as a young/er/est man.\nReview Title: The muse of the music was the times.

While JUNO fits into that same category, this distinctive dramedy is in a class all it\\'s own. Ellen Page (X-MEN: THE LAST STAND) stars as Juno, a witty teenage girl whose boredom doesn\\'t lead her to the mall. Instead, she makes a one-time trip into the arms of her best friend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera).

Director Jason Reitman (\", 'Thank You For Smoking', \") deftly keeps the movie from slipping into easy, shallow sarcasm or foundering in sentimentality. The result is smarter and funnier than you might expect from the subject matter, and warmer and more touching than you might expect from the cocky attitude. Page's performance is deceptively simple; she never asks the audience to love her, yet she effortlessly carries a movie in which she's in almost every scene.

Though the film was not long, I felt it drag and assumed I had missed something critical perhaps while putting my hand into the popcorn or jordan almonds which I'd prepared in advance.  Every aspect of the script seemed to be contrived and the language grew thin with Juno's quips becoming boring after awhile.  The tension never actually climaxed and I was more entertained by the music than the story.  In a nutshell, this movie is far from a classic and weak in the entertainment.  I prefer my films to be more full bodied than light unless the characters or story can carry them to fruition as entertainment.\nNapolean Dynamite it's not\nRatatouille\nBrad Garrett  (Actor),     Lou Romano  (Actor),     Brad Bird  (Director),     Jan Pinkava  (Director)    &                   1                  more   Rated:    G    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment, All Disney Titles\n['Product Description', 'From the creators of CARS and THE INCREDIBLES comes a break-through comedy with something for everyone.

Our hero is Remy, a French rat (voiced by Patton Oswalt) with a cultivated palate, who rises from his humble beginnings to become head chef at a Paris restaurant. How this happens is the stuff of Pixar magic, that ineffable blend of headlong comedy, seamless technology, and wonder (in the latter department, this movie's views of nighttime Paris are on a par with French cinema at its most lyrical). Director Brad Bird (\", 'The Incredibles', \") doesn't quite keep all his spinning plates in the air, but the gags are great and the animation amazingly expressive--Remy's shrugs and nods are nimbler than many flesh-and-blood actors can manage. Refreshingly, the movie's characters aren't celebrity-reliant, with the most recognizable voice coming from Peter O'Toole's snide food critic. (This fellow provides the film's sole sour note--an oddly pointed slap at critics, those craven souls who have done nothing but rave about Pixar's movies over the years.) Brad Bird's style is more quick-hit and less resonant than the approach of Pixar honcho John Lasseter, but it's hard to complain about a movie that cooks up such bountiful pleasure. --\", 'Robert Horton', 'Beyond', 'Ratatouille', 'on DVD', 'Ratatouille', 'on Blu-ray', 'Ratatouille', 'Toys & More', 'Other Classic Pixar Hits', 'Stills from', 'Ratatouille', '(Click for larger image)']\n{'Aspect Ratio': '2.40:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'G (General Audience)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.5 x 0.5 inches; 4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'WD05371400DVD', 'Director': 'Brad Bird, Jan Pinkava', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Dolby, NTSC, Widescreen, Digital Sound', 'Run time': '1 hour and 51 minutes', 'Release date': 'November 6, 2007', 'Actors': 'Brad Garrett, Lou Romano, Patton Oswalt', 'Dubbed': 'English', 'Subtitles': 'English', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround), English (Dolby Digital 5.1), Unqualified (DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1)', 'Studio': 'DISNEY/PIXAR', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nAs a child, I think I would not have been scared of animated rats in the kitchen.  Mice made the most entertaining cartoon characters.  Despite my understanding the magic of animation and being that I did indeed have an unwelcome rat in my kitchen a couple years ago, the notion of rats running through the food, let alone cooking, nauseates me beyond any level of comfort and I found myself cringing throughout \"Ratatouille.\"  Each time I saw the Little Chef on the head of Linguini, I thought it as creepy as the scariest of horror films, particularly since they resembled each other in profile.  I couldn't erase from memory the vision of a three dimensional rodent I photographed running across my balcony.  Nevertheless, I think this film is an outstanding representation of an imaginative story that was successfully translated to film via the collaborative efforts of creative artists.  Mickey Mouse and Mighty Mouse never frightened me as did this film, so I can only assume that had I retained the innocence of youth, I would have been thrilled with the success of the film's heroic underdog, er rather, rat, and not repulsed.  I think kids will love this film.\nMice never scared me like Ratatouille\nI'm Not There (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)\nChristian Bale  (Actor),     David Cross  (Actor),     Todd Haynes  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Musicals & Performing Arts, Musicals\n[\"Since arriving in New York City's folk music scene in the 1960s, American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan has become a major figure in popular music, influencing millions with his chart topping songs.
