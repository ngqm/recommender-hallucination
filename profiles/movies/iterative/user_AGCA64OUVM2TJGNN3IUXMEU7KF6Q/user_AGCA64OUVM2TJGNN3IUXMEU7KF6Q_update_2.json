Our hero is Remy, a French rat (voiced by Patton Oswalt) with a cultivated palate, who rises from his humble beginnings to become head chef at a Paris restaurant.

Director Brad Bird (\", 'The Incredibles', \") doesn't quite keep all his spinning plates in the air, but the gags are great and the animation amazingly expressive--Remy's shrugs and nods are nimbler than many flesh-and-blood actors can manage. Refreshingly, the movie's characters aren't celebrity-reliant, with the most recognizable voice coming from Peter O'Toole's snide food critic.

Mice made the most entertaining cartoon characters.  Despite my understanding the magic of animation and being that I did indeed have an unwelcome rat in my kitchen a couple years ago, the notion of rats running through the food, let alone cooking, nauseates me beyond any level of comfort and I found myself cringing throughout \"Ratatouille.\"  Each time I saw the Little Chef on the head of Linguini, I thought it as creepy as the scariest of horror films, particularly since they resembled each other in profile.  I couldn't erase from memory the vision of a three dimensional rodent I photographed running across my balcony.  Nevertheless, I think this film is an outstanding representation of an imaginative story that was successfully translated to film via the collaborative efforts of creative artists.  Mickey Mouse and Mighty Mouse never frightened me as did this film, so I can only assume that had I retained the innocence of youth, I would have been thrilled with the success of the film's heroic underdog, er rather, rat, and not repulsed.  I think kids will love this film.\nReview Title: Mice never scared me like Ratatouille\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

While JUNO fits into that same category, this distinctive dramedy is in a class all it\\'s own. Ellen Page (X-MEN: THE LAST STAND) stars as Juno, a witty teenage girl whose boredom doesn\\'t lead her to the mall. Instead, she makes a one-time trip into the arms of her best friend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera). When Juno discovers that she\\'s pregnant, she\\'s forced to grow up fast as she tries to find adoptive parents for her quickly growing child.

Gag Takes.', 'Amazon.com', 'Somewhere between the sharp satire of', 'Election', 'and the rich human comedy of', 'You Can Count On Me', 'lies', 'Juno', ', a sardonic but ultimately compassionate story of a pregnant teenage girl who wants to give her baby up for adoption. Social misfit Juno (Ellen Page,', 'Hard Candy', ',', 'X-Men: The Last Stand', ') protects herself with a caustic wit, but when she gets pregnant by her friend Paulie (Michael Cera,', 'Superbad', '), Juno finds herself unwilling to terminate the pregnancy. When she chooses a couple who place a classified ad looking to adopt, Juno gets drawn further into their lives than she anticipated. But', 'Juno', 'is much more than its plot; the stylized dialogue (by screenwriter Diablo Cody) seems forced at first, but soon creates a richly textured world, greatly aided by superb performances by Page, Cera, Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman as the prospective parents, and J.K. Simmons (', 'Spider-Man', \") and Allison Janney as Juno's father and stepmother. Director Jason Reitman (\", 'Thank You For Smoking', \") deftly keeps the movie from slipping into easy, shallow sarcasm or foundering in sentimentality. The result is smarter and funnier than you might expect from the subject matter, and warmer and more touching than you might expect from the cocky attitude. Page's performance is deceptively simple; she never asks the audience to love her, yet she effortlessly carries a movie in which she's in almost every scene.

Though the film was not long, I felt it drag and assumed I had missed something critical perhaps while putting my hand into the popcorn or jordan almonds which I'd prepared in advance.  Every aspect of the script seemed to be contrived and the language grew thin with Juno's quips becoming boring after awhile.  The tension never actually climaxed and I was more entertained by the music than the story.  In a nutshell, this movie is far from a classic and weak in the entertainment.  I prefer my films to be more full bodied than light unless the characters or story can carry them to fruition as entertainment.\nNapolean Dynamite it's not\nRatatouille\nBrad Garrett  (Actor),     Lou Romano  (Actor),     Brad Bird  (Director),     Jan Pinkava  (Director)    &                   1                  more   Rated:    G    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment, All Disney Titles\n['Product Description', 'From the creators of CARS and THE INCREDIBLES comes a break-through comedy with something for everyone.
