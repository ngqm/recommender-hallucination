The mom wasn't 'missing.' She walked out on her two kids and chose to not make contact again. She was found in a few days and wasn't living far from her parents. She wasn't abducted or anything like that as the title would imply.<br /><br />There is little to no mystery here. It's a feel-good documentary, but it has very little substance.<br /><br />I seriously wonder what awards this could have won.\nReview Title: Not recommended\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "The After\nScience Fiction\n['A new Amazon Original Series: From Chris Carter, creator of The X-Files. Eight strangers are thrown together by mysterious forces and must help each other survive in a violent world that defies explanation.

But this isn't a show so much as a series of somewhat related scenes.<br /><br />A rather attractive woman gets nude after IT happens (whatever IT is)...so if that's your thing, at least there's that. To be clear...the girl skinny dips in front of strangers after IT happens because....ratings?<br /><br />I guess ratings are immaterial here. But it's just a very strange thing to shoe-horn into a show about the end of the world.<br /><br />Anyway, cliches ahoy, matey! I think we pretty much have every modern stereotype covered here, and it's all terribly boring.<br /><br />This show is like The Walking Dead with a much smaller budget, worse actors, a much smaller budget and a terrible script.<br /><br />If you do watch it, consider it a comedy going in and you might enjoy it.\nI really wanted to like this. But this isn't a show so much ...\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'smoking', 'foul language'], 'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Christian Tureaud', 'David Salzberg'], 'Producers': ['Christian Tureaud', 'David Salzberg', 'Mike Boettcher', 'Carlos Boettcher'], 'Starring': ['Mike Boettcher', 'Carlos Boettcher'], 'Studio': ['Anderson Digital']}\nGreat film, but why was the son allowed to tag along? That seems really weird and irresponsible. It's an extra person that the soldiers have to babysit.\nGreat film, but why was the son allowed to ...\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': [\"Thaddeus O'Sullivan\"], 'Producers': ['Julie Payne', 'Ann Wingate', 'Frank Doelger', 'Tracey Scoffield', 'David M.

The woman is trying to explain to them that the &#34;pipe&#34; or &#34;bridge&#34; is just a lava tube or molten rock formation (The moon used to be part of the earth) but they are ignoring her. This is bad documentary film making. They are literally just speaking over her with their own interpretations. Why even bother bringing in an expert to look?\nThis is bad documentary film making\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Ellen Goosenberg Kent'], 'Starring': ['Andrea Yates'], 'Studio': ['Fisher Klingenstein Films']}\nTough one. She was acquitted in 2007 by reason of insanity. That should have been the first verdict. She was clearly quite insane Personally, I think the husband is more to blame than she is. He was an enabler. That female prosecutor clearly has no experience with mental illness.\nGood episode, tragic case.\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Ellen Goosenberg Kent'], 'Starring': ['David Koresh'], 'Studio': ['Fisher Klingenstein Films']}\nTough one. The government overreacted, but those people were definitely brainwashed, and it was hardly fair to the kids.

Worth watching, though I deducted one star for including the 'psychic' toward the end.\nWorth a watch\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Lyn Goldfarb', 'Margaret Koval'], 'Producers': ['PBS'], 'Studio': ['PBS']}\nTook several points off because they mention Jesus as if he were a historical person when there is no evidence of this being the case.\nTook several points off because they mention Jesus as if ...\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Vanessa Caswill', 'China Moo-Young'], 'Producers': ['Hugh Warren', 'Elizabeth Kilgarriff'], 'Starring': ['Jodie Comer', 'Natasha Little', 'Stuart Graham'], 'Studio': ['BBC America']}\nI can give it 4 stars because I got it for free with my Prime membership. It's entertaining, but some things about the way the police interact with her are unrealistic.\nWorth a watch if you have Prime\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Annamaria Talas'], 'Producers': ['Annamaria Talas']}\nAmazing. Great graphics. Lots of information conveyed efficiently and simply.<br /><br />I would love to watch Howie Mandel watch this.\nAmazing. Great graphics\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Neil Johnson'], 'Starring': ['E.J. De la Pena', 'Walter Koenig', 'Chris Judge'], 'Studio': ['Distribber']}\nReally, really bad. The 5 star reviews are clearly from people associated with the production. Family/friends, etc.<br /><br />Don't waste your time. Sad to see Chris Judge and Koenig getting roped into this.\nNot worth a watch\n{'Content advisory': ['Foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', 'Deutsch [UT]', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica) [CC]', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a) [CC]', 'Fran\u00e7ais [CC]', 'Italiano [CC]', 'Portugu\u00eas [SDH]'], 'Directors': ['Frida Barkfors', 'Lasse Barkfors'], 'Producers': ['Frida Barkfors', 'Anders Bruus', 'Anne K\u00f6hncke'], 'Studio': ['Journeyman Pictures']}\nSo yeah, this is depressing. But it's objectively a good documentary. The white dude in the beginning definitely should have done *some* time. That's just blatent negligence. Talk about white privilege. (I'm white).\nGood documentary, but sad\n{'Content advisory': ['Alcohol use', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Robert McCallum', 'Jordan C.
