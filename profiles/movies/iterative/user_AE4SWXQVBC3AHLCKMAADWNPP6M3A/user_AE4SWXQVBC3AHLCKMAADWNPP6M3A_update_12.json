But this isn't a show so much as a series of somewhat related scenes.<br /><br />A rather attractive woman gets nude after IT happens (whatever IT is)...so if that's your thing, at least there's that. To be clear...the girl skinny dips in front of strangers after IT happens because....ratings?<br /><br />I guess ratings are immaterial here. But it's just a very strange thing to shoe-horn into a show about the end of the world.<br /><br />Anyway, cliches ahoy, matey! I think we pretty much have every modern stereotype covered here, and it's all terribly boring.<br /><br />This show is like The Walking Dead with a much smaller budget, worse actors, a much smaller budget and a terrible script.<br /><br />If you do watch it, consider it a comedy going in and you might enjoy it.\nI really wanted to like this. But this isn't a show so much ...\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'smoking', 'foul language'], 'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Christian Tureaud', 'David Salzberg'], 'Producers': ['Christian Tureaud', 'David Salzberg', 'Mike Boettcher', 'Carlos Boettcher'], 'Starring': ['Mike Boettcher', 'Carlos Boettcher'], 'Studio': ['Anderson Digital']}\nGreat film, but why was the son allowed to tag along?

The woman is trying to explain to them that the &#34;pipe&#34; or &#34;bridge&#34; is just a lava tube or molten rock formation (The moon used to be part of the earth) but they are ignoring her. This is bad documentary film making. They are literally just speaking over her with their own interpretations.

She was acquitted in 2007 by reason of insanity. That should have been the first verdict. She was clearly quite insane Personally, I think the husband is more to blame than she is. He was an enabler.
