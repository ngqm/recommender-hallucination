Eight strangers are thrown together by mysterious forces and must help each other survive in a violent world that defies explanation. More episodes coming soon exclusively on Prime Instant Video.']\nAverage Rating: 3.8\nProduct Details: {'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Chris Carter'], 'Producers': ['Chris Carter', 'Marc Rosen', 'Gabe Rotter'], 'Starring': ['Aldis Hodge', 'Andrew Howard', 'Arielle Kebbel']}\nReview Text: I really wanted to like this. But this isn't a show so much as a series of somewhat related scenes.<br /><br />A rather attractive woman gets nude after IT happens (whatever IT is)...so if that's your thing, at least there's that. To be clear...the girl skinny dips in front of strangers after IT happens because....ratings?<br /><br />I guess ratings are immaterial here. But it's just a very strange thing to shoe-horn into a show about the end of the world.<br /><br />Anyway, cliches ahoy, matey! I think we pretty much have every modern stereotype covered here, and it's all terribly boring.<br /><br />This show is like The Walking Dead with a much smaller budget, worse actors, a much smaller budget and a terrible script.<br /><br />If you do watch it, consider it a comedy going in and you might enjoy it.\nReview Title: I really wanted to like this.
