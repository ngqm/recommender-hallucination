I believed it was Well Written & the Cast quite Enjoyable to Watch Interact as their Characters. It's Too Bad about the cancellation since last episode's leave you hanging Like most shows do now-a-days; I do believe the story did not end w/the 13th episode. And the death of  Michael Clarke Duncan is so Tragic..  I don't believe they could have found his replacement but perhaps they could have made his death part of the show??? But I am not the person who decides what shows continue & which 1's get axed. Regardless, I have to scratch my head @ their choices.... I DO LOVE THIS SHOW!!!\nReview Title: Come Back to Us!!!

It does start out fairly well IMO but the continued struggle back & forth between Dean & the Angels just seemed to prolong the agony of what needed to be done.. It just kept going back & forth & wasting time w/what they could have been doing. And bringing in the old favorite characters & doing what the writers did, really ticked me off. I think it was definitely a cheap move. Not sure if they had planned a 6th season but why just obliterate all the supporting characters.. It was Stoopid. I collected all of the 1st four seasons but have no intention of owning the 5th & don't have a clue what happened in the 6th.

Anthony Jaswinski's script drops tantalizing references to religious prophecies, human-made catastrophes, and real-life phenomena (including the still unexplained 16th-century disappearance of the entire Roanoke Colony), but never really seems to fix on the specifics of its particular spooky situation, leaving the audience to fill in an increasing number of blanks. That the film ultimately works as well as it does is due to director Brad Anderson, a filmmaker whose previous work (including\", 'The Machinist', 'and the wonderfully upsetting', 'Session 9', \") has displayed a firm grasp of place.
