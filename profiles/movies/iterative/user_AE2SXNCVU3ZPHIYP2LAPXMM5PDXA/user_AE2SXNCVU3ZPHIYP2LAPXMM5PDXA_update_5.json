Michael Westen (Jeffrey Donovan) is in the middle of a top-secret mission when he discovers he\\'s been \"burned\"--basically, fired without warning. After barely extricating himself from danger, he wakes up in Miami, where the government has abandoned him and locked him out of his own bank account. To make ends meet, he takes on private detective jobs (helping an old lady who\\'s fallen victim to a con artist; rescuing a young girl who\\'s being tricked into white slavery; helping a mother whose son has been kidnapped by the boy\\'s father... only it turns out the father is the rightful parent and the \"mom\" is an assassin sent to kill him--a nice guest star appearance by Lucy Lawless,', 'Xena: Warrior Princess', '), while trying to figure out who burned him and why.

The new: A media-savvy way of deconstructing the tricks and techniques of spies and government agencies, often resulting in smart and highly entertaining plot twists. Donovan, handsome but cheeky, combines a light comic touch with a convincing secret agent cool, and the supporting cast fill their niches with aplomb. Their escapades are pretty breezy and occasionally skirt being glib, but most of the time the show finds an extremely entertaining balance between action, romance, and humor. The extras are few (some montages of characteristic moments from the series, including one of the many bikini-clad girls the Miami locale provides) and the commentaries, rather than covering entire episodes, just discuss a few select scenes from each show.
