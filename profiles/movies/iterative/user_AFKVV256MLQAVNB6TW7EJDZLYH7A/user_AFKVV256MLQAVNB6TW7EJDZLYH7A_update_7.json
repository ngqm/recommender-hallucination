So for a study in darkness, this is very well-done. But who needs to study that? I think what we need are lessons in light. Well this movie does some of that too, but kind of too little, too late. The acting is fantastic, as acting goes. The setting is stark, riveting. The story will (unless you are a robot) leave you feeling like the shell-shocked victim of a train that went over a cliff.<br /><br />I always ask myself, at the end of a program or movie or book, bottom line: what are they saying? What's the message? Because no way are programs, movies and books not messages. So what is the message of Ryan's daughter? Well, I can only tell you what it was to me, and I am, as they say in marketing, a random sample.<br /><br />The message to me was: life is unbearably ugly, all but hopeless, but (& here is the too little, too late part) you can always start over, as long as you're not dead. OK ... thanks...?? One person's vision of what life is like, and in spite of the high talent, the exorbitant amt. of $ spent on making movies, and all the effort that went in...that's all it is, thank G-d.\nReview Title: \" The acting is fantastic, as acting goes\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Funny, poignant, as well as truly suspenseful & downright scary at points. You'll get wrapped up, intrigued, surprised, spooked, and definitely entertained. In addition (there's more???) it makes you think, because it touches real life often, as all well-done movies do.<br /><br />Pop some popcorn & &#34;sit for a spell!&#34;\nEnchanting!\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Susan Tully', 'Patrick Lau', 'Alan Grint', 'John Greening', 'Charlie Palmer', 'Moira Armstrong', 'Marc Jobst', 'David Tucker', 'Julian Holmes', 'Paul Marcus'], 'Producers': ['Grainne Marmion', 'Sue Hogg'], 'Starring': ['Brendan Coyle', 'Claudia Blakley', 'Dawn French'], 'Studio': ['BBC America']}\nClassic, excellent-quality, true-to-life drama that preserves the dignity and respect of the human experience, in contrast to all the dismal, superficial &#34;reality&#34; shows and violent &#34;entertainment&#34; which is our current media diet.

This movie was made back in the day where they did not rely on special effects or gruesome visuals to shock (that's cheating, really) - just genuine talent & an intriguing, shivery story.
