Funny, poignant, as well as truly suspenseful & downright scary at points. You'll get wrapped up, intrigued, surprised, spooked, and definitely entertained. In addition (there's more???) it makes you think, because it touches real life often, as all well-done movies do.<br /><br />Pop some popcorn & &#34;sit for a spell!&#34;\nEnchanting!\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Susan Tully', 'Patrick Lau', 'Alan Grint', 'John Greening', 'Charlie Palmer', 'Moira Armstrong', 'Marc Jobst', 'David Tucker', 'Julian Holmes', 'Paul Marcus'], 'Producers': ['Grainne Marmion', 'Sue Hogg'], 'Starring': ['Brendan Coyle', 'Claudia Blakley', 'Dawn French'], 'Studio': ['BBC America']}\nClassic, excellent-quality, true-to-life drama that preserves the dignity and respect of the human experience, in contrast to all the dismal, superficial &#34;reality&#34; shows and violent &#34;entertainment&#34; which is our current media diet. Cleanses the palate, restores and renews faith, hope and love. After watching this, you will respect yourself and others, which is how it should be.\nRestore your faith\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Mike Rohl', 'Michael Robison', 'Matthew Hastings', 'Michael Lange', 'Colin Ferguson', 'Joe Morton', 'Michael Grossman', 'Jefery Levy', 'Jeff Woolnough', 'Eric Laneuville'], 'Starring': ['Colin Ferguson', 'Salli Richardson-Whitfield', 'Joe Morton'], 'Studio': ['SciFi Channel']}\nAs a sci-fi geek, I LOVE this show. It's really a find. Funny, original, intriguing, and rewarding. GOOD acting, engaging characters, and really makes you think. By the time an episode is done, you can't wait to watch the next one. Did I say a real find? Seriously.

It has that unreal, lightning-fast, head-spinning quality to it. However very little actual plot/storyline.

This movie was made back in the day where they did not rely on special effects or gruesome visuals to shock (that's cheating, really) - just genuine talent & an intriguing, shivery story. Current horror flicks could (& should) take a lesson.\nCan't be beat for good old-fashioned TERROR - no need for \"blood & guts\" ...\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['David Lean'], 'Producers': ['Anthony Havelock-Allan'], 'Starring': ['Robert Mitchum', 'Sarah Miles', 'John Mills']}\nA very dark movie, focusing on the shocking and despairing aspects of humankind - not that these don't exist - of course they do; but all media/genres highlight & basically serve up to the public whatever aspect they choose to present about life. So for a study in darkness, this is very well-done. But who needs to study that? I think what we need are lessons in light. Well this movie does some of that too, but kind of too little, too late. The acting is fantastic, as acting goes. The setting is stark, riveting. The story will (unless you are a robot) leave you feeling like the shell-shocked victim of a train that went over a cliff.<br /><br />I always ask myself, at the end of a program or movie or book, bottom line: what are they saying? What's the message? Because no way are programs, movies and books not messages. So what is the message of Ryan's daughter? Well, I can only tell you what it was to me, and I am, as they say in marketing, a random sample.<br /><br />The message to me was: life is unbearably ugly, all but hopeless, but (& here is the too little, too late part) you can always start over, as long as you're not dead. OK ... thanks...?? One person's vision of what life is like, and in spite of the high talent, the exorbitant amt. of $ spent on making movies, and all the effort that went in...that's all it is, thank G-d.\n\" The acting is fantastic, as acting goes\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Hugh Wilson'], 'Producers': ['Scott Rudin'], 'Starring': ['Goldie Hawn', 'Bette Midler', 'Diane Keaton'], 'Studio': ['Paramount Pictures']}\nREALLY funny &, although dramatized of course, touchingly true to life. 3 consummate actresses deliver the goods, & the goods will have you laughing out loud and going away with a smile.
