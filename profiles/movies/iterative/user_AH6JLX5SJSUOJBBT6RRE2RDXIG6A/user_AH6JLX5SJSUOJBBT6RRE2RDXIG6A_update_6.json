I like the message it gives about people in our world (well their world) being different but we still need each other. I don't have much that I don't like about it. Overall love it and the music but the 2 things I feel are slight, personal disappointments:<br /><br />-Renting price: Mixed feelings. Had we seen it in theater we would have easily spent 3 times the amount for one showing (at a dine-in theater) so that's definitely cheaper...but, I guess I had in my mind it was going to be like Onward and have the ability to rent or buy. I'm thankful for the ability to see it since we had been excited for it for while...and a bit of fun to a difficult time. But we likely won't be able to rent it again after this time. So mixed feelings- thankful for the ability of watching it\u2026but also kind of bummed that it still feels a bit expensive, during this time, to rent it. No one made me rent it though still sharing my personal viewpoint \ud83e\udd14<br /><br />-Second: I'm not really strict about kids movies but I am getting tired of kids movies having butt jokes/showing butts\u2026 of course it cracks my kiddo up lol ugh BUT why is it necessary\ud83d\ude12 There's not too much in this one- I think there were just a couple, still though...there are many other ways to make them laugh!<br /><br />ANYWAY, off my soapbox now. I did actually love the movie. We're currently watching it for the third time. My 9 year old is for sure enjoying it!\nWe're loving it!
