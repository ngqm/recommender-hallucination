  "reference_summary": "{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Sam Esmail', 'Jim McKay', 'Tricia Brock', 'Deborah Chow', 'Nisha Ganatra', 'Niels Arden Oplev', 'Christoph Schrewe'], 'Producers': ['Sam Esmail', 'Kyle Bradstreet', 'Steve Golin', 'Chad Hamilton'], 'Starring': ['Rami Malek', 'Christian Slater']}\nPretty clever plot lines (though not always realistic) and very good acting. Far more interesting than you think a &#34;hacker&#34; drama would be.  Definitely R-rated and pushes the limit of that at times. I'll keep watching on Amazon Prime.\nBetter than expected for a hacker drama\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Rob Rapley'], 'Producers': ['Rob Rapley', 'Stephanie Haberman Bordas', 'Kathryn Lord'], 'Starring': ['Michael Murphy', 'Shuler Hensley', 'Kathryn Erbe'], 'Studio': ['PBS']}\nLots of info about presidents Garfield and Arthur I never knew. Garfield could have been one of the best presidents ever. Looks like his doctor did more to kill him than the guy who shot him. Good acting in the docu-drama parts. Very engrossing.\nWell worth your time if you like learning little known history.\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Starring': ['Paul Giamatti', 'Laura Linney', 'Stephen Dilane'], 'Studio': ['HBO']}\nJohnny A finally gets his due! And Abigail too!<br />Fantastic acting. Great production quality for a period piece.<br />Adams, Jefferson, Washington, Hamilton, and Franklin are all here.\nEntertaining and educational! All the founding fathers excellently portrayed--but Abigail steals the show!\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Bill Condon'], 'Producers': ['Anne Carey', 'Iain Canning', 'Emile Sherman', 'Len Blavatnik', 'Aviv Giladi', 'Vince Holden', 'Christine Langan', 'Zanne Devine', 'Amy Nauiokas'], 'Starring': ['Ian McKellen', 'Laura Linney', 'Hiroyuki Sanada'], 'Studio': ['Paramount Pictures']}\nGreat acting but devoid of any action or intrigue. This is a drama about a retired Sherlock slipping into senility.  Mystery fans will be disappointed.\nBoring but well-acted drama. Not a Sherlock mystery movie.\nHeist\nSuspense, Action, Cerebral, Intense\n[\"A casino card dealer, desperate to pay for his daughter's life-saving surgery, teams up with a co-worker to pull off a casino heist, but as the plan falters they find themselves hijacking a bus and using the hostages as collateral.\"]\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Scott Mann'], 'Producers': ['Randall Emmett', 'George Furla', 'Wayne Marc Godfrey', 'Robert Jones', 'Stephen Sepher', 'Alexander Tabrizi'], 'Starring': ['Dave Bautista', 'Jeffrey Dean Morgan', 'Robert De Niro']}\nMajor plot flaws in an otherwise clever heist film.  Despite that, it was worth watching (for free with Prime membership).\nThis is not a DeNiro caliber film--but somewhat enjoyable.\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'frightening scenes', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Sam Raimi'], 'Producers': ['Tom Rosenberg', 'James Jacks', 'Gary Lucchesi', 'Robert G. Tapert', 'Rob Tapert'], 'Starring': ['Keanu Reeves', 'Cate Blanchett', 'Hilary Swank']}\nSuperstar line-up delivers good acting in this redneck-ESP thriller. Keanu makes a good bad guy.\nGood ESP-crime-mystery drama\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English', 'English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Susanne Bier'], 'Producers': ['Susanne Bier', 'Khadija Alami', 'Alexei Boltho', 'Rob Bullock', 'Simon Cornwell', 'Stephen Cornwell', 'Sam Englebardt', 'Jos\u00e9 Luis Escolar', 'David Farr', 'Brian Flanagan'], 'Starring': ['Hugh Laurie', 'Tom Hiddleston', 'Nader Boussandel']}\nHugh Laurie is great.\nA good 6-episode drama.",
