I had originally watched this Fox TV movie back in 1996, but was not able to view it again because I no longer had a working VCR (I had recorded the film myself when it aired). I think that I still own the old VHS tape that I made with the move on it.. but no longer have a VCR.  I have been a huge fan of Doctor Who for years,  so I really wanted to re-visit this special program !!!!!!! The Move was great.. even better than I had remembered it !!!!! I have not yet watched all of the special features on disc 2.. but what I have seen were interesting segments !!!!! In order to watch the DVD on my Windows 10 PC I had to download a free DVD player app from the Windows store called \"Any Player\". (I do not have a DVD player) It was a really enjoyable film !!!!!!\nReview Title: Wonderful DVD Movie..\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

There she is reacquainted with Voight, an old friend who has returned from the war as a paraplegic. Lonely and disconnected from her husband, Fonda finds love, and fulfilling sex, with Voight. The sex scenes, very steamy for the time, are still provocative. This mature love story is about expanding your horizons, and is both moving and thoughtful.

It is very funny, well written, and the characters are very memorable. Griz, Panda, and Ice Bear have each continued to grow on me, the more I have seen them.  And I can't wait to see where new storylines might go.<br /><br />I also noticed that I was still enjoying re-watching each of the episodes, even though I had seen them many times. In my opinion, this series definitely has some real potential.. and it seems to possess a certain appeal!<br /><br />EDITS: And, as many other folks here have said.. each episode seems to include a new song (which relates to the storyline) ..and these songs are also well done, they are rather catchy, and are quite memorable.. (just like what I had said about the characters, a few lines above in this review).<br /><br />In one sense, it is too bad that these little &#34;song sequences&#34; tend to be a bit short.. but they work, and they are cool.<br /><br />So.. in my opinion, &#34;We Bare Bears&#34; is very nicely done, ..a wonderful series thus far!\nWonderful Series!!\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Graeme Harper', 'Euros Lyn', 'Jamie Magnus Stone', 'Douglas Mackinnon', 'Rachel Talalay', 'James Strong', 'Charlie Palmer', 'James Hawes', 'Joe Ahearne', 'Toby Haynes'], 'Starring': ['Christopher Eccleston', 'Billie Piper'], 'Studio': ['BBC America']}\nI recently began watching this show (&#34;Doctor Who Season 1&#34;) on Amazon Prime after having seen some of the episodes (but not all of them) before.<br /><br />So.. I  decided I should probably try starting the series over at the beginning.. and watching it through.  And i am really glad that I did!<br /><br />This show is totally awesome, and it is a whole lot of fun!  It really recaptures a great deal of the feel from the original &#34;Doctor Who&#34; series that began back in the 60's.\nGreat Series!!\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Graeme Harper', 'Euros Lyn', 'Jamie Magnus Stone', 'Douglas Mackinnon', 'Rachel Talalay', 'James Strong', 'Charlie Palmer', 'James Hawes', 'Joe Ahearne', 'Toby Haynes'], 'Starring': ['David Tennant', 'Billie Piper'], 'Studio': ['BBC America']}\nI recently began (re) watching the &#34;new&#34; Doctor Who series from the beginning, ..after having seen many (but not all) of the episodes (basically up to the end of season 4) a few years back.<br /><br />My goal is to get caught up on the series.. and I figured the best thing to do was start at the beginning and watch the all, to refresh my memory.<br /><br />I am very glad that I did.. Season 2 of Doctor Who is really Great! ..and I am really enjoying revisiting the entire series thus far!\nAnother Great Season..\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Graeme Harper', 'Euros Lyn', 'Jamie Magnus Stone', 'Douglas Mackinnon', 'Rachel Talalay', 'James Strong', 'Charlie Palmer', 'James Hawes', 'Joe Ahearne', 'Toby Haynes'], 'Starring': ['David Tennant', 'Freema Agyeman', 'John Barrowman'], 'Studio': ['BBC America']}\nAs I have continued to (re) watch each of these seasons of the &#34;new&#34; Doctor Who series.. I must say that I have been enjoying myself immensely!<br /><br />Season three is another Great season in my opinion.  And even though I believe that I have probably seen all of the episodes in this particular season some time ago.. I am still enjoying re-visiting each one of them and refreshing my memory!<br /><br />The entire series has been terrific thus far.\nGreat Series, and Great Fun!..\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Graeme Harper', 'Euros Lyn', 'Jamie Magnus Stone', 'Douglas Mackinnon', 'Rachel Talalay', 'James Strong', 'Charlie Palmer', 'James Hawes', 'Joe Ahearne', 'Toby Haynes'], 'Starring': ['David Tennant', 'Catherine Tate', 'Freema Agyeman'], 'Studio': ['BBC America']}\nVery *minor spoilers* concerning the Doctor..<br /><br />I have continued to (re)watch (and to truly enjoy) each season of the &#34;new&#34; Doctor Who series! And season four of Doctor Who has got to be one of my favorite seasons (thus far).<br /><br />In fact, now that I have finished (re)watching all of season four.. I am &#34;caught up&#34; with as many episodes as I have previously seen of the series. Meaning that from this point on.. I will be watching any &#34;future&#34; episodes for the first time.<br /><br />Season four of Doctor Who was really great! You have got to love Donna Noble!  She and David Tennant's Doctor make a great combination.<br /><br />And I just want  to mention that after finishing season four.. viewers should watch &#34;Doctor Who: The David Tennant Specials ...&#34; next, in order not to miss any parts of the story.<br /><br />Again, after completing season four.. you should then watch the &#34;Doctor Who: The David Tennant Specials ...&#34; next (and not just go on with season five.. because the story line continues with the specials) -- before season five begins with the new Doctor.<br /><br />&#34;Doctor Who: The David Tennant Specials ...&#34; is actually a short &#34;season&#34; of eight specials which are the final episodes of David Tennant's Doctor.<br /><br />Episode 1: Planet of the Dead<br />Episode 2: The Doctor Who Confidential: Planet of the Dead (commentary)<br /><br />Episode 3: The Waters of Mars<br />Episode 4: The Doctor Who Confidential: The Waters of Mars (commentary)<br /><br />Episode 5: End of Time, Part 1<br />Episode 6: The Doctor Who Confidential: End of Time, Part 1 (commentary)<br /><br />Episode 7: End of Time, Part 2<br />Episode 8: The Doctor Who Confidential: End of Time, Part 2 (commentary)<br /><br />(You can skip the commentaries if you want to.. but I would not, because but they are good.. and well worth watching.. especially once you have seen the particular episode that they talk about).<br /><br />Then go on to watch season five of the series..\nGreat Season.. (*minor spoilers* concerning the Doctor..)\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Graeme Harper', 'Euros Lyn', 'Jamie Magnus Stone', 'Douglas Mackinnon', 'Rachel Talalay', 'James Strong', 'Charlie Palmer', 'James Hawes', 'Joe Ahearne', 'Toby Haynes']}\nAwesome special episodes!! The Great series continues!<br /><br />I watched this Wonderful but short &#34;season&#34; of eight specials.. which are the final episodes of David Tennant's Doctor.. (and as such should be viewed following season four of &#34;Doctor Who&#34;.. and before continuing on with season five..)\nAwesome special episodes!!

This season introduces some very interesting (and memorable) characters.. along with some rather surprising storylines!<br /><br />Corrected Edit: Oh.. and I think that viewers are probably supposed to watch at least one of the episodes found in  \u201dSeason 1&#34; of the \u201dDoctor Who - Christmas Specials&#34; next (after finishing season five of the series).. before going on to season six.<br /><br />Further Edit: Yes, according to a Wiki page that I found.. after watching the last episode in season 5 of &#34;Doctor Who&#34; (&#34;The Big Bang&#34;) you should then watch the December 25, 2010 Christmas special (&#34;A Christmas Carol&#34;) (found in  \u201dSeason 1&#34; of the \u201dDoctor Who - Christmas Specials&#34;).. before beginning to watch season six.<br /><br />So in the  future you may want to check the dates of the specials (meaning mostly the year) to be sure that you are watching episodes in the right order.
