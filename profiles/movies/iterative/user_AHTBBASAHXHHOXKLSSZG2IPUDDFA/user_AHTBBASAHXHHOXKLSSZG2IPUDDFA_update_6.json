It is very funny, well written, and the characters are very memorable. Griz, Panda, and Ice Bear have each continued to grow on me, the more I have seen them.  And I can't wait to see where new storylines might go.<br /><br />I also noticed that I was still enjoying re-watching each of the episodes, even though I had seen them many times. In my opinion, this series definitely has some real potential.. and it seems to possess a certain appeal!<br /><br />EDITS: And, as many other folks here have said.. each episode seems to include a new song (which relates to the storyline) ..and these songs are also well done, they are rather catchy, and are quite memorable.. (just like what I had said about the characters, a few lines above in this review).<br /><br />In one sense, it is too bad that these little &#34;song sequences&#34; tend to be a bit short.. but they work, and they are cool.<br /><br />So.. in my opinion, &#34;We Bare Bears&#34; is very nicely done, ..a wonderful series thus far!\nReview Title: Wonderful Series!!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Fonda, feeling isolated while her hawkish husband, Bruce Dern, is away in Vietnam, follows a friend's example and volunteers at a veteran's hospital. There she is reacquainted with Voight, an old friend who has returned from the war as a paraplegic. Lonely and disconnected from her husband, Fonda finds love, and fulfilling sex, with Voight. The sex scenes, very steamy for the time, are still provocative. This mature love story is about expanding your horizons, and is both moving and thoughtful. Director Hal Ashby (\", 'Harold and Maude', ') does succumb to melodrama on occasion, but these are forgivable slips.', \"--Rochelle O'Gorman\"]\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.32 x 4.19 x 1.12 inches; 6.13 Ounces', 'Director': 'Hal Ashby', 'Run time': '2 hours and 7 minutes', 'Release date': 'July 8, 1997', 'Date First Available': 'September 29, 2006', 'Actors': 'Jane Fonda, Jon Voight, Bruce Dern, Penelope Milford, Robert Carradine', 'Studio': 'MGM (Video & DVD)', 'Producers': 'Bruce Gilbert, Jerome Hellman', 'Writers': 'Nancy Dowd, Robert C.

Eventually, it evolved into this vanity production for Barbra Streisand, with Kris Kristofferson as the designated stud muffin. The story remains the same: A superstar on the decline meets a young singer on the way up. They marry as their career trajectories intersect, and his eventual demise is meant as a sacrifice to further boost her career by ridding her of the burden of him. Kristofferson\\'s rock & roll numbers are decidedly lousy--Hollywood\\'s idea of rock music--and Streisand looks good and always sounds fine (she won an Oscar for cowriting the song \"Evergreen\"). But you can feel her heavy hand guiding every shot; she seems to serve as puppet master for director Frank Pierson, framing every image of herself for maximum glow.
