Fonda, feeling isolated while her hawkish husband, Bruce Dern, is away in Vietnam, follows a friend's example and volunteers at a veteran's hospital. There she is reacquainted with Voight, an old friend who has returned from the war as a paraplegic. Lonely and disconnected from her husband, Fonda finds love, and fulfilling sex, with Voight. The sex scenes, very steamy for the time, are still provocative. This mature love story is about expanding your horizons, and is both moving and thoughtful. Director Hal Ashby (\", 'Harold and Maude', ') does succumb to melodrama on occasion, but these are forgivable slips.', \"--Rochelle O'Gorman\"]\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.32 x 4.19 x 1.12 inches; 6.13 Ounces', 'Director': 'Hal Ashby', 'Run time': '2 hours and 7 minutes', 'Release date': 'July 8, 1997', 'Date First Available': 'September 29, 2006', 'Actors': 'Jane Fonda, Jon Voight, Bruce Dern, Penelope Milford, Robert Carradine', 'Studio': 'MGM (Video & DVD)', 'Producers': 'Bruce Gilbert, Jerome Hellman', 'Writers': 'Nancy Dowd, Robert C.

Eventually, it evolved into this vanity production for Barbra Streisand, with Kris Kristofferson as the designated stud muffin. The story remains the same: A superstar on the decline meets a young singer on the way up. They marry as their career trajectories intersect, and his eventual demise is meant as a sacrifice to further boost her career by ridding her of the burden of him. Kristofferson\\'s rock & roll numbers are decidedly lousy--Hollywood\\'s idea of rock music--and Streisand looks good and always sounds fine (she won an Oscar for cowriting the song \"Evergreen\"). But you can feel her heavy hand guiding every shot; she seems to serve as puppet master for director Frank Pierson, framing every image of herself for maximum glow. The ultimate date flick (if the guy can sit still through it).', '--Marshall Fine']\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.32 x 4.19 x 1.12 inches; 6.08 Ounces', 'Director': 'Frank Pierson', 'Run time': '2 hours and 19 minutes', 'Release date': 'April 15, 1992', 'Date First Available': 'December 7, 2006', 'Actors': 'Barbra Streisand, Kris Kristofferson, Gary Busey, Oliver Clark, Venetta Fields', 'Studio': 'Warner Home Video', 'Writers': 'Alvin Sargent, Frank Pierson, Jay Presson Allen, Joan Didion, John Gregory Dunne'}\nI purchased this VHS tape as a gift for a friend.
