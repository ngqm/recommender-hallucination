I am hearing impaired and missed a lot of dialog when it was on so I was looking forward to watching these with the captioning.  Many of the seasons do not have this option.  It's great to watch without commercials!  With so little to watch on TV these days, this has been a real treat for me.  I just wish the captioning wasn't missing on so many seasons.\nCaptions for Hearing Impaired are missing on some.\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Daniel Petrie'], 'Producers': ['David W. Rintels'], 'Starring': ['Jeff Fahey', 'Morgan Freeman', 'Laurie Metcalf'], 'Studio': ['Fisher Klingenstein Films']}\nThis was a very good movie, however I found it a bit slow moving in parts.  The acting was very good and I'm a huge fan of Morgan Freeman.  His part in this movie didn't seem to be awesome; it wasn't him - it was the part!  Not enough punch for me.  He's capable of so much more but the opportunity to give more wasn't there.\nOK, but I expected more.\nThe Ghost and the Darkness\nMichael Douglas  (Actor),     Val Kilmer  (Actor),     Stephen Hopkins  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Action & Adventure\n['Product Description', \"Only the most incredible parts of the story are true. Michael Douglas and Val Kilmer star in this tense, terrific and true adventure set in 1896 East Africa. There, two lions on man-eating rampage have shut down the construction of a railway. The beasts hunt together, showing no fear of man or fire. What's more, they're killing for sport rather than for food-and they have an almost supernatural knack for knowing what traps await them. Big-game hunter Remington (Douglas) and construction engineer Patterson (Kilmer) set out to stop these unstoppable monsters. But, in this astonishing tale of man against beast, the hunters become the hunted.\", 'Amazon.com', \"Val Kilmer stars as Lt. Col. John Patterson, a 19th-century Irish engineer drafted by Britain's railroad bosses to build a trestle bridge over an African river, thus expanding the empire a tiny bit more. In Tsavo, Patterson is instantly hailed for killing a man-eating lion that had been making life hell for native workers. But morale sinks when a pair of unstoppable big cats devour more men and destroy the project. Along comes an Ahab-like, expatriate American hunter (Michael Douglas) to help Patterson face the almost preternatural powers of the two killers. The script by William Goldman (\", 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid', ') is based on fact, though the film owes more to Spielberg (specifically to', 'Jaws', ') than history. There are also suggestive echoes of Kipling and Conrad in the material and characters, and there are hints of emotional complexity and psychological nuance that make one wish this could have been a great film instead of a merely fun one.', '--Tom Keogh']\n{'Genre': 'Action & Adventure', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, Letterboxed, AC-3, Closed-captioned, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Kurt Egelhof, John Kani, Bernard Hill, Om Puri, Tom Wilkinson, William Goldman, Michael Douglas, Henry Cele, Brian McCardie, Satchu Annamalai, Stephen Hopkins, Teddy Reddy, Val Kilmer, Emily MortimerKurt Egelhof, John Kani, Bernard Hill, Om Puri, Tom Wilkinson, William Goldman, Michael Douglas, Henry Cele, Brian McCardie, Satchu Annamalai, Stephen Hopkins, Teddy Reddy, Val Kilmer, Emily Mortimer   See more', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround), English (Dolby Digital 5.1), French (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround), Unqualified', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 49 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '2.35:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.75 x 5.75 x 0.53 inches; 4 Ounces', 'Director': 'Stephen Hopkins', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, Letterboxed, AC-3, Closed-captioned, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Run time': '1 hour and 49 minutes', 'Release date': 'December 1, 1998', 'Actors': 'Michael Douglas, Val Kilmer, Tom Wilkinson, John Kani, Bernard Hill', 'Subtitles': 'Spanish', 'Studio': 'Paramount', 'Writers': 'William Goldman', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nGreat (older) movie.

Shelly Long is quite good in the roll of the adult woman who begins to remember tragic events involving her father.  It takes a very strong woman to do what this character did.  It makes me wonder how many children's lives were damaged in the interim time period.\nCourage at it's best.\nNorma Rae: 35th Anniversary\nSally Field  (Actor),     Beau Bridges  (Actor),     Martin Ritt  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG    Format: Blu-ray\nMovies & TV, Featured Categories, Blu-ray, Drama\n['A union organizer from up North recruits a divorced cotton-mill worker down South.
