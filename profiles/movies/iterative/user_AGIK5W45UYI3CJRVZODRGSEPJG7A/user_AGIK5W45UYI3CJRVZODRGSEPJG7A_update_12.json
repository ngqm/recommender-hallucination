Michael Douglas and Val Kilmer star in this tense, terrific and true adventure set in 1896 East Africa. There, two lions on man-eating rampage have shut down the construction of a railway. The beasts hunt together, showing no fear of man or fire. What's more, they're killing for sport rather than for food-and they have an almost supernatural knack for knowing what traps await them. Big-game hunter Remington (Douglas) and construction engineer Patterson (Kilmer) set out to stop these unstoppable monsters. But, in this astonishing tale of man against beast, the hunters become the hunted.\", 'Amazon.com', \"Val Kilmer stars as Lt. Col. John Patterson, a 19th-century Irish engineer drafted by Britain's railroad bosses to build a trestle bridge over an African river, thus expanding the empire a tiny bit more. In Tsavo, Patterson is instantly hailed for killing a man-eating lion that had been making life hell for native workers. But morale sinks when a pair of unstoppable big cats devour more men and destroy the project. Along comes an Ahab-like, expatriate American hunter (Michael Douglas) to help Patterson face the almost preternatural powers of the two killers. The script by William Goldman (\", 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid', ') is based on fact, though the film owes more to Spielberg (specifically to', 'Jaws', ') than history. There are also suggestive echoes of Kipling and Conrad in the material and characters, and there are hints of emotional complexity and psychological nuance that make one wish this could have been a great film instead of a merely fun one.', '--Tom Keogh']\n{'Genre': 'Action & Adventure', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, Letterboxed, AC-3, Closed-captioned, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Kurt Egelhof, John Kani, Bernard Hill, Om Puri, Tom Wilkinson, William Goldman, Michael Douglas, Henry Cele, Brian McCardie, Satchu Annamalai, Stephen Hopkins, Teddy Reddy, Val Kilmer, Emily MortimerKurt Egelhof, John Kani, Bernard Hill, Om Puri, Tom Wilkinson, William Goldman, Michael Douglas, Henry Cele, Brian McCardie, Satchu Annamalai, Stephen Hopkins, Teddy Reddy, Val Kilmer, Emily Mortimer   See more', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround), English (Dolby Digital 5.1), French (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround), Unqualified', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 49 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '2.35:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.75 x 5.75 x 0.53 inches; 4 Ounces', 'Director': 'Stephen Hopkins', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, Letterboxed, AC-3, Closed-captioned, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Run time': '1 hour and 49 minutes', 'Release date': 'December 1, 1998', 'Actors': 'Michael Douglas, Val Kilmer, Tom Wilkinson, John Kani, Bernard Hill', 'Subtitles': 'Spanish', 'Studio': 'Paramount', 'Writers': 'William Goldman', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nGreat (older) movie.

Sally Field - in an Emmy Award winning and career-turning performance - portrays Sybil, a woman suffering from multiple personality disorder who develops over 16 distinct personalities in order to cope and escape haunting memories of her harrowing childhood. Joanne Woodward plays the understanding and compassionate psychiatrist that helps Sybil confront her horrific past and eliminate her demons.', ']]>', 'Amazon.com', 'The word \"landmark\" is fairly used in the case of', 'Sybil', \": this 1976 TV movie brought new frankness to television, it raised the quality bar for the made-for-television movie, and it utterly changed the career of a future Oscar-winning actress. The film was based on the bestselling nonfiction book about a multiple-personality patient and her exhaustive therapy. It opens with a brilliant series of scenes that suggest how a young woman named Sybil (Sally Field) experiences unexplained blackouts, which brings her to the attention of a psychiatrist, Dr. Wilbur (Joanne Woodward). The film unfolds around the searching therapy sessions, laced with flashbacks to Sybil's toxic childhood. There's also a tentative romance between the lonely Sybil and a manchild (Brad Davis) who lives across the alley. Most notably, of course, there are the appearances of Sybil's alternate personalities, who express her strangled emotional life. Stewart Stern's sensitive script seems to flow organically from one scene to the next, and director Daniel Petrie frequently allows the camera to observe the acting acrobatics in long, challenging takes.\", 'Woodward, who won an Oscar for playing a multiple-personality patient in', 'The Three Faces of Eve', ', is all nurturing warmth as the steadfast doctor. But really this film was a sober coming-out party for Sally Field, who astonished viewers at the time by erasing all memories of', 'Gidget', 'and', 'The Flying Nun', \", the bubblegum roles she'd mostly been known for. Field's work is anguished but non-actor-y, and despite the character's hidden personalities, she seems as clear as day in her performance. The production won four Emmys, not surprisingly including nods for Field, Stern, and Outstanding Special (Drama).\", 'The 187-minute movie takes up one disc; the second disc has informative featurettes about the making of the film.', 'Examining Sybil', \"is an absorbing hour-long documentary with comments from Field and Woodward, as well as executive producer Peter Dunne. It is dominated by the spellbinding storytelling of Stewart Stern, who developed the screenplay by spending time with the real Dr. Wilbur and listening to tapes of her sessions with Sybil. His tale of Sally Field's unlikely audition triumph is a small movie in itself.\", 'The Paintings of Sybil', 'presents a generous selection of paintings by the real Sybil (who became a professor of art), along with recollections by one of her friends. Something listed on the DVD cover as \"Sybil Therapy Session\" is misleadingly titled, suggesting some kind of actual footage or transcript of the real Sybil and her treatment; in fact, it\\'s Stewart Stern describing the harrowing process of listening to the doctor\\'s tapes.
