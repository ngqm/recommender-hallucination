He taught them about the paranormal evil that lives in the dark corners and on the back roads of America...and he taught them how to kill it. Sam, however, wanted nothing to do with this violent and dangerous life, and he left it behind, until the day Dean appeared on his doorstep with troubling news. Their father had gone missing on a \"hunting trip.\" Sam and Dean have spent the last year cruising the highways of the United States searching for their lost father and encountering creatures that most people believe exist only in folklore, superstition and nightmares.

Season Two maintains the show\\'s \"Monster of the Week\" approach while adding compelling layers to the main characters and their history; in \"What Is And What Should Never Be,\" a djinn offers the boys a glimpse of how their lives might\\'ve played out had their mother not succumbed to demonic forces, while the two-part \"All Hell Breaks Loose\" brings the season to a close with not only a rift between Sam and Dean, but the gates of Hell swinging open to unleash monstrous spirits. And if that\\'s not enough of a creepshow for you, the boys also encounter a cannibal clown (\"Everybody Loves a Clown\"), seductive demons (\"Crossroad Blues\"), a town gripped by mass psychosis (\"Croatoan\"), as well as a barrage of ghosts, vampires and werewolves.
