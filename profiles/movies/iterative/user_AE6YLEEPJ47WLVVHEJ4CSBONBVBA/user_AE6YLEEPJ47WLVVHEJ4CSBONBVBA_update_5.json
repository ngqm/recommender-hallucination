This eventful year at McKinley High School begins with the glee club New Directions recruiting more members, Coach Sue Sylvester running for congress, Blaine transferring to McKinley, and several original New Directions members finishing up their senior year. As graduation nears, Rachel and Kurt struggle through the application procedure to gain acceptance into their college choice NYADA, there are a couple of wedding proposals (one more unexpected than the other), and Santana examines her sexual orientation. Mike Chang struggles with parental expectations, Kurt and Blaine hit a rocky patch, and Mercedes finds herself at the center of an interesting love triangle. Coaches Sylvester and Beiste each reveal a whole new side of their personalities, a serious accident threatens to derail several lives, and, of course, New Directions takes another crack at winning Regionals. As good as the stories and characters are, the best thing about', 'Glee', 'is the musical performances, and this season does not disappoint. Broadway-inspired numbers from shows like', 'Hairspray', ',', 'West Side Story', ', and', 'Dreamgirls', 'are passionately delivered right alongside classic rock and pop songs from bands such as Foreigner and Chicago and iconic artists like Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston. There are also plenty of songs made popular by contemporary artists like Coldplay, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Jason Mraz, and Taylor Swift. The special \"Extraordinary Merry Christmas\" episode takes the glee club back into the past when times were simpler and delivers a fine parody of 1950s-sitcom holiday specials with songs like \"Blue Christmas,\" \"Let It Snow,\" and \"My Favorite Things.\" The Michael Jackson-themed episode \"Michael\" celebrates the decades of musical contributions of an amazing artist, with songs ranging from \"Never Can Say Goodbye\" to \"I Just Can\\'t Stop Loving You\" and \"Black and White.\" The Whitney Houston-themed episode \"Dance with Somebody,\" aired just following Houston\\'s unexpected passing, pays tribute to a phenomenal artist with power-driven songs like \"Saving All My Love for You,\" \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody,\" and \"I Have Nothing.\" This season features some unexpected solos and vocal pairings for the regular cast; recurring roles for', 'Glee Project', 'winners Samuel Larsen (Joe Hart) and Damian McGinty (Rory Flanagan), and contestants Alex Newell (Wade) and Lindsay Pearce (Harmony); and an amazing list of guest artists, including Idina Menzel, Whoopi Goldberg, Brian Stokes Mitchell, Ricky Martin, Gloria Estefan, and Lindsay Lohan. The \"Jukebox\" special feature allows viewers to select and play the musical numbers from each episode. Other bonus features include a couple of deleted and extended scenes, a \"Glee Under the Stars\" interview session, the \"Glee Give a Note\" check presentation and student interviews from Culver City Middle School, and a behind-the-scenes look at the \"Props\" episode.

Fresh energy came from the new students, guest star Gwyneth Paltrow as substitute teacher Holly Holliday, and new football coach Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones), who even inspires a temporary alliance between Will and Sue (Jane Lynch).
