That's all I was able to say just right now as I finished watching.  Great take in cause/effect, choices, and indeed the question if we are pre-destined to a fate. I have to say, soon after the film starts there's like 45minutes or so that can feel like an eternity as it's very slow while a very long conversation b/w the characters takes place, but it sets up the rest beautifully.  Totally worth it.  Ethan Hawke gave a great performance.  Hats off to him.\nHats off to Ethan Hawke\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Tim Bartell'], 'Producers': ['Justin Hogan', 'Cameron McIntyre', 'Tim Bartell'], 'Starring': ['Ricky Mabe', 'Jordan Monaghan', 'Conor Leslie'], 'Studio': ['Indie Rights']}\n1 1/2 stars at best.
