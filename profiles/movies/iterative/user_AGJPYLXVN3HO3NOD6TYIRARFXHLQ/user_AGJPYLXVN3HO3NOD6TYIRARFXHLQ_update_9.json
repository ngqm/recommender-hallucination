That's all I was able to say just right now as I finished watching.  Great take in cause/effect, choices, and indeed the question if we are pre-destined to a fate. I have to say, soon after the film starts there's like 45minutes or so that can feel like an eternity as it's very slow while a very long conversation b/w the characters takes place, but it sets up the rest beautifully.  Totally worth it.  Ethan Hawke gave a great performance.  Hats off to him.\nHats off to Ethan Hawke\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Tim Bartell'], 'Producers': ['Justin Hogan', 'Cameron McIntyre', 'Tim Bartell'], 'Starring': ['Ricky Mabe', 'Jordan Monaghan', 'Conor Leslie'], 'Studio': ['Indie Rights']}\n1 1/2 stars at best.  It showed a lot of promise within the first few minutes but once it gets into the story line, it absolutely tanks.  Gotta wonder about who wrote those 5 stars reviews, that coincidentally were all written within a day or two of each other.\nTotally tanks\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Jake Oelman'], 'Producers': ['Ford Oelman', 'Jake Oelman', 'Jake Limbert'], 'Starring': ['Joe Mazzello', 'Michelle Forbes', 'Josh Fadem'], 'Studio': ['Kinonation']}\nThis movie went nowhere really really fast.  The main character's personality is so stiff and dry is not even funny.  I was fooled  after having seen the preview.  A real disappointment.\nThe main character's personality is so stiff and dry is not even funny.

I really enjoy Aniston's character's - maybe it's just her I really like, but that's not here not there - Movie could've used better writing.  Acting was overall okay.  They were just strapped to a poor script.  Though, comedy is not Butler's forte.  Editing was also very suspect.  This is one of those movies where less would've been more -way more.  I barely made it to the end.  Three stars is really generous.  Trailer had movie expectations way higher.  Too bad.\nDisappointing\nFrench Kiss\nMeg Ryan  (Actor),     Kevin Kline  (Actor),     Lawrence Kasidan  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Studio Specials, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, All Fox Titles\n['Meg Ryan (\"Sleepless in Seattle\") and Kevin Kline (\"Dave\") star in this bouncy romantic comedy about life, love and larceny.

Movie has a purple/yellow line on the left side of the screen.  I returned it and got a new replacement copy...with the very same issue!  another reviewer mentioned same issue. Must be a manufacturing issue with this new release.  Also no true widescreen.  Really disappointed.\nBad DVD quality.\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Lisa Azuelos'], 'Producers': ['Lisa Azuelos'], 'Starring': ['Sophie Marceau']}\nThis movie had me intoxicated flying as a kite.
