That's all I was able to say just right now as I finished watching.  Great take in cause/effect, choices, and indeed the question if we are pre-destined to a fate. I have to say, soon after the film starts there's like 45minutes or so that can feel like an eternity as it's very slow while a very long conversation b/w the characters takes place, but it sets up the rest beautifully.  Totally worth it.  Ethan Hawke gave a great performance.  Hats off to him.\nHats off to Ethan Hawke\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Tim Bartell'], 'Producers': ['Justin Hogan', 'Cameron McIntyre', 'Tim Bartell'], 'Starring': ['Ricky Mabe', 'Jordan Monaghan', 'Conor Leslie'], 'Studio': ['Indie Rights']}\n1 1/2 stars at best.  It showed a lot of promise within the first few minutes but once it gets into the story line, it absolutely tanks.  Gotta wonder about who wrote those 5 stars reviews, that coincidentally were all written within a day or two of each other.\nTotally tanks\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Jake Oelman'], 'Producers': ['Ford Oelman', 'Jake Oelman', 'Jake Limbert'], 'Starring': ['Joe Mazzello', 'Michelle Forbes', 'Josh Fadem'], 'Studio': ['Kinonation']}\nThis movie went nowhere really really fast.  The main character's personality is so stiff and dry is not even funny.  I was fooled  after having seen the preview.  A real disappointment.\nThe main character's personality is so stiff and dry is not even funny.

I really enjoy Aniston's character's - maybe it's just her I really like, but that's not here not there - Movie could've used better writing.  Acting was overall okay.  They were just strapped to a poor script.  Though, comedy is not Butler's forte.  Editing was also very suspect.  This is one of those movies where less would've been more -way more.  I barely made it to the end.  Three stars is really generous.  Trailer had movie expectations way higher.  Too bad.\nDisappointing\nFrench Kiss\nMeg Ryan  (Actor),     Kevin Kline  (Actor),     Lawrence Kasidan  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Studio Specials, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, All Fox Titles\n['Meg Ryan (\"Sleepless in Seattle\") and Kevin Kline (\"Dave\") star in this bouncy romantic comedy about life, love and larceny.

Movie has a purple/yellow line on the left side of the screen.  I returned it and got a new replacement copy...with the very same issue!  another reviewer mentioned same issue. Must be a manufacturing issue with this new release.  Also no true widescreen.  Really disappointed.\nBad DVD quality.\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Lisa Azuelos'], 'Producers': ['Lisa Azuelos'], 'Starring': ['Sophie Marceau']}\nThis movie had me intoxicated flying as a kite. Wish I had a some wine while watching it. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Though, the final scene brought me crashing down to earth... I would've stayed floating up in the clouds...\nLe Magnifique!\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Didier Le P\u00eacheur'], 'Producers': ['Clementine Dabadie'], 'Starring': ['Mathilde Seigner'], 'Studio': ['Under The Milky Way']}\nI did not read nor I was aware of the book the movie is based on.  However, this movie works great taking you with its charm and quirkiness, wondering how it will develop. As soon as you feel invested in the story and its characters, it becomes a real downer of a movie.\nNot what it seems...\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['Davvis\u00e1megiella'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Hannes Holm'], 'Producers': ['Annica Bellander', 'Nicklas Wikstr\u00f6m Nicastro'], 'Starring': ['Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd', 'Bahar Pars', 'Zozan Akg\u00fcn'], 'Studio': ['Music Box Films']}\nGreat story.  What an awesome treat.  You'll ponder, laugh, cry, and smile.  As far as subtitles, Ove would've been very disappointed people cannot figure out to just turn their subtitles on, on the settings!  C'mon people!  It's 2017!  I suppose some just expect for them to automatically be on, but it is a preference, specially with some films having more than one language to choose from for subtitles.  Anyway, very unfair to rate the movie with 1 star just because they couldn't figure it out.  It was nominated for an Oscar for a reason.  It is also the highest-grossing foreign-language film of 2016.  You won't be disappointed!\nBra!  (Great in Swedish) ;)\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Dani Menkin'], 'Producers': ['Dani Menkin'], 'Starring': ['Daniel (Mooki) Niv', 'Naruna de Macedo Kaplan'], 'Studio': ['Indie Rights']}\nOne of the best movies I've seen in a long while.
