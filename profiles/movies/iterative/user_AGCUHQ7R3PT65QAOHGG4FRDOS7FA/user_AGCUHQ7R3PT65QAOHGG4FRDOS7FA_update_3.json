  "reference_summary": "True Blood: Season 1\nAnna Paquin  (Actor),     Stephen Moyer  (Actor)    Rated:    PG    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, HBO, All HBO Titles\n['Product Description', 'True Blood: The Complete First Season (DVD)', 'TRUE BLOOD chronicles the backwoods Louisiana town of Bon Temps... where vampires have emerged from the coffin, and no longer need humans for their fix. Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin, Golden Globe(R)-winner for \"True Blood\", Academy Award\u00ae-winner for \u201cThe Piano\u201d) works as a waitress at the rural bar Merlotte\\'s. Though outwardly a typical young woman, she keeps a dangerous secret: she has the ability to hear the thoughts of others. Her situation is further complicated when the bar gets its first vampire patron - 173-year old Bill Compton (Steven Moyer, \"Quills\") - and the two outsiders are immediately drawn to each other. Delivering the best of what audiences have come to expect from Creator and Executive Producer Alan Ball (writer of Oscar\u00ae-winning Best Picture \u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d, creator of the Emmy\u00ae Award-winning HBO\u00ae series \u201cSix Feet Under\u201d), TRUE BLOOD is a dark and sexy tale that boldly delves into the heart - and the neck - of the Deep South.', ']]>', 'Amazon.com', 'Alan Ball\u2019s', 'True Blood', 'series works well for television, as it has enough sensationalism to tantalize and enough story girth to make the viewer care about the characters. That one can finally invest emotion into monsters, including an undead Civil War victim, a transformer who can shapeshift into various animals, and a female mind reader, speaks volumes about America\u2019s willingness to accept fantasy. Of course, television has always produced good fantasy shows (', 'I Dream of Jeannie', '), but', 'True Blood\u2019s', 'Southern Goth brand of fun horror is more macabre and more perverse, not to mention gorier, than most shows of its kind to date. Adapted from Charlaine Harris\u2019 Sookie Stackhouse novels,', 'True Blood', 'thrills because of its equal blend in each episode of erotica, humor, tragedy, mystery, and fantasy.', 'Set in a rural, swampy Louisiana parrish, the show centers around Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin) and her clan, sweet grandmother Adele (Lois Smith) and air-headed brother Jason (Ryan Kwanten). Illicit love is spawned early on, when Sookie saves vampire Bill Compton (Stephen Moyer) from having his blood stolen in the parking lot of Merlotte\u2019s diner, owned by Sam Merlotte (Sam Trammell) who completes what will form a complex love triangle. As tensions between Sookie\u2019s suitors loosen or tighten, many side plots, such as her African American best friend Tara\u2019s (Rutina Wesley) struggle with an alcoholic, Bible-thumping mother and her brother\u2019s dangerous crush on drug addicted hippie, Amy Burley (Lizzy Caplan), keep one wondering who will succeed in this podunk place. The main tension throughout, however, is a race war waged between vampires and humans. As murders of \u201cfang bangers\u201d occur (human girls who let vampires bite them) and dumb policeman Andy Bellefleur (Chris Bauer) fails to find clues, one sees the metaphorical implications of vampirism and feels deeper resonance with what can be a downright trashy show. Gossip galore, especially about what kinds of babies interbreeding will produce, is rampant. One of the funniest characters is Tara\u2019s flamboyant cousin, Lafayette (Nelsan Ellis), who deals drugs, works as a fry cook, and services the local white politicians, while making sure he\u2019s always up in everyone\u2019s business.', 'What makes', 'True Blood', 'smarter than pure soap opera is the parallels it draws between its monster mash and actual, familiar societal problems. Sookie and her friends watch the news, where Evangelicals bash vampires and prohibit mixed marriage, and everyone is addicted to V, a.k.a vampire blood, that effects like psychedelic heroin. Even its gore reflects a mix of serious and silly, as vampires explode into red, sticky goop. Though it may not be attempting to qualify for the best vampire footage ever shot,', 'True Blood', 'is as addictive as that substance the town\u2019s youth obsesses over, which is a metaphor in itself. --', 'Trinie Dalton', 'Stills from', 'True Blood', '(Click for larger image)']\n{'Genre': 'Drama, Mystery & Suspense/Thrillers', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Box set, Color, Dolby, Widescreen, Subtitled, NTSC, Closed-captioned', 'Contributor': 'William Sanderson, Lois Smith, Rutina Wesley, Nelsan Ellis, Sam Trammell, Ryan Kwanten, Lizzy Caplan, Chris Bauer, Anna Paquin, Stephen MoyerWilliam Sanderson, Lois Smith, Rutina Wesley, Nelsan Ellis, Sam Trammell, Ryan Kwanten, Lizzy Caplan, Chris Bauer, Anna Paquin, Stephen Moyer  See more', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1), French (Dolby Digital 5.1), Spanish (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo), Unqualified', 'Number Of Discs': '5', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.78:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG (Parental Guidance Suggested)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.5 x 1.5 inches; 14.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': '5069617', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Box set, Color, Dolby, Widescreen, Subtitled, NTSC, Closed-captioned', 'Run time': '12 hours', 'Release date': 'October 21, 2014', 'Actors': 'Anna Paquin, Stephen Moyer, Sam Trammell, Rutina Wesley, Ryan Kwanten', 'Subtitles': 'English, French, Spanish, Portuguese', 'Studio': 'HBO Studios', 'Number of discs': '5'}\nOk, I enjoyed the books.  The TV series doesn't have the feel of the books or stay true to the plot or even the characters. That's OK, it's TV.  At first I had trouble with the casting.  None of the cast seem to fit the characters in the book... So just accept this is LOOSELY based on the book.  I wouldn't buy this season unless it was dirt cheap.  You can go online and search/view all the episodes.  Watch thru to the ending episode... by that time, you get used to the characters and that is the episode that gives you hope that season two is actually going to be worthwhile....So, if you can actually get through the first 12 episodes.... things might get better.... also go online and see the preview for season two... it looks promising..\nIt could get better... it's like a b grade homemade movie\nSmash: Season 2\nKatharine McPhee  (Actor),     Debra Messing  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Boxed Sets, Drama\n[\"In Season Two, Broadway-bound musical Bombshell has competition on its heels in the form of Hit List, a rock musical written by two Broadway newcomers that threatens to tear apart the very fabric of Bombshell's team.

No doubt fans, like myself, were excited for the new season. But, what a disappointment. All of the great Broadway-style music that we loved has been replaced by mediocre Katherine McPhee pop songs. It cheapens the show. The producers fired the shows creator after season 1, and it is flailing. No character development, and all that existed previously is just gone. Julia's family and torrid affair, Karen's split with Dev, Ivy trying desperately to satisfy her over-achieving Broadway legend Mom (Bernadette Peters!) to the extent of a suicide attempt - all of that gone like it never even happened. Nothing. Everything, with the possible exception of an occasionally fabulous Megan Hilty solo, is just painful to watch.\nDon't buy wait until it is free to be disappointed....\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Hettie Macdonald', \"Daniel O'Hara\", 'Ed Bazalgette', 'Daniel Nettheim', 'Justin Molotnikov', 'Rachel Talalay'], 'Producers': ['Tracie Simpson', 'Derek Ritchie', 'Nikki Wilson', 'Peter Bennett'], 'Starring': ['Peter Capaldi', 'Jenna Coleman', 'Michelle Gomez'], 'Studio': ['BBC America']}\nHands down... the best part of the last two seasons....
