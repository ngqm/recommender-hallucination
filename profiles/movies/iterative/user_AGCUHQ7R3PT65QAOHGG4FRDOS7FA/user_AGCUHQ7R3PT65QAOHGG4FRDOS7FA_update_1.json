The TV series doesn't have the feel of the books or stay true to the plot or even the characters. That's OK, it's TV.  At first I had trouble with the casting.  None of the cast seem to fit the characters in the book... So just accept this is LOOSELY based on the book.  I wouldn't buy this season unless it was dirt cheap.  You can go online and search/view all the episodes.  Watch thru to the ending episode... by that time, you get used to the characters and that is the episode that gives you hope that season two is actually going to be worthwhile....So, if you can actually get through the first 12 episodes.... things might get better.... also go online and see the preview for season two... it looks promising..\nReview Title: It could get better... it's like a b grade homemade movie\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
