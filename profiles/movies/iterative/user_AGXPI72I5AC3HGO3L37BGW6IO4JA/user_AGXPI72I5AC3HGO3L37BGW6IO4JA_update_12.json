Shows most of the larger cities on the Adriatic Coastline in what is now Croatia, with a few southern cities as well.<br />Good, basic information.  Does not really show the magnificent beauty of the Adriatic Sea.<br />I do enjoy it and brings back the wonderful memories I have from my visit there in 2000.<br />Thank you for offering this video for sale. I hope you offer more on Croatia in the future.\nAdriatic Coast\nDog of Flanders VHS\nDavid Ladd  (Actor),     Donald Crisp  (Actor),     James B.

Then at my library I found this older edition and was so pleased when I found it still in print and available ....  The older edition is different abit from the newer version; however I love both stories.<br />It is a classic of the highest standards.  The original book has a sad ending and I am glad the movies are more joyful!<br />Excellent movies for children to see, especially any children with artistic talent!

In one of her finest performances, Ellen Burstyn stars as Edna McCauley, a transplanted farm girl who develops healing powers following an accident that left her widowed and paralyzed. Returning to her Kansas homeland, she attracts awe and controversy, performing healings while deflecting any pretense of religion. That's a risky position in the Bible belt, and even Edna's new beau Cal (Sam Shepard) responds with zealous incredulity, fearing what he can't understand while others embrace Edna with unquestioning faith. Through it all, Edna remains calmly resolute as the conduit of an extraordinary gift.\", 'Sensitively written by Lewis John Carlino (', 'The Great Santini', '),', 'Resurrection', \"tenuously mixes spiritual significance with John Ford's homespun tradition, but for the most part it works: Burstyn superbly conveys Edna's heartfelt determination, and both she and stage veteran Eva LeGallienne (in a rare and final film performance, as Edna's grandma) deservedly earned Oscar nominations. The movie dares to suggest that miracles reside within everyone, and that pure grace will manifest itself in unexpected ways. To that end, Richard Farnsworth is warm and wise in a brief but perfect role; Burstyn's final scene with Roberts Blossom (as her disapproving father) is a heartbreaker; and the film ends with an act of compassion that brings the story full circle as an affirmation of life's greatest mysteries.\", '--Jeff Shannon']\n{'Format': 'Color, NTSC, HiFi Sound', 'Contributor': \"Ellen Burstyn, Tom Taylor (II), Daniel Petrie, Jeffrey DeMunn, Claudette Harrell, Carlin Glynn, Madeleine Sherwood, Tommy Splittgerber, Clifford David, Ralph Roberts, Sylvia Walden, David Calkins, Jessie Lee Fulton, Edith Mills (II), Don Michaelson, Penelope Allen, Lane Smith, Carol Williard, Edward Pflaum, Sally Bondi, James N.
