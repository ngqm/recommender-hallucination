I've never been a fan of the David Suchet \"Poirot\". his character came across as prissy and more of a caricature than anything else. so to see the Poirot that Malkovich portrayed was such a treat, he brought depth  to the character that was sadly lacking before.<br />I would highly recommend this to anyone even if they're not Agatha Christie fans.\nABC murders\nWWII In HD: Collector\u2019s Edition\nRob Lowe  (Actor),     Justin Bartha  (Actor),     Frederic Lumiere  (Director),     Matthew Ginsburg  (Director)    &                   1                  more   Rated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Boxed Sets, Documentary\n['Product Description', 'Seventy years in the making.
