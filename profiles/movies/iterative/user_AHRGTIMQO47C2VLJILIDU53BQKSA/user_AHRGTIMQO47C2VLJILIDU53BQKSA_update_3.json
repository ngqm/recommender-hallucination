Schickele (P.D.Q. Bach)', 'Studio': 'Vai (Video Artists Inter.)'}\nReview Text: You already know going in that this will be funny.  PDQ Bach (Peter Schickele) has a long history of very clever musical satire.  I mean, who else can write music in the style of Bach, Mozart, and Handel, and call it something like &quot;Fanfare for the Common Cold,&quot; &quot;The Seasonings,&quot; &quot;Chorale Prelude On An American Hymn For The Last Sunday Before The Fourth Day Of The Seventh Month After New Year's Eve,&quot; and dedicate a piece to &quot;A nobleman, Count Pointercount&quot;?<br />At last, we have one of Schickele's major works on video, in a fully staged production by The Minnesota Opera.  The principals are quite good, and the chorus is excellent.<br />Peter Schickele clearly loves Mozart's operas.  There are numerous &quot;jokes&quot; based on Don Giovanni, Le Nozze di Figaro, Cosi fan Tutte, Abduction from the Seraglio, and The Magic Flute.<br />Like Mozart's operas, Abduction has a convoluted plot:  Susanna Susannadanna's husband, Figaro, is dying (&quot;Stay With Me&quot;).  However, before he can die, he is abducted by Captain Kadd (&quot;My Name is Captain Kadd, and I Am Very Very Very Very Very Very Bad&quot;).  Well, actually before he is abducted, Susanna is visited by Dona Donna who is searching for Donald Giovanni (&quot;Perfidy, Thy Name is Donald, Although They Call Thee Don for Short&quot;), who loved her and left her (Donna, that is, not Susanna).  There is a rescue attempted by the men (Donald and his mute companion, Schleporello), who are shipwrecked, who are then followed by the ladies who end up in the Pasha Shaboom's harem.  Well, you get the picture.<br />There are subtle and not-so-subtle parodies of specific Mozart arias (&quot;Batti, batti&quot; becomes &quot;Macho, macho, That's How All Men Are,&quot; and is followed immediately by &quot;You Can Beat Me,&quot; for example), but you don't need to know the Mozart works to appreciate the humor.  While some of the bits are perhaps a tad too broad, the clever lyrics and well-written music more than compensate.  One of the funniest bits in the entire work is the &quot;Caribbean Ballet&quot; in the style of Swan Lake, complete with pineapple headdresses in place of the usual feathers for the &quot;corps de ballet,&quot; and a &quot;Carmen Miranda&quot;-style Odile.<br />This is definitely worth seeing if you're already a fan of PDQ Bach.  It's definitely worth seeing even if you're not yet a fan.\nReview Title: PDQ Bach's Operatic Masterpiece!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

He leads his unusual party on an expedition to the center of the earth, by way of a volcano in Iceland. On the way, they encounter enormous mushrooms and giant prehistoric monsters. Produced by Michael Todd with then-spectacular special effects, the story was modernized to 1950s sensibilities. Mason gives this class, while Arlene Dahl and Diane Baker are the romantic interests. And Pat Boone is more palatable than you might expect as a secondary lead. You can watch this with your children and not be bored, and they will surely love it.\", \"--Rochelle O'Gorman\"]\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Language': 'English, French, Italian, Icelandic', 'Package Dimensions': '7.32 x 4.19 x 1.12 inches; 6.08 Ounces', 'Director': 'Henry Levin', 'Run time': '2 hours and 12 minutes', 'Release date': 'January 2, 1996', 'Date First Available': 'November 3, 2006', 'Actors': 'James Mason, Pat Boone, Arlene Dahl, Diane Baker, Thayer David', 'Studio': '20th Century Fox', 'Producers': 'Charles Brackett', 'Writers': 'Charles Brackett, Jules Verne, Walter Reisch'}\nI first saw this on the &quot;big screen&quot; as a child, and was totally blown away by the special effects.  I'm still amazed at what they were able to do given the &quot;state of the art&quot; at the time (1959).  No, it's  not precisely the way Jules Verne wrote it, but the basics of the plot and  story are there.  James Mason is the archtypical passionate professor, and  quite good in this role.  Arlene Dahl does a fine job in what could have  been &quot;just another pretty face&quot; role.  She actually gives it some  character and &quot;spunk.&quot;  And Pat Boone works well in the student  role, once he gets past the cheesy &quot;Scottish&quot; accent.<br />This is a  great family flick -- minimal violence, nothing that would tempt other than  a &quot;G&quot; rating -- and the &quot;good guys&quot; win in the end.

We devote our meager free time to the pursuit of musical excellence, many of us in amateur brass bands, string orchestras, community choirs and the like -- for what purpose?<br />Because we MUST.  No  matter how dismal or depressed the rest of our lives are, there's always an  opportunity to create something beautiful, something truly magnificent, by  combining our talents with those of others.<br />The Grimley Colliery Band is  but one example of this.  Each member, all men but one newcomer, is facing  a crisis -- the closing of the coal mine into which they've poured their  sweat and energy for most of their lives, and the uncertain future to  follow.  Their director, Danny, demanding and hard-headed, has retired from  the mine, and doesn't seem to grasp the seriousness of the matter.  &quot;Music is EVERYTHING!&quot; he proclaims.  The members consider him  daft, as they struggle to balance family, the impending union/management  show-down, and finances.  It's only at a moment of crisis that they realize  the point:  Danny not only understands the situation, but he also knows  that MUSIC is the only thing that will get these proud men through the  storm together, whole and with some shred of self-respect.<br />Pete  Postlethwaite is brilliant as Danny; Tara Fitzgerald's understated  performance as Gloria, the only female member of the band, gives her  character a sense of integrity and honor that could easily have been  overlooked in favor of more &quot;marketable&quot; characteristics.  The  rest of the cast is remarkable.  Particularly notable is Stephen Tompkinson  as Phil, Danny's son, whose descent into abject depression seems to mirror  the daily descent into the black hole of the coal mine -- dark, dirty, and  dangerous.<br />I liked this movie far better than I thought I would when I  saw the cover of the DVD.  This is less a romance than an examination of  many lives made complete -- by music, by the pursuit of beauty and grace,  by focused cooperation.  It really doesn't get any better than this.\nThis movie speaks to all of us amateur musicians . . .\nP.D.Q.
