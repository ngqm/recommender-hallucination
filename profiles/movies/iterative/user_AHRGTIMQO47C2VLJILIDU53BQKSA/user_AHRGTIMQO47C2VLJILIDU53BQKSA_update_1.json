He leads his unusual party on an expedition to the center of the earth, by way of a volcano in Iceland. On the way, they encounter enormous mushrooms and giant prehistoric monsters. Produced by Michael Todd with then-spectacular special effects, the story was modernized to 1950s sensibilities. Mason gives this class, while Arlene Dahl and Diane Baker are the romantic interests. And Pat Boone is more palatable than you might expect as a secondary lead. You can watch this with your children and not be bored, and they will surely love it.\", \"--Rochelle O'Gorman\"]\nAverage Rating: 4.6\nProduct Details: {'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Language': 'English, French, Italian, Icelandic', 'Package Dimensions': '7.32 x 4.19 x 1.12 inches; 6.08 Ounces', 'Director': 'Henry Levin', 'Run time': '2 hours and 12 minutes', 'Release date': 'January 2, 1996', 'Date First Available': 'November 3, 2006', 'Actors': 'James Mason, Pat Boone, Arlene Dahl, Diane Baker, Thayer David', 'Studio': '20th Century Fox', 'Producers': 'Charles Brackett', 'Writers': 'Charles Brackett, Jules Verne, Walter Reisch'}\nReview Text: I first saw this on the &quot;big screen&quot; as a child, and was totally blown away by the special effects.  I'm still amazed at what they were able to do given the &quot;state of the art&quot; at the time (1959).  No, it's  not precisely the way Jules Verne wrote it, but the basics of the plot and  story are there.  James Mason is the archtypical passionate professor, and  quite good in this role.  Arlene Dahl does a fine job in what could have  been &quot;just another pretty face&quot; role.  She actually gives it some  character and &quot;spunk.&quot;  And Pat Boone works well in the student  role, once he gets past the cheesy &quot;Scottish&quot; accent.<br />This is a  great family flick -- minimal violence, nothing that would tempt other than  a &quot;G&quot; rating -- and the &quot;good guys&quot; win in the end.  Fantastic scenery, believable special effects -- a great way to spend an  afternoon!\nReview Title: As good now as it was then . . .\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
