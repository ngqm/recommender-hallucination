How do they deal with it?  Well, after getting past the initial shock and guilt (she yells into a towel, he lies about his wife's name and the number of children he has), they agree to meet every year, same weekend, same place.  We, the audience, are allowed to observe every 5th meeting in the same room.<br />We see the changes in the relationship, the changes in each of the participants, the changing times.  We get to know Doris and George through these slices of time, laugh with them, cry with them, always with the question -- will they ever leave their respective partners and follow their hearts?  It's definitely a relationship based more on mutual respect and friendship, despite its extra-marital foundation.  You get the feeling that these two individuals are truly soul-mates who just happened to meet.<br />Alan Alda gives an amazing performance, beginning as a guilt-ridden rather milk-toast-ish accountant.  Without giving away the plot twists, he goes through many changes and personal crises, and still manages to stay a reasonably likable, vulnerable man.<br />Ellen Burstyn, as Doris, enters into this as a rather ditzy young wife on her way to a Catholic retreat with the nuns, who manages to grow up over the years.  It's a treat to see the changes in these characters with each change of scene.<br />Bernard Slade's original two-person play with its witty dialogue is preserved almost intact, with only one new character in the movie that isn't in the play (&quot;old Mr. Chalmers&quot;).  If anything, the movie improves the original through the music and photo montages that separate the scenes (the entre-acte song, &quot;The Last Time I Felt Like This&quot; was nominated for an Academy Award).<br />This is definitely worth seeing for the superb performances of Alda and Burstyn.\nReview Title: Well written, well acted . . .\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

He leads his unusual party on an expedition to the center of the earth, by way of a volcano in Iceland. On the way, they encounter enormous mushrooms and giant prehistoric monsters. Produced by Michael Todd with then-spectacular special effects, the story was modernized to 1950s sensibilities. Mason gives this class, while Arlene Dahl and Diane Baker are the romantic interests.

I'm still amazed at what they were able to do given the &quot;state of the art&quot; at the time (1959).  No, it's  not precisely the way Jules Verne wrote it, but the basics of the plot and  story are there.  James Mason is the archtypical passionate professor, and  quite good in this role.  Arlene Dahl does a fine job in what could have  been &quot;just another pretty face&quot; role.  She actually gives it some  character and &quot;spunk.&quot;  And Pat Boone works well in the student  role, once he gets past the cheesy &quot;Scottish&quot; accent.<br />This is a  great family flick -- minimal violence, nothing that would tempt other than  a &quot;G&quot; rating -- and the &quot;good guys&quot; win in the end.  Fantastic scenery, believable special effects -- a great way to spend an  afternoon!\nAs good now as it was then . . .\nBrassed Off!

We devote our meager free time to the pursuit of musical excellence, many of us in amateur brass bands, string orchestras, community choirs and the like -- for what purpose?<br />Because we MUST.  No  matter how dismal or depressed the rest of our lives are, there's always an  opportunity to create something beautiful, something truly magnificent, by  combining our talents with those of others.<br />The Grimley Colliery Band is  but one example of this.  Each member, all men but one newcomer, is facing  a crisis -- the closing of the coal mine into which they've poured their  sweat and energy for most of their lives, and the uncertain future to  follow.  Their director, Danny, demanding and hard-headed, has retired from  the mine, and doesn't seem to grasp the seriousness of the matter.  &quot;Music is EVERYTHING!&quot; he proclaims.  The members consider him  daft, as they struggle to balance family, the impending union/management  show-down, and finances.  It's only at a moment of crisis that they realize  the point:  Danny not only understands the situation, but he also knows  that MUSIC is the only thing that will get these proud men through the  storm together, whole and with some shred of self-respect.<br />Pete  Postlethwaite is brilliant as Danny; Tara Fitzgerald's understated  performance as Gloria, the only female member of the band, gives her  character a sense of integrity and honor that could easily have been  overlooked in favor of more &quot;marketable&quot; characteristics.  The  rest of the cast is remarkable.  Particularly notable is Stephen Tompkinson  as Phil, Danny's son, whose descent into abject depression seems to mirror  the daily descent into the black hole of the coal mine -- dark, dirty, and  dangerous.<br />I liked this movie far better than I thought I would when I  saw the cover of the DVD.  This is less a romance than an examination of  many lives made complete -- by music, by the pursuit of beauty and grace,  by focused cooperation.  It really doesn't get any better than this.\nThis movie speaks to all of us amateur musicians . . .\nP.D.Q. Bach - The Abduction of Figaro VHS\nFormat: VHS Tape\nMovies & TV, Digital VHS\n['P.D.Q Bach provides a madcap farce in this crazed pastiche on the Figaro saga. A wonderful funny performance with plenty of gags, both musical & visual. Entertaining & hilarious.']\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.32 x 4.19 x 1.12 inches; 6.13 Ounces', 'Release date': 'February 10, 1997', 'Date First Available': 'September 29, 2006', 'Actors': 'P.  Schickele (P.D.Q. Bach)', 'Studio': 'Vai (Video Artists Inter.)'}\nYou already know going in that this will be funny.  PDQ Bach (Peter Schickele) has a long history of very clever musical satire.  I mean, who else can write music in the style of Bach, Mozart, and Handel, and call it something like &quot;Fanfare for the Common Cold,&quot; &quot;The Seasonings,&quot; &quot;Chorale Prelude On An American Hymn For The Last Sunday Before The Fourth Day Of The Seventh Month After New Year's Eve,&quot; and dedicate a piece to &quot;A nobleman, Count Pointercount&quot;?<br />At last, we have one of Schickele's major works on video, in a fully staged production by The Minnesota Opera.  The principals are quite good, and the chorus is excellent.<br />Peter Schickele clearly loves Mozart's operas.  There are numerous &quot;jokes&quot; based on Don Giovanni, Le Nozze di Figaro, Cosi fan Tutte, Abduction from the Seraglio, and The Magic Flute.<br />Like Mozart's operas, Abduction has a convoluted plot:  Susanna Susannadanna's husband, Figaro, is dying (&quot;Stay With Me&quot;).  However, before he can die, he is abducted by Captain Kadd (&quot;My Name is Captain Kadd, and I Am Very Very Very Very Very Very Bad&quot;).  Well, actually before he is abducted, Susanna is visited by Dona Donna who is searching for Donald Giovanni (&quot;Perfidy, Thy Name is Donald, Although They Call Thee Don for Short&quot;), who loved her and left her (Donna, that is, not Susanna).  There is a rescue attempted by the men (Donald and his mute companion, Schleporello), who are shipwrecked, who are then followed by the ladies who end up in the Pasha Shaboom's harem.  Well, you get the picture.<br />There are subtle and not-so-subtle parodies of specific Mozart arias (&quot;Batti, batti&quot; becomes &quot;Macho, macho, That's How All Men Are,&quot; and is followed immediately by &quot;You Can Beat Me,&quot; for example), but you don't need to know the Mozart works to appreciate the humor.  While some of the bits are perhaps a tad too broad, the clever lyrics and well-written music more than compensate.  One of the funniest bits in the entire work is the &quot;Caribbean Ballet&quot; in the style of Swan Lake, complete with pineapple headdresses in place of the usual feathers for the &quot;corps de ballet,&quot; and a &quot;Carmen Miranda&quot;-style Odile.<br />This is definitely worth seeing if you're already a fan of PDQ Bach.  It's definitely worth seeing even if you're not yet a fan.\nPDQ Bach's Operatic Masterpiece!\nSame Time Next Year VHS\nEllen Burstyn  (Actor),     Alan Alda  (Actor),     Robert Mulligan  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG    Format: VHS Tape\nMovies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Drama\n['Product description', 'The best film ever about life and love in the turmoil of the mid 20th Century', 'Amazon.com', \"Bernard Slade's smart, funny, and touching play about an adulterous couple who meet one weekend a year for 26 years is nicely adapted for the screen by Robert Mulligan (\", 'To Kill a Mockingbird', ') in this 1978 film.
