I've enjoyed von Trier's wor in the past, and Willem Dafoe usually provides a wonderful performance (which could be taken in other ways in this context.)  The movie was amazing in the sense of being a work of art, but I don't think I could watch it a second time (though I'm tempted to buy it just to support von Trier's work.)  It contains intense violence, sex and a rather bizarre story.  I highly recommend it to those who enjoy a smart, artsy film and have strong stomachs.\nReview Title: Incredibly well done, but extremely morbid.\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
