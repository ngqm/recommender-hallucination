It was a great movie with a great story and a not entirely predictable \"surprise\" ending.  I also enjoyed his follow-up film, Unbreakable (yet it wasn't too well received.)  Each of his later films, however, have left me disappointed.  Lady in the Water is no different.  He keep trying to  string insane story ideas together, only to cap them off with a \"surprise\" ending.  A surprise ending is only a surprise if you're not expecting it!  Another problem I have is how his characters always seem to just accept whatever's going on in the movie.<br /><br />This film is about a water nymph that's trying to save the world from humanity.  Or maybe it's to save humanity from themselves...  Anyway.  She shows up in the swimming pool of an apartment complex filled with very eccentric tenants.  The landlord of the complex is the man who finds her, and immediately clings to this nymph.  He's not quite too sure what to do with her, but conveniently there's an Asian family (Japanese, I think) that just happens to know the legend.  So, to appease the elder lady of the household (who is the expert of the legend,) he goes through some rather silly exercises.  Once he knows this legend, he goes to all the other tenants for help.  They all immediately buy into his tale and pitch in right away.  As the movie progresses, things become more and more convoluted.  Eventually everyone figures out what to do, and the \"surprise\" happens.  Seriously...  I wasn't surprised in any fashion.  In fact, I predicted what'd happen.<br /><br />Here are the stats:<br /><br />Violence/Blood/Gore:  Almost none.<br />Boobs:  None.<br />Likable characters:  Maybe the landlord?<br />Plot devices that made sense:  None.<br />People in this film that look like Jeff Goldbloom:  M Knight Shamalayan.<br /><br />Over all verdict:  Maybe watch it on cable if you're having a hard time sleeping.  Otherwise skip.\nReview Title: Really?\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I've enjoyed von Trier's wor in the past, and Willem Dafoe usually provides a wonderful performance (which could be taken in other ways in this context.)  The movie was amazing in the sense of being a work of art, but I don't think I could watch it a second time (though I'm tempted to buy it just to support von Trier's work.)  It contains intense violence, sex and a rather bizarre story.  I highly recommend it to those who enjoy a smart, artsy film and have strong stomachs.\nIncredibly well done, but extremely morbid.\nLady in the Water [Blu-ray]\nPaul Giamatti  (Actor),     Bryce Dallas Howard  (Actor)    Rated:    PG-13    Format: Blu-ray\nMovies & TV, Blu-ray, Movies\n['Lady In The Water (BD)', ']]>']\n{'Genre': 'Fantasy, Suspense, Science Fiction', 'Format': 'AC-3, Blu-ray, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, Dubbed, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Freddy Rodriguez, Jared Harris, Jeffrey Wright, Bob Balaban, M.
