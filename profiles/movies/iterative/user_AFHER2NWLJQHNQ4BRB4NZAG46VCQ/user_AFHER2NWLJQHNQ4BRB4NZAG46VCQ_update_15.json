The movie did a great job keeping the spirit of the lore from the game series and (from what I can tell) the novelizations.  Sure, there are some departures from &#34;the way it really happened,&#34; but that was expected, and quite frankly, pretty well done.  The movie itself was fairly grim - some of your favorite characters might suffer (or die?)  I expected the special effects to be on the lame side, but on the contrary, they were very well done (provided you ignore the Kirin Tor members' eyes.)<br /><br />Overall, the movie had enough hat tips to the game series (complete with pop-culure references!) to keep me happy, but did a fine enough job presenting itself to someone who has never played any of the games (one person being my wife, who also thoroughly enjoyed it!)\nReview Title: Thumbs up from a long-time fan of the game\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I've enjoyed von Trier's wor in the past, and Willem Dafoe usually provides a wonderful performance (which could be taken in other ways in this context.)  The movie was amazing in the sense of being a work of art, but I don't think I could watch it a second time (though I'm tempted to buy it just to support von Trier's work.)  It contains intense violence, sex and a rather bizarre story.  I highly recommend it to those who enjoy a smart, artsy film and have strong stomachs.\nIncredibly well done, but extremely morbid.\nLady in the Water [Blu-ray]\nPaul Giamatti  (Actor),     Bryce Dallas Howard  (Actor)    Rated:    PG-13    Format: Blu-ray\nMovies & TV, Blu-ray, Movies\n['Lady In The Water (BD)', ']]>']\n{'Genre': 'Fantasy, Suspense, Science Fiction', 'Format': 'AC-3, Blu-ray, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, Dubbed, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Freddy Rodriguez, Jared Harris, Jeffrey Wright, Bob Balaban, M.

It was a great movie with a great story and a not entirely predictable \"surprise\" ending.  I also enjoyed his follow-up film, Unbreakable (yet it wasn't too well received.)  Each of his later films, however, have left me disappointed.  Lady in the Water is no different.  He keep trying to  string insane story ideas together, only to cap them off with a \"surprise\" ending.  A surprise ending is only a surprise if you're not expecting it!  Another problem I have is how his characters always seem to just accept whatever's going on in the movie.<br /><br />This film is about a water nymph that's trying to save the world from humanity.  Or maybe it's to save humanity from themselves...  Anyway.  She shows up in the swimming pool of an apartment complex filled with very eccentric tenants.  The landlord of the complex is the man who finds her, and immediately clings to this nymph.  He's not quite too sure what to do with her, but conveniently there's an Asian family (Japanese, I think) that just happens to know the legend.  So, to appease the elder lady of the household (who is the expert of the legend,) he goes through some rather silly exercises.  Once he knows this legend, he goes to all the other tenants for help.  They all immediately buy into his tale and pitch in right away.  As the movie progresses, things become more and more convoluted.  Eventually everyone figures out what to do, and the \"surprise\" happens.  Seriously...  I wasn't surprised in any fashion.  In fact, I predicted what'd happen.<br /><br />Here are the stats:<br /><br />Violence/Blood/Gore:  Almost none.<br />Boobs:  None.<br />Likable characters:  Maybe the landlord?<br />Plot devices that made sense:  None.<br />People in this film that look like Jeff Goldbloom:  M Knight Shamalayan.<br /><br />Over all verdict:  Maybe watch it on cable if you're having a hard time sleeping.  Otherwise skip.\nReally?\nTrue Blood: Season 1\nAnna Paquin  (Actor),     Stephen Moyer  (Actor)    Rated:    PG    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, HBO, All HBO Titles\n['Product Description', 'True Blood: The Complete First Season (DVD)', 'TRUE BLOOD chronicles the backwoods Louisiana town of Bon Temps... where vampires have emerged from the coffin, and no longer need humans for their fix. Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin, Golden Globe(R)-winner for \"True Blood\", Academy Award\u00ae-winner for \u201cThe Piano\u201d) works as a waitress at the rural bar Merlotte\\'s. Though outwardly a typical young woman, she keeps a dangerous secret: she has the ability to hear the thoughts of others. Her situation is further complicated when the bar gets its first vampire patron - 173-year old Bill Compton (Steven Moyer, \"Quills\") - and the two outsiders are immediately drawn to each other. Delivering the best of what audiences have come to expect from Creator and Executive Producer Alan Ball (writer of Oscar\u00ae-winning Best Picture \u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d, creator of the Emmy\u00ae Award-winning HBO\u00ae series \u201cSix Feet Under\u201d), TRUE BLOOD is a dark and sexy tale that boldly delves into the heart - and the neck - of the Deep South.', ']]>', 'Amazon.com', 'Alan Ball\u2019s', 'True Blood', 'series works well for television, as it has enough sensationalism to tantalize and enough story girth to make the viewer care about the characters.

Of course, television has always produced good fantasy shows (', 'I Dream of Jeannie', '), but', 'True Blood\u2019s', 'Southern Goth brand of fun horror is more macabre and more perverse, not to mention gorier, than most shows of its kind to date. Adapted from Charlaine Harris\u2019 Sookie Stackhouse novels,', 'True Blood', 'thrills because of its equal blend in each episode of erotica, humor, tragedy, mystery, and fantasy.', 'Set in a rural, swampy Louisiana parrish, the show centers around Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin) and her clan, sweet grandmother Adele (Lois Smith) and air-headed brother Jason (Ryan Kwanten). Illicit love is spawned early on, when Sookie saves vampire Bill Compton (Stephen Moyer) from having his blood stolen in the parking lot of Merlotte\u2019s diner, owned by Sam Merlotte (Sam Trammell) who completes what will form a complex love triangle. As tensions between Sookie\u2019s suitors loosen or tighten, many side plots, such as her African American best friend Tara\u2019s (Rutina Wesley) struggle with an alcoholic, Bible-thumping mother and her brother\u2019s dangerous crush on drug addicted hippie, Amy Burley (Lizzy Caplan), keep one wondering who will succeed in this podunk place. The main tension throughout, however, is a race war waged between vampires and humans. As murders of \u201cfang bangers\u201d occur (human girls who let vampires bite them) and dumb policeman Andy Bellefleur (Chris Bauer) fails to find clues, one sees the metaphorical implications of vampirism and feels deeper resonance with what can be a downright trashy show. Gossip galore, especially about what kinds of babies interbreeding will produce, is rampant. One of the funniest characters is Tara\u2019s flamboyant cousin, Lafayette (Nelsan Ellis), who deals drugs, works as a fry cook, and services the local white politicians, while making sure he\u2019s always up in everyone\u2019s business.', 'What makes', 'True Blood', 'smarter than pure soap opera is the parallels it draws between its monster mash and actual, familiar societal problems.

Horror movies and even vampire stories have always been my favorites.  Campy TV shows like Buffy are right up my ally.  This show, however, reached a level of absurdity that I cannot tolerate.  I begrudgingly made it half way through the third episode before I had to turn it off.  My initial reaction to the first episode stuck through out.  I didn't really care for any of the characters, the dialog was awful and the whole \"forbidden romance between a girl and a vampire\" idea has been played out, beaten up and burned down to the ground already.  To be open minded, I did try to stick this out.  I made it to the third episode hoping that the negative vibe I got would grow a bit.  That didn't happen for me, however.<br /><br />Over all, this show feels like it's made for teenagers with a vampire fetish.\nRidiculous\nDexter: Season 1\nMichael C.

The idea of a serial killer who only kills other killers is rather intriguing, and this show presents it in such a fun way.  The characters are all great and the dialog is brilliantly witty.  The first season had a slight flaw of being rather predictable, but that really doesn't detract from my over all rating.  This show is also strangely  addictive!  The only way to really watch it is by DVD or somehow streaming it from the internet (I watched it on Netflix, but I enjoyed it enough to buy on DVD once I get some extra cash!) so you can watch the episodes back-to-back, as most every one ends as a cliff hanger.\nLoved it!\nNight of the Demons\nEdward Furlong  (Actor),     Shannon Elizabeth  (Actor),     Adam Gierasch  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Horror\n[\"Angela (Shannon Elizabeth) is throwing a decadent Halloween part at New Orleans' infamous Broussard Mansion.

The Road definitely fits that category!  The story, as the description indicates, is largely based on the journey that a father and his son take after the world ends.  All the vegetation has been decimated, and the animals are long gone.  The only life that remains are a few packs of mostly unsavory (which is probably why they kept trying to eat newly-found people) humans trying to get by.  The cast and crew did an amazing job:  This film was uncomfortable to watch most of the time!  As the story kept unfolding, I kept wondering what'd happen next.  The final events leading up to the end weren't a huge surprise, but the very end had a subtle twist that I thought was quite well done!

Moore, the \"reimagined\"', 'BG', 'is exactly what it claims to be: a drama for grown-ups in a science-fiction setting. The mature intelligence of the series is its greatest asset, from the tenuous respect between Galactica\\'s militarily principled commander Adama (Olmos) and politically astute President Roslin (Mary McDonnell) to the barely suppressed passion between ace Viper pilot \"Apollo\" (a.k.a. Adama\\'s son Lee, played by Jamie Bamber) and the brashly insubordinate Starbuck (Katee Sackhoff), whose multifaceted character is just one of many first-season highlights. Picking up where the miniseries ended (it\\'s included here, sparing the need for separate purchase), season 1 opens with the riveting, Hugo Award-winning episode \"33,\" in which Galactica and the \"ragtag fleet\" of colonial survivors begin their quest for the legendary 13th colony planet Earth, while being pursued with clockwork regularity by the Cylons, who\\'ve now occupied the colonial planet of Caprica. The fleet\\'s hard-fought survival forms (1) the primary side of the series\\' three-part structure, shared with (2) the apparent psychosis of Dr. Gaius Baltar (James Callis) whose every thought and move are monitored by various incarnations of Number Six (Tricia Helfer), the seemingly omniscient Cylon ultravixen who follows a master plan somehow connected to (3) the Caprican survival ordeal of crash-landed pilots \"Helo\" (Tahmoh Penikett) and \"Boomer\" (Grace Park), whose simultaneous presence on Galactica is further evidence that 12 multicopied models of Cylons, in human form, are gathering their forces.', 'With remarkably consistent quality, each of these 13 episodes deepens the dynamics of these fascinating characters and suspenseful situations. While', 'BG', 'relies on finely nuanced performances, solid direction, and satisfying personal and political drama to build its strong emotional foundation, the action/adventure elements are equally impressive, especially in \"The Hand of God,\" a pivotal episode in which the show\\'s dazzling visual effects get a particularly impressive showcase. Original', 'BG', \"series star Richard Hatch appears in two politically charged episodes (he's a better actor now, too), and with the threat of civil war among the fleet, season 1 ends with an exceptional cliffhanger that's totally unexpected while connecting the plot threads of all preceding episodes.

Beginning with the Colonial Fleet separated, Col. Tigh (Michael Hogan) botching his temporary command, and Capt. Adama (Edward James Olmos) near death after a Cylon assassination attempt, series producer/developer Ronald D. Moore and his gifted writing staff packed more into these 10 episodes than most series manage in a full season. Maintaining its reputation as an adult drama, the series is compellingly anchored by the gravitas of Olmos and Mary McDonnell, whose role as Fleet President Laura Roslin grows more complex as she reveals her diagnosis of breast cancer and defies Adama, playing the \"religious card\" with her conviction that prophetic visions will lead the embattled fleet toward its legendary home planet Earth. As Adama\\'s son Apollo (Jamie Bamber) wrestles with his role in Roslin\\'s mutinous agenda, paranoia runs high as Cylon copies (or \"avatars\") of Boomer (Grace Park) complicate matters aboard Galactica and on Kobol, where a lost Raptor crew struggles to survive and Dr. Baltar (James Callis) endures the increasingly haunting and manipulative intrusions into his tormented psyche by Number Six (Tricia Helfer), the seductive Cylon who holds the secret to the Cylon master plan to destroy humankind.', \"Further action takes place on Cylon-occupied Caprica, where Starbuck (Katee Sackhoff) and Helo (Tamoh Penikett) discover a group of human resistance fighters who survived the Cylons' nuclear attack in season 1.

The series\\' large and likable cast is well-used throughout (even smaller roles are given adequate dimension), and Moore\\'s \"podcast\" commentaries provide a smart, thorough analysis of the show\\'s writing process and conceptual evolution. Yes, it\\'s undeniably true that this half-season DVD set is a blatantly commercial ploy to lure more and more viewers into the ongoing season (which resumed in January 2006), but you can hardly blame Universal for capitalizing on a high-quality series.

The uneasy alliance between humans and a pack of rebel Cylons, including Caprica 6 (Tricia Helfer) takes a quizzical turn when the former residents of Earth appear to be Cylon rather than human, and some of the final five begin to recall their past lives on Earth. Kara (Katee Sackhoff) has to call her own human status into question when she discovers a crashed Viper occupied by a corpse wearing her dog tags, and President Roslin (Mary McDonnell) and Admiral Adama (Edward James Olmos) battle their own despair and struggle to lead an emotionally devastated fleet.

He's a huge Star Trek fan, and while I don't mind the show, I never really followed.  This gave me some preconceived notions of what Battlestar Galactica might be like.  I'm glad I got over those notions!  Battlestar is a gritty, intense character and story driven series.  All the main characters and even some of the more important minor characters well be fleshed out and in great detail.  I also thought that the characters were very deep and multidimensional, so it added a fair amount of realism (on the personal level.)  The story will keep you on the edge of your seat while you watch the fleet suffer through its journey (some good times will be had, but there is a lot of crazy things that happen to everyone involved!)  I really like how most of the questions one might ask are answered (or resolved) by the time the show ends.<br /><br />When watching this show, one might find him/herself  questioning ideas about politics, religion and social/ethical values.  I certainly did, and for me, this was a very attractive aspect of watching Battlestar.<br /><br />At any rate, experiencing Battlestar Galactica for the first time should be about surprises.  They do a great job playing their hand close to their chest, and you definitely are made to wait to find a lot of things out.  You might be curious to read up on it on Wiki or hit the forums for more information, but chances are you'll ruin some surprises.  Also, the \"webisodes\" are quite boring.  Save'em for after the show, if you're interested in watching.  (they might be a little less annoying if they stitched them all together so you didn't have to load a 4 minute clip 10 times over to complete them.)\nOne of the best shows I've ever seen\nCalifornication: Seasons 1-4\nRated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Showtime, All Showtime Titles\n{'Format': 'Widescreen, NTSC', 'Language': 'English', 'Publication Date': 'November 1, 2011', 'MPAA rating': 'Unrated (Not Rated)', 'Package Dimensions': '7.8 x 5.51 x 2.52 inches; 1.55 Pounds', 'Media Format': 'Widescreen, NTSC', 'Release date': 'November 1, 2011', 'Dubbed': 'English, Spanish', 'Studio': 'Showtime Ent.'}\nDavid Duchovny's character is wonderfully flawed; He's intelligent, extremely funny and has a big heart, but for some reason, can't say no to drugs, alcohol or women.  He was also unable to commit to the love of his life/mother of his child, so she left him.  The show starts out with Hank Moody (David Duchovny)trying desparatly to win her back.  He sill has a grip on her heart, but his flaws keep pushing her away.  This is one of the central themes to the show, through every season thus far.<br /><br />One of Moody's other traits, which I can very much relate to, is that he doesn't have patients for public displays of rudeness/ignorance.  He'll often react in the best way possible (some of these reactions might have gone through my head had I witnessed such displays, but I don't think I'd carry them out!)  Such situations often end in my laughter and his imprisonment.<br /><br />Californication isn't necessarily for children.  There is frequent foul language, drug/alcohol use, and nudity/sex.  Anyone watching it, however, will probably see past that and find something very human in this show.  Watching Hank Moody try and try again is sometimes painful, and sometimes very inspiring. Some things I take from this show is that maybe we as people need to be a little more thoughtful of others, and at the same time, maybe embrace a little more \"political incorrectness.\"<br /><br />I could probably expand on all that quite a bit, but I'm sure everyone would just rather watch the show than read my ramblings!\nOne of my favorite shows\nCabin In The Woods [Blu-ray + Digital Copy]\nJenkins, Richard  (Actor),     Williams, Jesse  (Actor),     Drew Goddard  (Director, Writer)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: Blu-ray\nMovies & TV, Featured Categories, Blu-ray, Horror\n{'Genre': 'Horror', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Ultraviolet, AC-3, Blu-ray, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen, Ultraviolet, Digital_copyMultiple Formats, Ultraviolet, AC-3, Blu-ray, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen, Ultraviolet, Digital_copy   See more', 'Contributor': 'Drew Goddard, Joss Whedon, Hemsworth, Chris, Williams, Jesse, Hutchison, Anna Marie, Connolly, Kristen, Jenkins, RichardDrew Goddard, Joss Whedon, Hemsworth, Chris, Williams, Jesse, Hutchison, Anna Marie, Connolly, Kristen, Jenkins, Richard   See more', 'Language': 'English', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 35 minutes'}\nI haven't seen any previews for this (or any movie, for that matter...) so it was all a pretty big surprise to me.

I am very much looking forward to season 2!\nVery Entertaining\nThe Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (Extended Edition) (Blu-ray)\nIan McKellen  (Actor),     Martin Freeman  (Actor),     Peter Jackson  (Director, Producer, Writer)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG-13    Format: Blu-ray\nMovies & TV, Blu-ray, Movies\n['Join Peter Jackson on the Journey to the World\u2019s Greatest Adventure Three-disc Extended Edition includes 13 minutes of revealing never-before-seen film footage and nearly 9 hours of fascinating in-depth looks at the production.']\n{'Brand': 'NEW LINE HOME VIDEO', 'Package Type': 'Standard Packaging', 'Number of Items': '3', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 5.6 Ounces', 'Item model number': '27724716', 'Director': 'Peter Jackson', 'Media Format': 'Blu-ray, Blu-ray, NTSC', 'Run time': '3 hours and 2 minutes', 'Release date': 'November 5, 2013', 'Actors': 'Ian McKellen, Martin Freeman, Richard Armitage, James Nesbitt, Ken Stott', 'Producers': 'Peter Jackson, Alan Horn, Toby Emmerich, Fran Walsh, Carolynne Cunningham', 'Studio': 'WarnerBrothers', 'Writers': 'Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Guillermo del Toro', 'Number of discs': '3'}\nI was a huge fan of the LotR movies, and I have read all of the books multiple times.  The Hobbit series was horrid for me.  They added way too much bloat, and the action sequences were ridiculous, over-the-top and cartoony.  The Hobbit movies are to Lord of the Rings as Star Wars episodes 1-3 are to the original trilogy.\nLord of the Rings - Episode 1\nThe Witch\nKate Dickie  (Actor),     Julian Richings  (Actor),     Robert Eggers  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: Blu-ray\nMovies & TV, Blu-ray, Movies\n['A devoutly Christian family in 1630s New England, struggles to survive living along the edge of a vast wilderness.

It's 96 minutes long, but felt like 196 minutes.  I must say, it was extremely anticlimactic and not scary at all.  If I could return it, I would.  Wait for it to be streaming on one of the standard streaming services instead of wasting money on it.\nNot scary.

The movie did a great job keeping the spirit of the lore from the game series and (from what I can tell) the novelizations.  Sure, there are some departures from &#34;the way it really happened,&#34; but that was expected, and quite frankly, pretty well done.  The movie itself was fairly grim - some of your favorite characters might suffer (or die?)  I expected the special effects to be on the lame side, but on the contrary, they were very well done (provided you ignore the Kirin Tor members' eyes.)<br /><br />Overall, the movie had enough hat tips to the game series (complete with pop-culure references!) to keep me happy, but did a fine enough job presenting itself to someone who has never played any of the games (one person being my wife, who also thoroughly enjoyed it!)\nThumbs up from a long-time fan of the game",
