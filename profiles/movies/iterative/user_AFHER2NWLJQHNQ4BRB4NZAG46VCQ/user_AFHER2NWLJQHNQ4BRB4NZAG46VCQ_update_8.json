The Road definitely fits that category!  The story, as the description indicates, is largely based on the journey that a father and his son take after the world ends.  All the vegetation has been decimated, and the animals are long gone.  The only life that remains are a few packs of mostly unsavory (which is probably why they kept trying to eat newly-found people) humans trying to get by.  The cast and crew did an amazing job:  This film was uncomfortable to watch most of the time!  As the story kept unfolding, I kept wondering what'd happen next.  The final events leading up to the end weren't a huge surprise, but the very end had a subtle twist that I thought was quite well done!  My response was simply: \"Wow?!\"\nReview Title: Desperate, hopeless, and amazing!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I've enjoyed von Trier's wor in the past, and Willem Dafoe usually provides a wonderful performance (which could be taken in other ways in this context.)  The movie was amazing in the sense of being a work of art, but I don't think I could watch it a second time (though I'm tempted to buy it just to support von Trier's work.)  It contains intense violence, sex and a rather bizarre story.  I highly recommend it to those who enjoy a smart, artsy film and have strong stomachs.\nIncredibly well done, but extremely morbid.\nLady in the Water [Blu-ray]\nPaul Giamatti  (Actor),     Bryce Dallas Howard  (Actor)    Rated:    PG-13    Format: Blu-ray\nMovies & TV, Blu-ray, Movies\n['Lady In The Water (BD)', ']]>']\n{'Genre': 'Fantasy, Suspense, Science Fiction', 'Format': 'AC-3, Blu-ray, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, Dubbed, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Freddy Rodriguez, Jared Harris, Jeffrey Wright, Bob Balaban, M.

It was a great movie with a great story and a not entirely predictable \"surprise\" ending.  I also enjoyed his follow-up film, Unbreakable (yet it wasn't too well received.)  Each of his later films, however, have left me disappointed.  Lady in the Water is no different.  He keep trying to  string insane story ideas together, only to cap them off with a \"surprise\" ending.  A surprise ending is only a surprise if you're not expecting it!  Another problem I have is how his characters always seem to just accept whatever's going on in the movie.<br /><br />This film is about a water nymph that's trying to save the world from humanity.  Or maybe it's to save humanity from themselves...  Anyway.  She shows up in the swimming pool of an apartment complex filled with very eccentric tenants.  The landlord of the complex is the man who finds her, and immediately clings to this nymph.  He's not quite too sure what to do with her, but conveniently there's an Asian family (Japanese, I think) that just happens to know the legend.  So, to appease the elder lady of the household (who is the expert of the legend,) he goes through some rather silly exercises.  Once he knows this legend, he goes to all the other tenants for help.  They all immediately buy into his tale and pitch in right away.  As the movie progresses, things become more and more convoluted.  Eventually everyone figures out what to do, and the \"surprise\" happens.  Seriously...  I wasn't surprised in any fashion.  In fact, I predicted what'd happen.<br /><br />Here are the stats:<br /><br />Violence/Blood/Gore:  Almost none.<br />Boobs:  None.<br />Likable characters:  Maybe the landlord?<br />Plot devices that made sense:  None.<br />People in this film that look like Jeff Goldbloom:  M Knight Shamalayan.<br /><br />Over all verdict:  Maybe watch it on cable if you're having a hard time sleeping.  Otherwise skip.\nReally?\nTrue Blood: Season 1\nAnna Paquin  (Actor),     Stephen Moyer  (Actor)    Rated:    PG    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, HBO, All HBO Titles\n['Product Description', 'True Blood: The Complete First Season (DVD)', 'TRUE BLOOD chronicles the backwoods Louisiana town of Bon Temps... where vampires have emerged from the coffin, and no longer need humans for their fix. Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin, Golden Globe(R)-winner for \"True Blood\", Academy Award\u00ae-winner for \u201cThe Piano\u201d) works as a waitress at the rural bar Merlotte\\'s. Though outwardly a typical young woman, she keeps a dangerous secret: she has the ability to hear the thoughts of others. Her situation is further complicated when the bar gets its first vampire patron - 173-year old Bill Compton (Steven Moyer, \"Quills\") - and the two outsiders are immediately drawn to each other. Delivering the best of what audiences have come to expect from Creator and Executive Producer Alan Ball (writer of Oscar\u00ae-winning Best Picture \u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d, creator of the Emmy\u00ae Award-winning HBO\u00ae series \u201cSix Feet Under\u201d), TRUE BLOOD is a dark and sexy tale that boldly delves into the heart - and the neck - of the Deep South.', ']]>', 'Amazon.com', 'Alan Ball\u2019s', 'True Blood', 'series works well for television, as it has enough sensationalism to tantalize and enough story girth to make the viewer care about the characters.

Illicit love is spawned early on, when Sookie saves vampire Bill Compton (Stephen Moyer) from having his blood stolen in the parking lot of Merlotte\u2019s diner, owned by Sam Merlotte (Sam Trammell) who completes what will form a complex love triangle. As tensions between Sookie\u2019s suitors loosen or tighten, many side plots, such as her African American best friend Tara\u2019s (Rutina Wesley) struggle with an alcoholic, Bible-thumping mother and her brother\u2019s dangerous crush on drug addicted hippie, Amy Burley (Lizzy Caplan), keep one wondering who will succeed in this podunk place. The main tension throughout, however, is a race war waged between vampires and humans. As murders of \u201cfang bangers\u201d occur (human girls who let vampires bite them) and dumb policeman Andy Bellefleur (Chris Bauer) fails to find clues, one sees the metaphorical implications of vampirism and feels deeper resonance with what can be a downright trashy show. Gossip galore, especially about what kinds of babies interbreeding will produce, is rampant. One of the funniest characters is Tara\u2019s flamboyant cousin, Lafayette (Nelsan Ellis), who deals drugs, works as a fry cook, and services the local white politicians, while making sure he\u2019s always up in everyone\u2019s business.', 'What makes', 'True Blood', 'smarter than pure soap opera is the parallels it draws between its monster mash and actual, familiar societal problems.

Horror movies and even vampire stories have always been my favorites.  Campy TV shows like Buffy are right up my ally.  This show, however, reached a level of absurdity that I cannot tolerate.  I begrudgingly made it half way through the third episode before I had to turn it off.  My initial reaction to the first episode stuck through out.  I didn't really care for any of the characters, the dialog was awful and the whole \"forbidden romance between a girl and a vampire\" idea has been played out, beaten up and burned down to the ground already.  To be open minded, I did try to stick this out.  I made it to the third episode hoping that the negative vibe I got would grow a bit.  That didn't happen for me, however.<br /><br />Over all, this show feels like it's made for teenagers with a vampire fetish.\nRidiculous\nDexter: Season 1\nMichael C.

The idea of a serial killer who only kills other killers is rather intriguing, and this show presents it in such a fun way.  The characters are all great and the dialog is brilliantly witty.  The first season had a slight flaw of being rather predictable, but that really doesn't detract from my over all rating.  This show is also strangely  addictive!  The only way to really watch it is by DVD or somehow streaming it from the internet (I watched it on Netflix, but I enjoyed it enough to buy on DVD once I get some extra cash!) so you can watch the episodes back-to-back, as most every one ends as a cliff hanger.\nLoved it!\nNight of the Demons\nEdward Furlong  (Actor),     Shannon Elizabeth  (Actor),     Adam Gierasch  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Horror\n[\"Angela (Shannon Elizabeth) is throwing a decadent Halloween part at New Orleans' infamous Broussard Mansion.

In his character's fierce determination to live--but also the gentle sighs he lets forth when confronted with, say, his first sip of whisky in years--Mortensen is completely in the moment, and all too human in the post-human world.\", '--Robert Horton', 'Stills from', 'The Road', '(Click for larger image)']\n{'Genre': 'Drama, Thriller', 'Format': 'AC-3, Blu-ray, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Viggo Mortensen, Charlize Theron', 'Language': 'English', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 51 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '2.35:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'Relay time: 119min', 'Media Format': 'AC-3, Blu-ray, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Run time': '1 hour and 51 minutes', 'Release date': 'May 25, 2010', 'Actors': 'Viggo Mortensen, Charlize Theron', 'Subtitles': 'English', 'Studio': 'Sony', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nI've long been a fan of the post-apocalyptic genre when it comes to fiction and games.  The Road definitely fits that category!  The story, as the description indicates, is largely based on the journey that a father and his son take after the world ends.  All the vegetation has been decimated, and the animals are long gone.  The only life that remains are a few packs of mostly unsavory (which is probably why they kept trying to eat newly-found people) humans trying to get by.  The cast and crew did an amazing job:  This film was uncomfortable to watch most of the time!  As the story kept unfolding, I kept wondering what'd happen next.  The final events leading up to the end weren't a huge surprise, but the very end had a subtle twist that I thought was quite well done!  My response was simply: \"Wow?!\"\nDesperate, hopeless, and amazing!",
