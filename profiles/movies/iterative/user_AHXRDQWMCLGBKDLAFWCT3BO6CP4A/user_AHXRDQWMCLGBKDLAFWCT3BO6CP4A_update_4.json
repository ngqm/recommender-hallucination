We have to be careful about when we watch because we cannot quit until we have seen all of the episodes in the season.  End up staying up very late sometimes because we cannot bear not to know what comes next!\nReview of Season 5 Doc Martin\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', 'Espa\u00f1ol [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Ben Bolt', 'Minkie Spiro'], 'Producers': ['Mark Crowdy'], 'Starring': ['Martin Clunes', 'Caroline Catz', 'Stephanie Cole']}\nLove it.
