But the idea of this movie is so original, I like the idea of our guys stealing one of our own nukes to threaten the Russians who stole some of our nuclear fuel to make a bomb and put it in the Saudi oil fields in an attempt to get the Israeli's off the west bank. It feels like a class B movie, but it is enjoyable all the same.
