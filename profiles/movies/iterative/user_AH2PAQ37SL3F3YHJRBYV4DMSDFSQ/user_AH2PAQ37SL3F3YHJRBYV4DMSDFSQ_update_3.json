But the idea of this movie is so original, I like the idea of our guys stealing one of our own nukes to threaten the Russians who stole some of our nuclear fuel to make a bomb and put it in the Saudi oil fields in an attempt to get the Israeli's off the west bank. It feels like a class B movie, but it is enjoyable all the same. This movie would make a great remake if done today, and considering some of the garbage that has been released lately, this one would be a big hit.\nGreat concept for storyline\nHigh Road to China\nTom Selleck  (Actor),     Bess Armstrong  (Actor),     Brian G.

Selleck stars as Patrick O'Malley, a boozing, washed-up aviator who meets his match when he's hired by a high-strung heiress to find her long lost father. They make their way eastward in O'Malley's WWI biplane, surviving narrow escapes, last second rescues, and combat with warlords along the way. But nothing tops the ongoing battle they have with each other - the one which leads inevitably to romance.\"]\n{'Genre': 'Action & Adventure', 'Format': 'Widescreen, Multiple Formats, NTSC, Subtitled, Color', 'Contributor': 'Tom Selleck, Jack Weston, Brian G.
