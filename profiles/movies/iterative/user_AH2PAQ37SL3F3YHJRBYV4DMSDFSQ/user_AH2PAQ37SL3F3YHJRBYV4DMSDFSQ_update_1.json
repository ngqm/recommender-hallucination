VHS TAPE Sealed (as shown) \"The Soldier [VHS]\" Fast shipping..(DC-3)']\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '7.32 x 4.19 x 1.12 inches; 6.13 Ounces', 'Director': 'James Glickenhaus', 'Run time': '1 hour and 36 minutes', 'Release date': 'April 6, 1999', 'Date First Available': 'September 29, 2006', 'Actors': 'Ken Wahl, Alberta Watson, Jeremiah Sullivan, William Prince, Klaus Kinski', 'Studio': 'Fox Home Entertainme'}\nReview Text: Back in the 80s when this was made, i think it was a pretty good flick, it has a weak plot though and some areas could have been expanded upon. But the idea of this movie is so original, I like the idea of our guys stealing one of our own nukes to threaten the Russians who stole some of our nuclear fuel to make a bomb and put it in the Saudi oil fields in an attempt to get the Israeli's off the west bank. It feels like a class B movie, but it is enjoyable all the same. This movie would make a great remake if done today, and considering some of the garbage that has been released lately, this one would be a big hit.\nReview Title: Great concept for storyline\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
