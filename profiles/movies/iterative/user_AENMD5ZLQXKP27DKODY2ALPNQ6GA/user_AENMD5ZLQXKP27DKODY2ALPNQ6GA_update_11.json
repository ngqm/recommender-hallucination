My children sing the songs from Newsies around the house on Disney's Pandora. We love Christian Bale and the story is historical fiction, so it is both education and fun. I think it provided an opportunity for me to explain to my own children how EASY they have it, and had they been born a century earlier this could be them...working 10-12 hours a day in a factory or selling newspapers. The songs though, so catchy. Fun for the whole family on movie night!\nReview Title: \"It's a Fine Life, Carrying the Banner in New York!\"\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

It is like going on a ride at Disneyland! Of course Dwayne Johnson is easy on the eyes, but he delivers humor so well. My children loved both movies, but this one was their favorite.
