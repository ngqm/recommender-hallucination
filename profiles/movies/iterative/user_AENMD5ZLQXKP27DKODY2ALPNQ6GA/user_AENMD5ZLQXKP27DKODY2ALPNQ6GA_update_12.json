He was so precious to all of us. He could play with our 3 year old, or hang out with our son who was his age though my son towered over him. My son was very protective of him. He passed away in his sleep just before Christmas when he was 12 years old. Our hearts were broken. When we saw the trailers for &#34;Wonder,&#34; about six months after his death, we all KNEW that he HAD to see this movie together. We watched it in our home, and all of us cried. We all were amazed at the strength of this young boy, and were cheering his victories and crying during his sadness. We saw so much of our little friend in Auggie. It brought us closer to him. Our children already had had their learning experiences with their friend, but they all felt deeply for Auggie and as such, will never forget this story. It teaches so much about what is on the inside, and that those who are different from us...they can have the best stories!\nReview Title: My children had a very very good friend who had a disfigured face due to a ...\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I uses to watch it with my dad after work 20 years ago. Still love Jean-Luc Picard...but enjoying all of the characters a little more now that I am older. And my kids watch it with me.

My dad has since passed away and in an effort to connect him to my kids all four of them watxh the STNG reruns with me. We love them. Cutting edge for 25 years ago. And family friendly plots and episodes (with enough adult humour and scenes to keep the adults interested). As entertaining today as 20 yeara ago...and it still excites my son to think of the &#34;possibilities!&#34;\nToday or 25 Years ago\n{'Audio languages': ['English', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)'], 'Directors': ['Robert Stevenson'], 'Producers': ['Bill Walsh'], 'Starring': ['Angela Lansbury', 'David Tomlinson'], 'Studio': ['Walt Disney Pictures']}\nOne of the best Disney movies ever.

It is like going on a ride at Disneyland! Of course Dwayne Johnson is easy on the eyes, but he delivers humor so well. My children loved both movies, but this one was their favorite. Who knew a sequel could be better than the first one? But this was like Land of the Lost meets Honey I Shrunk the Kids!

My children sing the songs from Newsies around the house on Disney's Pandora. We love Christian Bale and the story is historical fiction, so it is both education and fun. I think it provided an opportunity for me to explain to my own children how EASY they have it, and had they been born a century earlier this could be them...working 10-12 hours a day in a factory or selling newspapers. The songs though, so catchy.
