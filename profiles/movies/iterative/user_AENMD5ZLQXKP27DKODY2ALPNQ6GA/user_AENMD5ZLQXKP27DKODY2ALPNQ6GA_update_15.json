I am tired of Disney redoing the classic movies and computer/lifelike film versions of our favorite animations. I love Emily Blunt...but not in this role. I felt that the whole movie lacked a strong execution of a storyline. That Mary Poppins came in and barely introduced herself before all her \"magic\" began. There was no real reason behind some of their adventures. Most were unnecessary. There was nearly no connection between Mary and Burt.

It is like going on a ride at Disneyland! Of course Dwayne Johnson is easy on the eyes, but he delivers humor so well. My children loved both movies, but this one was their favorite. Who knew a sequel could be better than the first one? But this was like Land of the Lost meets Honey I Shrunk the Kids!

My children sing the songs from Newsies around the house on Disney's Pandora. We love Christian Bale and the story is historical fiction, so it is both education and fun. I think it provided an opportunity for me to explain to my own children how EASY they have it, and had they been born a century earlier this could be them...working 10-12 hours a day in a factory or selling newspapers. The songs though, so catchy. Fun for the whole family on movie night!\n\"It's a Fine Life, Carrying the Banner in New York!\"\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Stephen Chbosky'], 'Producers': ['David Hoberman', 'Todd Lieberman'], 'Starring': ['Julia Roberts', 'Jacob Tremblay', 'Owen Wilson'], 'Studio': ['Lionsgate']}\nMy children had a very very good friend who had a disfigured face due to a car accident when he was 2 yrs old. He was so precious to all of us. He could play with our 3 year old, or hang out with our son who was his age though my son towered over him. My son was very protective of him. He passed away in his sleep just before Christmas when he was 12 years old. Our hearts were broken. When we saw the trailers for &#34;Wonder,&#34; about six months after his death, we all KNEW that he HAD to see this movie together. We watched it in our home, and all of us cried. We all were amazed at the strength of this young boy, and were cheering his victories and crying during his sadness. We saw so much of our little friend in Auggie. It brought us closer to him. Our children already had had their learning experiences with their friend, but they all felt deeply for Auggie and as such, will never forget this story. It teaches so much about what is on the inside, and that those who are different from us...they can have the best stories!\nMy children had a very very good friend who had a disfigured face due to a ...\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Brad J. Silverman'], 'Producers': ['Robert Norton', 'Russ Rice', 'Larry Frenzel', 'Christopher M. Zarpas'], 'Starring': ['Aj Michalka', 'James Denton', 'Kevin Pollak'], 'Studio': ['ROADSIDE ATTRACTIONS LLC']}\nAlthough the plot was a little predictable (The Prodigal's Daughter), the music was amazing. And the lead's transition was also a wonderful, feel-good movie that I cannot wait to watch it with my daughters. Lots of great lessons to share and discover in this movie. Highly recommend.\nGreat Movie To Watch With My Teenage Girls\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Chantelle Squires'], 'Producers': ['Brent Geisler', 'Melissa Leilani Larson', 'Tamu Smith', 'Chantelle Squires', 'Zandra Vranes'], 'Starring': ['Danielle Deadwyler', 'Emily Goss', 'Brad Schmidt'], 'Studio': ['Samuel Goldwyn Films']}\nThis was a Number 1 pick at a bookstore I was in, and I had also seen it advertised as a new release. I was excited to hear about Jane Mannings experiences with the Latter-day Saint people. Though I am not delusional enough to believe that the African-American's of that time were always treated equally, I also cannot see that Emma and Joseph would have ever knowingly hurt a person they cared and loved as they did Jane. From what I have read, Joseph and Emma loved Jane very much. From my studies it seems out of character for either of them to have spoken about or to Jane in a way that was condescending. I suppose I could be wrong. I suppose most of my thoughts regarding this are simply imagined as was this movie. It felt as if a message or agenda was being pushed where there wasn't any fact-based evidence to support that these events occurred. Perhaps I missed the notice of it being more than historical fiction. Either way, it just felt really off right up until the end. I would not watch it again myself. Would not recommend it either.\nVERY Disappointed\n{'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)'], 'Subtitles': ['English', 'English [CC]', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica) [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Rob Marshall'], 'Producers': ['Rob Marshall', 'John DeLuca', 'Marc Platt'], 'Starring': ['Emily Blunt', 'Ben Whishaw', 'Pixie Davies'], 'Studio': ['Walt Disney Pictures']}\nI had didn't have high expectations of this movie.

I felt that the whole movie lacked a strong execution of a storyline. That Mary Poppins came in and barely introduced herself before all her \"magic\" began. There was no real reason behind some of their adventures. Most were unnecessary. There was nearly no connection between Mary and Burt.
