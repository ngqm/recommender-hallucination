My dad has since passed away and in an effort to connect him to my kids all four of them watxh the STNG reruns with me. We love them. Cutting edge for 25 years ago. And family friendly plots and episodes (with enough adult humour and scenes to keep the adults interested). As entertaining today as 20 yeara ago...and it still excites my son to think of the &#34;possibilities!&#34;\nToday or 25 Years ago\n{'Audio languages': ['English', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)'], 'Directors': ['Robert Stevenson'], 'Producers': ['Bill Walsh'], 'Starring': ['Angela Lansbury', 'David Tomlinson'], 'Studio': ['Walt Disney Pictures']}\nOne of the best Disney movies ever.
