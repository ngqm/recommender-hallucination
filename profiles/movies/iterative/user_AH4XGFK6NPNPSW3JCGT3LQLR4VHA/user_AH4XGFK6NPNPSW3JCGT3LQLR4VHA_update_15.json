When her sister is killed by the werewolf that prowls the dark forest surrounding their village, the people call on a famed werewolf hunter to help them kill the wolf.

Valerie's heart belongs to her childhood friend Peter (Shiloh Fernandez), but as\", 'Red Riding Hood', \"opens, she learns she has been betrothed to Henry (Max Irons). As if that love triangle weren't enough, it seems a dangerous wolf--or is it werewolf?--has been terrorizing the town for years, and its killing sprees have intensified. When the townsfolk kill a wolf, they think they have finally freed their town from tyranny, and throw a giant bacchanal--like Burning Man in the snow. But then Father Solomon (Gary Oldman, in wickedly good form) appears on the scene to tell the villagers they've killed only a gray wolf--not, in fact, the werewolf he knows is the true villain.\", \"So the romantic pulls of Valerie, Peter, and Henry play out with a backdrop of true chills and mystery. The atmosphere created by Hardwicke, along with production designer Thomas E. Sanders and cinematographer Mandy Walker, is perfect for a goose-bumpy horror story with teen hearts caught in the balance. The set design of the village, especially, is rich with detail--even the trees in the surrounding forest seem to have branches made of threatening spikes. Seyfried is willful, passionate, and perfect as Valerie, and easily anchors a film that could have spun out. Other standouts include Virginia Madsen, Valerie's mother who has a dark secret in her own past, and Julie Christie as Valerie's rather peculiar grandmother.

The road-trip stuff is enough fun that when the movie does arrive at its version of Disneyland, the air goes out of it a little; sure, there's a giant zombie blowout, with entrails flying, but it's not quite the same. Director Ruben Fleischer keeps the gags coming, although the movie is often funnier in its odd little asides (both Eisenberg and Harrelson are expert at this) than in its official jokes. Comic high point: an interlude at the home of a very famous movie star, who plays himself--and we'll leave the spoiler unspoiled, in case anybody hasn't heard about this funny extended cameo.\", '--Robert Horton', 'Stills from', 'Zombieland', '(Click for larger image)']\n{'Genre': 'Action, Sci-Fi, Horror, Comedy', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Color, Dolby, Dubbed, NTSC, Widescreen, Subtitled', 'Contributor': 'Abigail Breslin, Derek Graf, Ruben Fleischer, Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Zombieland Productions, LLC, Gavin Polone, Amber Heard, Emma Stone, Bill MurrayAbigail Breslin, Derek Graf, Ruben Fleischer, Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Zombieland Productions, LLC, Gavin Polone, Amber Heard, Emma Stone, Bill Murray  See more', 'Language': 'French (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo), Unqualified (DTS ES 6.1)', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 28 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '2.40:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.57 x 4.98 x 7.84 inches; 2.56 Ounces', 'Audio Description': 'English', 'Item model number': 'CTR33154DVD', 'Director': 'Ruben Fleischer', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Color, Dolby, Dubbed, NTSC, Widescreen, Subtitled', 'Run time': '1 hour and 28 minutes', 'Release date': 'February 2, 2010', 'Actors': 'Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, Abigail Breslin, Amber Heard', 'Dubbed': 'French', 'Subtitles': 'English, French', 'Producers': 'Gavin Polone', 'Studio': 'Sony Pictures Home Entertainment', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nlove this movie\nFive Stars\nRepo!
