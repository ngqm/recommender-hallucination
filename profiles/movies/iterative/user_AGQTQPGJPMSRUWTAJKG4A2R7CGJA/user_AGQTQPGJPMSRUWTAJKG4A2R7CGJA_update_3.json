I only bought it for 1 cent. Yes that's right 1 cent! And paid a few bucks for shipping and handling. It was in great condition, no scratches, it didn't skip at all. Love amazon. I highly recommend buying items on here. Never had a problem with anything I purchased.\nGina\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['David Twohy'], 'Producers': ['Ryan Kavanaugh', 'Mark Canton', 'Tucker Tooley', 'Robbie Brenner'], 'Starring': ['Timothy Olyphant', 'Steve Zahn', 'Milla Jovovich'], 'Studio': ['Rogue Pictures']}\nLoved this movie. I seen it years ago and decided to rent it and stream it. It was $1.99. I think it should be cheaper or free  since it's a older movie. You only have it for 24 hours. I was confused when I 1st rented it. It said I had it for 30 days then the next day I watched the rest of it bc I fell asleep the 1st time, it then said I had 16 hours left to watch it. Maybe they're was a glitch in the system.. I think if your renting it you should have it available longer than 24 hours. If played well. No interruptions.\nGood\nAlvin and the Chipmunks: The Chipmunk Adventure\nRated:    G    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Kids & Family\n['ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS:CHIPMUNK ADVE - DVD Movie']\n{'Format': 'NTSC, Full Screen', 'Contributor': 'Alvin & The Chipmunks', 'Language': 'Unqualified (DTS ES 6.1)', 'Publication Date': 'March 23, 2010', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'G (General Audience)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.5 x 0.5 inches; 3.2 Ounces', 'Media Format': 'NTSC, Full Screen', 'Release date': 'March 23, 2010', 'Actors': 'Alvin & The Chipmunks', 'Studio': 'Paramount'}\nLoved this movie when I was a kid!
