Somewhere along the 900 miles between Austin, TX and Huntsville, AL the two men become unlikely friends. However, every road has an end. In Huntsville, sad truths come to light, with heartbreak and violence lingering in their wake, ultimately leaving both men changed forever. The music of \"Redemption Road\" is permeated with authenticity, from Country music - perfectly befitting the film\\'s Nashville locations - to the full scope of the Blues with a pinch of good old-fashioned Gospel to reflect the film\\'s deeper themes of faith.']\n{'Genre': 'Music Videos & Concerts', 'Format': 'NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Peebles, Mario Van, Perry, Luke, Manning, Taryn, Duncan, Michael Clarke, Simpson, Morgan, Sanchez, Kiele, Skerritt, TomPeebles, Mario Van, Perry, Luke, Manning, Taryn, Duncan, Michael Clarke, Simpson, Morgan, Sanchez, Kiele, Skerritt, Tom  See more', 'Language': 'English', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'Unrated (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 2.72 Ounces', 'Item model number': '18713591791', 'Director': 'Peebles, Mario Van', 'Media Format': 'NTSC', 'Release date': 'August 7, 2012', 'Actors': 'Duncan, Michael Clarke, Simpson, Morgan, Sanchez, Kiele, Manning, Taryn, Perry, Luke', 'Studio': 'Freestyle Releasing', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nI Like Any Movie That, Has Blue's Music.
