Confined to a secret facility known as the \"Dollhouse,\" Echo and the other Actives including Sierra and Victor carry out engagements assigned by Adelle, one of the Dollhouse leaders.

After each scenario, Echo, always under the watchful eye of her handler Boyd, returns to the mysterious Dollhouse where her thoughts, feelings and experiences are erased by Topher, the Dollhouse\\'s genius programmer. Echo enters the next scenario with no memory of before.
