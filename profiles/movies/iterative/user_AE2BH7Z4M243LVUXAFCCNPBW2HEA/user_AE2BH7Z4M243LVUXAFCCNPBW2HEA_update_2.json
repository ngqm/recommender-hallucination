Created by the now-legendary James L. Brooks (The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Rhoda, The Simpsons), the program was praised for dealing realistically with such subjects as racism, sexism, illiteracy, guns in school and drugs. Pete Dixon (Lloyd Haynes) is a dedicated and popular history teacher who fights the good fight on the side of his students. Joining him in his idealistic approach to education are guidance counselor Liz McIntyre (Denise Nicholas) and student teacher Alice Johnson (Karen Valentine). Experienced and slightly world-weary principal Seymour Kaufman (Michael Constantine) provides a balance to the youthful idealism of the '60s cultural revolution\u2014but at the end of the day, everyone is on the side of the students.

It's interesting to view the students or rather the actors portraying the students' feelings of anxiety and despair in the society i.e., the assassinations, the riots, conscription  and how their views mirrored the militant/counter culture groups of that time period (e.g., The Black Panthers; The Weather Underground; Brothers of Internal Love, FLQ). And to watch the following actors in the early stages of their careers and how skinny they were was comical:  i.e. , Teri Garr; Glynn Turman- A Different World, The Wire; Rob Riener; Cindy Williams--Lavern and Shirley; Ed Bagley Jr. and Kurt Russell.\nReview Title: What Memories of the Turbulent late 1960's\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

BUT the cast of MST3000 rip it to shreds.  With the exception of Gypsy (extremely annoying), the cast has some good one liners: \"Mr Treveno has been hit again\" ; \"he just landed just short of the green\"; \"fresh panties all around\"; and  Tom Servo's obsession with Joe Don Baker's eating/farting.
