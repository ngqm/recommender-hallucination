The acting by all was fantastic, especially, Jeff Bridges and Rob Reiner.Remembered a bits and pieces of it on late night television in mid-seventies. I was too young to see it  the theaters. Just as well I was living it myself. Not in the US but in Toronto, Ontario, Canada--not as violent but the name calling was prevalent. Being a child that grew up in the 1970's it was just a terrible time as far as race relations.  Nevertheless, the film captured the  savagery and primitive  behavior of the time period of 1970 at the time of the US secondary school busing enactment.<br /><br />Didn't understand the point of why the black girls were ripping  the  white girl's close off? A very eerie scene!!! Probably a reaction to black men would possibly pay more attention to her for various reasons, coupled with black women's insecurity of the alleged notion of the western culture's standard of beauty is caucasian. Regardless the scene did it's job of capturing the viewer's emotions.<br /><br />Dare I say, and it still stands today, when a women who are clearly more attractive than a certain mass of women, the low self-esteem and/or not so attractive women get attention starved and feel angry and scared of being ostracized and, worse case, they believe, they'll die alone.<br /><br />Perhaps this film should be archived in the US National Film Registry.\nReview Title: Just an Ugly time for Black Americans in the early 1970's, and the film captured it.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

BUT the cast of MST3000 rip it to shreds.  With the exception of Gypsy (extremely annoying), the cast has some good one liners: \"Mr Treveno has been hit again\" ; \"he just landed just short of the green\"; \"fresh panties all around\"; and  Tom Servo's obsession with Joe Don Baker's eating/farting.

Created by the now-legendary James L. Brooks (The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Rhoda, The Simpsons), the program was praised for dealing realistically with such subjects as racism, sexism, illiteracy, guns in school and drugs. Pete Dixon (Lloyd Haynes) is a dedicated and popular history teacher who fights the good fight on the side of his students. Joining him in his idealistic approach to education are guidance counselor Liz McIntyre (Denise Nicholas) and student teacher Alice Johnson (Karen Valentine). Experienced and slightly world-weary principal Seymour Kaufman (Michael Constantine) provides a balance to the youthful idealism of the '60s cultural revolution\u2014but at the end of the day, everyone is on the side of the students.

It's interesting to view the students or rather the actors portraying the students' feelings of anxiety and despair in the society i.e., the assassinations, the riots, conscription  and how their views mirrored the militant/counter culture groups of that time period (e.g., The Black Panthers; The Weather Underground; Brothers of Internal Love, FLQ). And to watch the following actors in the early stages of their careers and how skinny they were was comical:  i.e. , Teri Garr; Glynn Turman- A Different World, The Wire; Rob Riener; Cindy Williams--Lavern and Shirley; Ed Bagley Jr. and Kurt Russell.\nWhat Memories of the Turbulent late 1960's\nMiami Vice: Season 4\nDon Johnson  (Actor),     Philip Michael Thomas  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Studio Specials, Universal Studios Home Entertainment, All Universal Studios Titles\n['Hit the streets again with Don Johnson as James \"Sonny\" Crockett and Philip Michael Thomas as Ricardo Tubbs, two of the world\\'s slickest undercover cops, in Season Four of Miami Vice!

I m going to read a declaration of a state of war...Within the next 14 days we will attack a symbol or institution of American injustice --Bernardine Dohrn', 'Thirty years ago, with these words, a group of young American radicals called The Weathermen announced their intention to overthrow the U.S. government. Fueled by outrage over the Vietnam War and racism in America, they went undergound during the 1970s, bombing targets across the country that they felt symbolized the real violence that the U.S. government and capitalist power were wreaking throughout the world. From pitched battles with police on Chicago s city streets, to bombing the U.S. Capitol building, to breaking acid-guru Timothy Leary out of prison, this carefully organized clandestine network attempted to incite a national revolution, while successfully evading one of the largest FBI manhunts in history.', 'One of the top documentaries of the year, this award-winning film interweaves extensive archival material with modern-day interviews to explore the incredible story of The Weather Underground. As former members reflect candidly about the idealistic passion that drove them to bring the war home, they paint a compelling portrait of troubled and revolutionary times, with unexpected and often striking connections to the current world situation.', 'Special Features:', 'Commentary From Former Weathermen Bernardine Dohrn and Bill Ayers; Filmmaker Commentary; Original Weathermen Audio Communiques; Bonus Film on Former Weatherman David Gilbert: A Lifetime of Struggle; Excerpt from Emile de Antonio film Underground; Filmmaker Biographies; Filmmaker Statement; Spanish Subtitles; Interactive Menus; Scene Selection', 'Amazon.com', \"The key players in the radical movement known as the Weather Underground are skillfully brought to life in this Oscar-nominated documentary. The Weathermen were born of sixties protest, but took their scheme to overthrow the U.S. government to especially violent extremes. Never a well-populated movement, the Underground petered out as its leaders aged during the seventies; by decade's end, weary of hiding, most of them had turned themselves over to the authorities. That journey, by which a fire-breathing revolutionary such as Bernadine Dohrn became a (still fiery) gray-haired wife and mother, is an intriguing one. This film, rich in period footage (and some unnecessary sensationalism) captures the era somewhat broadly. But the present-day interviews with the participants, contrasted with their radical selves, provides an exceptionally detailed look inside the organization itself. It's not a nostalgic look back, and the overall mood is sobering rather than celebratory. Lili Taylor provides the narration.\", '--Robert Horton', 'Review', '. . .

The film does not at all glorify them, the directors simply told a story of why these American college students simply wanted to stop the senseless armed conflict in Vietnam and their stance against oppression and racism in America. While I don't agree with their politics i.e., communism, and their unrealistic premise of the majority of Americans would violently revolt against the American government, their commitment ( by death if necessary) to the cause for social change, as told by the director, is very engaging!! I absolutely can't get enough of Weatherman Niomi Jaffee's quote early in the film: &#34; if you sit in your little white house and go to your little  white job and allow the country you live in to murder people, and you sit there and don't do anything about it that's violence&#34;...if one is not part of the solution they're part of the problem. In the director's commentary, the director said when he interviewed the group said that they didn't want to be &#34;good Germans&#34; (in relation to Jaffe's quote)---wow!!<br /><br />I was only five years old when the group went underground, officially,in 1970 after the townhouse explosion (I had my own problems with racism) but I had heard of the name around 1975 and in 1980 when most of charges (the many bombings the group committed)were dropped because of arrogant, stupid, and corrupt tactics of the FBI.<br /><br />Too bad these directors, although nominated, didn't win the academy award for best documentary film---and these directors were not born during that time!! Any unearthed story from the turbulent 1960s that would educate today's young adults in order to further civilize and clean up bad behavior is alright by me.
