BUT the cast of MST3000 rip it to shreds.  With the exception of Gypsy (extremely annoying), the cast has some good one liners: \"Mr Treveno has been hit again\" ; \"he just landed just short of the green\"; \"fresh panties all around\"; and  Tom Servo's obsession with Joe Don Baker's eating/farting. One of the best!!!\nYes One of the Best\nRoom 222: Season Two [DVD]\nLloyd Haynes  (Actor),     Denise Nicholas  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, TV\n[\"A compelling series about life at a multiracial Los Angeles high school, Room 222 left an indelible mark on popular culture by using the half-hour form to explore socially relevant issues (more than a year before Norman Lear's other groundbreaking shows\u2014All in the Family and Maude) and by starting the still-popular trend of high school television series. Created by the now-legendary James L. Brooks (The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Rhoda, The Simpsons), the program was praised for dealing realistically with such subjects as racism, sexism, illiteracy, guns in school and drugs. Pete Dixon (Lloyd Haynes) is a dedicated and popular history teacher who fights the good fight on the side of his students. Joining him in his idealistic approach to education are guidance counselor Liz McIntyre (Denise Nicholas) and student teacher Alice Johnson (Karen Valentine). Experienced and slightly world-weary principal Seymour Kaufman (Michael Constantine) provides a balance to the youthful idealism of the '60s cultural revolution\u2014but at the end of the day, everyone is on the side of the students. Season Two guest stars include Richard Dreyfuss, Kurt Russell, Cindy Williams, Chuck Norris, Tim Matheson and Ed Begley, Jr.\", ']]>']\n{'Genre': 'Drama/Television, Television', 'Format': 'Subtitled, NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Lloyd Haynes, James L.

It's interesting to view the students or rather the actors portraying the students' feelings of anxiety and despair in the society i.e., the assassinations, the riots, conscription  and how their views mirrored the militant/counter culture groups of that time period (e.g., The Black Panthers; The Weather Underground; Brothers of Internal Love, FLQ). And to watch the following actors in the early stages of their careers and how skinny they were was comical:  i.e. , Teri Garr; Glynn Turman- A Different World, The Wire; Rob Riener; Cindy Williams--Lavern and Shirley; Ed Bagley Jr. and Kurt Russell.\nWhat Memories of the Turbulent late 1960's\nMiami Vice: Season 4\nDon Johnson  (Actor),     Philip Michael Thomas  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Studio Specials, Universal Studios Home Entertainment, All Universal Studios Titles\n['Hit the streets again with Don Johnson as James \"Sonny\" Crockett and Philip Michael Thomas as Ricardo Tubbs, two of the world\\'s slickest undercover cops, in Season Four of Miami Vice!

Had to wonder who i.e., Bill Hanna, Joe Barbera or Keith Andes, voice of Birdman, thought of the distinctive battle cry!!  Too bad the show was politically silent to the current events of time, i.e., 1967. Sadly Mr. Andes completed suicide in 2005 because of extreme ill heath (source: Internet movie data base).\nWhat imagination BillHanna and Joe Barbera had back in the late 19060's\nVietnam: The Ten Thousand Day War\nRichard Basehart  (Actor),     Alexander Haig  (Actor)    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Military & War\n['Known as history s first \"living room war,\" The Vietnam conflict is presented on 4 DVDs with clarity, authority and insight in this nearly 10-hour documentary.
