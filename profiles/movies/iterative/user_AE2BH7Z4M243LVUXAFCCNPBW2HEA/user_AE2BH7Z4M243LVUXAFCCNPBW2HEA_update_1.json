BUT the cast of MST3000 rip it to shreds.  With the exception of Gypsy (extremely annoying), the cast has some good one liners: \"Mr Treveno has been hit again\" ; \"he just landed just short of the green\"; \"fresh panties all around\"; and  Tom Servo's obsession with Joe Don Baker's eating/farting. One of the best!!!\nReview Title: Yes One of the Best\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
