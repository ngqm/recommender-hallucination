Fueled by outrage over the Vietnam War and racism in America, they went undergound during the 1970s, bombing targets across the country that they felt symbolized the real violence that the U.S. government and capitalist power were wreaking throughout the world. From pitched battles with police on Chicago s city streets, to bombing the U.S. Capitol building, to breaking acid-guru Timothy Leary out of prison, this carefully organized clandestine network attempted to incite a national revolution, while successfully evading one of the largest FBI manhunts in history.', 'One of the top documentaries of the year, this award-winning film interweaves extensive archival material with modern-day interviews to explore the incredible story of The Weather Underground.

The Weathermen were born of sixties protest, but took their scheme to overthrow the U.S. government to especially violent extremes. Never a well-populated movement, the Underground petered out as its leaders aged during the seventies; by decade's end, weary of hiding, most of them had turned themselves over to the authorities. That journey, by which a fire-breathing revolutionary such as Bernadine Dohrn became a (still fiery) gray-haired wife and mother, is an intriguing one. This film, rich in period footage (and some unnecessary sensationalism) captures the era somewhat broadly. But the present-day interviews with the participants, contrasted with their radical selves, provides an exceptionally detailed look inside the organization itself. It's not a nostalgic look back, and the overall mood is sobering rather than celebratory. Lili Taylor provides the narration.\", '--Robert Horton', 'Review', '. . .

The film does not at all glorify them, the directors simply told a story of why these American college students simply wanted to stop the senseless armed conflict in Vietnam and their stance against oppression and racism in America. While I don't agree with their politics i.e., communism, and their unrealistic premise of the majority of Americans would violently revolt against the American government, their commitment ( by death if necessary) to the cause for social change, as told by the director, is very engaging!! I absolutely can't get enough of Weatherman Niomi Jaffee's quote early in the film: &#34; if you sit in your little white house and go to your little  white job and allow the country you live in to murder people, and you sit there and don't do anything about it that's violence&#34;...if one is not part of the solution they're part of the problem. In the director's commentary, the director said when he interviewed the group said that they didn't want to be &#34;good Germans&#34; (in relation to Jaffe's quote)---wow!!<br /><br />I was only five years old when the group went underground, officially,in 1970 after the townhouse explosion (I had my own problems with racism) but I had heard of the name around 1975 and in 1980 when most of charges (the many bombings the group committed)were dropped because of arrogant, stupid, and corrupt tactics of the FBI.<br /><br />Too bad these directors, although nominated, didn't win the academy award for best documentary film---and these directors were not born during that time!! Any unearthed story from the turbulent 1960s that would educate today's young adults in order to further civilize and clean up bad behavior is alright by me.

BUT the cast of MST3000 rip it to shreds.  With the exception of Gypsy (extremely annoying), the cast has some good one liners: \"Mr Treveno has been hit again\" ; \"he just landed just short of the green\"; \"fresh panties all around\"; and  Tom Servo's obsession with Joe Don Baker's eating/farting.

Created by the now-legendary James L. Brooks (The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Rhoda, The Simpsons), the program was praised for dealing realistically with such subjects as racism, sexism, illiteracy, guns in school and drugs. Pete Dixon (Lloyd Haynes) is a dedicated and popular history teacher who fights the good fight on the side of his students. Joining him in his idealistic approach to education are guidance counselor Liz McIntyre (Denise Nicholas) and student teacher Alice Johnson (Karen Valentine). Experienced and slightly world-weary principal Seymour Kaufman (Michael Constantine) provides a balance to the youthful idealism of the '60s cultural revolution\u2014but at the end of the day, everyone is on the side of the students.

It's interesting to view the students or rather the actors portraying the students' feelings of anxiety and despair in the society i.e., the assassinations, the riots, conscription  and how their views mirrored the militant/counter culture groups of that time period (e.g., The Black Panthers; The Weather Underground; Brothers of Internal Love, FLQ).
