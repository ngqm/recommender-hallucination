The stream ran without any real buffering and I was happy with bitrate, picture and sound.<br />The movie itself, is enjoyable with good plot points and action<br />There are several plot holes and continuity errors- pretty standard for action movies and Tom Cruise's performance is not as good as it could be.<br />The script is tight but does not grab your emotions very firmly. The supporting cast is really what makes up for any lack you feel in the tug of the plot or main character.<br />Overall I enjoyed it. Not enough to want to own it or even watch it again unless it was on TV and the choice came down to it and Duck Dynasty.\nBetter than I expected\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Constantine Makris', 'Matt Earl Beesley', 'Jamie Babbit', 'Ed Bianchi', 'Stephen Hopkins'], 'Producers': ['Bob DeLaurentis', \"Peter O'Fallon\", 'Noah Hawley'], 'Studio': ['ABC Network']}\nI had my doubts, but I loved the cast pretty much from the get go. The show has smart dialogue and crazy &#34;night court&#34; plot twists. The surprise of the show is while you are looking for humor and actionb you are getting emotion from the acting and situations. It's not melodrama as much as you start to care for the characters even the ones who have despicable pasts. I would highly recommend this show if you like The Glades, or The Finder\nthis is a fresh show filled with smart humor\nInkheart (+ BD-Live) [Blu-ray]\nBrendan Fraser  (Actor),     Paul Bettany  (Actor),     Iain Softley  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG    Format: Blu-ray\nMovies & TV, Today's Deals, Featured Deals & New Releases, The Big DVD & Blu-ray Blowout\n['Inkheart (Blu-ray)', 'When Mo Folchart reads a story, the characters leap off the page.

What I got was a good cohesive story with enough mystery that if it had been a book I would have continued turning the pages until I learned all of its secrets. There were some scenes that just went to fast and I felt like there could have been more there.
