The show has smart dialogue and crazy &#34;night court&#34; plot twists. The surprise of the show is while you are looking for humor and actionb you are getting emotion from the acting and situations. It's not melodrama as much as you start to care for the characters even the ones who have despicable pasts. I would highly recommend this show if you like The Glades, or The Finder\nReview Title: this is a fresh show filled with smart humor\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Abrams', 'Bryan Burk'], 'Starring': ['Tom Cruise', 'Jeremy Renner', 'Simon Pegg'], 'Studio': ['Hit Movies']}\nWhen my Blu-Ray Disc from netflix wouldn't play I turned to streaming and grabbed this movie. The stream ran without any real buffering and I was happy with bitrate, picture and sound.<br />The movie itself, is enjoyable with good plot points and action<br />There are several plot holes and continuity errors- pretty standard for action movies and Tom Cruise's performance is not as good as it could be.<br />The script is tight but does not grab your emotions very firmly. The supporting cast is really what makes up for any lack you feel in the tug of the plot or main character.<br />Overall I enjoyed it. Not enough to want to own it or even watch it again unless it was on TV and the choice came down to it and Duck Dynasty.\nBetter than I expected\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Constantine Makris', 'Matt Earl Beesley', 'Jamie Babbit', 'Ed Bianchi', 'Stephen Hopkins'], 'Producers': ['Bob DeLaurentis', \"Peter O'Fallon\", 'Noah Hawley'], 'Studio': ['ABC Network']}\nI had my doubts, but I loved the cast pretty much from the get go.
