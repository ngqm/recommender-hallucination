The stream ran without any real buffering and I was happy with bitrate, picture and sound.<br />The movie itself, is enjoyable with good plot points and action<br />There are several plot holes and continuity errors- pretty standard for action movies and Tom Cruise's performance is not as good as it could be.<br />The script is tight but does not grab your emotions very firmly. The supporting cast is really what makes up for any lack you feel in the tug of the plot or main character.<br />Overall I enjoyed it. Not enough to want to own it or even watch it again unless it was on TV and the choice came down to it and Duck Dynasty.\nReview Title: Better than I expected\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
