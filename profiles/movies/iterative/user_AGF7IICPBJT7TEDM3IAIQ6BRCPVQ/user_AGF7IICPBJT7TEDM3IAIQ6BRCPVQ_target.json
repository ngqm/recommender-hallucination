According to Bert and Alice, the two surly servants who work for the formidable Miss Farnaby (Geraldine McEwan), the notice should read: \"Wanted: masochist to be at the beck and call of cantankerous old trout.\" Fortunately, Mulberry has never met Bert or Alice. In fact, no one knows where he comes from. Out of the blue, he just turns up one day at the family mansion, without a single qualification to his name, and sweet-talks his way into the job. Suddenly, the dull old house is not dull anymore and Miss Farnaby\\'s life will never be the same again. But who is the mysterious man in black, and what does he want with Mulberry?', ']]>', 'Amazon.com', 'Both morbid and joyful, British sitcom', 'Mulberry', 'begins when a quirky young man with a penchant for floral waistcoats named Mulberry (Karl Howman,', 'Brush Strokes', ') shows up on the doorstep of a sullen, surly old woman named Mrs. Farnaby (Geraldine McEwan,', 'The Magdalene Sisters', ',', 'Mapp & Lucia', \"). The irrepressible Mulberry proceeds to unsettle the servants--Bert (Tony Selby) and Alice (Lill Roughley in the first season, Mary Healey in the second)--as he puckishly lures Mrs. Farnaby into a fuller, happier life. But unbeknownst to Mrs. Farnaby, Mulberry harbors a secret: He's the son of Death and Springtime (talk about mixed marriages) and he's been sent by his father (John Bennet) to carry the old woman over the threshold--not a typical premise for a comedy. This DVD set has both seasons; season 1 is occupied with the unveiling of Mulberry's secret and the drawing-out of Farnaby, while the second finds a surprising richness of material in the set-up, ranging from Mulberry having a near-death experience of his own to Alice considering running away with another man. Despite the recurring presence of Death, the show is really about taking pleasure in life and making your own choices. Howman's zaniness could have grown tiresome were it not countered by McEwan's deliciously dour presence (though a TV interview with the pair, included as an extra, reveals her to be a sweetheart in person). As Farnaby softens, Mulberry calms down, maintaining a careful balance. An odd but likable show, cut off by the BBC just as it found itself in full bloom.

Successful, high-powered Russ Duritz (Willis) has spent all of his incredibly empty life forgetting the child he used to be -- until one day, he meets him face-to-face! Thinking this kid is a hallucination, Russ does everything he can to make him go away. But 8-year-old Rusty (Breslin), who\\'s anything but happy that he grows up to be a loser without real meaning in his life, can\\'t leave -- at least not yet. At once funny and charming, DISNEY\\'S THE KID is a magical comedy that\\'s filled with adult-sized laughs.|Screenwriter Audrey Wells says she knew immediately when she saw Spencer Breslin that he was the perfect kid. \"The kid spoke five words, and they weren\\'t even words in the script, he just walked on stage and said \\'hello\\' and I knew he was the one,\" says Wells.|\"I was in the frozen food section of a supermarket when my mom told me I got the part,\" says the movie\\'s young star, Spencer Breslin. \"I couldn\\'t believe it!

Not a moment too soon, a pudgy kid (Spencer Breslin) mysteriously appears in Russ's life, revealing himself to be Rusty Duritz--that is, Russ's 8-year-old self, arriving by some magic to put the adult Russ's life into beneficial perspective. This variation on\", 'A Christmas Carol', 'has Rusty guiding Russ on a tour of his past to reveal how he became a loveless, hard-shelled loser.

Written with admirable restraint by Audrey Wells (who brought a similar appeal to\", 'The Truth About Cats and Dogs', ') and directed by Jon Turteltaub (', 'Cool Runnings', \"), the movie doesn't force its supernatural elements or attempt to explain Rusty's existence.

The extras focus on young Breslin, first with a 20-minute featurette with behind-the scenes footage of Spencer from his casting to the film\\'s wrap. The witty and playful director Jon Turteltaub reverses an old axiom stating he loves working with kids, especially Spencer. He illustrates this--and Spencer\\'s unabashed enthusiasm--by sharing the commentary duties with him, and the result is a 108-minute record that\\'s funnier than the film. Spencer asks questions out of the blue (\"Jon, does my DVD player come with a remote?\"), repeats Turteltaub\\'s technical information with perfect irony, embarrasses the director on continuity errors, and munches on an occasional pickle.
