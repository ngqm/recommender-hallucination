Discover the forgotten and astonishing story of our nation's foundation in the American Heritage Series. For centuries, Americans were taught a truthful view of history that recognized the Godly heroes and moral foundation our nation was founded upon. But in recent years, a new version of history has assaulted the moral and spiritual fiber of our nation, leaving the truth of our past eliminated and forgotten. Until today. From Separation of Church and State, to the Civil Rights Movement, the heroism of our founding Fathers to the building of our nation's monuments, this series will inspire every American to reclaim the Godly, true story of our nation.\", \"When sold by Amazon.com, this product is manufactured on demand using DVD-R recordable media.

David Barton really knows his history. I love listening to and watching him.<br /><br />I received the set yesterday, 9-26-11, and watched the first two DVDs. They even look good playing them on the computer but are better on an HDTV.<br /><br />How many of us actually knew there were about 250 Founding Fathers/Framers? I actually knew of a few, probably like most. Like David says, around the 60's they started changing the way we learned history and moved away from the faith aspects of the Founders and moved toward the economic aspects. Most who want to change history talk about Ben Franklin and Thomas Jefferson about being non-religous and portray all founders that way. They might have been the least religous but in today's world they would be far more outspoken about faith and God than most preachers today.<br /><br />For anyone who wants to learn the truth about our history I would highly recommend this series. I've only watched two of the DVDs so far and can't wait until I watch the rest.\nFantastic DVD series!\nDune\nKyle MacLachlan  (Actor),     Jose Ferrer  (Actor),     David Lynch  (Director, Writer)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Science Fiction, Sci-Fi Action\n['Product Description', \"Dazzling special effects, unforgettable images and powerful performances highlight David Lynch's stunning film version of Frank Herbert's classic science fiction epic about an intergalactic warrior's messianic rise.
