David Barton really knows his history. I love listening to and watching him.<br /><br />I received the set yesterday, 9-26-11, and watched the first two DVDs. They even look good playing them on the computer but are better on an HDTV.<br /><br />How many of us actually knew there were about 250 Founding Fathers/Framers? I actually knew of a few, probably like most. Like David says, around the 60's they started changing the way we learned history and moved away from the faith aspects of the Founders and moved toward the economic aspects. Most who want to change history talk about Ben Franklin and Thomas Jefferson about being non-religous and portray all founders that way. They might have been the least religous but in today's world they would be far more outspoken about faith and God than most preachers today.<br /><br />For anyone who wants to learn the truth about our history I would highly recommend this series. I've only watched two of the DVDs so far and can't wait until I watch the rest.\nReview Title: Fantastic DVD series!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
