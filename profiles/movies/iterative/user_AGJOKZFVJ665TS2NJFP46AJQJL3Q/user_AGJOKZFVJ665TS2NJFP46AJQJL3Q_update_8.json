When their friend Freddie accidentally leaks a video of their antics on the web; Carly; and average 13-year-old girl; becomes an unlikely online celebrity. Embracing her popularity; Carly convinces Sam; her co-host and comedic sidekick; and Freddie; their technical producer; to turn \"iCarly\" into a weekly show: where they can finally do and say whatever they want! iCarly is a convergent entertainment experience that unites the TV screen and the web for kids. Throughout the show; Carly will encourage viewers to post their own originally created content relating to the context of each show. Solicited content may become part of a future iCarly episode; or included in Carly\\'s online webcast; making iCarly the first scripted show on all of TV to incorporate original kid-created content.', 'Amazon.com', 'iCarly', \"is an appealing tween sitcom that marries television with web programming and offers viewers a chance to submit their own content for possible inclusion in future episodes. When Carly gets in trouble at school for posting an unflattering flyer of her teacher, her punishment is to record the school talent show auditions and post them online. As it turns out, Carly is innocent and was just covering for her best friend Sam, who really posted the flyer, so it's only fair that Sam join her in her punishment. Freddie, who has a huge crush on Carly and just happens to be a tech wizard, also decides to join them and help tape the auditions. The somewhat painful experience inspires the three teens to wish for an opportunity to produce their own show and determine their own programming--an idea that soon blossoms into a plan for a weekly web show. Since Carly's dad is stationed overseas in Europe, her 26-year-old brother Spencer, who's a rather unconventional artist and an even flakier authority figure, is in charge and he gives them the go-ahead. Soon the three teens are regularly hanging out in Carly and Spencer's apartment, eating everything in sight, producing their weekly web show, and gawking at whatever unusual sculpture Spencer happens to be working on at the moment. Things are never dull as Carly and her friends work to increase viewership. They pursue a write-up on an influential Internet site run by a very unusual tyrant, broadcast from a haunted apartment on Halloween, pay back a mean teacher by making a fool of her online, and set a world record for the longest continuous webcast. And then there's all the usual high school drama, like figuring out who to date, what to do for a science project, and how to get good grades--by any means.

Set in a faraway kingdom called Ooo, the series follows the caffeinated adventures of Finn the Human (Jeremy Shada) and his bespectacled talking dog Jake (John DiMaggio,', 'Futurama', ') as they thwart the misunderstood but mostly evil Ice King (Tom Kenny,', 'SpongeBob SquarePants', ') from his regular attempts to kidnap Princess Bubblegum (Hynden Walch,', 'Teen Titans', '). Aiding them in their escapades are the bass-playing Vampire Queen (Olivia Olson,', 'Phineas and Ferb', '), petulant extraterrestrial Lumpy Space Princess (voiced by series creator Pendleton Ward), and Beemo (Niki Yang), a sentient but playable video game console. The 26 mini-episodes that comprise the show\\'s first season pit the heroes against a dizzying array of oddities, including candy zombies in \"Slumber Party Panic,\" a pie-throwing robot (Andy Milonakis), and \"Ricardio the Heart Guy,\" a living heart suavely voiced by George Takei.

It is unquestionably an acquired taste, but it\\'s also a sweetly offbeat series and an awful lot of fun. The two-disc set includes a healthy selection of extras, most notably commentary tracks on four episodes, including \"Tree Trunks,\" which features some amusing anecdotes from Ward\\'s mother and family friend Polly Lou Livingston, who also provide voices in the episode.
