Set in a faraway kingdom called Ooo, the series follows the caffeinated adventures of Finn the Human (Jeremy Shada) and his bespectacled talking dog Jake (John DiMaggio,', 'Futurama', ') as they thwart the misunderstood but mostly evil Ice King (Tom Kenny,', 'SpongeBob SquarePants', ') from his regular attempts to kidnap Princess Bubblegum (Hynden Walch,', 'Teen Titans', '). Aiding them in their escapades are the bass-playing Vampire Queen (Olivia Olson,', 'Phineas and Ferb', '), petulant extraterrestrial Lumpy Space Princess (voiced by series creator Pendleton Ward), and Beemo (Niki Yang), a sentient but playable video game console. The 26 mini-episodes that comprise the show\\'s first season pit the heroes against a dizzying array of oddities, including candy zombies in \"Slumber Party Panic,\" a pie-throwing robot (Andy Milonakis), and \"Ricardio the Heart Guy,\" a living heart suavely voiced by George Takei.

It is unquestionably an acquired taste, but it\\'s also a sweetly offbeat series and an awful lot of fun. The two-disc set includes a healthy selection of extras, most notably commentary tracks on four episodes, including \"Tree Trunks,\" which features some amusing anecdotes from Ward\\'s mother and family friend Polly Lou Livingston, who also provide voices in the episode.
