Myself, I selected the movie to watch because I am a huge Tom Hanks fan.<br />My adult son (early 20's) and husband would not have been interested in this type of movie.<br />Best advice: watch the trailer to ensure it piques your interest first.\nVery Entertaining; Really Enjoyed the Characters & Storyline\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Martin Scorsese'], 'Producers': ['Emma Koskoff', 'Alexandra Milchan', 'Rick Yorn', 'Irwin Winkler', 'Danny Dimbort', 'Joel Gotler', 'Georgia Kacandes', 'Martin Scorsese', 'Leonardo DiCaprio', 'Riza Aziz', 'Joey McFarland', 'Emma Tillinger Koskoff'], 'Starring': ['Leonardo DiCaprio', 'Jonah Hill', 'Margot Robbie'], 'Studio': ['Hit Movies']}\nI was so intrigued by this fascinating movie that I have researched Jordan Belfort online and plan to order his books soon.  Second hand, of course, as he is currently in default with restitution payments to his victims.<br />Leonardo DiCaprio does an exceptional portrayal of this money hungry, drug crazed, sex addicted character.  I am definitely a bigger Leo fan than ever before after watching this.<br />If you have a problem with nudity, sex, drugs, profanity and/or nudity, sex, drugs, profanity - and there IS a double helping of all of it - then this movie is not for you.  Otherwise, grab some popcorn and enjoy!\nClear out the kiddos and order it.  You are about to be entertained!\n{'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Stephen Frears'], 'Producers': ['Steve Coogan', 'Tracey Seaward', 'Gabrielle Tana'], 'Starring': ['Judi Dench', 'Steve Coogan', 'Sophie Kennedy Clark']}\nActing at it's finest.  I was completely immersed in this story from the very beginning.  I both laughed and cried.  I was surprised more than once at the turns the story took.  I highly recommend it.  It is not a movie that would particularly interest my husband who prefers westerns and action movies.  I am a very conservative mother of 2 adult sons and would say that in retrospect I would have required them to be 12 to 14 years old before they watched it.  It is plenty good enough to see twice, so I recommend parents watch it first, then decide what they feel is appropriate for viewing by the children.  Great movie.\nLoved it.\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', 'Espa\u00f1ol'], 'Directors': ['Jean-Marc Vallee'], 'Producers': ['Robbie Brenner', 'Rachel Winter'], 'Starring': ['Matthew McConaughey', 'Jennifer Garner', 'Jared Leto']}\nWonderfully acted, great story.
