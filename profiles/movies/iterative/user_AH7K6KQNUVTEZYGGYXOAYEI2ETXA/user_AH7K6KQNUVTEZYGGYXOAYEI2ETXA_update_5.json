The series follows a group of individuals who need to find a way to survive in the chaotic time after a major event such as a grid breakdown. Interesting to see the issues they have to deal with including deciding who they can take in, trust, the lawlessness of society, making something from nothing. There is a second season based in New Orleans and a third that never was completed due to a tragedy. But I wish they would make more.\nEnjoyed this series\nThe Next Three Days\nRussell Crowe  (Actor),     Liam Neeson  (Actor),     Paul Haggis  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Action & Adventure\n['Product Description', 'Life seems perfect for John Brennan until his wife, Lara, is arrested for a murder she says she didn\u2019t commit. Three years into her sentence, John is struggling to hold his family together, raising their son and teaching at college while he pursues every means available to prove her innocence. With the rejection of their final appeal, Lara becomes suicidal and John decides there is only one possible, bearable solution: to break his wife out of prison. Refusing to be deterred by impossible odds or his own inexperience, John devises an elaborate escape plot and plunges into a dangerous and unfamiliar world, ultimately risking everything for the woman he loves.

The movie is most compelling in how it follows Brennan's wrenching emotional changes. He's not some cold, focused secret agent--he's torn between his painful devotion to his wife and the frightening possibility of what could go wrong, including the possible cost to their son. The outstanding supporting cast includes Liam Neeson, Brian Dennehy, and rapper RZA, but the vast majority of the movie rests on Crowe's shoulders and he carries it like an athlete. There's something deeply physical about Crowe's performances--his emotions seem to fill his entire body, even as his expressions are incredibly subtle. It's a gripping performance by a remarkable actor, anchoring a well-conceived and engaging thriller.\", '--Bret Fetzer']\n{'Genre': 'Thriller', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Russell Crowe, Paul Haggis, Liam Neeson', 'Language': 'English', 'Studio': 'Lionsgate', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '0.6 x 5.4 x 7.5 inches; 2.72 Ounces', 'Item model number': '29740', 'Director': 'Paul Haggis', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Release date': 'March 8, 2011', 'Actors': 'Russell Crowe, Liam Neeson', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nGift\nDvd\nThe Revenant\nLeonardo DiCaprio  (Actor),     Tom Hardy  (Actor),     Alejandro G.
