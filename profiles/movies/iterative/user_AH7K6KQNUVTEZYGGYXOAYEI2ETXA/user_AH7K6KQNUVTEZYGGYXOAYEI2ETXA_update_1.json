The series follows a group of individuals who need to find a way to survive in the chaotic time after a major event such as a grid breakdown. Interesting to see the issues they have to deal with including deciding who they can take in, trust, the lawlessness of society, making something from nothing. There is a second season based in New Orleans and a third that never was completed due to a tragedy. But I wish they would make more.\nReview Title: Enjoyed this series\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
