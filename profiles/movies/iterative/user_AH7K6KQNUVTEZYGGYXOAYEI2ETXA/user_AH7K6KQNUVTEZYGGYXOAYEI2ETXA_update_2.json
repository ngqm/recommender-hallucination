The series follows a group of individuals who need to find a way to survive in the chaotic time after a major event such as a grid breakdown. Interesting to see the issues they have to deal with including deciding who they can take in, trust, the lawlessness of society, making something from nothing. There is a second season based in New Orleans and a third that never was completed due to a tragedy. But I wish they would make more.\nEnjoyed this series\nThe Next Three Days\nRussell Crowe  (Actor),     Liam Neeson  (Actor),     Paul Haggis  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Action & Adventure\n['Product Description', 'Life seems perfect for John Brennan until his wife, Lara, is arrested for a murder she says she didn\u2019t commit.
