Before becoming a CIA officer, Evelyn Salt (Jolie) swore an oath to duty, honor, and country. She will prove loyal to these when a defector accuses her of being a Russian sleeper spy. Salt goes on the run, using all her skills and years of experience as a covert operative to elude capture, protect her husband, and stay one step ahead of her colleagues at the CIA.', 'Amazon.com', 'Angelina Jolie confirms her status as action-heroine supreme in the sinewy thriller', 'Salt', \". Evelyn Salt (Jolie) is a respected high-ranking CIA agent\u2026 until a defecting Russian operative declares that she's a Russian mole in deep cover, launching her on the most delicious chase sequence since the\", 'Bourne', \"movies. When the film's over you'll realize the motivations for much of what happened didn't make much sense, but while the movie's going on the pell-mell pace will brush such concerns from your mind. Director Phillip Noyce (\", 'Patriot Games', ',', 'Dead Calm', \") has a gift for staging action sequences you can actually follow moment to moment, which is infinitely more engaging than frenzied editing that blurs everything into cattle-prod jolts--the movie's first third is top-notch orchestration. Jolie's star magnetism provides the cool, calm axis around which everything else revolves; the sturdy supporting performances of Liev Schreiber (\", 'The Manchurian Candidate', ') and Chiwetel Ejiofor (', 'Inside Man', ',', 'Dirty Pretty Things', ') give enough heft to the plot to keep you from questioning anything.', 'Salt', 'is an old-fashioned entertainment, a skillfully made mechanism with enough grace notes to let it breathe and catch you by surprise.', '--Bret Fetzer']\n{'Genre': 'Action, Drama, Thriller', 'Format': 'AC-3, Blu-ray, Dolby, Dubbed, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Angelina Jolie, Liev Schreiber, Philip Noyce', 'Language': 'English, French, Spanish', 'Runtime': '5 hours and 5 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '2.40:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'Unrated (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 5.92 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'Salt Blu Ray', 'Director': 'Philip Noyce', 'Media Format': 'AC-3, Blu-ray, Dolby, Dubbed, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Run time': '5 hours and 5 minutes', 'Release date': 'September 6, 2011', 'Actors': 'Angelina Jolie, Liev Schreiber', 'Dubbed': 'French', 'Subtitles': 'English, French, Spanish', 'Studio': 'Sony Pictures', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nMs Jolie kicks ass in a relatively coherent and interesting script.\nFour Stars\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Mina \u0110uki\u0107'], 'Producers': ['Mina \u0110uki\u0107', 'Nikola Lezaic'], 'Starring': ['Hana Selimovic', 'Mladen Sovilj', 'Mina Subota'], 'Studio': ['Visit Films']}\nSome funny and some touching scenes spread out within a generally slow but interesting story. Then either my cultural differences or murky writing leads to another ( at least for me) huh? ending. Worth the watch if nothing else to do.\nOK until the what? ending.\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Jag Mundhra'], 'Producers': ['Jag Mundhra', 'Kalpana Saxena', 'Vivek Singhania'], 'Starring': ['Richard Tyson'], 'Studio': ['AMBI Distribution']}\nIt had everything going for it, hunky American who couldn't act, blonde girlfriend , and Asian temptress, all set in India. But as Mr. Cortez says elsewhere, the movie doesn't live up to it's title. Skip this one.\nDon't waste your time\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Alan Overton'], 'Producers': ['Ted Leversuch', 'Phillip Watson'], 'Starring': ['Susan Baxter', 'Carol MacKenzie'], 'Studio': ['Sprocket Flicks']}\nI've never seen the original, but seeing it was made in 62 I figured there wouldn't be much nudity anyway, but this was ridiculous. Viewed as half east coast travelogue and half proper boat etiquette it might have been OK, but...  The cheesy music played throughout ( think early Bewitched episodes), the ever present voice over ( think any travel film from the late 50's early 60's), the couple of nudists scenes that were shot from a distance and the whole early sixties fashion vibe make this version mostly unwatchable. But if you must, pop a beer, relax in your plastic webbed chaise lounge, and turn on the sunlamp.\nDo not waste your time 2\n{'Audio languages': ['\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Kwak Jae-yong'], 'Producers': ['Ho-Cheol Ahn', 'Young-jun Ji', 'Sang Han Shin'], 'Starring': ['Shin Min-ah', 'On Ju-wan', 'Yu Geon'], 'Studio': ['AsianCrush']}\nThe first two thirds of the movie is a rather slow romance between Shin Min-a and her hockey playing crush. Not much action except a couple of gang fights demonstrating the four martial arts types in the movie and some flashbacks on the Green Destiny sword, which Shin Min-a's mother wielded. The last third finally gets to the antagonist and improves a bit but not really enough to make the movie. Not a bad movie, but just not great. Also, for some reason the director(?) seemed to like the look of Shin Min-a's face when she puffed out her cheeks, and he has her do it way too much for my taste.\nTries hard but a trifle slow\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Ryan Eslinger'], 'Producers': ['Steve Luna', 'Jamie Hoang'], 'Starring': ['Jaz Kemp', 'William Ferrer', 'Noah Cohen']}\nI thought the premise was plausible and interesting, the acting was outstanding, and the movie moved right along. What else could you want? This is what Hollywood should be making instead of remakes and reboots.\nWell made, interesting story",
