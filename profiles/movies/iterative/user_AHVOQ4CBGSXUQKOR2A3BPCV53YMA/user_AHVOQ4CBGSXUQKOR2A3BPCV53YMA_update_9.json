Warning the rest of this review has spoilers ... I have seen Chris Hemsworth in quite a few movies and he has always had a solid performance.  This one, not believable at all, so I have to blame directing, which is shocking because it's Michael Mann.  The &#34;love&#34; interest happens so quickly that it's not believable at all ( they look at each other and end up in bed, even drunk one night stands have a little more foreplay) and really not even necessary for this film.  Had they fallen &#34;in love&#34; after the brothers death, it would have played out better.  Having TV actors, low budget film actors in prime roles along side Hemsworth was confusing to say the least and just had me scratching my head.  They would have been better using actors we had never seen before.  The transition of this movie is so &#34;choppy&#34;, no smooth transitions into next scenes, I was wondering if they ended up on the editors floor or the movie was just written that way.  It was all so predictable, sadly I knew the brothers car was going to blow up and I had never seen the movie before.  More of a made for TV Sunday Afternoon viewing than a major film.  I wouldn't pay to rent it, wait for it go up for free, which should be real soon.\nReview Title: Don't rent, wait for it to be free, then you won't feel robbed.\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
