The movie brings to front the hush and hidden denials of many relationships. It causes the viewer to question their own responsibility for friends or relatives, who they suspect may be in relationships that are abusive. It is a must see for everyone. Because everyone in someway will see their own reflection, some which they may wish not to acknowledge.\nReview Title: Outstanding Performance and Storyline!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
