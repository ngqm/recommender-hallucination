Loaded with flashes of the past. From political correctness to social norms, the film is a study of progress a society has made. It also suggests where the hunger for the 24 hour news cycle originated.

The movie brings to front the hush and hidden denials of many relationships. It causes the viewer to question their own responsibility for friends or relatives, who they suspect may be in relationships that are abusive. It is a must see for everyone.

The story focuses on Liberace\u2019s tempestuous relationship with Scott Thorson (Matt Damon) in Las Vegas from 1977 to 1982 \u2013 a time when Liberace was at the peak of his popularity but remained closeted as a homosexual. Featuring a pair of electrifying performances by Douglas and Damon (the first time either has starred in an HBO production), Behind the Candelabra captures the essence of Liberace\u2019s appeal while reminding viewers how different attitudes were at the time, as few high-profile entertainers (including Liberace) could admit they were gay, at least in front of the public which made them stars.', ']]>', 'Amazon.com', 'Now that', 'Behind the Candelabra', ', the HBO movie about the secret relationship between pianist/entertainer Liberace and former animal trainer Scott Thorson, has won three Emmys (including statues for best movie or miniseries, lead actor Michael Douglas, and director Steven Soderbergh), it\\'s hard to imagine that this was once a film that no one wanted to make. \"Too gay,\" they said. But after languishing in development for several years, and with Soderbergh, Douglas, and Matt Damon attached, the film finally premiered in 2013--and it is a triumph. Damon is thoroughly convincing as Thorson (whose book supplied the source material), the callow, not-especially-bright young man so susceptible to Liberace\\'s charming, unctuous persuasions (things get nutty when Scott agrees to undergo extensive plastic surgery designed to turn him into a younger version of \"Lee,\" as the pianist\\'s friends call him). Screenwriter Richard LaGravenese\\'s dialogue is hilarious (\"In gay years,\" one character tells Scott, \"you\\'re Judy during the Sid Luft obese period\"), while Soderbergh\\'s directorial choices are also amusing. Meanwhile, the rest of the cast is clearly having a field day: Rob Lowe (as the cosmetic surgeon) and Debbie Reynolds (as Liberace\\'s mother) gleefully chew the scenery, while Scott Bakula and Dan Aykroyd are entertaining as well. But this is Douglas\\'s show, and he steals it. His performance isn\\'t a caricature. Nor is it a parody, or an impersonation; the real Liberace, a guy whose name was seemingly always preceded by \"flamboyant,\" was such an over-the-top character that Douglas merely has to play it straight, so to speak. In the process, he sheds light not only on Liberace\\'s manipulative tendencies (\"Scott, why don\\'t you let me decide what\\'s important?\") but also his vulnerabilities--especially at the end, when he and Thorson have one last poignant meeting following a bitter falling out. The filmmakers also have something valuable to say about gay culture during a period when celebrities like Liberace and Rock Hudson tried desperately to stay in the closet, especially after contracting AIDS.', '--Sam Graham']\n{'Genre': 'Drama', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Color, Dolby, DTS Surround Sound, Dubbed, NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Scott Bakula, Matt Damon, Steven Soderbergh, Michael Douglas', 'Language': 'Spanish (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround), English (DTS 5.1)', 'Runtime': '2 hours', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG (Parental Guidance Suggested)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'HBO1000411874DVD', 'Director': 'Steven Soderbergh', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Color, Dolby, DTS Surround Sound, Dubbed, NTSC', 'Run time': '2 hours', 'Release date': 'September 17, 2013', 'Actors': 'Michael Douglas, Matt Damon, Scott Bakula', 'Dubbed': 'Spanish', 'Studio': 'HBO Studios', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nThe movie brings some camp back for those who remember the 1970's. The classmanship and craftmanship that laid many housewives in denial, while many young men on their backs brought out much of what many onlookers had speculated. The Gossip Rags couldn't put out such spice in such a rise and fall, with so many sparkles as Douglas and Damon were able to do.
