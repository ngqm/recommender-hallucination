The story focuses on Liberace\u2019s tempestuous relationship with Scott Thorson (Matt Damon) in Las Vegas from 1977 to 1982 \u2013 a time when Liberace was at the peak of his popularity but remained closeted as a homosexual. Featuring a pair of electrifying performances by Douglas and Damon (the first time either has starred in an HBO production), Behind the Candelabra captures the essence of Liberace\u2019s appeal while reminding viewers how different attitudes were at the time, as few high-profile entertainers (including Liberace) could admit they were gay, at least in front of the public which made them stars.', ']]>', 'Amazon.com', 'Now that', 'Behind the Candelabra', ', the HBO movie about the secret relationship between pianist/entertainer Liberace and former animal trainer Scott Thorson, has won three Emmys (including statues for best movie or miniseries, lead actor Michael Douglas, and director Steven Soderbergh), it\\'s hard to imagine that this was once a film that no one wanted to make. \"Too gay,\" they said. But after languishing in development for several years, and with Soderbergh, Douglas, and Matt Damon attached, the film finally premiered in 2013--and it is a triumph. Damon is thoroughly convincing as Thorson (whose book supplied the source material), the callow, not-especially-bright young man so susceptible to Liberace\\'s charming, unctuous persuasions (things get nutty when Scott agrees to undergo extensive plastic surgery designed to turn him into a younger version of \"Lee,\" as the pianist\\'s friends call him). Screenwriter Richard LaGravenese\\'s dialogue is hilarious (\"In gay years,\" one character tells Scott, \"you\\'re Judy during the Sid Luft obese period\"), while Soderbergh\\'s directorial choices are also amusing. Meanwhile, the rest of the cast is clearly having a field day: Rob Lowe (as the cosmetic surgeon) and Debbie Reynolds (as Liberace\\'s mother) gleefully chew the scenery, while Scott Bakula and Dan Aykroyd are entertaining as well. But this is Douglas\\'s show, and he steals it. His performance isn\\'t a caricature. Nor is it a parody, or an impersonation; the real Liberace, a guy whose name was seemingly always preceded by \"flamboyant,\" was such an over-the-top character that Douglas merely has to play it straight, so to speak. In the process, he sheds light not only on Liberace\\'s manipulative tendencies (\"Scott, why don\\'t you let me decide what\\'s important?\") but also his vulnerabilities--especially at the end, when he and Thorson have one last poignant meeting following a bitter falling out. The filmmakers also have something valuable to say about gay culture during a period when celebrities like Liberace and Rock Hudson tried desperately to stay in the closet, especially after contracting AIDS.', '--Sam Graham']\n{'Genre': 'Drama', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Color, Dolby, DTS Surround Sound, Dubbed, NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Scott Bakula, Matt Damon, Steven Soderbergh, Michael Douglas', 'Language': 'Spanish (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround), English (DTS 5.1)', 'Runtime': '2 hours', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG (Parental Guidance Suggested)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'HBO1000411874DVD', 'Director': 'Steven Soderbergh', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Color, Dolby, DTS Surround Sound, Dubbed, NTSC', 'Run time': '2 hours', 'Release date': 'September 17, 2013', 'Actors': 'Michael Douglas, Matt Damon, Scott Bakula', 'Dubbed': 'Spanish', 'Studio': 'HBO Studios', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nThe movie brings some camp back for those who remember the 1970's.

In this epic gangster tale, inspired by true-life tales of author Matt Bondurant\u2019s family in his novel \u201cThe Wettest County In The World,\u201d the loyalty of three brothers is put to the test against the backdrop of the nation\u2019s most notorious crime wave.', 'Amazon.com', 'Director John Hillcoat and writer-musician Nick Cave made a brutal, brilliant splash with', 'The Proposition', ', a revisionist Outback Western that quickly tore away any lingering notions of frontier romanticism.', 'Lawless', \", the duo's take on another turbulent period of history--namely, the bloodiest years of America's Prohibition--eases up on the unrelenting grimness a bit, but the hard edges still shine through. Adapted from the historical novel\", 'The Wettest County in the World', \", by Matt Bondurant, Cave's script follows three Virginia brothers determined to continue their family's legacy of providing quality moonshine to their faithful customers (including members of local law enforcement) during the Great Depression. While the youngest brother (Shia LaBeouf) attempts to gain the business of a feared local mobster (Gary Oldman), the three find themselves under assault from a ruthless federal agent (Guy Pearce) with a sadistic agenda of his own. Hillcoat, working with cinematographer Beno\u00eet Delhomme, delivers a fantastically realized period piece, one where the folksy, lived-in atmosphere is randomly dispelled by moments of shockingly raw savagery. Unfortunately, the attention to detail doesn't quite extend itself to LaBeouf's character, whose motivations and actions feel strangely half-baked throughout. Still, even if the main storyline occasionally falters, the film offers plenty to recommend itself, including Cave's ominously cheery score, small but vivid turns by Jessica Chastain and Mia Wasikowska, and the gloriously weird Pearce, who starts his performance somewhere in the outer stratosphere and just keeps heading upwards. The main draw of\", 'Lawless', \", however, ultimately comes from Tom Hardy, who goes all out and then some as the enforcer and reluctant father figure of the family.

It's enough to intimidate even the bravest, street-hardened cop except, perhaps, for the small, secret crew of LAPD outsiders led by Sgt. John O'Mara and Sgt.

Take a post-World War II Los Angeles, plunge it in noir, drop a ruthless gangster into the mix, and let loose an extralegal squad of cops to break the mob's rule. The crime kingpin in question is Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn), and his LAPD adversaries include a detective so square his fedora appears permanently affixed to his skull (Josh Brolin) and a ladies' man (Ryan Gosling) whose dalliance with Cohen's escort (Emma Stone) might not be the best idea for a smooth relationship. Their squad includes stalwart character actors such as Anthony Mackie, Michael Pe\u00f1a, Giovanni Ribisi, and an especially droll Robert Patrick. With all this talent on display, the movie must surely have some bang in its Tommy gun--but alas, director Ruben Fleischer (\", 'Zombieland', \") has opted for a peculiarly lighthearted, bantering tone for much of the action, which sits oddly with the gun massacres and dismemberments on display. He's also got Sean Penn in full Actor mode, snorting and stamping and wearing his prosthetic nose like a badge of pride.

Sadly, many of the films that get 'lost' are the ones that really need to be found, and 80 Blocks from Tiffany's is one such film. Here is a film that has been marooned in an archive for 30 years and, despite a brief educational VHS release in 1985, it has gone largely unseen. Until now. Inspired by journalist Jon Bradshaw's Esquire Magazine article, Savage Skulls, Gary Weis, a filmmaker for Saturday Night Live, convinced SNL creator Lorne Michaels to help turn the concept into a feature-length documentary. Documenting the everyday activities of two South Bronx street gangs, the Savage Nomads and the Savage Skulls, the film is a glimpse into a different time, when the South Bronx was considered a land of nowhere. The 80 Blocks from Tiffany's DVD is beautifully packaged, housed in a 40-page hard cover book within a slip case. DVD bonus materials include brand new never-before-seen interviews with Weis and director of photography Joan Churchill, while the accompanying book contains all new liner notes and Jon Bradshaw s Savage Skulls article in its entirety. In recent years, the rich visual history of New York City street culture circa 1979 has come to light, mostly restricted to images only. 80 Blocks from Tiffany's might be some of the only motion picture footage that exists to describe a culture that has all but vanished. The South Bronx of today is a much different place than it was 30 years ago, a world that has long since vanished. 80 Blocks is a compelling and one-of-a-kind look into this time seen through the eyes of those trapped in a domestic war zone.\"]\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'Unrated (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.5 x 0.5 inches; 8.8 Ounces', 'Director': 'Gary Weiss', 'Media Format': 'Color, NTSC', 'Run time': '1 hour and 34 minutes', 'Release date': 'November 23, 2010', 'Actors': 'The Savage Nomads, The Savage Skulls, Weis, Gary', 'Studio': 'Traffic Ent.', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nA raw and yet to mature film that is set in a period, prior to reality television.

Ryder (John Travolta), the criminal mastermind behind the hijacking and leader of a highly-armed gang of four, threatens to execute the train's passengers unless a large ransom is paid within one hour. As the tension mounts beneath his feet, Garber employs his vast knowledge of the subway system in a battle to outwit Ryder and save the hostages. But there's one riddle Garber can't solve: even if the thieves get the money, how can they possibly escape?\", 'Amazon.com', \"John Godey's 1973 novel\", 'The Taking of Pelham One Two Three', \"boasts a suspense situation so surefire that even the directorial bad habits of Tony Scott can't ruin this latest movie version. Four armed men seize a New York City subway train, isolate one car, and threaten to start killing passengers if a ransom isn't paid within the hour. The ransom was a million dollars in the book and also in Joseph Sargent's solid 1974 movie, in which Robert Shaw played the mercenary leading the hostage takers and Walter Matthau was the growling transit cop trying to outsmart him. In 2009, the title has gone digital--\", 'The Taking of Pelham 123', \"--and inflation has jumped the asking price to $10 million. Where Shaw's menace was steely, John Travolta opts for manic, and shamelessly has a blast in the master villain role. His adversary, cagily underplayed by Denzel Washington, has been upgraded in civil-service rank but also demoted on suspicion of taking a bribe. This colors the dynamics of the dialogue between Washington at his control-center console and Travolta on the motorman's microphone aboard the stalled train. So far, so reasonably good. But the director's trademark tactics keep getting between, well, everything. From the get-go, the visuals are subjected to pointless and irritating stutter effects, speeding-up/slowing-down, gratuitous camera movement, and the interposition of dirt- or light-smeared panes of glass between the camera and people we'd appreciate a clear look at. The 1974 movie settled for one police car being wrecked as the ransom is rushed uptown; Scott requires multiple collisions, each the occasion for police cruisers taking Lethal Weapon-style flight. The hostages in the earlier film were wittily individuated, a multicultural group portrait of the city at that mid-'70s moment; the ones on Scott's train--and also Travolta's fellow perpetrators, including that wonderful character actor Luis Guzm\u00e1n--barely register. On the upside, John Turturro and James Gandolfini shine as two guys who (like the actors themselves) are very good at their jobs\u2014respectively playing a hostage negotiator and His Honor, the mayor. The screenplay by Brian Helgeland (\", 'L.A. Confidential', ',', 'Mystic River', ') strives intelligently, if formulaically, to add new dimensions to the main characters and to offer its own gloss on the current economic meltdown.', '--Richard T.
