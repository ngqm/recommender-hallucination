Michael Caine is wonderful, but I thought that LV's mother & her tagalong friend, silent Sadie, stole the show.  LV's mother is a loud, middle-aged floozy who wears pushup bras, micromini skirts, towering heels & lace tightsn and prattles on nonstop in a barely decipherable accent and odd syntax (I kept the subtitles on during the entire film -- a big help.)  Her best friend Sadie is a chubby, funny-faced follower who never speaks -- the mother babbles nonstop & no one else has a chance to get a word in edgewise.  LV is her mother's opposite -- a plain-jane, retiring type, silent, expressing herself only through the voices and words of the divas on her treasured record albums, finding solace in the framed portrait of her deceased father.  The plot keeps you on edge, but all is resolved positively in the end.  As an added bonus, Jane Horrocks (LV) is, in fact, an incredible performer, able to mimic everyone from Judy Garland in Wizard Oz to Marilyn Monroe singing \"Happy Birthday.\"\nReview Title: part comedy, part tragedy, part horror film\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

The story begins as two soldiers, a war-weathered Bosnian and a rookie-soldier Serb, become stranded in a trench in &quot;no man's land&quot; together. The Serb's friend and fellow soldier is also in the trench, lying on top of a bouncing mine, which will detonante if he moves. The film shows the efforts of the the soldiers to elicit rescue by UNPROFOR peacekeepers. There tension and hostility between the soldiers in the trench alternate with moments of kindness, even tenderness, and genuine teamwork in their effort for rescue, until they remember that they hate each other. The French peacekeepers are ordered not to take action by their British commander, because it is too dangerous. A cunning French peacekeeper works behind the scenes, in conjunction with a BBC journalist, to pressure UNPROFOR to permit them to attempt an evacuation of the stranded soldiers. In the end, the rescue effort is to no avail and none of the three stranded soldiers are rescued alive. The movie is very real, from the Bosnian soldier's high-top basketball sneakers, the French UNPROFOR peacekeeper snoozing on duty, the Bosnian commander's lew flirting with the BBC journalist. This is a great picture, one of those movies that will come back to haunt you days after you've seen it.\na must-see for anyone who has spent time in the Balkans\nThe Harmonists [DVD]\nBen Becker  (Actor),     Heino Ferch  (Actor),     Joseph Vilsmaier  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Musicals & Performing Arts, Musicals\n['Filled with topflight performances and unforgettable music, this entertaining and critically acclaimed story was cheered by audiences everywhere!

The story line is so gripping, it almost seems too contrived to be true.  And, given the immense talent and popularity of the group (in its heydey), I was surprised that I had never heard of them.  The story is about a group of six musicians, three of whom are Jewish, who rise to fame in Germany in 1930s.  Tension grows within the group as the Nazis become increasingly powerful in Germany.  After the group performs aboard the USS Saratoga in New York harbor, there is some question about whether they will return to Nazi Germany or stay in the US.  The group plays its final concert to a sold-out crowd shortly after the New York trip.  The movie will leave you wanting to know much more about its members, particularly Mr. Frommerman, and its music.  As an added bonus, the five-part harmonies are FANTASTIC.  This is one of the most gripping shows I've seen in several months, it came as a complete surprise.\nBrilliant, gripping, and based on a true story!\nWindtalkers\nNicolas Cage  (Actor),     Adam Beach  (Actor),     John Woo  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Action & Adventure\n['During WWII, two U.S. Marines are assigned to protect two Navajo Marines code talkers.

That's about the extent of what I learned about the Navajo codetalkers in this film.  This was a gory, shoot-em-up war film, with plenty of Japs (conveniently identifiable by the twigs in their helmets) tumbling to the ground under American fire, lots of arms & legs being blown off, even a decapitation.  The rumble of gunfire serves as background noise at all times.  The Nicholas Cage character is meant to be an enigma -- he is neither particularly interesting nor particularly likeable,and his transformation (from skepticism of his Navajo assignee to respect for the Navajo) seems a bit too sudden.  There are some breathtaking shots of Navajo country at the end of the film, but it's not worth sitting through the rest of the film to see.  If you want a war movie, you won't necessarily be disappointed.

Oscar, a precocious fifteen year old prep school student who quotes Voltaire and speaks French, is far, far too sophisticated to be bothered by the girls his age. Rather, his heart is focused on his step-mother, played by Sigourney Weaver.  He is a charmer, but completely unable to see the naivete of his youth.  His efforts to be adult -- gluing on fake sideburns and spouting philosophy to any willing audience are right on.  He seems to think that there is no reason he cannot be a serious contender for his step-mother's affections, and he courts her (his true intentions unbeknownst to her) by bringing her lunch at work, calling the terminology of her work (cardiological research) poetry, and playing tennis with her.  John Ritter plays the clueless history-professor-Dad to a tee.  I really liked this film -- from the title screen (where letters flitter across the screen in the shape of a tadpole) to the end, where Oscar is finally able to see the attractiveness of a girl his own age.

The story centers around Andie MacDowell's character's search for her Pulitzer-award-winning photographer husband, who was reportedly killed when a building collapses in the war. Sarah Lloyd (Andie) is convinced that her husband is still alive, so she leaves behind her two young children & her job at Newsweek to venture to Serb-held Vukovar to find him. Her journey is fraught with violence -- shortly after she crosses into Yugoslavia, she encounters a Serb roadblock, where her hitchhiker/passenger/guide, a charming Croatian student in Paris returning to find his wife & baby, is needlessly executed, the rented Audi is crushed by a tank, and Sarah barely escapes rape. She is \"rescued\" by fellow journalists, and undaunted, continues her seeming suicide mission to find her husband in Vukovar. The violence in this film rivals anything you'll find on screen (think two hours of the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan) and you'll hear the ... word at least once a minute -- but it is well worth seeing. It will foster an appreciation of what photojournalists go through to document history, putting themselves at risk certainly as much as the soldiers, without the support & protection of an Army being them (albeit voluntarily). My only concern is that the film may oversimplify the issues underlying the conflict -- it depicts Serbs as evil and Croats as - - well, not evil, providing a relatively safe haven for the journalists. However, the film is not so much about the conflict itself as it is about the sacrifices of the journalists covering the conflict.\ntribute to journalists who died covering the Balkan conflict\nLittle Voice [DVD]\nBrenda Blethyn  (Actor),     Jane Horrocks  (Actor),     Mark Herman  (Director, Writer)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Studio Specials, Miramax Home Entertainment, All Titles\n['Product Description', 'World-class stars Michael Caine (HANNAH AND HER SISTERS), Brenda Blethyn (SECRETS AND LIES), and Ewan McGregor (STAR WARS: EPISODE I, BLACK HAWK DOWN) deliver acclaimed performances in an inspirational story about a painfully shy young woman and how the power of music leads her to an amazing transformation!
