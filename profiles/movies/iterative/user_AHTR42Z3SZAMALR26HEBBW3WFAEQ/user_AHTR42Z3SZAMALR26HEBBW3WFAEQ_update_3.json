That's about the extent of what I learned about the Navajo codetalkers in this film.  This was a gory, shoot-em-up war film, with plenty of Japs (conveniently identifiable by the twigs in their helmets) tumbling to the ground under American fire, lots of arms & legs being blown off, even a decapitation.  The rumble of gunfire serves as background noise at all times.  The Nicholas Cage character is meant to be an enigma -- he is neither particularly interesting nor particularly likeable,and his transformation (from skepticism of his Navajo assignee to respect for the Navajo) seems a bit too sudden.  There are some breathtaking shots of Navajo country at the end of the film, but it's not worth sitting through the rest of the film to see.  If you want a war movie, you won't necessarily be disappointed.  If you want a history lesson, don't spend your money on this.\nReview Title: this IS NOT about the Najavo codetalkers; it's a war film\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Stuck in an abandoned trench between enemy lines, a Serb and a Bosnian play the blame game in a comic tit-for-tat struggle while a wounded Bosnian soldier lies helplessly on a land mine. A French tank unit of the U.N.\\'s humanitarian force (known locally as \"the Smurfs\"), a scheming British TV reporter, a German mine defuser, and the U.N. high command (led by a bombastically ineffectual Simon Callow) all become tangled in the chaotic rescue as the tenuous cease-fire is only a spark away from detonation. Tanovic directs with a ferocious, angry eloquence and makes his points with vivid metaphors and a savage humor as harrowing as it is hilarious. Searing and smart, this satire carries an emotional recoil.', '--Sean Axmaker']\n{'Format': 'Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, DVD, Full Screen, Subtitled, Widescreen, NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Katrin Cartlidge, Danis Tanovic, Branko Djuric, Georges Siatidis, Alain Eloy, Mustafa Nadarevic, Simon Callow, Rene Bitorajac, Sacha Kremer, Tanja Ribic, Bogdan Diklic, Filip Sovagovic, Serge-Henri ValckeKatrin Cartlidge, Danis Tanovic, Branko Djuric, Georges Siatidis, Alain Eloy, Mustafa Nadarevic, Simon Callow, Rene Bitorajac, Sacha Kremer, Tanja Ribic, Bogdan Diklic, Filip Sovagovic, Serge-Henri Valcke  See more', 'Language': 'Unqualified', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 38 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.85:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Package Dimensions': '7.1 x 5.42 x 0.58 inches; 2.88 Ounces', 'Director': 'Danis Tanovic', 'Media Format': 'Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, DVD, Full Screen, Subtitled, Widescreen, NTSC', 'Run time': '1 hour and 38 minutes', 'Release date': 'April 9, 2002', 'Actors': 'Branko Djuric, Rene Bitorajac, Filip Sovagovic, Georges Siatidis, Serge-Henri Valcke', 'Subtitles': 'English', 'Studio': 'MGM (Video & DVD)', 'Writers': 'Danis Tanovic', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nThis compelling tale underscores the futility of war and the complete impotence of the UNPROFOR to make any difference in the civil unrest in the Balkans. The story begins as two soldiers, a war-weathered Bosnian and a rookie-soldier Serb, become stranded in a trench in &quot;no man's land&quot; together. The Serb's friend and fellow soldier is also in the trench, lying on top of a bouncing mine, which will detonante if he moves. The film shows the efforts of the the soldiers to elicit rescue by UNPROFOR peacekeepers. There tension and hostility between the soldiers in the trench alternate with moments of kindness, even tenderness, and genuine teamwork in their effort for rescue, until they remember that they hate each other. The French peacekeepers are ordered not to take action by their British commander, because it is too dangerous. A cunning French peacekeeper works behind the scenes, in conjunction with a BBC journalist, to pressure UNPROFOR to permit them to attempt an evacuation of the stranded soldiers. In the end, the rescue effort is to no avail and none of the three stranded soldiers are rescued alive. The movie is very real, from the Bosnian soldier's high-top basketball sneakers, the French UNPROFOR peacekeeper snoozing on duty, the Bosnian commander's lew flirting with the BBC journalist. This is a great picture, one of those movies that will come back to haunt you days after you've seen it.\na must-see for anyone who has spent time in the Balkans\nThe Harmonists [DVD]\nBen Becker  (Actor),     Heino Ferch  (Actor),     Joseph Vilsmaier  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Musicals & Performing Arts, Musicals\n['Filled with topflight performances and unforgettable music, this entertaining and critically acclaimed story was cheered by audiences everywhere!

The story line is so gripping, it almost seems too contrived to be true.  And, given the immense talent and popularity of the group (in its heydey), I was surprised that I had never heard of them.  The story is about a group of six musicians, three of whom are Jewish, who rise to fame in Germany in 1930s.  Tension grows within the group as the Nazis become increasingly powerful in Germany.  After the group performs aboard the USS Saratoga in New York harbor, there is some question about whether they will return to Nazi Germany or stay in the US.  The group plays its final concert to a sold-out crowd shortly after the New York trip.  The movie will leave you wanting to know much more about its members, particularly Mr. Frommerman, and its music.  As an added bonus, the five-part harmonies are FANTASTIC.  This is one of the most gripping shows I've seen in several months, it came as a complete surprise.\nBrilliant, gripping, and based on a true story!\nWindtalkers\nNicolas Cage  (Actor),     Adam Beach  (Actor),     John Woo  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Action & Adventure\n['During WWII, two U.S. Marines are assigned to protect two Navajo Marines code talkers.
