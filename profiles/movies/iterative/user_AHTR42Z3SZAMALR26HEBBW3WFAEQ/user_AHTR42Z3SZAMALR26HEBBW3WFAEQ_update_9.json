It really is like one long home movie, scratchy, not at all slickly produced or well-edited, with footage of Johnny going about his daily routine, at home with his parents, walking through his now-vacant childhood home, on a farm with his children, visiting the gas station owner &amp; other folks in his home town, interspersed with footage of Johnny (and others, including June Carter &amp; her sisters) performing.  The performances are powerful, of course, but the real treat is seeing Johnny in his element, with his family &amp; old neighbors.  The only odd aspect of the film is that it devotes significant time to other aspiring performers who want to play for Johnny -- It's interesting, but what it shows about Johnny (his reaction to these aspiring writers &amp; performers) seems to be limited in comparison to the time given to others performing entire songs.  If you're looking for a slick musical production of Cash performing, you'll be disappointed.  If you want a behind-the-scenes look at the Man in Black, this is well worth the money.\nReview Title: one long, scratchy behind-the-scenes home movie\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

The story begins as two soldiers, a war-weathered Bosnian and a rookie-soldier Serb, become stranded in a trench in &quot;no man's land&quot; together. The Serb's friend and fellow soldier is also in the trench, lying on top of a bouncing mine, which will detonante if he moves. The film shows the efforts of the the soldiers to elicit rescue by UNPROFOR peacekeepers. There tension and hostility between the soldiers in the trench alternate with moments of kindness, even tenderness, and genuine teamwork in their effort for rescue, until they remember that they hate each other. The French peacekeepers are ordered not to take action by their British commander, because it is too dangerous. A cunning French peacekeeper works behind the scenes, in conjunction with a BBC journalist, to pressure UNPROFOR to permit them to attempt an evacuation of the stranded soldiers. In the end, the rescue effort is to no avail and none of the three stranded soldiers are rescued alive. The movie is very real, from the Bosnian soldier's high-top basketball sneakers, the French UNPROFOR peacekeeper snoozing on duty, the Bosnian commander's lew flirting with the BBC journalist. This is a great picture, one of those movies that will come back to haunt you days after you've seen it.\na must-see for anyone who has spent time in the Balkans\nThe Harmonists [DVD]\nBen Becker  (Actor),     Heino Ferch  (Actor),     Joseph Vilsmaier  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Musicals & Performing Arts, Musicals\n['Filled with topflight performances and unforgettable music, this entertaining and critically acclaimed story was cheered by audiences everywhere!

The story line is so gripping, it almost seems too contrived to be true.  And, given the immense talent and popularity of the group (in its heydey), I was surprised that I had never heard of them.  The story is about a group of six musicians, three of whom are Jewish, who rise to fame in Germany in 1930s.  Tension grows within the group as the Nazis become increasingly powerful in Germany.  After the group performs aboard the USS Saratoga in New York harbor, there is some question about whether they will return to Nazi Germany or stay in the US.  The group plays its final concert to a sold-out crowd shortly after the New York trip.  The movie will leave you wanting to know much more about its members, particularly Mr. Frommerman, and its music.  As an added bonus, the five-part harmonies are FANTASTIC.  This is one of the most gripping shows I've seen in several months, it came as a complete surprise.\nBrilliant, gripping, and based on a true story!\nWindtalkers\nNicolas Cage  (Actor),     Adam Beach  (Actor),     John Woo  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Action & Adventure\n['During WWII, two U.S. Marines are assigned to protect two Navajo Marines code talkers.

That's about the extent of what I learned about the Navajo codetalkers in this film.  This was a gory, shoot-em-up war film, with plenty of Japs (conveniently identifiable by the twigs in their helmets) tumbling to the ground under American fire, lots of arms & legs being blown off, even a decapitation.  The rumble of gunfire serves as background noise at all times.  The Nicholas Cage character is meant to be an enigma -- he is neither particularly interesting nor particularly likeable,and his transformation (from skepticism of his Navajo assignee to respect for the Navajo) seems a bit too sudden.  There are some breathtaking shots of Navajo country at the end of the film, but it's not worth sitting through the rest of the film to see.  If you want a war movie, you won't necessarily be disappointed.

Oscar, a precocious fifteen year old prep school student who quotes Voltaire and speaks French, is far, far too sophisticated to be bothered by the girls his age. Rather, his heart is focused on his step-mother, played by Sigourney Weaver.  He is a charmer, but completely unable to see the naivete of his youth.  His efforts to be adult -- gluing on fake sideburns and spouting philosophy to any willing audience are right on.  He seems to think that there is no reason he cannot be a serious contender for his step-mother's affections, and he courts her (his true intentions unbeknownst to her) by bringing her lunch at work, calling the terminology of her work (cardiological research) poetry, and playing tennis with her.  John Ritter plays the clueless history-professor-Dad to a tee.  I really liked this film -- from the title screen (where letters flitter across the screen in the shape of a tadpole) to the end, where Oscar is finally able to see the attractiveness of a girl his own age.

The story centers around Andie MacDowell's character's search for her Pulitzer-award-winning photographer husband, who was reportedly killed when a building collapses in the war. Sarah Lloyd (Andie) is convinced that her husband is still alive, so she leaves behind her two young children & her job at Newsweek to venture to Serb-held Vukovar to find him. Her journey is fraught with violence -- shortly after she crosses into Yugoslavia, she encounters a Serb roadblock, where her hitchhiker/passenger/guide, a charming Croatian student in Paris returning to find his wife & baby, is needlessly executed, the rented Audi is crushed by a tank, and Sarah barely escapes rape. She is \"rescued\" by fellow journalists, and undaunted, continues her seeming suicide mission to find her husband in Vukovar. The violence in this film rivals anything you'll find on screen (think two hours of the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan) and you'll hear the ... word at least once a minute -- but it is well worth seeing. It will foster an appreciation of what photojournalists go through to document history, putting themselves at risk certainly as much as the soldiers, without the support & protection of an Army being them (albeit voluntarily). My only concern is that the film may oversimplify the issues underlying the conflict -- it depicts Serbs as evil and Croats as - - well, not evil, providing a relatively safe haven for the journalists. However, the film is not so much about the conflict itself as it is about the sacrifices of the journalists covering the conflict.\ntribute to journalists who died covering the Balkan conflict\nLittle Voice [DVD]\nBrenda Blethyn  (Actor),     Jane Horrocks  (Actor),     Mark Herman  (Director, Writer)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Studio Specials, Miramax Home Entertainment, All Titles\n['Product Description', 'World-class stars Michael Caine (HANNAH AND HER SISTERS), Brenda Blethyn (SECRETS AND LIES), and Ewan McGregor (STAR WARS: EPISODE I, BLACK HAWK DOWN) deliver acclaimed performances in an inspirational story about a painfully shy young woman and how the power of music leads her to an amazing transformation!

LV is her mother's opposite -- a plain-jane, retiring type, silent, expressing herself only through the voices and words of the divas on her treasured record albums, finding solace in the framed portrait of her deceased father.

There are also some great clips of other wonderful performers -- A young, unpolished Alison Krauss, a young overly-polished George Jones in his crewcut days, singing \"White Lightning\", a young Porter Waggoner.  In addition, there is commentary by two rail-thin farmers, wearing overalls & fedoras & leaning on hoes in a field, talking about the backdrop against which bluegrass music gained and lost popularity, discussing the struggles of the depression and that crazy hip-swinging Elvis who had people \"throwing their babies at him\" and everything.  This is such a great DVD -- I know that I'll watch this again and again, and share it with several of my friends and family (and I'm half tempted to run out & buy myself a banjo and spend the next few years trying to learn to play like Earl Scruggs.)\na must if you love traditional bluegrass\nFar from Heaven\nJulianne Moore  (Actor),     Dennis Quaid  (Actor),     Todd Haynes  (Director, Writer)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Studio Specials, Focus Features, All Titles\n['Julianne Moore (Hannibal, Boogie Nights) and Dennis Quaid (The Rookie, Frequency) star in this seductive story of a seemingly perfect family, and the forbidden desires that threaten to tear them apart. Cathy Whitaker (Moore) has it all - a lovely home, two wonderful children and a handsome husband (Quaid), who is successfully climbing the corporate ladder. But Cathy\\'s idyllic existence is just an illusion, and she is eventually forced to choose between living a lie or following her heart.Academy Award nominee Moore \"is a vision,\" declared Rex Reed, and he called Quaid\\'s performance \"the best of his career,\" in this stunning drama hailed by the New York Post as \"one of the year\\'s best.\"', 'Bonus Content:', 'Anatomy of a Scene', 'Anatomy of a Scene', 'The Making of Far From Heaven', 'The Making of Far From Heaven', \"Director's Commentary with Todd Haynes\", \"Director's Commentary with Todd Haynes\", \"The Filmmaker's Experience: Questions & Answers with Todd Haynes & Julianne Moore\", \"The Filmmaker's Experience: Questions & Answers with Todd Haynes & Julianne Moore\", 'Theatrical Trailer', 'Theatrical Trailer', 'Production Notes', 'Production Notes', 'Cast and Filmmakers', 'Cast and Filmmakers', 'Recommendations', 'Recommendations', ']]>']\n{'Product Dimensions': '5.31\"L x 7.52\"W', 'Item Weight': '2.68 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Orientation': 'Portrait', 'Shape': 'Rectangular', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.85:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned)', 'Item model number': '025192245626', 'Director': 'Todd Haynes', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, DTS Surround Sound, Dubbed, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Run time': '1 hour and 48 minutes', 'Release date': 'July 4, 2017', 'Actors': 'Julianne Moore, Dennis Quaid, Dennis Haysbert, Patricia Clarkson, Michael Gaston', 'Dubbed': 'French', 'Subtitles': 'Spanish, French', 'Producers': 'Allen Jody', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1), English (DTS 5.1), French (Dolby Digital 2.0), Unqualified', 'Studio': 'Universal Pictures Home Entertainment', 'Writers': 'Todd Haynes', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nJulianne Moore is so poised, so stiff and controlled, so 1958 in this film. She and her gay executive husband are perceived as the perfect \"Mr. & Mrs. Magnatech\" leading the perfect suburban life.  Her dresses and hats and heels always match perfectly.  Her children address her as \"Mother\"; her maid addresses her as \"Mrs. Whitaker\", she refers to her husband as \"Mr. Whitaker\", and her children are scolded for using such words as \"geez\" -- because that language is not used in the Whitaker household.  The other reviews do a fine job of summarizing the plot and commenting on the acting.  I kept hoping that Moore would run off with her gardener in the end -- his character was the perfect gentleman, the perfect friend, the perfect single father.  He could tell when Moore was in need and reached out accordingly.  He had more heart, soul and courage than any other character in the film.  I found myself falling in love with the gardener in this film; the character was delicious and the acting was superb.\nNo happy endings in this film\nJohnny Cash - The Man, His World, His Music\nRated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Music Artists, Cash, Johnny\n['Product Description', \"This 90 minute program contains many rare clips, including the Man in Black singing classic duets with his wife June Carter, Carl Perkins, and Bob Dylan This fascinating fly o n the wall documentary shot mainly on tour in the late '6 0's includes 21 song performances in many different setting s, plus unique footage of Cash relaxing and visiting with f riends and family. DVD Extras: No regional coding, compete Johnny Cash CD discography, complete list of Johnny Cash-re lated books & video, facility to play individual tracks.\", 'Amazon.com', 'This has the unmistakable whiff of opportunism about it\\xad-there is no structure, no narration, nothing by way of accompanying information, and much of the concert footage looks like it was filmed by someone whose other eye was engaged reading the instruction manual for the camera. Despite--or, just maybe, because of--these limitations, it offers some genuine revelations of its subject. And, in fairness, the concert footage that is filmed properly is marvelous.', 'The material collected here was apparently filmed in the late \\'60s and offers a series of snapshots of Cash on one of his famously interminable tours. He is shown playing to audiences of fans, maximum-security prisoners, and feather-clad Native American dignitaries, and he is shown away from the stage, playing cards on the tour bus, jamming with friends, and further reinforcing his then-unfashionable interest in Native American issues with a visit to the site of the Wounded Knee massacre. Also of interest are the other performers that wander through this random travelogue: Cash\\'s wife, June Carter Cash, in a duet with him on \"Jackson\"; Cash\\'s lead guitarist, Carl Perkins, taking the spotlight to sing his creation \"Blue Suede Shoes\"; and, best of all, Cash, grinning from ear to ear and quite unabashedly overawed, recording a glorious duet of Billy Edd Wheeler\\'s \"Blistered\" with an insouciant, gum-chewing Bob Dylan.', '--Andrew Mueller, Amazon.co.uk']\n{'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.75 x 5.75 x 0.25 inches; 5.6 Ounces', 'Media Format': 'NTSC', 'Run time': '1 hour and 30 minutes', 'Release date': 'May 30, 2000', 'Actors': 'Cash, Johnny', 'Studio': 'Video Music, Inc.', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nThis was not at all what I expected, but it was a rare treat.  It really is like one long home movie, scratchy, not at all slickly produced or well-edited, with footage of Johnny going about his daily routine, at home with his parents, walking through his now-vacant childhood home, on a farm with his children, visiting the gas station owner &amp; other folks in his home town, interspersed with footage of Johnny (and others, including June Carter &amp; her sisters) performing.  The performances are powerful, of course, but the real treat is seeing Johnny in his element, with his family &amp; old neighbors.  The only odd aspect of the film is that it devotes significant time to other aspiring performers who want to play for Johnny -- It's interesting, but what it shows about Johnny (his reaction to these aspiring writers &amp; performers) seems to be limited in comparison to the time given to others performing entire songs.  If you're looking for a slick musical production of Cash performing, you'll be disappointed.  If you want a behind-the-scenes look at the Man in Black, this is well worth the money.\none long, scratchy behind-the-scenes home movie",
