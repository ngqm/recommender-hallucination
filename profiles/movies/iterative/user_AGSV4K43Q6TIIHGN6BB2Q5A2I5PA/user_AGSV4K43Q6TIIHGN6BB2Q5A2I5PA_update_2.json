If you don't want a spoiler, don't read, but Christmas now comes from an &#34;alien&#34; sort of ship delivered by thousands of odd looking elves and Santa is just &#34;in charge&#34; - an old sort of &#34;out of it&#34; guy. It is not a classic I will want to watch again. There were terrible moments that made me want to cry. How is that a happy Christmas?\nReview Title: A really bizarre way to represent Christmas\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
