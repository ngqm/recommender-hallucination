I like the main actress a lot. the story is a true story about a polish girl who helps her best friends family during the time of Nazi occupation. Her sister and her hide over 10 Jews in her addict for a long time. she goes to work every day to provide all the hidden Jews with food. She has to work very hard to find food for her friends. on the end of the movie her house will be for a short time a Wehrmacht head quarter and she still manages to keep her friends hidden and save. after the war she ends up marrying her childhood sweetheart's brother. great story about the courage of a young girl.\nReview Title: great movie\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
