The night time set was a bit distracting, could barely see some of the characters interacting with the monsters in the apartment.\nGood Enough\nHow I Live Now\nInternational, Drama, Bleak, Eerie\n['Set in the near-future UK, Saoirse Ronan plays Daisy, an American teenager sent to stay with relatives in the English countryside. Initially withdrawn and alienated, she begins to warm up to her charming surroundings and strikes up a romance with the handsome Edmund (George MacKay). But on the fringes of their idyllic summer days are tense news reports of an escalating conflict in Europe. As the UK falls into a violent, chaotic military state, Daisy finds herself hiding and fighting to survive.']\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Kevin Macdonald'], 'Producers': ['Andrew Ruhemann', 'John Battsek', 'Charles Steel', 'Alasdair Flind'], 'Starring': ['Saoirse Ronan', 'George MacKay', 'Tom Holland']}\nI had high expectations for this movie since I saw that it was Sci-Fiction. Now while I was expecting aliens from outer space to impact the character's lives...apparently I knew nothing about it other than the preview and my imagination ran away filling in the blanks. It was a haunting story and exceeded my expectations even without the aliens since there weren't any. It was one of the best coming of age stories in an apocalyptic world that I have ever seen. The actors and actresses did a wonderful job securing the hopelessness and futility of nuclear war in a developed country.\nA Haunting Film\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Sam Miller'], 'Producers': ['Will Packer', 'Lee Clay'], 'Starring': ['Idris Elba', 'Taraji P.

That part was unbelievable. If there is a strange man standing at my doorstep asking to come into my house, and he is not a service person with a pre-arranged appointment, there is no way in hell he is getting past the threshold.\nFirst of all...\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Adam Nee', 'Aaron Nee'], 'Producers': ['Liza Chasin', 'Sandra Bullock', 'Seth Gordon', 'J.
