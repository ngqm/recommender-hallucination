Among the best sketches is \"CSI: Greater Greensboro Tri-Area,\" in which Foxworthy\\'s crime-scene sleuth is on the trail of a deerslayer. \"Lingerie for Couples Together 20 Years\" spotlights such hot domestic garb as sweatshirts accented with a ratty, cat-hair-covered blanket from the back of a closet. \"Hug or Hit\" is a mock game show in which a terrified contestant has to predict whether a drunk sleeping in a glass booth will, upon awakening, embrace or take a swing at him.', 'The recurring \"I believe\" format finds Foxworthy, Larry, and Engvall piously revealing articles of their faith in this hard, hard world: \"I believe,\" Engvall says, \"that Angelina Jolie thinks about me as much as I think about her.\" Right.
