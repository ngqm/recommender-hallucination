As the last robot left on earth, Wall-E (voiced by Ben Burtt) is one small robot--with a big, big heart--who holds the future of earth and mankind squarely in the palm of his metal hand. He\\'s outlasted all the \"Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class\" robots that were assigned some 700 years ago to clean up the environmental mess that man made of earth while man vacationed aboard the luxury spaceship Axiom. Wall-E has dutifully gone about his job compacting trash, the extreme solitude broken only by his pet cockroach, but he\\'s developed some oddly human habits and ideas. When the Axiom sends its regularly scheduled robotic EVE probe (Elissa Knight) to earth, Wall-E is instantly smitten and proceeds to try to impress EVE with his collection of human memorabilia. EVE\\'s directive compels her to bring Wall-E\\'s newly collected plant sprout to the captain of the Axiom and Wall-E follows in hot pursuit. Suddenly, the human world is turned upside down and the Captain (Jeff Garlin) joins forces with Wall-E and a cast of other misfit robots to lead the now lethargic people back home to earth.', 'Wall-E', 'is a great family film with the most impressive aspect being the depth of emotion conveyed by a simple robot--a machine typically considered devoid of emotion, but made so absolutely touching by the magic of Pixar animation. Also well-worth admiring are the sweeping views from space, the creative yet disturbing vision of what strange luxuries a future space vacation might offer, and the innovative use of trash in a future cityscape.

The resulting concoction is a hilarious adventure for all ages. Brilliant but befuddled Professor Phillip Brainard (Williams) is on the brink of inventing a revolutionary energy source and missing his wedding to fiancee Dr. Sara Jean Reynolds (Marcia Gay Harden) -- president of financially challenged Medfield College -- for the third time! When Phillip experiments with his own big bang theory, a miraculous elastic good -- Flubber -- emerges, leaving him ecstatic, but unmarried! Phillip and his flying cyber sidekick, Weebo, soon discover that Flubber, applied to anything, enables it to bounce super high and fast. However, many questions remain. Is Flubber good enough to win Sara back, save Medfield from its financial problems, and slip through the hands of the evil financier who is bankrolling the college? FLUBBER slips, slides, giggles, glides, flips, and flies -- the stuff of surefire family entertainment. Now you can bring home Disney\\'s box office hit that\\'s two parts innovation, three parts imagination, and \"100% pure fun!\" (CNN)|Many of the film\\'s special effects were produced in huge Building Three at the Treasure Island Naval Base off San Francisco. With 90,000 square feet of space, the producers were able to create the professor\\'s basement laboratory, the interior of the team\\'s locker room, and a 2,500-seat basketball stadium, all under one roof at one time.|Differing from the original film (THE ABSENT-MINDED PROFESSOR), this time Flubber is given a personality of its own. Mischievous and uncontrollable, it creates havoc everywhere.', 'Amazon.com', \"Disney couldn't resist the temptation to remake 1961's popular comedy\", 'The Absent Minded Professor', ', so they cast Robin Williams as Professor Philip Brainard (a role vaguely related to the character originated by Fred MacMurray), and the result is a comedy that, frankly, doesn\\'t fully deserve its modest success. It\\'s admittedly clever to a point, and certainly the digitally \"flubberized\" special effects provide the kind of movie magic that\\'s entertaining for kids and parents alike. The professor can\\'t even remember his own wedding day (much to the chagrin of his fianc\u00e9e, played by Marcia Gay Harden), and now his academic rival (Christopher McDonald) is trying to steal his latest and purely accidental invention--flying rubber, or ... flubber. The green goo magnifies energy and can be used as an amazing source of power, but in the hands of screenwriter John Hughes it becomes just another excuse to recycle a lot of', 'Home Alone', \"-style slapstick humor involving a pair of bumbling would-be flubber thieves. There's also a floating robot named Weebo and some catchy music by Danny Elfman to accompany dancing globs of flubber, but the story's too thin to add up to anything special. Lightweight fun, but, given the title, it lacks a certain bounce. Of course, that didn't stop Disney's marketing wizards from turning it into a home-video hit.\", '--Jeff Shannon']\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'ACTION, Comedy, LIVE', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Closed-captioned, Color, Live, NTSC, Letterboxed, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Leslie Stefanson, Malcolm Brownson, Dean Cundey, Edie McClurg, Jodie Benson, Clancy Brown, Samuel W.

I\u2019m so excited that amazon offers all of the seasons and for just $10 each. It\u2019s way cheaper the wasting money on yet another streaming app ( HBOMAX that\u2019ll be coming out in a May. I refuse and I mean refuse to buy another app. It\u2019s not worth it or affordable especially that one. They want $15 a month. No thanks!!!<br />I used to watch friends on Netflix whenever I wanted and it was wonderful. But it left in January 2020. It\u2019s always on nick at night but I like to watch it without commercials.<br /><br />Anyways I\u2019ve been watching this show since the 90s when it first aired and have been a huge fan since ( if you couldn\u2019t tell already lol)<br />I\u2019ve seen each episodes probably hundreds of times but I never ever get sick of them. Plus there\u2019s a handful of episodes that aren\u2019t aired as much. I laugh my butt off every time I watch it. I know almost every line from each episode. I\u2019m not joking when I say I\u2019m obsessed!<br /><br />One of the best things about it offered on amazon is that we can literally watch it anywhere and on anything. Phone, tablet, smart TV, chromcast or roku stock and probably amazon fire and other devices. This is way better then buying the box set of dvds since you have only one way to watch. Anyways if your a fan of this show then I recommend buying all the seasons. I\u2019ve bought the first 7 already and will continue to purchase the rest when I have the extra money. I just hope the price stays at $10 and not go up once it\u2019s available on HBOMAX.<br /><br />I want to add that even if you cancel your amazon prime, you\u2019ll still have access to whatever you buy for movies or shows. You don\u2019t need to worry about losing anything or think your wasting money. Your definitely not. And you never have to worry about returning it bc it doesn\u2019t work like a dvd. Who buys those nowadays anyways?! Do they still make dvds players? Lol\nReview Title: LOVE this show!

This is your typical documentary. It tells us about her success, ups and downs like any other documentary.<br />If you\u2019re a fan of Jen Aniston then I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ll like this. Give it shot! It\u2019s only an hour. But I wish it was longer. I\u2019ve been a huge fan of hers since the movie leprechaun. Then to see her on friends was wicked awesome! I was glad she continued with an acting career. I still watch friends till this day. Not just because of her but because they\u2019re all great in their own way. I know gave my boyfriend clapping in the introduction of the song! It\u2019s hysterical. Anyways he now loves the show as much as I do. This does talk about it quite a lot.<br />Anyways, enjoy!<br /><br />By the way, if anyone is wondering how to leave a review on prime movies, you can\u2019t do it from the app. You have to go to your web browser on your smart phone and type in Amazon, then pull up the movie/show or use a computer.

Wall-E has dutifully gone about his job compacting trash, the extreme solitude broken only by his pet cockroach, but he\\'s developed some oddly human habits and ideas. When the Axiom sends its regularly scheduled robotic EVE probe (Elissa Knight) to earth, Wall-E is instantly smitten and proceeds to try to impress EVE with his collection of human memorabilia. EVE\\'s directive compels her to bring Wall-E\\'s newly collected plant sprout to the captain of the Axiom and Wall-E follows in hot pursuit.

The resulting concoction is a hilarious adventure for all ages. Brilliant but befuddled Professor Phillip Brainard (Williams) is on the brink of inventing a revolutionary energy source and missing his wedding to fiancee Dr. Sara Jean Reynolds (Marcia Gay Harden) -- president of financially challenged Medfield College -- for the third time! When Phillip experiments with his own big bang theory, a miraculous elastic good -- Flubber -- emerges, leaving him ecstatic, but unmarried! Phillip and his flying cyber sidekick, Weebo, soon discover that Flubber, applied to anything, enables it to bounce super high and fast. However, many questions remain. Is Flubber good enough to win Sara back, save Medfield from its financial problems, and slip through the hands of the evil financier who is bankrolling the college? FLUBBER slips, slides, giggles, glides, flips, and flies -- the stuff of surefire family entertainment. Now you can bring home Disney\\'s box office hit that\\'s two parts innovation, three parts imagination, and \"100% pure fun!\" (CNN)|Many of the film\\'s special effects were produced in huge Building Three at the Treasure Island Naval Base off San Francisco. With 90,000 square feet of space, the producers were able to create the professor\\'s basement laboratory, the interior of the team\\'s locker room, and a 2,500-seat basketball stadium, all under one roof at one time.|Differing from the original film (THE ABSENT-MINDED PROFESSOR), this time Flubber is given a personality of its own. Mischievous and uncontrollable, it creates havoc everywhere.', 'Amazon.com', \"Disney couldn't resist the temptation to remake 1961's popular comedy\", 'The Absent Minded Professor', ', so they cast Robin Williams as Professor Philip Brainard (a role vaguely related to the character originated by Fred MacMurray), and the result is a comedy that, frankly, doesn\\'t fully deserve its modest success. It\\'s admittedly clever to a point, and certainly the digitally \"flubberized\" special effects provide the kind of movie magic that\\'s entertaining for kids and parents alike. The professor can\\'t even remember his own wedding day (much to the chagrin of his fianc\u00e9e, played by Marcia Gay Harden), and now his academic rival (Christopher McDonald) is trying to steal his latest and purely accidental invention--flying rubber, or ... flubber. The green goo magnifies energy and can be used as an amazing source of power, but in the hands of screenwriter John Hughes it becomes just another excuse to recycle a lot of', 'Home Alone', \"-style slapstick humor involving a pair of bumbling would-be flubber thieves. There's also a floating robot named Weebo and some catchy music by Danny Elfman to accompany dancing globs of flubber, but the story's too thin to add up to anything special. Lightweight fun, but, given the title, it lacks a certain bounce. Of course, that didn't stop Disney's marketing wizards from turning it into a home-video hit.\", '--Jeff Shannon']\n{'Genre': 'ACTION, Comedy, LIVE', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Closed-captioned, Color, Live, NTSC, Letterboxed, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Leslie Stefanson, Malcolm Brownson, Dean Cundey, Edie McClurg, Jodie Benson, Clancy Brown, Samuel W.

I\u2019m so excited that amazon offers all of the seasons and for just $10 each. It\u2019s way cheaper the wasting money on yet another streaming app ( HBOMAX that\u2019ll be coming out in a May. I refuse and I mean refuse to buy another app. It\u2019s not worth it or affordable especially that one. They want $15 a month. No thanks!!!<br />I used to watch friends on Netflix whenever I wanted and it was wonderful. But it left in January 2020. It\u2019s always on nick at night but I like to watch it without commercials.<br /><br />Anyways I\u2019ve been watching this show since the 90s when it first aired and have been a huge fan since ( if you couldn\u2019t tell already lol)<br />I\u2019ve seen each episodes probably hundreds of times but I never ever get sick of them. Plus there\u2019s a handful of episodes that aren\u2019t aired as much. I laugh my butt off every time I watch it. I know almost every line from each episode. I\u2019m not joking when I say I\u2019m obsessed!<br /><br />One of the best things about it offered on amazon is that we can literally watch it anywhere and on anything. Phone, tablet, smart TV, chromcast or roku stock and probably amazon fire and other devices. This is way better then buying the box set of dvds since you have only one way to watch. Anyways if your a fan of this show then I recommend buying all the seasons. I\u2019ve bought the first 7 already and will continue to purchase the rest when I have the extra money. I just hope the price stays at $10 and not go up once it\u2019s available on HBOMAX.<br /><br />I want to add that even if you cancel your amazon prime, you\u2019ll still have access to whatever you buy for movies or shows. You don\u2019t need to worry about losing anything or think your wasting money. Your definitely not. And you never have to worry about returning it bc it doesn\u2019t work like a dvd. Who buys those nowadays anyways?! Do they still make dvds players? Lol\nLOVE this show! Wicked funny! #1 fan right here!!\n{'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Castille Landon'], 'Producers': ['Dori A.

This is your typical documentary. It tells us about her success, ups and downs like any other documentary.<br />If you\u2019re a fan of Jen Aniston then I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ll like this. Give it shot! It\u2019s only an hour. But I wish it was longer. I\u2019ve been a huge fan of hers since the movie leprechaun. Then to see her on friends was wicked awesome! I was glad she continued with an acting career. I still watch friends till this day. Not just because of her but because they\u2019re all great in their own way. I know gave my boyfriend clapping in the introduction of the song! It\u2019s hysterical. Anyways he now loves the show as much as I do. This does talk about it quite a lot.<br />Anyways, enjoy!<br /><br />By the way, if anyone is wondering how to leave a review on prime movies, you can\u2019t do it from the app. You have to go to your web browser on your smart phone and type in Amazon, then pull up the movie/show or use a computer. I had to research it since it\u2019s been awhile since I rated something to watch.\nLoved this!\n{'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Darren Lynn Bousman'], 'Producers': ['Oren Koules', 'Mark Burg'], 'Starring': ['Chris Rock', 'Max Minghella', 'Samuel L.

Phillip and his flying cyber sidekick, Weebo, soon discover that Flubber, applied to anything, enables it to bounce super high and fast. However, many questions remain. Is Flubber good enough to win Sara back, save Medfield from its financial problems, and slip through the hands of the evil financier who is bankrolling the college? FLUBBER slips, slides, giggles, glides, flips, and flies -- the stuff of surefire family entertainment. Now you can bring home Disney\\'s box office hit that\\'s two parts innovation, three parts imagination, and \"100% pure fun!\" (CNN)|Many of the film\\'s special effects were produced in huge Building Three at the Treasure Island Naval Base off San Francisco. With 90,000 square feet of space, the producers were able to create the professor\\'s basement laboratory, the interior of the team\\'s locker room, and a 2,500-seat basketball stadium, all under one roof at one time.|Differing from the original film (THE ABSENT-MINDED PROFESSOR), this time Flubber is given a personality of its own. Mischievous and uncontrollable, it creates havoc everywhere.', 'Amazon.com', \"Disney couldn't resist the temptation to remake 1961's popular comedy\", 'The Absent Minded Professor', ', so they cast Robin Williams as Professor Philip Brainard (a role vaguely related to the character originated by Fred MacMurray), and the result is a comedy that, frankly, doesn\\'t fully deserve its modest success. It\\'s admittedly clever to a point, and certainly the digitally \"flubberized\" special effects provide the kind of movie magic that\\'s entertaining for kids and parents alike. The professor can\\'t even remember his own wedding day (much to the chagrin of his fianc\u00e9e, played by Marcia Gay Harden), and now his academic rival (Christopher McDonald) is trying to steal his latest and purely accidental invention--flying rubber, or ... flubber. The green goo magnifies energy and can be used as an amazing source of power, but in the hands of screenwriter John Hughes it becomes just another excuse to recycle a lot of', 'Home Alone', \"-style slapstick humor involving a pair of bumbling would-be flubber thieves. There's also a floating robot named Weebo and some catchy music by Danny Elfman to accompany dancing globs of flubber, but the story's too thin to add up to anything special. Lightweight fun, but, given the title, it lacks a certain bounce. Of course, that didn't stop Disney's marketing wizards from turning it into a home-video hit.\", '--Jeff Shannon']\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'ACTION, Comedy, LIVE', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Closed-captioned, Color, Live, NTSC, Letterboxed, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Leslie Stefanson, Malcolm Brownson, Dean Cundey, Edie McClurg, Jodie Benson, Clancy Brown, Samuel W.

I\u2019m so excited that amazon offers all of the seasons and for just $10 each. It\u2019s way cheaper the wasting money on yet another streaming app ( HBOMAX that\u2019ll be coming out in a May. I refuse and I mean refuse to buy another app. It\u2019s not worth it or affordable especially that one. They want $15 a month. No thanks!!!<br />I used to watch friends on Netflix whenever I wanted and it was wonderful. But it left in January 2020. It\u2019s always on nick at night but I like to watch it without commercials.<br /><br />Anyways I\u2019ve been watching this show since the 90s when it first aired and have been a huge fan since ( if you couldn\u2019t tell already lol)<br />I\u2019ve seen each episodes probably hundreds of times but I never ever get sick of them. Plus there\u2019s a handful of episodes that aren\u2019t aired as much. I laugh my butt off every time I watch it. I know almost every line from each episode. I\u2019m not joking when I say I\u2019m obsessed!<br /><br />One of the best things about it offered on amazon is that we can literally watch it anywhere and on anything. Phone, tablet, smart TV, chromcast or roku stock and probably amazon fire and other devices. This is way better then buying the box set of dvds since you have only one way to watch. Anyways if your a fan of this show then I recommend buying all the seasons. I\u2019ve bought the first 7 already and will continue to purchase the rest when I have the extra money. I just hope the price stays at $10 and not go up once it\u2019s available on HBOMAX.<br /><br />I want to add that even if you cancel your amazon prime, you\u2019ll still have access to whatever you buy for movies or shows. You don\u2019t need to worry about losing anything or think your wasting money. Your definitely not. And you never have to worry about returning it bc it doesn\u2019t work like a dvd. Who buys those nowadays anyways?! Do they still make dvds players? Lol\nReview Title: LOVE this show!

This is your typical documentary. It tells us about her success, ups and downs like any other documentary.<br />If you\u2019re a fan of Jen Aniston then I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ll like this. Give it shot! It\u2019s only an hour. But I wish it was longer. I\u2019ve been a huge fan of hers since the movie leprechaun. Then to see her on friends was wicked awesome! I was glad she continued with an acting career. I still watch friends till this day. Not just because of her but because they\u2019re all great in their own way. I know gave my boyfriend clapping in the introduction of the song! It\u2019s hysterical. Anyways he now loves the show as much as I do. This does talk about it quite a lot.<br />Anyways, enjoy!<br /><br />By the way, if anyone is wondering how to leave a review on prime movies, you can\u2019t do it from the app. You have to go to your web browser on your smart phone and type in Amazon, then pull up the movie/show or use a computer. I had to research it since it\u2019s been awhile since I rated something to watch.\nReview Title: Loved this!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2021/10/12\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Darren Lynn Bousman'], 'Producers': ['Oren Koules', 'Mark Burg'], 'Starring': ['Chris Rock', 'Max Minghella', 'Samuel L.

    "text": "I love Anna Kendrick but this was just god awful! Her acting and the other woman were great but the story line wasn\u2019t. It\u2019s supposed to be about her controlling/abusive boyfriend, but really, they didn\u2019t show too many flashbacks of situations that really proved that except when he called her the C-word and the very ending of the movie. Other than that, nothing concerning. I think it\u2019s more about how she thinks she needs to be perfect and is a wicked sensitive person who can\u2019t be criticized. That\u2019s what I got from it anyways. The movie dragged on and on. Don\u2019t waste your money. Luckily I only paid $6 instead of $20 like most cost with new releases on Amazon. That should\u2019ve been a red flag right there. I\u2019m sorry her movie bombed so bad. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll recover without any issues since she\u2019s wicked awesome! I hope to see her in more serious roles in the future.",
