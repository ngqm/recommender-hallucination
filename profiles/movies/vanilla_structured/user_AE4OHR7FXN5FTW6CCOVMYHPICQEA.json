  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:  \nThe individual exhibits a polarized view of cinematic content, demonstrating a strong preference for high-quality productions and negative sentiment toward low-budget or poorly executed films. Ratings consistently reflect this divide, with a notable trend of awarding high scores to well-produced documentaries, while expressing dissatisfaction with superhero and low-quality movies, often resulting in the lowest ratings. The reviews reveal a deep appreciation for documentaries, marked by high ratings and positive commentary. Common themes of disappointment include a lack of engaging storytelling and poor production quality, which compounds their negative feedback.\n\nThere is a clear quality preference, as the individual rewards films with strong production values and engaging content, as seen in their high ratings for documentaries. In contrast, evidence of price sensitivity is not explicitly seen; however, the strong negative responses to poorer quality films suggest a tolerance for spending on quality but disappointment at perceived waste on subpar options. Ultimately, the core preferences highlight a discerning viewer who values production quality, storytelling, and engagement over genre-specific attributes, leading to a varied but critical consumption of film media.",
