The gun loving egotist takes on science now.  Creationism has been crammed down the throats of a fearful Jane and John Q Public for more than 2000 years and many a scientist and healer has been murdered by the religious elite for helping us get off our knees and participate in our world.  It is the religious community who is force feeding their false doctrine, and, as they have done historically, they play the victim.<br />For hundreds of years, only the clergy were allowed to learn to read, write and perform experiments to better understand the nature of reality.  In industrialized parts of the world, almost anyone can read now.  That was a hard won fight.  Religion and science don't have to be enemies.  Scientists aren't calling for the end of Christianity.  Simply because science doesn't support religious stories, doesn't make the scientist the bad guy here.  Religion has a long history of the intentional misuse of information as it was once the major force of political power, created to keep you on your knees in service of the Lord, the King/Queen and the Pope.  Much like the Middle East today, only their mind control is Islam.<br />Science doesn't attack religion.  Religion is the bully here.

There's an artistic quality that separates it from other stories of organized crime and government corruption setting it above the crowd.

On the one hand, she will attract an important and large following of young minds.  This would make the choice clever.  On the other hand, the chemistry between the actors, which is always right on in Mr. Allen's films, is challenged by the Disney camera style that Ms. Cyrus is accustomed to.  The writing is pure Allen and there are, as always, many quotable and memorable moments that make this a really fun watch for those of us who love his openly neurotic, pensive and ultimately hilarious creations.

Oddly enough, I was expecting it to contain more about him: how he adapted to the seeming effeminate role of King Consort would have made it interesting.  Otherwise, it is much like the pedigree of a fine stallion on film.  I sense he is a far more interesting person than this documentary presented.  From my recall of various events and instances where we have been given access to his thoughts and deeds he is rather hilarious in a quintessentially British way.

More like a spy drama than a crime story, it attracts viewers who like character studies as well as intrigue.  It requires your patience, your attention, and a willingness to be wrong as you make predictions about what happens next.  The story is so skillfully layered.  It mainly focuses on the frailties of the powerful and the dynamics of the selfish and self serving people they attract but there's so much more to it.  I just LOVE it.  Of course, the acting is excellent.  The Harris' are cast with perfection.  The tweeking preacher is a stroke of genius as he is an all too common reality.  I suspect his delusions will enter into the story as they develop along with his addiction, ooo.  The writers are so much more clever and courageous than most and I hope I am not made to wait in vain for the completion of the story.  It is one of those tales that is full of surprises.  It is just too good to drop!  Niche audiences matter too, ;)  I am sure that a production like this has staying power.  The story is unlikely to ever become irrelevant or dated.  While the masses aren't flocking to watch it now, it is a story that can continue to find an adoring audience over time.  I hope this will be taken into consideration when making decisions on the future of this production.\nReview Title: BRAVO!!!

The acting is good even if the script gets a bit like Reign with all the self disclosure, rationalizations and justifications.  There aren't many excellent shows about the issues of male friendship so I am glad this series made the attempt.  It is a layered story with lots of twists of fate that conspire against just about everyone involved and smart enough to keep you guessing.  All of the characters are flawed and unlikable almost in turn.  The complex interplay of their egos against their need to cooperate to survive come to the fro from incident to incident which kept me watching.  Unable to rely upon the myth of American Individualism to squirm out of this tight spot, they are trapped into trusting when they know themselves to be untrustworthy.

As is generally the case when he arrives on screen, he steals the show.  I'm not a Holmes fan, not really my genre, but I watched it because of Clunes and I am surprised to say that I liked it.  There was little of the egotism that accompanies Holmes.  Doyle is challenged by his own faulty assumptions but, with the aid of his companions, he moves beyond them to find the truth.

More like a spy drama than a crime story, it attracts viewers who like character studies as well as intrigue.  It requires your patience, your attention, and a willingness to be wrong as you make predictions about what happens next.  The story is so skillfully layered.  It mainly focuses on the frailties of the powerful and the dynamics of the selfish and self serving people they attract but there's so much more to it.  I just LOVE it.  Of course, the acting is excellent.  The Harris' are cast with perfection.  The tweeking preacher is a stroke of genius as he is an all too common reality.  I suspect his delusions will enter into the story as they develop along with his addiction, ooo.  The writers are so much more clever and courageous than most and I hope I am not made to wait in vain for the completion of the story.  It is one of those tales that is full of surprises.  It is just too good to drop!  Niche audiences matter too, ;)  I am sure that a production like this has staying power.  The story is unlikely to ever become irrelevant or dated.  While the masses aren't flocking to watch it now, it is a story that can continue to find an adoring audience over time.

Warning, it is as hard to follow as a paper street map of San Francisco ;), but well worth hanging in there because something interesting is guaranteed to grab your attention.  The acting is simply first class and the story is just perfect.  Just when you think you understand some little piece of it, something comes along to add to the confusion and you just have to wait and see how it will influence the story.  It is what a great story driven production is capable of when allowed to see the light of day.  I am so glad this one made the cut!  Perlman and Delany are both at the top of their game in this production. Dillahunt brings back memories of the most despised character in Deadwood (where he was also outstanding!).

The acting is good even if the script gets a bit like Reign with all the self disclosure, rationalizations and justifications.  There aren't many excellent shows about the issues of male friendship so I am glad this series made the attempt.  It is a layered story with lots of twists of fate that conspire against just about everyone involved and smart enough to keep you guessing.  All of the characters are flawed and unlikable almost in turn.  The complex interplay of their egos against their need to cooperate to survive come to the fro from incident to incident which kept me watching.  Unable to rely upon the myth of American Individualism to squirm out of this tight spot, they are trapped into trusting when they know themselves to be untrustworthy.  Overall, it is an impressive piece of work!\nImpressive and Clever\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Stuart Orme'], 'Producers': ['Rebecca Eaton', 'Philippa Braithwaite', 'Trevor Hopkins'], 'Starring': ['Martin Clunes', 'Charles Edwards', 'Arsher Ali'], 'Studio': ['PBS']}\nMartin Clunes is so subtle and natural in this performance.  As is generally the case when he arrives on screen, he steals the show.  I'm not a Holmes fan, not really my genre, but I watched it because of Clunes and I am surprised to say that I liked it.  There was little of the egotism that accompanies Holmes.  Doyle is challenged by his own faulty assumptions but, with the aid of his companions, he moves beyond them to find the truth.  It's a believable and interesting period piece.  Holmes fans may be disappointed by the lack of narcissists but not in the clever construction of a good tale.\nClunes Drew Me In\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Coky Giedroyc'], 'Producers': ['Paul Rutman'], 'Starring': ['Anne-Marie Duff', 'Tom Hardy', 'Sienna Guillory'], 'Studio': ['FilmRise']}\nBy far my favorite interpretation of the greatest monarch in the history of the British Isles.  The characterizations were so well played and Ann Marie Duff was just perfect.  Rather than focus on the decorum of the English Rose, this story focuses on her wit and the power of her many personas as she evolved into a supremely competent ruler.  She showed the world that not only could a woman rule, she could reign.  So many memorable scenes.  Tom Hardy was the best casting choice to soften the strong portrayal of Elizabeth.  The scene where they were dancing, both in real time and in remembrance were so touching.  The laugh after she berated her council for relentless pursuing a &#34;match&#34;/stud for the succession, was probably my very favorite scene.  I laughed out loud!\nThe Best of the Elizabeth I\n{'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Tom Vaughan', 'Sandra Goldbacher', 'Olly Blackburn'], 'Producers': ['Paul Frift', 'Daisy Goodwin', 'Dan McCulloch', 'Damien Timmer'], 'Starring': ['Jenna Coleman', 'Tom Hughes', 'Rufus Sewell'], 'Studio': ['PBS']}\nSuch a good cast and gorgeous staging even if the content is far from exciting.  Modern monarch's powers have eroded to the point that the little things are all that is left to them.  The drama they suffer through now is tedious and tame, compared to some of the most notorious, Henry VIII, Elizabeth I, Lois XVII.  I bet everyone of them would giggle at how silly some of this seems, but I love the production.\nModern Monarch with Petty Problems\nCrime & Punishment\n['Crime And Punishment is the ultimate psychological thriller, steeped in powerful themes of guilt and retribution, set in St Petersburg in the second half of the 19th century.

If I had to pick the best casting decision, I would pick the Pawn Broker.  Wasn't she just as you would have pictured form the book?  The filth of street life was well portrayed.  So often literature loses so much on the screen but the director got the sense of the smell, the wet, the slimy.  The lead captured the anxiety and the crumbling confidence as if he knew this painful process.  Excellent.  Just Excellent.\nIntrospective and Dramatic",

The gun loving egotist takes on science now.  Creationism has been crammed down the throats of a fearful Jane and John Q Public for more than 2000 years and many a scientist and healer has been murdered by the religious elite for helping us get off our knees and participate in our world.  It is the religious community who is force feeding their false doctrine, and, as they have done historically, they play the victim.<br />For hundreds of years, only the clergy were allowed to learn to read, write and perform experiments to better understand the nature of reality.  In industrialized parts of the world, almost anyone can read now.  That was a hard won fight.  Religion and science don't have to be enemies.  Scientists aren't calling for the end of Christianity.  Simply because science doesn't support religious stories, doesn't make the scientist the bad guy here.  Religion has a long history of the intentional misuse of information as it was once the major force of political power, created to keep you on your knees in service of the Lord, the King/Queen and the Pope.

With excellent performances by a number of the cast members, it is more fun than illuminating or educational.  I agree much of the sex is gratuitous, that seems to be pat for HBO and let's face it, it draws in the crowds.  I love Ian McNiece as the herald.  In fact, bravo to the casting crew!

More like a spy drama than a crime story, it attracts viewers who like character studies as well as intrigue.  It requires your patience, your attention, and a willingness to be wrong as you make predictions about what happens next.  The story is so skillfully layered.  It mainly focuses on the frailties of the powerful and the dynamics of the selfish and self serving people they attract but there's so much more to it.  I just LOVE it.  Of course, the acting is excellent.  The Harris' are cast with perfection.  The tweeking preacher is a stroke of genius as he is an all too common reality.  I suspect his delusions will enter into the story as they develop along with his addiction, ooo.  The writers are so much more clever and courageous than most and I hope I am not made to wait in vain for the completion of the story.  It is one of those tales that is full of surprises.  It is just too good to drop!  Niche audiences matter too, ;)  I am sure that a production like this has staying power.  The story is unlikely to ever become irrelevant or dated.  While the masses aren't flocking to watch it now, it is a story that can continue to find an adoring audience over time.  I hope this will be taken into consideration when making decisions on the future of this production.\nReview Title: BRAVO!!!

The acting is good even if the script gets a bit like Reign with all the self disclosure, rationalizations and justifications.  There aren't many excellent shows about the issues of male friendship so I am glad this series made the attempt.  It is a layered story with lots of twists of fate that conspire against just about everyone involved and smart enough to keep you guessing.  All of the characters are flawed and unlikable almost in turn.  The complex interplay of their egos against their need to cooperate to survive come to the fro from incident to incident which kept me watching.  Unable to rely upon the myth of American Individualism to squirm out of this tight spot, they are trapped into trusting when they know themselves to be untrustworthy.

As is generally the case when he arrives on screen, he steals the show.  I'm not a Holmes fan, not really my genre, but I watched it because of Clunes and I am surprised to say that I liked it.  There was little of the egotism that accompanies Holmes.  Doyle is challenged by his own faulty assumptions but, with the aid of his companions, he moves beyond them to find the truth.  It's a believable and interesting period piece.  Holmes fans may be disappointed by the lack of narcissists but not in the clever construction of a good tale.\nReview Title: Clunes Drew Me In\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2017/09/22\nAverage Rating: 4.2\nProduct Details: {'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Coky Giedroyc'], 'Producers': ['Paul Rutman'], 'Starring': ['Anne-Marie Duff', 'Tom Hardy', 'Sienna Guillory'], 'Studio': ['FilmRise']}\nReview Text: By far my favorite interpretation of the greatest monarch in the history of the British Isles.  The characterizations were so well played and Ann Marie Duff was just perfect.  Rather than focus on the decorum of the English Rose, this story focuses on her wit and the power of her many personas as she evolved into a supremely competent ruler.  She showed the world that not only could a woman rule, she could reign.  So many memorable scenes.  Tom Hardy was the best casting choice to soften the strong portrayal of Elizabeth.  The scene where they were dancing, both in real time and in remembrance were so touching.  The laugh after she berated her council for relentless pursuing a &#34;match&#34;/stud for the succession, was probably my very favorite scene.
