In exchange for extraordinary powers, Dr. Parnassus (Plummer)makes a deal with the Devil to turn over any child of his when they turn sixteen. But as his daughter Valentina\u2019s (Lily Cole) birthday approaches, a mysterious stranger(Ledger) arrives with the power to change everything.

Though Anton pines for Valentina, she falls for the new fellow, who charms female viewers into opening up their wallets. Little do the ladies realize they risk their souls when they pass through the Imaginarium, a Mylar mirror that leads to alternate realities (where Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell play Tony\\'s doppelg\u00e4ngers). As it transpires, Parnassus made a Faustian bargain with Mr. Nick (Tom Waits, whom Gilliam considers \"America\\'s greatest musical poet\") centuries before and must supply Satan with five souls by Valentina\\'s 16th birthday or Nick will take her away from him--permanently.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThis individual's shopping behavior reveals a strong preference for movies, particularly in genres that encompass musicals, fantasy, and drama. They gravitate towards films with engaging narratives, often rooted in historical or imaginative themes, and show enthusiasm for productions featuring notable actors and directors. A consistent high rating reflects a positive sentiment toward quality storytelling and entertaining content, with average ratings primarily clustered between 4.5 and 5.0.\n\nThey exhibit a tendency to appreciate well-constructed plots that provoke emotional responses, indicating a desire for substance in film experiences rather than superficial entertainment. Quality appears to be prioritization over price, suggesting that they are less sensitive to cost, as long as the viewing experience meets their expectations.\n\nThe recurring inclusion of ratings that respond to unique, thought-provoking stories indicates a preference for films where character development and moral dilemmas are present. This consumer leans towards more mature content with advisory notes on violence and substance use, reflecting a willingness to engage with complex and possibly controversial themes. Overall, their core preferences center around high-quality films with rich narratives, memorable performances, and an inclination toward fantastical or serious storytelling.",
