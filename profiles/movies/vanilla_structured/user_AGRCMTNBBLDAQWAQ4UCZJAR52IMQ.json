Casting a giant shadow over all is a blood-soaked king, Gem Saloon owner Al Swearengen (Ian McShane), possibly the best, most complex, and mesmerizing villain seen on TV in years. Each of these characters, and many others, will forge alliances and feuds, cope with disasters (such as smallpox), and move--almost invisibly but inexorably--toward some semblance of order and common cause. Making it all worthwhile is Milch's masterful dialogue--often profane, sometimes courtly and civilized, never perfunctory--and the brilliant acting of the aforementioned performers plus others.\", '--Tom Keogh']\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Box set, Widescreen, Subtitled, Closed-captioned, Color, NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Ian McShane, Timothy Olyphant', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1), French (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo), Spanish (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo), Unqualified', 'Number Of Discs': '19', 'Runtime': '33 hours and 26 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.78:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.75 x 2 inches; 2 Pounds', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Box set, Widescreen, Subtitled, Closed-captioned, Color, NTSC', 'Run time': '33 hours and 26 minutes', 'Release date': 'December 9, 2008', 'Actors': 'Ian McShane, Timothy Olyphant', 'Subtitles': 'English', 'Studio': 'HBO Studios', 'Number of discs': '19'}\nReview Text: The Deadwood tv serial was a tremendous hit and we loved every episode so much that we jumped on the opportunity to own the entire series\nReview Title: love this\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: The Great Outdoors [DVD]\nReview Date: 2013/06/10\nStore: Dan Aykroyd  (Actor),     John Candy  (Actor),     Howard Deutch  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Action & Adventure\nProduct Description: ['When an unannounced, uninvited and unwelcome family of fun-loving misfits converge upon a lakeside resort to join their relatives for a summer of relaxation, the result is anything but restful in this raucous comedy starring Dan Aykroyd and John Candy.It\\'s a vacationer\\'s worst nightmare, as wheeler-dealer Aykroyd, his sexually repressed wife and eerie twin daughters \"join\" the easygoing Candy and his straight-laced clan for a season of \"fun\" in the sun.

It\\'s more than a chronicle of the hippie movement, however; this is a film of genuine historical and social importance, capturing the spirit of America in transition, when the Vietnam War was at its peak and antiwar protest was fully expressed through the liberating music of the time. With a brilliant crew at his disposal (including a young editor named Martin Scorsese), director Michael Wadleigh worked with over 300 hours of footage to create his original 225-minute director\\'s cut, which was cut by 40 minutes for the film\\'s release in 1970. Eight previously edited segments were restored in 1994, and the original director\\'s cut of Woodstock is now the version most commonly available on videotape and DVD. The film deservedly won the Academy Award for Best Documentary, and it\\'s still a stunning achievement. Abundant footage taken among the massive crowd (\"half a million strong\") expresses the human heart of the event, from skinny-dipping hippies to accidental overdoses, to unpredictable weather, midconcert childbirth, and the thoughtful (or just plain rambling) reflections of the festive participants. Then, of course, there is the music--a nonstop parade of rock & roll from the greatest performers of the period, including Crosby, Stills, and Nash, Canned Heat, The Who, Richie Havens, Joan Baez, Ten Years After, Sly & The Family Stone, Santana, and many more.

Casting a giant shadow over all is a blood-soaked king, Gem Saloon owner Al Swearengen (Ian McShane), possibly the best, most complex, and mesmerizing villain seen on TV in years. Each of these characters, and many others, will forge alliances and feuds, cope with disasters (such as smallpox), and move--almost invisibly but inexorably--toward some semblance of order and common cause.

It\\'s more than a chronicle of the hippie movement, however; this is a film of genuine historical and social importance, capturing the spirit of America in transition, when the Vietnam War was at its peak and antiwar protest was fully expressed through the liberating music of the time. With a brilliant crew at his disposal (including a young editor named Martin Scorsese), director Michael Wadleigh worked with over 300 hours of footage to create his original 225-minute director\\'s cut, which was cut by 40 minutes for the film\\'s release in 1970. Eight previously edited segments were restored in 1994, and the original director\\'s cut of Woodstock is now the version most commonly available on videotape and DVD. The film deservedly won the Academy Award for Best Documentary, and it\\'s still a stunning achievement. Abundant footage taken among the massive crowd (\"half a million strong\") expresses the human heart of the event, from skinny-dipping hippies to accidental overdoses, to unpredictable weather, midconcert childbirth, and the thoughtful (or just plain rambling) reflections of the festive participants. Then, of course, there is the music--a nonstop parade of rock & roll from the greatest performers of the period, including Crosby, Stills, and Nash, Canned Heat, The Who, Richie Havens, Joan Baez, Ten Years After, Sly & The Family Stone, Santana, and many more. Watching this ambitious film, as the saying goes, is the next best thing to being there--it\\'s a time-travel journey to that once-in-a-lifetime event. --', 'Jeff Shannon', 'Product Description', '1969 was a year unlike any other.

Casting a giant shadow over all is a blood-soaked king, Gem Saloon owner Al Swearengen (Ian McShane), possibly the best, most complex, and mesmerizing villain seen on TV in years. Each of these characters, and many others, will forge alliances and feuds, cope with disasters (such as smallpox), and move--almost invisibly but inexorably--toward some semblance of order and common cause.

It\\'s more than a chronicle of the hippie movement, however; this is a film of genuine historical and social importance, capturing the spirit of America in transition, when the Vietnam War was at its peak and antiwar protest was fully expressed through the liberating music of the time. With a brilliant crew at his disposal (including a young editor named Martin Scorsese), director Michael Wadleigh worked with over 300 hours of footage to create his original 225-minute director\\'s cut, which was cut by 40 minutes for the film\\'s release in 1970. Eight previously edited segments were restored in 1994, and the original director\\'s cut of Woodstock is now the version most commonly available on videotape and DVD. The film deservedly won the Academy Award for Best Documentary, and it\\'s still a stunning achievement. Abundant footage taken among the massive crowd (\"half a million strong\") expresses the human heart of the event, from skinny-dipping hippies to accidental overdoses, to unpredictable weather, midconcert childbirth, and the thoughtful (or just plain rambling) reflections of the festive participants. Then, of course, there is the music--a nonstop parade of rock & roll from the greatest performers of the period, including Crosby, Stills, and Nash, Canned Heat, The Who, Richie Havens, Joan Baez, Ten Years After, Sly & The Family Stone, Santana, and many more.
