  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe individual's purchase history reveals a distinct preference for comedic and family-oriented films, often appreciating content that combines humor with emotional depth. Recurrent 4 to 5-star ratings indicate a strong positive sentiment towards films that elicit laughter and heartfelt moments. \n\nThey gravitate towards materials that are either light-hearted or provide profound messaging, as seen in multiple reviews highlighting emotional themes, particularly in family settings. The user is sensitive to the quality of audio and overall production, noting issues like poor sound or gratuitous content, which influences their ratings negatively. This suggests a preference for well-produced movies with engaging storytelling.\n\nPrice sensitivity is less clearly defined but suggests a willingness to invest in films that deliver genuine enjoyment, contrasting with negative experiences leading to low ratings when expectations are not met. Furthermore, there is a clear inclination towards reviewing movies for their appropriateness for children, exhibiting a parental consideration in their choices.\n\nIn summary, the individual prefers humorous, touching, and family-friendly films, values high production quality, and demonstrates a parental mindset regarding content suitability, ultimately seeking enjoyment and meaningful connections through their viewing experiences.",

It is funny as all get out. It is  one of Lee Marvin's best performances ever. Clint Eastwood does a fine job. The side characters are great and again very funny. My aunt took me to see this movie when I was 18 years old and I laughed my self sick. There is nothing quite like this movie anywhere else and I would highly recommend it. If you love it as much as I do you will never regret seeing it and you will want to see it again and again.",
