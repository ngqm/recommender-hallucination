Billed as a special-effects comedy, the imaginative film (the top box-office smash of 1985) has staying power because of the heart behind Zemeckis and Bob Gale's script. High schooler Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox, during the height of his TV success) is catapulted back to the '50s where he sees his parents in their teens, and accidentally changes the history of how Mom and Dad met.

Much of the inside stuff is repeated in the various pieces, but that's to be expected with such exhaustive materials. Michael J. Fox chimes in with a video commentary presented in a picture-in-picture format (which would have worked better as a straight interview) and the producers tackle the main commentary track, but the highlight audio commentary is a free-flowing Q&A with Gale and director Robert Zemeckis in front of a USC film-school audience.

This DVD is probably the best quality DVD to date.  Great for showing off a high quality home theater.  Since the movie was shot on digital film, there was almost no ghosting or image quality lost.<br />Now the negatives:<br />What made the original Star Wars movies so spectatular was their campy dialog, fake but realistic special effects (even though you knew it was a fake spaceship you still knew it was a picture of a real model).  The older Star Wars films were mostly a tribute to the cheesey sci-fi movies of the 50's and 60's.  A true space opera, they were classics.<br />Episode II relies mostly on the impressive special effects to mesmerize and entertain.  Acting and story are second to this.  The totally cardboard acting of Haeden Christianson is so bad, that it makes you wonder if he should play an emotionally repressed andriod instead of the future Darth Vader. It made me miss Jar Jar.<br />Oustanding special effects that circumvent the rest of the movie.  This movie seems to be made mostly just to fill a quota and to set up the clearly superior episodes 3-6.  Makes you sad to see a performer past his prime, and Star Wars is way past its prime.\nReview Title: George Lucas has lost his mind.\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Widescreen Edition)\nReview Date: 2003/04/24\nStore: Daniel Radcliffe  (Actor),     Rupert Grint  (Actor),     Chris Columbus  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Characters & Series, Harry Potter, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\nProduct Description: ['Product Description', 'The next installment in the Harry Potter series finds young wizard Harry Potter (DANIEL RADCLIFFE) and his friends Ron Weasley (RUPERT GRINT) and Hermione Granger (EMMA WATSON) facing new challenges during their second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as they try to uncover a dark force that is terrorizing the school.', 'HARRY POTTER characters, names, and related indicia are trademarks of and (c) Warner Bros.

Since this book was slightly longer than the first, some parts had to be cut from the movie.  These cuts were actually filmed as \"additional scenes\", and are included on the second bonus disk.<br />The image and sound quality is very good especially since a lot of the movie is shot in darker lit areas.  The special effects which looked lower budget in the first movie actually shine in this film.  The scenes of Quidditch will be right up there from action scenes from great sports movies.

From what I have seen of Spiderman comis this does do a good job staying true to the spirit of the comics.<br />So many movies today rely too heavily on special effects. This is definately one of those.  Plot exposition and character development come second to displaying great, though overused CGI graphics.<br />The CGI spiderman jumps from building to building with reckless disregard for any sence of physics of laws of gravity.  It looks too fake.  You know he's a superhero, but still it looks too cartoonish.<br />Kirsten Dunst looks great as Mary Jane and Tobey Maguire does a great job as Peter Parker.<br />If you are a fan of comics and comics turned movies this is a must see, otherwise it probably won't be worth seeing.\nReview Title: Overrated film.

Though this may be true in some regards, the majority of the people who fought in this war fought for other reasons, whether it was for state's rights, protecting their homeland, or because they were asked to.  To understand this, you can better appreciate the sacrafice soldiers on both sides had to endure, and this movie captures that idea.<br />There are plenty of extras on this 1 disk DVD, from documentaries on the making of the film, to an interesting biography of Thomas Jackson.  Very interesting is the slave perspective, with viewpoints from the actors who played Martha and Jim, two prominant slave characters in the movie.

Continually contradictory, the common thesis that the lack of social programs in this country contribute to gun violence.<br />Michael Moore uses sappy music, and saavy editing to pull at the heartstrings while totally disregarding facts.<br />One such misleading fact is the number of gun murders he states.  While our gun deaths are much higher than countries like Germany, France, or Canada, it is actually smaller per capita according to FBI statistics.<br />Also, he takes only homicides for countries like Germany and Canada, but lumps justifiable shootings (cops shooting bad guys), and accidental deaths for the United States.<br />He blames the United State's welfare to work program for the shooting death of 8 year old Kayla Rolland by a classmate. He says the welfare to work program made the shooter's mother work, instead of stay home with her child.<br />He fails to point out that the boy lived in a known crackhouse, where numerous weapons were readily available along with drugs and passed-out drug addicts.<br />These are two of dozens of facts that mislead.

Congress sends Franklin to France in an effort to secure an alliance with England's rival; Franklin's political skills help him coax the French to support the American cause, leading to final American victory at Yorktown.

Richard Easton does a fantastic job portraying Franklin and the cast does well acting out actual correspondences and written first hand accounts from the time.<br /><br />The film is broken down into three segments showing the life of Franklin. Let the Experiment Be Made, The Making of a Revolutionary, and The Chessmaster.<br /><br />Let the experiment be made shows the early life of Franklin, how a genius was made and his contributions to science.<br /><br />The Making of a Revolutionary shows how a man who once considered himself a loyalist became a fierce proponent of independence.<br /><br />The Chessmaster detailed his years in France gaining support for the war, the treaty of France, and the building of the American Experiment in democracy.<br /><br />Ultimately this film does a great job portraying Franklin as a man.  Sometimes flawed, as we all are, but a man who contributed so many things to making America what we know today.<br />It does it with wit, humor, and narration that moves quick and keeps you interested.\nReview Title: Near perfect account of an American Icon\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Team Baby: Baby Nittany Lion [DVD]\nReview Date: 2008/04/26\nStore: Baby Nittany Lion-Penn State University-Raising to  (Actor),     Wyatt Cagle  (Director)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Kids & Family\nProduct Description: [\"You love your kids, you love your family and you love your Nittany Lions!

High schooler Marty McFly (Michael J.

Much of the inside stuff is repeated in the various pieces, but that's to be expected with such exhaustive materials. Michael J. Fox chimes in with a video commentary presented in a picture-in-picture format (which would have worked better as a straight interview) and the producers tackle the main commentary track, but the highlight audio commentary is a free-flowing Q&A with Gale and director Robert Zemeckis in front of a USC film-school audience.

This DVD is probably the best quality DVD to date.  Great for showing off a high quality home theater.  Since the movie was shot on digital film, there was almost no ghosting or image quality lost.<br />Now the negatives:<br />What made the original Star Wars movies so spectatular was their campy dialog, fake but realistic special effects (even though you knew it was a fake spaceship you still knew it was a picture of a real model).  The older Star Wars films were mostly a tribute to the cheesey sci-fi movies of the 50's and 60's.  A true space opera, they were classics.<br />Episode II relies mostly on the impressive special effects to mesmerize and entertain.  Acting and story are second to this.  The totally cardboard acting of Haeden Christianson is so bad, that it makes you wonder if he should play an emotionally repressed andriod instead of the future Darth Vader. It made me miss Jar Jar.<br />Oustanding special effects that circumvent the rest of the movie.  This movie seems to be made mostly just to fill a quota and to set up the clearly superior episodes 3-6.  Makes you sad to see a performer past his prime, and Star Wars is way past its prime.\nGeorge Lucas has lost his mind.\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Widescreen Edition)\nDaniel Radcliffe  (Actor),     Rupert Grint  (Actor),     Chris Columbus  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Characters & Series, Harry Potter, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\n['Product Description', 'The next installment in the Harry Potter series finds young wizard Harry Potter (DANIEL RADCLIFFE) and his friends Ron Weasley (RUPERT GRINT) and Hermione Granger (EMMA WATSON) facing new challenges during their second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as they try to uncover a dark force that is terrorizing the school.', 'HARRY POTTER characters, names, and related indicia are trademarks of and (c) Warner Bros.

From what I have seen of Spiderman comis this does do a good job staying true to the spirit of the comics.<br />So many movies today rely too heavily on special effects. This is definately one of those.  Plot exposition and character development come second to displaying great, though overused CGI graphics.<br />The CGI spiderman jumps from building to building with reckless disregard for any sence of physics of laws of gravity.  It looks too fake.  You know he's a superhero, but still it looks too cartoonish.<br />Kirsten Dunst looks great as Mary Jane and Tobey Maguire does a great job as Peter Parker.<br />If you are a fan of comics and comics turned movies this is a must see, otherwise it probably won't be worth seeing.\nOverrated film.

Though this may be true in some regards, the majority of the people who fought in this war fought for other reasons, whether it was for state's rights, protecting their homeland, or because they were asked to.  To understand this, you can better appreciate the sacrafice soldiers on both sides had to endure, and this movie captures that idea.<br />There are plenty of extras on this 1 disk DVD, from documentaries on the making of the film, to an interesting biography of Thomas Jackson.

Continually contradictory, the common thesis that the lack of social programs in this country contribute to gun violence.<br />Michael Moore uses sappy music, and saavy editing to pull at the heartstrings while totally disregarding facts.<br />One such misleading fact is the number of gun murders he states.  While our gun deaths are much higher than countries like Germany, France, or Canada, it is actually smaller per capita according to FBI statistics.<br />Also, he takes only homicides for countries like Germany and Canada, but lumps justifiable shootings (cops shooting bad guys), and accidental deaths for the United States.<br />He blames the United State's welfare to work program for the shooting death of 8 year old Kayla Rolland by a classmate. He says the welfare to work program made the shooter's mother work, instead of stay home with her child.<br />He fails to point out that the boy lived in a known crackhouse, where numerous weapons were readily available along with drugs and passed-out drug addicts.<br />These are two of dozens of facts that mislead.

Richard Easton does a fantastic job portraying Franklin and the cast does well acting out actual correspondences and written first hand accounts from the time.<br /><br />The film is broken down into three segments showing the life of Franklin. Let the Experiment Be Made, The Making of a Revolutionary, and The Chessmaster.<br /><br />Let the experiment be made shows the early life of Franklin, how a genius was made and his contributions to science.<br /><br />The Making of a Revolutionary shows how a man who once considered himself a loyalist became a fierce proponent of independence.<br /><br />The Chessmaster detailed his years in France gaining support for the war, the treaty of France, and the building of the American Experiment in democracy.<br /><br />Ultimately this film does a great job portraying Franklin as a man.

Both new and original materials are included in the plethora of extras, starting with two sets of making-of documentaries.

Producer-writer Bob Gale is the star of the extra features, candidly presenting the original ideas and many deleted scenes (a few with doses of crude humor). Much of the inside stuff is repeated in the various pieces, but that's to be expected with such exhaustive materials. Michael J. Fox chimes in with a video commentary presented in a picture-in-picture format (which would have worked better as a straight interview) and the producers tackle the main commentary track, but the highlight audio commentary is a free-flowing Q&A with Gale and director Robert Zemeckis in front of a USC film-school audience.

This DVD is probably the best quality DVD to date.  Great for showing off a high quality home theater.  Since the movie was shot on digital film, there was almost no ghosting or image quality lost.<br />Now the negatives:<br />What made the original Star Wars movies so spectatular was their campy dialog, fake but realistic special effects (even though you knew it was a fake spaceship you still knew it was a picture of a real model).  The older Star Wars films were mostly a tribute to the cheesey sci-fi movies of the 50's and 60's.  A true space opera, they were classics.<br />Episode II relies mostly on the impressive special effects to mesmerize and entertain.  Acting and story are second to this.  The totally cardboard acting of Haeden Christianson is so bad, that it makes you wonder if he should play an emotionally repressed andriod instead of the future Darth Vader. It made me miss Jar Jar.<br />Oustanding special effects that circumvent the rest of the movie.  This movie seems to be made mostly just to fill a quota and to set up the clearly superior episodes 3-6.  Makes you sad to see a performer past his prime, and Star Wars is way past its prime.\nReview Title: George Lucas has lost his mind.\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Widescreen Edition)\nReview Date: 2003/04/24\nStore: Daniel Radcliffe  (Actor),     Rupert Grint  (Actor),     Chris Columbus  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Characters & Series, Harry Potter, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\nProduct Description: ['Product Description', 'The next installment in the Harry Potter series finds young wizard Harry Potter (DANIEL RADCLIFFE) and his friends Ron Weasley (RUPERT GRINT) and Hermione Granger (EMMA WATSON) facing new challenges during their second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as they try to uncover a dark force that is terrorizing the school.', 'HARRY POTTER characters, names, and related indicia are trademarks of and (c) Warner Bros.

Since this book was slightly longer than the first, some parts had to be cut from the movie.

From what I have seen of Spiderman comis this does do a good job staying true to the spirit of the comics.<br />So many movies today rely too heavily on special effects. This is definately one of those.  Plot exposition and character development come second to displaying great, though overused CGI graphics.<br />The CGI spiderman jumps from building to building with reckless disregard for any sence of physics of laws of gravity.  It looks too fake.  You know he's a superhero, but still it looks too cartoonish.<br />Kirsten Dunst looks great as Mary Jane and Tobey Maguire does a great job as Peter Parker.<br />If you are a fan of comics and comics turned movies this is a must see, otherwise it probably won't be worth seeing.\nReview Title: Overrated film.

Though this may be true in some regards, the majority of the people who fought in this war fought for other reasons, whether it was for state's rights, protecting their homeland, or because they were asked to.  To understand this, you can better appreciate the sacrafice soldiers on both sides had to endure, and this movie captures that idea.<br />There are plenty of extras on this 1 disk DVD, from documentaries on the making of the film, to an interesting biography of Thomas Jackson.  Very interesting is the slave perspective, with viewpoints from the actors who played Martha and Jim, two prominant slave characters in the movie.

While our gun deaths are much higher than countries like Germany, France, or Canada, it is actually smaller per capita according to FBI statistics.<br />Also, he takes only homicides for countries like Germany and Canada, but lumps justifiable shootings (cops shooting bad guys), and accidental deaths for the United States.<br />He blames the United State's welfare to work program for the shooting death of 8 year old Kayla Rolland by a classmate. He says the welfare to work program made the shooter's mother work, instead of stay home with her child.<br />He fails to point out that the boy lived in a known crackhouse, where numerous weapons were readily available along with drugs and passed-out drug addicts.<br />These are two of dozens of facts that mislead.

I would liked to have seen some audio commentary though.\nReview Title: A must for the Railfans, kids, and transpotters\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2013/04/03\nAverage Rating: 3.9\nProduct Details: {'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Rodney Ascher'], 'Producers': ['Tim Kirk'], 'Starring': ['Bill Blakemore', 'Geoffrey Cocks', 'Juli Kearns'], 'Studio': ['IFC Films', 'AMC Plus Documentaries']}\nReview Text: I was hoping this movie would be a serious look at the symbolism and making of The Shining. Instead it is a poorly made and laughable look at the ideas of numerous crackpots who think cans of baking soda are references to genocide.<br /><br />Basically the film makers spliced together B-roll from other movies, dubbed over tinny recorded interviews of crackpots and made a movie. The opinions and ideas from those interviewed are similar to what you would find in a south philly bar at 3pm.<br /><br />Unwatchable...\nReview Title: Poorly done, boring, interviewees are crazy\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2013/04/03\nAverage Rating: 4.9\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Euros Lyn', 'Paul McGuigan'], 'Producers': ['Sue Vertue', 'Beryl Vertue', 'Steven Moffat', 'Mark Gatiss', 'Rebecca Eaton', 'Bethan Jones'], 'Starring': ['Benedict Cumberbatch', 'Martin Freeman'], 'Studio': ['BBC America']}\nReview Text: I finally watched Sherlock, and I am hooked. From the first episode, I am a big fan. The first story is so well done, characters are written perfectly, acting is superb, and the way they illustrate the way Sherlock's mind works with superimposed text is a stroke of genious. The first episode is written by Stephen Moffet, so fans of Doctor Who can relate to the quality and depth of the story telling. Masterfully done on all levels. Not a bad episode in either season (Series)\nReview Title: Fantastic story, writing, it will suck you in!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2018/07/13\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Martha Coolidge'], 'Producers': ['Brian Grazer'], 'Starring': ['Val Kilmer', 'Gabe Jarret', 'William Atherton'], 'Studio': ['COLUMBIA']}\nReview Text: Moles and Trolls Moles and Trolls.

Excellently narrated, and well put together this is the gold standard of documentaries on the subject.<br /><br />Unlike more modern documentaries that have new graphics and re creations, this is almost entirely made of archival footage and film reels.  This makes it somuch better in my opinion\nReview Title: One of the best documentaries on WW2\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n    Structure your response as:\n   \n    SUMMARY:\n    [Final synthesis of preferences and patterns]",
