As a result, she was made to waste her life in a madhouse, with the staff believing she had killed her baby.  After 50 years, the tale is finally revealed in a truth that could have given her a joyful life...but didn't until the very end.\nReview Title: Wonderful plot, portrayed by acting in which each character had a deeply developed character and personality.\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2018/07/09\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Kenneth Branagh'], 'Producers': ['Ridley Scott', 'Mark Gordon', 'Simon Kinberg', 'Kenneth Branagh', 'Judy Hofflund', 'Michael Schaefer'], 'Starring': ['Kenneth Branagh', 'Pen\u00e9lope Cruz', 'Johnny Depp'], 'Studio': ['Kinberg Genre;The Mark Gordon Company;Scott Free']}\nReview Text: What can I say.  When compared to the Albert Finney version a few decades ago, this one doesn't leave the starting gate.  For starters, the Finney version built a depth of atmosphere within the first five minutes.  When Branagh appears, and although he is a fine actor, I had to laugh at his handlebar mustache, it was that comical.  None of the other actors in this version have the verve of the first one.  Sorry I paid to buy this to keep in my Amazon Video Library, but I was curious -- and sadly disappointed.\nReview Title: Don't bother unless you are prepared to be unimpressed.\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2018/08/07\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Producers': ['Gennifer Hutchison', 'Thomas Schnauz', 'Melissa Bernstein', 'Mark Johnson', 'Vince Gilligan', 'Peter Gould'], 'Studio': ['American Movie Classics (AMC)']}\nReview Text: I realize the writers have to lay a foundation and that's what they are doing.  The acting has not diminished.  I love all the characters, even Howard, who tends to be a jerk, but you have to have a bad guy, otherwise there is no tension.  I felt sorry for Jimmy when he heard Howard reading all of Chuck's outstanding accomplishments, his schooling, community service, debate team, etc.  I'm sure that made Jimmy feel pretty small in contrast.\nReview Title: Season 4, Episode 1 a little slow moving\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2019/07/24\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Leslie Iwerks'], 'Producers': ['Leslie Iwerks'], 'Starring': ['Kelsey Grammer', 'Roy Disney', 'Chuck Jones'], 'Studio': ['Walt Disney Pictures']}\nReview Text: I have read several books and bios about Walt Disney and watched many filmed biographies of him.  While all mention Ub Iwerks, he is usually given only \"byline\" status.  This is a wonderful biography about a man who was not only an artist, but a remarkable engineer as well.  IF you watch this, keep in mind throughout that Mr. Iwerks was forced to quit school at the age of 14.  Disney, himself a determined genius, must have recognized that Mr. Iwerks was also his intellectual and creative equal and much like him.  I'm glad his granddaughter has given him a place among the Disney family and it is no less than fitting that he deserves to be recognized.\nReview Title: Masterful documentary and a must for all Disney fans\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2019/08/28\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Studio': ['CBS']}\nReview Text: Fabulous storylines with great period sets and costumes.

A couple of scenes just stupid, like Phoenix laying down next to a guy while he's dying.
