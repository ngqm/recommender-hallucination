If you actually respect him, avoid this film at all costs.  If Christ's life prior to the crucifixion is missing, then the story is pointless.  His great lessons are missing.  The sermon on the mount is reduced to one line.  And the most important point is missing -- CHRIST CHOSE THE CROSS.  Here, he is portrayed as a victim, dragged around by the jew-mob (there isn't a character there, just a mass-mob) completely unable to do a thing.  The focus isn't on Christ's message, love, pacificm, or teachings, it's a sensationalist view of his suffering, which doesn't fit well with the Christ story.\nReview Title: An affront to Christ\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Yu-Gi-Oh! // Movie - Capsule Monsters / Part 1 [DVD]\nReview Date: 2006/06/08\nStore: *  (Actor, Director)    Rated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Science Fiction, Animation\nProduct Description: ['Saving the world from destruction week after week is not an easy task, so when Joey wins an exotic trip for four, Yugi and his friends decide to take a much needed vacation\\x85or so they think!

The pacing is perfect.  The story is perfect.  The characters--well you know the characters.  The puzzles are great.  The only tiny thing missing was Kaiba.  As much as the original series was super fantastic wonderful, this one takes it up a notch.  I rented it and now I'm buying two copies.  I'm floored by what a good job they did.  The theatrical release has nothing on this.  This is what should have been in the movies.  This is good.  Buy it.  Watch it a dozen times.

He wants to train to fight dragons himself, but he's a skinny little boy, barely suited to the task.<br /><br />When he finally does get his chance to kill a dragon, he learns very little is what it first seems, and that is true of himself as much as it is true about the dragons.<br /><br />Thematically, this is about acceptance, and self-acceptance.  It's about using one's unique skills to succeed.  It's about looking deaper for the truth.<br /><br />In tone, it's hillarious.  One character, on speaking of why they're going to hunt dragons, says \"We're vikings.  It's an occupational hazzard.\"  It's suited to small children, even sensitive small children.

Each of the workouts automatically adjusts itself to your level as your form improves.  Lengthen and Strengthen reminds me of dance class more than yoga.

The voice actors are the same, and great as always.<br /><br />Tiger is again the underestimated clown who wins more by grit and determination than raw power. Barnaby is still the cool, collected one who has more heart than he shows.<br /><br />Bison is played the fool a little more in this one, taking a role once reserved for Origami Cyclone, who in turn has shown tremendous growth as a result of the events of the first series. Dragon Kid and Blue Rose are a little underused -- fair enough given it's a movie, with the tune limits that implies. Fire Emblem gets some intense moments. He has a wonderful line, &#34;If a man is made of courage and a woman is made of love, gay people must be invincible.&#34; This might have been more impressive if he weren't knocked flat moments later.<br /><br />I really hope this means they're relaunching the series.

They follow the same patterns of searching for clues online and nothing is what it seems. They are both the kind of movie you watch twice in a row, once to experience the story, the second time with the benefit of hindsight to see the clues for what they really are. There are a few that should have been clearly false, based on other information that came earlier (a thing related to her allowance, it will make sense at the time).<br /><br />At its most basic, this is the story of a girl who\u2019s gone missing. Her father and the police try to find her, and her dad tries to follow the digital trail. All mysteries have a good supply of red herrings, but these are so perfect, so misinterpreted and re-misinterpreted and so organic to the story it\u2019s masterful.<br /><br />Stylistically, I liked the grainy SD segments where we\u2019re watching the events through an in-story low-grade camera. It was both more immersive (it should have looked like that) and yet it called attention to itself because SD is so far in our collective rear view.<br /><br />As we dig deeper into the story, no one and nothing is what it first seems. The narrative style is such that only a little information comes through at a time and it keeps the viewer delightfully off balance the entire time. The most insignificant details mean so much at the end.<br /><br /> It hits some beautiful points with social media where everyone is wearing a mask, either to get attention or to hide an ugly soul behind, and in one case to capitalize on the father\u2019s tragedy. It hits some beautiful points as well. Emotionally, this is a roller coaster.<br /><br />Watch this with friends who are game to pause the video and check the details on the screen. There is so much that flies right by. It\u2019s brilliant.<br /><br />The only thing I don\u2019t like, is that so many details happen visually, and this movie requires such close attention, it\u2019s a poor choice to watch while knitting.\nReview Title: A masterpiece in writing and execution\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

It's about using one's unique skills to succeed.  It's about looking deaper for the truth.<br /><br />In tone, it's hillarious.

Shot in a picturesque garden overlooking the Pacific Ocean, the standing Burn & Firm program is designed to elevate your heart rate as is tones your upper body, lifts your seat, shapes your legs and strengthens your core. It starts with isometric conditioning using small controlled movements and then layers on larger low impact moves designed to build heat with a vigorous flow. This combination will help increase your energy level and sculpt the slim, well-proportioned physique (or silhouette) of a dancer. The Lengthen & Strengthen program is a dynamic combination of standing bare work and floor work focused on tightening and toning very precisely targeted areas to create a balanced body that is long, strong and lean.']\n{'Genre': 'Exercise & fitness - barre method, Exercise & fitness - barre method', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Sadie Lincoln, Andrea Ambandos', 'Language': 'English', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 9 minutes', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'Unrated (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 2.08 Ounces', 'Audio Description': 'English', 'Item model number': '28125333', 'Director': 'Andrea Ambandos', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Run time': '1 hour and 9 minutes', 'Release date': 'December 3, 2013', 'Actors': 'Sadie Lincoln', 'Studio': 'Lionsgate', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nThere are two workouts on this video.

The voice actors are the same, and great as always.<br /><br />Tiger is again the underestimated clown who wins more by grit and determination than raw power. Barnaby is still the cool, collected one who has more heart than he shows.<br /><br />Bison is played the fool a little more in this one, taking a role once reserved for Origami Cyclone, who in turn has shown tremendous growth as a result of the events of the first series. Dragon Kid and Blue Rose are a little underused -- fair enough given it's a movie, with the tune limits that implies. Fire Emblem gets some intense moments. He has a wonderful line, &#34;If a man is made of courage and a woman is made of love, gay people must be invincible.&#34; This might have been more impressive if he weren't knocked flat moments later.<br /><br />I really hope this means they're relaunching the series.

They follow the same patterns of searching for clues online and nothing is what it seems. They are both the kind of movie you watch twice in a row, once to experience the story, the second time with the benefit of hindsight to see the clues for what they really are. There are a few that should have been clearly false, based on other information that came earlier (a thing related to her allowance, it will make sense at the time).<br /><br />At its most basic, this is the story of a girl who\u2019s gone missing. Her father and the police try to find her, and her dad tries to follow the digital trail. All mysteries have a good supply of red herrings, but these are so perfect, so misinterpreted and re-misinterpreted and so organic to the story it\u2019s masterful.<br /><br />Stylistically, I liked the grainy SD segments where we\u2019re watching the events through an in-story low-grade camera. It was both more immersive (it should have looked like that) and yet it called attention to itself because SD is so far in our collective rear view.<br /><br />As we dig deeper into the story, no one and nothing is what it first seems. The narrative style is such that only a little information comes through at a time and it keeps the viewer delightfully off balance the entire time. The most insignificant details mean so much at the end.<br /><br /> It hits some beautiful points with social media where everyone is wearing a mask, either to get attention or to hide an ugly soul behind, and in one case to capitalize on the father\u2019s tragedy. It hits some beautiful points as well. Emotionally, this is a roller coaster.<br /><br />Watch this with friends who are game to pause the video and check the details on the screen. There is so much that flies right by. It\u2019s brilliant.<br /><br />The only thing I don\u2019t like, is that so many details happen visually, and this movie requires such close attention, it\u2019s a poor choice to watch while knitting.\nA masterpiece in writing and execution",

If you actually respect him, avoid this film at all costs.  If Christ's life prior to the crucifixion is missing, then the story is pointless.  His great lessons are missing.  The sermon on the mount is reduced to one line.  And the most important point is missing -- CHRIST CHOSE THE CROSS.  Here, he is portrayed as a victim, dragged around by the jew-mob (there isn't a character there, just a mass-mob) completely unable to do a thing.

He wants to train to fight dragons himself, but he's a skinny little boy, barely suited to the task.<br /><br />When he finally does get his chance to kill a dragon, he learns very little is what it first seems, and that is true of himself as much as it is true about the dragons.<br /><br />Thematically, this is about acceptance, and self-acceptance.  It's about using one's unique skills to succeed.  It's about looking deaper for the truth.<br /><br />In tone, it's hillarious.  One character, on speaking of why they're going to hunt dragons, says \"We're vikings.  It's an occupational hazzard.\"  It's suited to small children, even sensitive small children.

This combination will help increase your energy level and sculpt the slim, well-proportioned physique (or silhouette) of a dancer.

Burn and Firm is focused on conditioning the body through a tightly controlled isometric workout.  You won't find complex choreography work here.  You won't find &#34;tie yourself in a human knot&#34; type yoga poses.  You will find a really solid workout that leaves you feeling it the next day.  Each of the workouts automatically adjusts itself to your level as your form improves.  Lengthen and Strengthen reminds me of dance class more than yoga.

The voice actors are the same, and great as always.<br /><br />Tiger is again the underestimated clown who wins more by grit and determination than raw power. Barnaby is still the cool, collected one who has more heart than he shows.<br /><br />Bison is played the fool a little more in this one, taking a role once reserved for Origami Cyclone, who in turn has shown tremendous growth as a result of the events of the first series. Dragon Kid and Blue Rose are a little underused -- fair enough given it's a movie, with the tune limits that implies. Fire Emblem gets some intense moments. He has a wonderful line, &#34;If a man is made of courage and a woman is made of love, gay people must be invincible.&#34; This might have been more impressive if he weren't knocked flat moments later.<br /><br />I really hope this means they're relaunching the series.

They follow the same patterns of searching for clues online and nothing is what it seems. They are both the kind of movie you watch twice in a row, once to experience the story, the second time with the benefit of hindsight to see the clues for what they really are. There are a few that should have been clearly false, based on other information that came earlier (a thing related to her allowance, it will make sense at the time).<br /><br />At its most basic, this is the story of a girl who\u2019s gone missing. Her father and the police try to find her, and her dad tries to follow the digital trail. All mysteries have a good supply of red herrings, but these are so perfect, so misinterpreted and re-misinterpreted and so organic to the story it\u2019s masterful.<br /><br />Stylistically, I liked the grainy SD segments where we\u2019re watching the events through an in-story low-grade camera. It was both more immersive (it should have looked like that) and yet it called attention to itself because SD is so far in our collective rear view.<br /><br />As we dig deeper into the story, no one and nothing is what it first seems. The narrative style is such that only a little information comes through at a time and it keeps the viewer delightfully off balance the entire time. The most insignificant details mean so much at the end.<br /><br /> It hits some beautiful points with social media where everyone is wearing a mask, either to get attention or to hide an ugly soul behind, and in one case to capitalize on the father\u2019s tragedy. It hits some beautiful points as well. Emotionally, this is a roller coaster.<br /><br />Watch this with friends who are game to pause the video and check the details on the screen. There is so much that flies right by. It\u2019s brilliant.<br /><br />The only thing I don\u2019t like, is that so many details happen visually, and this movie requires such close attention, it\u2019s a poor choice to watch while knitting.\nReview Title: A masterpiece in writing and execution\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n    Structure your response as:\n   \n    SUMMARY:\n    [Final synthesis of preferences and patterns]",

    "text": "This is pure fun.<br /><br />In the opening, this cranks up the ridiculous past anywhere it was in the original cartoon. Before the opening credits roll Shaggy locks a door with four or five locks, then opens a door across the way, sees a monster, turns and tries to pull the door he just locked open without unlocking it. Then he turns to the left and runs out an open archway into the hallway. That entire opening sequence, aside from being hilarious, sets up the \u201cmonsters are always fake\u201d pathway.<br /><br />We move to Daphne in her modern world on a television interview talking about changing her career to a reporter for a show called \u201cCoast to Coast with Daphne Blake\u201d and get all the needed backstory on how the team split up, sans her and Fred (and, one presumes, Shaggy and Scooby), how she got bored with all the monsters and ghosts always being fake (ruh roh, foreshadowing) and what tone we might expect from the rest of the movie. From there it\u2019s the traditional \u201cget the gang back together and let\u2019s go solve a mystery\u201d motif. This sets up the \u201cthis time the monsters are real\u201d pathway.<br /><br />The movie could follow either path. I\u2019m not saying which it does.<br /><br />This appeals on multiple fronts. First, for fans of the original wanting more of what they fell in love with, the antics (some dive right into Loony Toons territory) the goofy traps, the dynamic of the team, this has it. At its core, that\u2019s what this is (whacky chase scenes to music and all).<br /><br />Fans of the newer versions who like the more take a step back look at their world and their place in it, there is plenty of that here, particularly in the music (The Ghost is Here) and the jokes (stale Scooby Snax \u2013 that is how it\u2019s spelled on the box). At one point Shaggy unpacks a suitcase filled with identical green shirts. The two elements balance and compliment each other quite well.<br /><br />For an old movie, this still holds up. The video is great for a cartoon, even if in a square, not wide-screen format because of its age, and the sound quality, while stereo not surround sound, is excellent. If you\u2019re going to watch the 2019 Return to Zombie Island, it\u2019s definitely worth watching this first as that is a direct sequel to this.",
