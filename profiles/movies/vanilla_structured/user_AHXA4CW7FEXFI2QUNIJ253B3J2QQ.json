  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:  \nThe individual's purchase history reveals a strong preference for high-quality adaptations of classic literature, yet a notable dissatisfaction with recent interpretations and remakes. They consistently rate products with critical sentiments, reflecting a desire for authentic storytelling over modern reboots, and express disappointment when such adaptations fail to capture the original's essence. A recurring theme is their appreciation for character-driven narratives, particularly those set in historical contexts, with an inclination towards drama.\n\nQuality preferences lean towards well-crafted productions, as evidenced by higher ratings for meticulously executed works, while they show sensitivity to perceived poor execution, such as excessive or irritating dialogue. The critic's engagement suggests they value innovative storytelling, but are highly critical of mediocrity, especially in adaptations of beloved works. Their purchasing behavior indicates selective choices, favoring critically acclaimed genres yet expressing strong disapproval when expectations are unmet.\n\nIn summary, this individual demonstrates a complex relationship with film and television, balancing high expectations for fidelity to source material with a disdain for derivative content, while favoring well-produced, character-centric drama.",

Nor do they make a good story. Actually.... there was no story. I watched half the movie and half of that on fast forward because it was so insipid. And I still was able to follow the shallow plot.<br />The acting was aweful. Two sisters with two different accents. The Irish one sounded scrottish half the time and hysterical the rest.<br />The French man lost his accent completely for a while.<br />It was all so disjointed.<br />I thought oh maybe someone's idea of an art film? But nope just someone trying too hard to be just like..... trying too hard to make it into a league they just aren't in.<br />Who directed this waste of celluloid?<br />I loved the landscape shots, but it seemed they were randomly thrown in every tine the director didn't know where to go next.<br />What a waste.",
