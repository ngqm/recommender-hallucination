    "text": "This miniseries was an extremely eye opening look into the terrible tragedy. I remembered when it happened but I had no idea of the devastation that followed. It also answered many questions I had about Chernobyl. I recommend this miniseries to anybody who wants to know or understand the truth & pain that happened. I had to buy it so I could go back & make sure I didn't miss anything.",
