  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:  \nThe purchasing patterns reveal a consumer who tends toward emotionally resonant narratives, as indicated by high ratings for heartwarming stories and strong character-driven plots, reflecting a preference for engaging, thoughtful films. However, sentiment analysis indicates significant disappointment with poorly executed storylines, as evidenced by low ratings for films perceived as lacking depth or originality. Themes such as family dynamics, personal struggles, and social commentary recur frequently in their choices.\n\nQuality preferences lean towards high-production-value content, including well-known directors and actors, which suggests a tendency to favor reputable cinematic works. At the same time, the consumer exhibits sensitivity to narrative construction, favoring stories that avoid clich\u00e9s and that provide rewarding or uplifting experiences.\n\nPrice sensitivity is not explicitly discernible from the available data, but the consumer appears willing to invest in films that promise quality and emotional depth while being critical of those that do not meet these expectations. Overall, this individual prioritizes compelling storytelling and strong emotional arcs, demonstrating a clear aversion to mediocrity in film, while also recognizing and appreciating the occasional value in mainstream successes.",
