When Carly gets in trouble at school for posting an unflattering flyer of her teacher, her punishment is to record the school talent show auditions and post them online. As it turns out, Carly is innocent and was just covering for her best friend Sam, who really posted the flyer, so it's only fair that Sam join her in her punishment. Freddie, who has a huge crush on Carly and just happens to be a tech wizard, also decides to join them and help tape the auditions. The somewhat painful experience inspires the three teens to wish for an opportunity to produce their own show and determine their own programming--an idea that soon blossoms into a plan for a weekly web show. Since Carly's dad is stationed overseas in Europe, her 26-year-old brother Spencer, who's a rather unconventional artist and an even flakier authority figure, is in charge and he gives them the go-ahead. Soon the three teens are regularly hanging out in Carly and Spencer's apartment, eating everything in sight, producing their weekly web show, and gawking at whatever unusual sculpture Spencer happens to be working on at the moment. Things are never dull as Carly and her friends work to increase viewership. They pursue a write-up on an influential Internet site run by a very unusual tyrant, broadcast from a haunted apartment on Halloween, pay back a mean teacher by making a fool of her online, and set a world record for the longest continuous webcast. And then there's all the usual high school drama, like figuring out who to date, what to do for a science project, and how to get good grades--by any means.

Once more buried under mounds of latex, Albert Finney is perfection itself as Ebeneezer Scrooge, proving as effective as a young (un-made up) man as the old skinflint we\\'ve grown to love. The Three Ghosts who turn the miserly Scrooge\\'s life around on Christmas Eve are portrayed by Edith Evans (Past), Kenneth More (Present) and Paddy Stone (Yet to Come). Our favorite among the huge, predominantly British supporting cast is Sir Alec Guinness as a fussy, slightly effeminate Marley\\'s Ghost. Best of all, Finney performs his many songs \"live\" and not lip-synched to a pre-recording.

Freddie, who has a huge crush on Carly and just happens to be a tech wizard, also decides to join them and help tape the auditions.

Things are never dull as Carly and her friends work to increase viewership. They pursue a write-up on an influential Internet site run by a very unusual tyrant, broadcast from a haunted apartment on Halloween, pay back a mean teacher by making a fool of her online, and set a world record for the longest continuous webcast.

The Three Ghosts who turn the miserly Scrooge\\'s life around on Christmas Eve are portrayed by Edith Evans (Past), Kenneth More (Present) and Paddy Stone (Yet to Come). Our favorite among the huge, predominantly British supporting cast is Sir Alec Guinness as a fussy, slightly effeminate Marley\\'s Ghost. Best of all, Finney performs his many songs \"live\" and not lip-synched to a pre-recording.
