Daphne, engaged to Donny (Saul Rubinek), learns of Niles\\' unrequited feelings for her from an extremely medicated Frasier in \"Back Talk.\" If Daphne\\'s impending marriage was not obstacle enough to keep them apart, there is fussy, phobic, and formidable Dr. Mel Karnofsky (Jane Adams), Maris\\'s former plastic surgeon, who is introduced in \"The Late Dr. Crane\" as a romantic interest for Niles. The season culminates in the Emmy-nominated episode \"Something Borrowed, Someone Blue,\" arguably the show\\'s very best, and most satisfying cliffhanger, in which Niles and Daphne make like Ben and Elaine in', 'The Graduate', ', only in a Winnebago. Bebe Neuwirth makes another memorable return as the dread Lilith Crane in \"The Apparent Trap,\" in which son Frederick employs psychological warfare to try and get a mini-bike from his parents. Episodes featuring Frasier\\'s amoral agent Bebe Glaser (Harriet Samson Harris) are always a season highlight, and \"Morning Becomes Entertainment\" is no exception, as Bebe and Frasier (Kelsey Grammer) team up to host a TV morning chat show (who knew that Frasier had \"a way with voices,\" as witness his Sean Connery and James Mason impressions!). Dan Butler also returns as Bulldog in the poignant episode \"The Dog That Rocks the Cradle,\" A welcome addition to', 'Frasier', \"'s gallery of colorful characters in Simon (Anthony LaPaglia in an Emmy-nominated performance), Daphne's besotted brother.\", 'Frasier Crane is a witty and urbane', 'New Yorker', 'cartoon in a lewd, crude shock jock world. In the hilarious episode \"Radio Wars,\" he literally becomes the butt of his radio station\\'s new morning team\\'s stunts. Frasier is also at odds with his substitute producer, Mary (Kim Coles), a you-go-girl black woman, in \"Something About Dr. Mary.\" The series excelled at farce, and \"RDWRER\" is vintage', 'Frasier', ', as the Crane men embark on a New Year\\'s Eve road trip to Sun Valley, and Niles mistakenly thinks he\\'s been kidnapped when he falls asleep in the wrong Winnebago. Another season benchmark is \"Out with Dad,\" in which Frasier is compelled to pass off his father (John Mahoney) as gay. The lack of extras on this four-disc set is disappointing, but as wine snob Frasier might say, the seventh season was a very good year for the show that bears his name, and it\\'s a pleasure to uncork its many delights.', '--Donald Liebenson']\nAverage Rating: 4.9\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Comedy/Television, Television', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Box set, Closed-captioned, Color, Full Screen, NTSC', 'Contributor': 'David Hyde Pierce, Kelsey Grammer, Dan Butler, John Mahoney, Jane Leeves, Peri Gilpin', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo), Unqualified', 'Number Of Discs': '4', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.33:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 4.96 Ounces', 'Item model number': '409880985', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Box set, Closed-captioned, Color, Full Screen, NTSC', 'Run time': '8 hours and 46 minutes', 'Release date': 'August 4, 2015', 'Actors': 'Dan Butler, Kelsey Grammer, David Hyde Pierce, Jane Leeves, Peri Gilpin', 'Studio': 'Paramount', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '4'}\nReview Text: I LOVE FRASIER!!!

In addition to Huffman, other memorable star turns this season include Millicent Martin as Daphne\\'s impossible mother, Jeanne Tripplehorn as a coach whose berating of her students causes Frasier to conjure up hallucinations of his own former gym teacher, portrayed by Bob Hoskins.

      "'s fifth season is marked by two central themes. First is Roz's (Peri Gilpin) unexpected pregnancy, which naturally opens the door for countless promiscuity jokes for the radio show's beleaguered producer. The second is the continuing drama of Niles (David Hyde Pierce) and his frosty wife, Maris, which seems to finally come to a head. Not that even a good marriage has ever kept Niles from pining for Daphne (Jane Leeves), of course. Frasier's (Kelsey Grammer) show is sailing along, and for the occasion of his 1000th show, is honored by the mayor for \"Frasier Crane Day,\" which allows the cast to do some rare location shooting in Seattle. But he has some problems with KACL management, and the prospect of tough contract negotiations tempts him to return to the Dark Side, in the form of agent Bebe (Harriet Sansom Harris). His personal life continues to sputter, even when he meets a perfect woman (Sela Ward as a fashion model studying zoology, Lindsay Frost as a high-powered defense attorney). The annual guest appearance by ex-wife Lilith (Bebe Neuwirth) comes with a bizarre twist, and his father (John Mahoney) comes to a critical point with his girlfriend (Marsha Mason).",
