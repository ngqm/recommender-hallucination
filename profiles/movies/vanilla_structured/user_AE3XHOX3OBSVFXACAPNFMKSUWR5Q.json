It's about a young man's great love for a city, Paris, and the illusion people have that a life different from theirs would be much better.\", 'Amazon.com', 'Paris is a city that lends itself to daydreaming, to walking the streets and imagining all sorts of magic, a quality that Woody Allen understands perfectly.', 'Midnight in Paris', \"is Allen's charming reverie about just that quality, with a screenwriter hero named Gil (Owen Wilson) who strolls the lanes of Paris with his head in the clouds and walks right into his own best fantasy. Gil is there with his materialistic fianc\u00e9e (Rachel McAdams) and her unpleasant parents, taking a break from his financially rewarding but spiritually unfulfilling Hollywood career--and he can't stop thinking that all he wants to do is quit the movies, move to Paris, and write that novel he's been meaning to finish. You know, be like his heroes in the bohemian Paris of the 1920s. Sure enough, a midnight encounter draws him into the jazzy world of Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Picasso and Dali, and an intense Ernest Hemingway, who promises to bring Gil's manuscript to Gertrude Stein for review. Gil wakes up every morning back in the real world, but returning to his enchanted Paris proves fairly easy. In the execution of this marvelous fantasia, Allen pursues the idea that people of every generation have always romanticized a previous age as golden (this is in fact explained to us by Michael Sheen's pedantic art expert), but he also honors Gil's need to find out certain truths for himself. The movie's on the side of gentle fantasy, and it has some literary/cinematic in-jokes that call back to the kind of goofy humor Allen created in\", 'Love and Death', \".The film is guilty of the slackness that Allen's latter-day directing has sometimes shown, and the underwritten roles for McAdams and Marion Cotillard are better acted than written. But the city glows with Allen's romantic sense of it, and Owen Wilson has just the right nice-guy melancholy to put the idea over.

Thanks for this one, Woody Allen, I hope you win an award and I hope this movie wins many. The first minute or two of this film, scenes of Paris with jazz music, was wonderful! (Frankly, I would have preferred classical cello music, but the visuals alone worked beautifully with their sepia overtones.)<br /><br />My favorite scene involved a surrealistic exchange among Dali, Luis Bunuel, Man Ray and our protagonist Gil where they all spoke about a rhinoceros from their individual viewpoints. (Inspired and hilarious -- loved it!) Other great philosophy came from Hemingway. And on writing, Gertrude Stein said it best.<br /><br />Brilliant cast: Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein, Adrien Brody as Salvador Dali, Tom Hiddleston as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Carla Bruni as museum guide. The part of Owen Wilson would most likely have been played by Woody Allen himself if he had been slightly younger, but Wilson does his best to affect Allen's mannerisms.<br /><br />Paris IS a most beautiful city. I've walked much of Paris in the rain and I agree with one premise of this movie: rain enhances the beauty of Paris. (One of my most invigorating days, ever, was sitting on the top level of an open-air tour bus, in the rain, umbrella open, soaring around Paris from one arrondissement to another.)<br /><br />This is a movie I will want to watch at least once a year as I do with Enchanted April, Amelie, Up At The Villa, It's A Wonderful Life and a few other classics where immeasurable love and skill went into their creation.\nReview Title: Love Affair In And With Paris\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Mozart in the Jungle\nReview Date: 2015/03/01\nCategories: Comedy\nProduct Description: ['A new Amazon Original Series: \\xa0What happens behind the curtains at the symphony is just as captivating as what happens on stage.

This 1964 film adaptation of the classic novel by Ford Madox Ford shows a young Judi Dench (Skyfall, J. Edgar) in one of her earliest screen roles. Considered by many as one of the pre-eminent literary works of the 20th-century, Parade's End follows Christopher Tietjens (Ronald Hines, Elizabeth R), a wealthy member of Edwardian England's upper class, as the country is drawn into World War One. Tietjens is at the center of a love triangle between his wife Sylvia (Jeanne Moody), a treacherous socialite who is trying to destroy him, and his suffragette mistress, Valentine (Dench). The warfare Tietjens encounters as an officer in Europe is but a backdrop to a personal battle of conflicting loyalties, hidden passions and the rigid social expectations of his day.\", ']]>', 'Amazon.com', 'This introspective adaptation of Ford Madox Ford\\'s four-book series revolves around Yorkshire statistician Christopher Tietjens (Ronald Hines, pale and prickly), a nonconformist living in stiff-upper-lip Edwardian England (screenwriter John Hopkins concentrates on the first three novels in the tetralogy). When war breaks out, Christopher does his patriotic duty, while dreaming of the day \"there will be no more parades.\" In the first part, his spiteful and snobbish wife, Sylvia (Jeanne Moody, overacting in an entertaining manner), leaves him for another man, but Christopher forgoes divorce to avoid a scandal and moves in with his Rossetti-obsessed associate, MacMaster (Fulton Mackay), the kind of arty gentleman who rolls his', 'r', '\\'s. To her mother, Sylvia explains her actions succinctly: \"I hate my husband and I hate my child.\" While she\\'s away, he meets Valentine (Judi Dench, the essence of compassion), a suffragette and pacifist. If Christopher represents the past, Valentine represents the future.', 'Sylvia eventually returns, but Christopher continues to associate with Valentine, to the consternation of his father, who believes the rumors that have been swirling around his son (most of them untrue). As Christopher\\'s brother, Mark (Ronald Leigh-Hunt), tells Valentine, he\\'s \"a fellow who never told a lie or did a dishonorable thing.\" In the next two chapters, Christopher serves as an officer in France and Belgium, loses several of his men, and suffers from posttraumatic stress disorder, which complicates his long-simmering, but unconsummated romance with Valentine.

IMHO: Best director, Best Screenplay, Best Actors, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Every Category. All interior scenes look as though they were staged by Vermeer. The casting and the portrayal of the characters by these actors is absolutely stunning!<br /><br />Set during WW1, Christopher Tietjens, one of Britain's most brilliant statisticians finds himself fighting in the trenches. He leaves two women behind: his wealthy wife, Sylvia, and Miss Wannop, a woman he has gradually come to know and love. Sylvia is a manipulative, selfish socialite, and Miss Wannop, a suffragette, is someone with a strong sense of duty (like Tietjens).<br /><br />This 1964 version is okay. It's in black and white. The script is abbreviated. But it is fun seeing Judi Dench, when she was younger, in the role of Miss Wannop.<br /><br />I bought both this DVD and the kindle book (based on the novel by Ford Madox Ford, &#34;No More Parades&#34;).

As a PARIS GUIDE = 3.5 STARS. But I did enjoy it -- especially the French Cafe music!<br /><br />This is an artsy 54-minute medley of footage, stills and music. It might be years old, or just made to look that way, with its sepia tinted footage. Film is often shown with music only, no narration, and sometimes they fast forward: cars zoom around Place de la Concorde; people walk at a rapid clip making them look like Weebles.<br /><br />Narration, by a Brit named John Symes who has a most calming tone of voice, is abbreviated; he speaks only about half of the time. But he does manage to inform visitors about sightseeing highlights, including history and culture, and some practical tips, in spite of the trimmed narration.<br /><br />He begins with your arrival at CDG and suggests you take the RoissyBus. (I took it once. I found it to be inexpensive and convenient, since I was staying at a Best Western a few of blocks away from the Paris Opera Garnier.) He also mentions the train and taxis; but taxis can be expensive. One great tip is to google the bus map and print it out, since they're hard to come by. Another is to wear comfortable shoes and walk everywhere.<br /><br />&#34;Must See&#34; places: Eiffel Tower, Louvre (plan to spend a whole day), Carousel under the Louvre to buy Louvre tickets and shop for French souvenirs, Notre Dame Cathedral, Place de la Concorde, Sacre Coeur (I like his tip on watching the sunset from here and visiting Montmartre in the evening), Pompidou Center, Moulin Rouge, Invalides, Palais de Luxembourg, Pantheon (I agree -- a must see! though a bit out of the way), Tuileries Gardens, Grand Palais (the Nazis used it for their tanks during WW2 -- I didn't know this), Forum des Halles for shopping (but he really prefers Carousel), walk along the Seine, go to the theatre (but beware -- it will be in French!). They show Bourse, but don't identify it. They show the inside of Opera Garnier, but don't tell you what you're looking at.<br /><br />When he bemoans the fact that one can't get a cup of real English tea, he says it &#34;tongue in cheek,&#34; I think, and isn't really crying over the fact that English tea isn't served with milk in France, if at all. He recommends orange juice, instead. He points out that Parisians are beautiful to look at (true!), and he says about Paris: it's one of those places it would be a shame not to visit.

(According to legend, he snatched the crown from the hands of Pope Pius VII and crowned himself during the coronation.) This film doesn't show it, but there's a sensational painting by Jacques Louis David that depicts Napoleon crowning Josephine, with Pope Pius VII sitting behind him.<br /><br />Next, they mention the Pont Neuf, &#34;New Bridge,&#34; the oldest bridge in Paris. Then, Cafe Marly, a beautiful vantage point for a view of The Louvre, and of course The Louvre, itself (where you can view the aforementioned painting up close and personal).<br /><br />They mention who must yield to whom when driving a car.

This movie has one of the best musical scores, ever! Brilliantly written, acted and directed by Emilio Estevez. This is very much a Sheen/Estevez family affair with contributions by many family members as actors, producers, etc. The casting is spot-on. Sheen and Yorick van Wageningen (as Joost from Amsterdam) really shine in their roles, with wonderful performances by Deborah Kara Unger (as Sarah, with her painful history) and James Nesbitt (as Jack, a writer with &#34;writer's block&#34;).<br /><br />&#34;Margaret Mead didn't become a great cultural anthropologist by staying in school,&#34; says Tom's son Daniel, who has a strong calling to travel the world. So, instead of finishing his doctorate, Daniel travels and unfortunately gets caught in a storm in the Pyrenees. (Again, the cast of characters highlights anthropology/sociology: Captain Henri (Tcheky Karyo), Angelica (Angela Molina), El Ramon (Eusebio Lazaro), are among my favorites, running the gamut of human emotions and circumstances.)<br /><br />*** SPOILER ALERT -- DON'T READ FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS ***<br /><br />Tom goes to Spain's Basque Country to retrieve the body of his only son. He decides to walk The Camino de Santiago from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago de Compostela, and then further to Muxia, scattering Daniel's ashes along the way.<br /><br />The spirit of Daniel is very much with Tom along the way. Tom also makes the acquaintance of three other trekkers, or peregrinos, who form close friendships after some early conflicts, underscoring one of my favorite quotes: &#34;To understand all is to forgive all.&#34;<br /><br />Toward the end, the film pays homage to Santiago de Compostela: exterior scenes from the distance and close up, St. James at the entrance, inside the church, and a mass with clergy getting the huge incense burner (botafumeiro) airborne, swinging from the nave to the chancel (an awesome scene!) on its enormous arc.<br /><br />At the suggestion of Ishmael, a gypsy with integrity, Tom goes the extra mile, taking Daniel's remaining ashes to Muxia, to the sea, where Tom reaches catharsis.<br /><br />Scenes of the Spanish countryside highlight the beauty of this route: a field under the Milky Way. A corridor where miracles can happen.<br /><br />Since all four travelers are seeking something along the way that they hope to find resolved by their destination, I could not stop myself from remembering &#34;The Wizard of Oz.&#34; In spite of heartfelt sentiments in both films, I think &#34;The Way&#34; is the more serious of the two.\nReview Title: Epiphany & Catharsis Along The Way\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Kundalini Yoga With Grace & Strength\nReview Date: 2016/09/18\nStore: Rated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Special Interests\nProduct Description: ['From the Back Cover', 'With Grace & Strength', \"is a video that delivers.

Trying to keep an open mind, Chris agrees to enter Mary's world.\"]\nAverage Rating: 3.5\nProduct Details: {'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Daniel Brown']}\nReview Text: In this thought-provoking documentary, Mary Rodwell, therapist to the alien abduction community, travels around Australia with her scientifically minded, skeptical son, Chris in tow.<br /><br />I found this documentary to brilliantly written and edited and I think it gives a balanced and honest portrayal of the people featured: loving mother and son, &#34;flippant&#34; Australian astrophysicist (Dr. Lion Weaver) and an audience full of skeptical (bordering on rude) students, an astronomer (Dr. Rhagvir Bhathel) who filters signals from deep space, a roomful of folks interested in the topic (members of one of Mary's support groups, I believe), some of whom had actually sighted UFOs, a polygraph tester (Gavin Wilson) for the Federal Police, and two men who claimed to have had close encounters with aliens.<br /><br />The first of these two men, Greg Dinal, claimed he had seen a UFO in 1967, describing it as a reddish ball in the sky that grew until it was as big as a football field. His experiences did not pass the lie detector test, although in telling his story, I found him entirely credible. The second man, Peter Curry, described an incredible experience that happened at 7:15 a.m. in 1992. He awoke to find a blonde female &#34;straddling&#34; him. He obtained evidence (hairs) that were scientifically tested. The DNA results: close to human; rare Chinese Mongoloid type; near African pygmy. The polygraph expert asked him if there were five aliens in his home at Hurlstone Park and he affirmed this. He passed the polygraph test.<br /><br />Mary shows Chris a video of lights in the sky, at night, near Silbury Hill in England, where crop circles have appeared. Neither Mary nor Chris can determine exactly what the lights are.<br /><br />There was nothing in this documentary that caused me to believe that anyone has ever been abducted by aliens, although I do believe it is possible. And the hairs that Peter Curry collected and the subsequent DNA results lend credibility to alien visitations of humans. My own personal belief is that aliens have probably visited Earth, perhaps between 20,000 and 40,000 years ago and possibly more recently. I base this on Puma Punku in Bolivia and some evidence in a documentary titled &#34;Pyramid Code&#34; about ancient sites in Egypt. Erich von Daniken's book, &#34;Chariots of the Gods&#34; (1968) also presented a lot of intriguing evidence. (My belief is that aliens visited Earth and that they might have altered DNA of early people. I have no idea if they have visited us in modern times, but I don't see why not, especially if they want to see the results of their experimentation.) These sites were not covered in &#34;My Mum Talks to Aliens,&#34; which focuses on people who have been abducted.<br /><br />So, like Mary's son Chris, I remain skeptical but open-minded about those individuals who claim to have been abducted by aliens. But Mary believes it, and she is a wonderful supporter of those who claim to have had those experiences.<br /><br />As for crop circles, I suspect that some technical genius(es) in England invented personal drones long before they hit the mainstream. I believe that they then programmed those drones to follow a template, knocking wheat or corn over in fields for whatever reason -- to test the accuracy of their drones, or to baffle the rest of us.\nReview Title: Fighting A Fight She Believes In\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2016/12/17\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Alcohol use', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a)', 'Italiano', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', 'Polski', '\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e', 'Portugu\u00eas', 'Deutsch', 'Fran\u00e7ais'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', '\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629', '\u010ce\u0161tina', 'Dansk', 'Deutsch', '\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a)', 'Suomi', 'Filipino', 'Fran\u00e7ais', '\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea', '\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940', 'Magyar', 'Indonesia', 'Italiano', '\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e', '\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4', 'Bahasa Melayu', 'Norsk Bokm\u00e5l', 'Nederlands', 'Polski', 'Portugu\u00eas (Brasil)', 'Portugu\u00eas (Portugal)', 'Rom\u00e2n\u0103', '\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439', 'Svenska', '\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bcd', '\u0c24\u0c46\u0c32\u0c41\u0c17\u0c41', '\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22', 'T\u00fcrk\u00e7e', '\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430', 'Ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t', '\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7b80\u4f53\uff09', '\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7e41\u9ad4\uff09'], 'Directors': ['Paul Weitz', 'Roman Coppola', 'Will Graham', 'Patricia Rozema', 'Azazel Jacobs', 'Tricia Brock', 'Gael Garcia Bernal'], 'Producers': ['Paul Weitz', 'Roman Coppola', 'Jason Schwartzman', 'Will Graham'], 'Starring': ['Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal', 'Lola Kirke', 'Saffron Burrows'], 'Studio': ['Amazon Studios']}\nReview Text: I love the series, the actors and the casting.

We both thought that Alex Maier did a phenomenal job with this film -- interviews, music, etc. -- but especially the editing! And we both appreciated his articulate, eloquent narration. Alex had to navigate tricky spots several times to set up his camera, make the climb, and retrieve his camera. He really captured the essence of America's arid landscape as he backpacked 800 miles across southern Utah and northern Arizona. Some of this terrain is tough! At times he went hours without water and other times he was chest deep in water at the base of steep canyons. A recurring theme is the self-empowerment of solving problems and figuring one's way out of tricky situations. He makes mistakes along the way and accepts those with humor and humility.

You know, be like his heroes in the bohemian Paris of the 1920s.

Gil wakes up every morning back in the real world, but returning to his enchanted Paris proves fairly easy. In the execution of this marvelous fantasia, Allen pursues the idea that people of every generation have always romanticized a previous age as golden (this is in fact explained to us by Michael Sheen's pedantic art expert), but he also honors Gil's need to find out certain truths for himself.

Thanks for this one, Woody Allen, I hope you win an award and I hope this movie wins many. The first minute or two of this film, scenes of Paris with jazz music, was wonderful! (Frankly, I would have preferred classical cello music, but the visuals alone worked beautifully with their sepia overtones.)<br /><br />My favorite scene involved a surrealistic exchange among Dali, Luis Bunuel, Man Ray and our protagonist Gil where they all spoke about a rhinoceros from their individual viewpoints. (Inspired and hilarious -- loved it!) Other great philosophy came from Hemingway. And on writing, Gertrude Stein said it best.<br /><br />Brilliant cast: Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein, Adrien Brody as Salvador Dali, Tom Hiddleston as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Carla Bruni as museum guide. The part of Owen Wilson would most likely have been played by Woody Allen himself if he had been slightly younger, but Wilson does his best to affect Allen's mannerisms.<br /><br />Paris IS a most beautiful city.

It is definitely one of my &#34;Top 20 All Time Favorite Movies.&#34; Available on Amazon Prime Video or DVD at amazon.com. IMHO: Best director, Best Screenplay, Best Actors, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Every Category. All interior scenes look as though they were staged by Vermeer. The casting and the portrayal of the characters by these actors is absolutely stunning!<br /><br />Set during WW1, Christopher Tietjens, one of Britain's most brilliant statisticians finds himself fighting in the trenches. He leaves two women behind: his wealthy wife, Sylvia, and Miss Wannop, a woman he has gradually come to know and love. Sylvia is a manipulative, selfish socialite, and Miss Wannop, a suffragette, is someone with a strong sense of duty (like Tietjens).<br /><br />This 1964 version is okay. It's in black and white. The script is abbreviated. But it is fun seeing Judi Dench, when she was younger, in the role of Miss Wannop.<br /><br />I bought both this DVD and the kindle book (based on the novel by Ford Madox Ford, &#34;No More Parades&#34;).  I have watched this 1964 version once, and I've watched the 2012 version several times. I love this story!\nNo More Parades\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['---']}\nAs a RELAXATION film = 5-STARS. As a PARIS GUIDE = 3.5 STARS. But I did enjoy it -- especially the French Cafe music!<br /><br />This is an artsy 54-minute medley of footage, stills and music. It might be years old, or just made to look that way, with its sepia tinted footage. Film is often shown with music only, no narration, and sometimes they fast forward: cars zoom around Place de la Concorde; people walk at a rapid clip making them look like Weebles.<br /><br />Narration, by a Brit named John Symes who has a most calming tone of voice, is abbreviated; he speaks only about half of the time. But he does manage to inform visitors about sightseeing highlights, including history and culture, and some practical tips, in spite of the trimmed narration.<br /><br />He begins with your arrival at CDG and suggests you take the RoissyBus. (I took it once. I found it to be inexpensive and convenient, since I was staying at a Best Western a few of blocks away from the Paris Opera Garnier.) He also mentions the train and taxis; but taxis can be expensive. One great tip is to google the bus map and print it out, since they're hard to come by. Another is to wear comfortable shoes and walk everywhere.<br /><br />&#34;Must See&#34; places: Eiffel Tower, Louvre (plan to spend a whole day), Carousel under the Louvre to buy Louvre tickets and shop for French souvenirs, Notre Dame Cathedral, Place de la Concorde, Sacre Coeur (I like his tip on watching the sunset from here and visiting Montmartre in the evening), Pompidou Center, Moulin Rouge, Invalides, Palais de Luxembourg, Pantheon (I agree -- a must see! though a bit out of the way), Tuileries Gardens, Grand Palais (the Nazis used it for their tanks during WW2 -- I didn't know this), Forum des Halles for shopping (but he really prefers Carousel), walk along the Seine, go to the theatre (but beware -- it will be in French!). They show Bourse, but don't identify it. They show the inside of Opera Garnier, but don't tell you what you're looking at.<br /><br />When he bemoans the fact that one can't get a cup of real English tea, he says it &#34;tongue in cheek,&#34; I think, and isn't really crying over the fact that English tea isn't served with milk in France, if at all. He recommends orange juice, instead. He points out that Parisians are beautiful to look at (true!), and he says about Paris: it's one of those places it would be a shame not to visit. I so agree!\nArtsy & Relaxing With A Sketch Of The Main Sights\n{'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['KM Records'], 'Studio': ['TravelVideoStore.com']}\nWhen you only have 14 minutes to discover Paris, this might be the short for you.<br /><br />They start out with the Seine and the Right and Left Banks (Rive Droite and Rive Gauche), a good way for the visitor to get oriented.<br /><br />They move on to Notre Dame de Paris, where Napoleon crowned himself in 1804. (According to legend, he snatched the crown from the hands of Pope Pius VII and crowned himself during the coronation.) This film doesn't show it, but there's a sensational painting by Jacques Louis David that depicts Napoleon crowning Josephine, with Pope Pius VII sitting behind him.<br /><br />Next, they mention the Pont Neuf, &#34;New Bridge,&#34; the oldest bridge in Paris. Then, Cafe Marly, a beautiful vantage point for a view of The Louvre, and of course The Louvre, itself (where you can view the aforementioned painting up close and personal).<br /><br />They mention who must yield to whom when driving a car. (Priorit\u00e9 \u00e0 droite - the old French system of giving priority to all traffic coming from the right clues you into the fact that you should familiarize yourself with driving rules, and signage. But if you only learn one rule, this would be it, since the entire country is overflowing with traffic circles.)<br /><br />They cover Place de la Concorde, Picasso Museum in the Hotel Sale, Fashion Week, Paris streets at night, Moulin Rouge, Arc de Triomphe, Eiffel Tower, stairs to Sacre Coeur and Montmartre Hill, and La Defense.<br /><br />Narration is good, but choice of background music and sound editing isn't.

This movie has one of the best musical scores, ever! Brilliantly written, acted and directed by Emilio Estevez. This is very much a Sheen/Estevez family affair with contributions by many family members as actors, producers, etc. The casting is spot-on. Sheen and Yorick van Wageningen (as Joost from Amsterdam) really shine in their roles, with wonderful performances by Deborah Kara Unger (as Sarah, with her painful history) and James Nesbitt (as Jack, a writer with &#34;writer's block&#34;).<br /><br />&#34;Margaret Mead didn't become a great cultural anthropologist by staying in school,&#34; says Tom's son Daniel, who has a strong calling to travel the world. So, instead of finishing his doctorate, Daniel travels and unfortunately gets caught in a storm in the Pyrenees. (Again, the cast of characters highlights anthropology/sociology: Captain Henri (Tcheky Karyo), Angelica (Angela Molina), El Ramon (Eusebio Lazaro), are among my favorites, running the gamut of human emotions and circumstances.)<br /><br />*** SPOILER ALERT -- DON'T READ FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS ***<br /><br />Tom goes to Spain's Basque Country to retrieve the body of his only son. He decides to walk The Camino de Santiago from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago de Compostela, and then further to Muxia, scattering Daniel's ashes along the way.<br /><br />The spirit of Daniel is very much with Tom along the way. Tom also makes the acquaintance of three other trekkers, or peregrinos, who form close friendships after some early conflicts, underscoring one of my favorite quotes: &#34;To understand all is to forgive all.&#34;<br /><br />Toward the end, the film pays homage to Santiago de Compostela: exterior scenes from the distance and close up, St. James at the entrance, inside the church, and a mass with clergy getting the huge incense burner (botafumeiro) airborne, swinging from the nave to the chancel (an awesome scene!) on its enormous arc.<br /><br />At the suggestion of Ishmael, a gypsy with integrity, Tom goes the extra mile, taking Daniel's remaining ashes to Muxia, to the sea, where Tom reaches catharsis.<br /><br />Scenes of the Spanish countryside highlight the beauty of this route: a field under the Milky Way. A corridor where miracles can happen.<br /><br />Since all four travelers are seeking something along the way that they hope to find resolved by their destination, I could not stop myself from remembering &#34;The Wizard of Oz.&#34; In spite of heartfelt sentiments in both films, I think &#34;The Way&#34; is the more serious of the two.\nEpiphany & Catharsis Along The Way\nKundalini Yoga With Grace & Strength\nRated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Special Interests\n['From the Back Cover', 'With Grace & Strength', \"is a video that delivers.

Their relationship has reached a critical point. Mary's beliefs led to the breakdown of her marriage and left a teenage Chris with some emotional scars, so the topic comes with baggage. Trying to keep an open mind, Chris agrees to enter Mary's world.\"]\n{'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Daniel Brown']}\nIn this thought-provoking documentary, Mary Rodwell, therapist to the alien abduction community, travels around Australia with her scientifically minded, skeptical son, Chris in tow.<br /><br />I found this documentary to brilliantly written and edited and I think it gives a balanced and honest portrayal of the people featured: loving mother and son, &#34;flippant&#34; Australian astrophysicist (Dr. Lion Weaver) and an audience full of skeptical (bordering on rude) students, an astronomer (Dr. Rhagvir Bhathel) who filters signals from deep space, a roomful of folks interested in the topic (members of one of Mary's support groups, I believe), some of whom had actually sighted UFOs, a polygraph tester (Gavin Wilson) for the Federal Police, and two men who claimed to have had close encounters with aliens.<br /><br />The first of these two men, Greg Dinal, claimed he had seen a UFO in 1967, describing it as a reddish ball in the sky that grew until it was as big as a football field. His experiences did not pass the lie detector test, although in telling his story, I found him entirely credible. The second man, Peter Curry, described an incredible experience that happened at 7:15 a.m. in 1992. He awoke to find a blonde female &#34;straddling&#34; him. He obtained evidence (hairs) that were scientifically tested. The DNA results: close to human; rare Chinese Mongoloid type; near African pygmy. The polygraph expert asked him if there were five aliens in his home at Hurlstone Park and he affirmed this. He passed the polygraph test.<br /><br />Mary shows Chris a video of lights in the sky, at night, near Silbury Hill in England, where crop circles have appeared. Neither Mary nor Chris can determine exactly what the lights are.<br /><br />There was nothing in this documentary that caused me to believe that anyone has ever been abducted by aliens, although I do believe it is possible. And the hairs that Peter Curry collected and the subsequent DNA results lend credibility to alien visitations of humans. My own personal belief is that aliens have probably visited Earth, perhaps between 20,000 and 40,000 years ago and possibly more recently. I base this on Puma Punku in Bolivia and some evidence in a documentary titled &#34;Pyramid Code&#34; about ancient sites in Egypt. Erich von Daniken's book, &#34;Chariots of the Gods&#34; (1968) also presented a lot of intriguing evidence. (My belief is that aliens visited Earth and that they might have altered DNA of early people. I have no idea if they have visited us in modern times, but I don't see why not, especially if they want to see the results of their experimentation.) These sites were not covered in &#34;My Mum Talks to Aliens,&#34; which focuses on people who have been abducted.<br /><br />So, like Mary's son Chris, I remain skeptical but open-minded about those individuals who claim to have been abducted by aliens. But Mary believes it, and she is a wonderful supporter of those who claim to have had those experiences.<br /><br />As for crop circles, I suspect that some technical genius(es) in England invented personal drones long before they hit the mainstream. I believe that they then programmed those drones to follow a template, knocking wheat or corn over in fields for whatever reason -- to test the accuracy of their drones, or to baffle the rest of us.\nFighting A Fight She Believes In\n{'Content advisory': ['Alcohol use', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a)', 'Italiano', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', 'Polski', '\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e', 'Portugu\u00eas', 'Deutsch', 'Fran\u00e7ais'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', '\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629', '\u010ce\u0161tina', 'Dansk', 'Deutsch', '\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a)', 'Suomi', 'Filipino', 'Fran\u00e7ais', '\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea', '\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940', 'Magyar', 'Indonesia', 'Italiano', '\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e', '\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4', 'Bahasa Melayu', 'Norsk Bokm\u00e5l', 'Nederlands', 'Polski', 'Portugu\u00eas (Brasil)', 'Portugu\u00eas (Portugal)', 'Rom\u00e2n\u0103', '\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439', 'Svenska', '\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bcd', '\u0c24\u0c46\u0c32\u0c41\u0c17\u0c41', '\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22', 'T\u00fcrk\u00e7e', '\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430', 'Ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t', '\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7b80\u4f53\uff09', '\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7e41\u9ad4\uff09'], 'Directors': ['Paul Weitz', 'Roman Coppola', 'Will Graham', 'Patricia Rozema', 'Azazel Jacobs', 'Tricia Brock', 'Gael Garcia Bernal'], 'Producers': ['Paul Weitz', 'Roman Coppola', 'Jason Schwartzman', 'Will Graham'], 'Starring': ['Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal', 'Lola Kirke', 'Saffron Burrows'], 'Studio': ['Amazon Studios']}\nI love the series, the actors and the casting.

Gil is there with his materialistic fianc\u00e9e (Rachel McAdams) and her unpleasant parents, taking a break from his financially rewarding but spiritually unfulfilling Hollywood career--and he can't stop thinking that all he wants to do is quit the movies, move to Paris, and write that novel he's been meaning to finish. You know, be like his heroes in the bohemian Paris of the 1920s. Sure enough, a midnight encounter draws him into the jazzy world of Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Picasso and Dali, and an intense Ernest Hemingway, who promises to bring Gil's manuscript to Gertrude Stein for review. Gil wakes up every morning back in the real world, but returning to his enchanted Paris proves fairly easy. In the execution of this marvelous fantasia, Allen pursues the idea that people of every generation have always romanticized a previous age as golden (this is in fact explained to us by Michael Sheen's pedantic art expert), but he also honors Gil's need to find out certain truths for himself.

Thanks for this one, Woody Allen, I hope you win an award and I hope this movie wins many. The first minute or two of this film, scenes of Paris with jazz music, was wonderful! (Frankly, I would have preferred classical cello music, but the visuals alone worked beautifully with their sepia overtones.)<br /><br />My favorite scene involved a surrealistic exchange among Dali, Luis Bunuel, Man Ray and our protagonist Gil where they all spoke about a rhinoceros from their individual viewpoints. (Inspired and hilarious -- loved it!) Other great philosophy came from Hemingway. And on writing, Gertrude Stein said it best.<br /><br />Brilliant cast: Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein, Adrien Brody as Salvador Dali, Tom Hiddleston as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Carla Bruni as museum guide. The part of Owen Wilson would most likely have been played by Woody Allen himself if he had been slightly younger, but Wilson does his best to affect Allen's mannerisms.<br /><br />Paris IS a most beautiful city. I've walked much of Paris in the rain and I agree with one premise of this movie: rain enhances the beauty of Paris. (One of my most invigorating days, ever, was sitting on the top level of an open-air tour bus, in the rain, umbrella open, soaring around Paris from one arrondissement to another.)<br /><br />This is a movie I will want to watch at least once a year as I do with Enchanted April, Amelie, Up At The Villa, It's A Wonderful Life and a few other classics where immeasurable love and skill went into their creation.\nReview Title: Love Affair In And With Paris\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Mozart in the Jungle\nReview Date: 2015/03/01\nCategories: Comedy\nProduct Description: ['A new Amazon Original Series: \\xa0What happens behind the curtains at the symphony is just as captivating as what happens on stage.

This 1964 film adaptation of the classic novel by Ford Madox Ford shows a young Judi Dench (Skyfall, J. Edgar) in one of her earliest screen roles. Considered by many as one of the pre-eminent literary works of the 20th-century, Parade's End follows Christopher Tietjens (Ronald Hines, Elizabeth R), a wealthy member of Edwardian England's upper class, as the country is drawn into World War One. Tietjens is at the center of a love triangle between his wife Sylvia (Jeanne Moody), a treacherous socialite who is trying to destroy him, and his suffragette mistress, Valentine (Dench). The warfare Tietjens encounters as an officer in Europe is but a backdrop to a personal battle of conflicting loyalties, hidden passions and the rigid social expectations of his day.\", ']]>', 'Amazon.com', 'This introspective adaptation of Ford Madox Ford\\'s four-book series revolves around Yorkshire statistician Christopher Tietjens (Ronald Hines, pale and prickly), a nonconformist living in stiff-upper-lip Edwardian England (screenwriter John Hopkins concentrates on the first three novels in the tetralogy). When war breaks out, Christopher does his patriotic duty, while dreaming of the day \"there will be no more parades.\" In the first part, his spiteful and snobbish wife, Sylvia (Jeanne Moody, overacting in an entertaining manner), leaves him for another man, but Christopher forgoes divorce to avoid a scandal and moves in with his Rossetti-obsessed associate, MacMaster (Fulton Mackay), the kind of arty gentleman who rolls his', 'r', '\\'s. To her mother, Sylvia explains her actions succinctly: \"I hate my husband and I hate my child.\" While she\\'s away, he meets Valentine (Judi Dench, the essence of compassion), a suffragette and pacifist. If Christopher represents the past, Valentine represents the future.', 'Sylvia eventually returns, but Christopher continues to associate with Valentine, to the consternation of his father, who believes the rumors that have been swirling around his son (most of them untrue). As Christopher\\'s brother, Mark (Ronald Leigh-Hunt), tells Valentine, he\\'s \"a fellow who never told a lie or did a dishonorable thing.\" In the next two chapters, Christopher serves as an officer in France and Belgium, loses several of his men, and suffers from posttraumatic stress disorder, which complicates his long-simmering, but unconsummated romance with Valentine.

IMHO: Best director, Best Screenplay, Best Actors, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Every Category. All interior scenes look as though they were staged by Vermeer. The casting and the portrayal of the characters by these actors is absolutely stunning!<br /><br />Set during WW1, Christopher Tietjens, one of Britain's most brilliant statisticians finds himself fighting in the trenches. He leaves two women behind: his wealthy wife, Sylvia, and Miss Wannop, a woman he has gradually come to know and love. Sylvia is a manipulative, selfish socialite, and Miss Wannop, a suffragette, is someone with a strong sense of duty (like Tietjens).<br /><br />This 1964 version is okay. It's in black and white. The script is abbreviated. But it is fun seeing Judi Dench, when she was younger, in the role of Miss Wannop.<br /><br />I bought both this DVD and the kindle book (based on the novel by Ford Madox Ford, &#34;No More Parades&#34;).

As a PARIS GUIDE = 3.5 STARS. But I did enjoy it -- especially the French Cafe music!<br /><br />This is an artsy 54-minute medley of footage, stills and music. It might be years old, or just made to look that way, with its sepia tinted footage. Film is often shown with music only, no narration, and sometimes they fast forward: cars zoom around Place de la Concorde; people walk at a rapid clip making them look like Weebles.<br /><br />Narration, by a Brit named John Symes who has a most calming tone of voice, is abbreviated; he speaks only about half of the time. But he does manage to inform visitors about sightseeing highlights, including history and culture, and some practical tips, in spite of the trimmed narration.<br /><br />He begins with your arrival at CDG and suggests you take the RoissyBus. (I took it once. I found it to be inexpensive and convenient, since I was staying at a Best Western a few of blocks away from the Paris Opera Garnier.) He also mentions the train and taxis; but taxis can be expensive. One great tip is to google the bus map and print it out, since they're hard to come by. Another is to wear comfortable shoes and walk everywhere.<br /><br />&#34;Must See&#34; places: Eiffel Tower, Louvre (plan to spend a whole day), Carousel under the Louvre to buy Louvre tickets and shop for French souvenirs, Notre Dame Cathedral, Place de la Concorde, Sacre Coeur (I like his tip on watching the sunset from here and visiting Montmartre in the evening), Pompidou Center, Moulin Rouge, Invalides, Palais de Luxembourg, Pantheon (I agree -- a must see! though a bit out of the way), Tuileries Gardens, Grand Palais (the Nazis used it for their tanks during WW2 -- I didn't know this), Forum des Halles for shopping (but he really prefers Carousel), walk along the Seine, go to the theatre (but beware -- it will be in French!). They show Bourse, but don't identify it. They show the inside of Opera Garnier, but don't tell you what you're looking at.<br /><br />When he bemoans the fact that one can't get a cup of real English tea, he says it &#34;tongue in cheek,&#34; I think, and isn't really crying over the fact that English tea isn't served with milk in France, if at all. He recommends orange juice, instead. He points out that Parisians are beautiful to look at (true!), and he says about Paris: it's one of those places it would be a shame not to visit.

(According to legend, he snatched the crown from the hands of Pope Pius VII and crowned himself during the coronation.) This film doesn't show it, but there's a sensational painting by Jacques Louis David that depicts Napoleon crowning Josephine, with Pope Pius VII sitting behind him.<br /><br />Next, they mention the Pont Neuf, &#34;New Bridge,&#34; the oldest bridge in Paris.

This movie has one of the best musical scores, ever! Brilliantly written, acted and directed by Emilio Estevez. This is very much a Sheen/Estevez family affair with contributions by many family members as actors, producers, etc. The casting is spot-on. Sheen and Yorick van Wageningen (as Joost from Amsterdam) really shine in their roles, with wonderful performances by Deborah Kara Unger (as Sarah, with her painful history) and James Nesbitt (as Jack, a writer with &#34;writer's block&#34;).<br /><br />&#34;Margaret Mead didn't become a great cultural anthropologist by staying in school,&#34; says Tom's son Daniel, who has a strong calling to travel the world. So, instead of finishing his doctorate, Daniel travels and unfortunately gets caught in a storm in the Pyrenees. (Again, the cast of characters highlights anthropology/sociology: Captain Henri (Tcheky Karyo), Angelica (Angela Molina), El Ramon (Eusebio Lazaro), are among my favorites, running the gamut of human emotions and circumstances.)<br /><br />*** SPOILER ALERT -- DON'T READ FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS ***<br /><br />Tom goes to Spain's Basque Country to retrieve the body of his only son. He decides to walk The Camino de Santiago from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago de Compostela, and then further to Muxia, scattering Daniel's ashes along the way.<br /><br />The spirit of Daniel is very much with Tom along the way. Tom also makes the acquaintance of three other trekkers, or peregrinos, who form close friendships after some early conflicts, underscoring one of my favorite quotes: &#34;To understand all is to forgive all.&#34;<br /><br />Toward the end, the film pays homage to Santiago de Compostela: exterior scenes from the distance and close up, St. James at the entrance, inside the church, and a mass with clergy getting the huge incense burner (botafumeiro) airborne, swinging from the nave to the chancel (an awesome scene!) on its enormous arc.<br /><br />At the suggestion of Ishmael, a gypsy with integrity, Tom goes the extra mile, taking Daniel's remaining ashes to Muxia, to the sea, where Tom reaches catharsis.<br /><br />Scenes of the Spanish countryside highlight the beauty of this route: a field under the Milky Way. A corridor where miracles can happen.<br /><br />Since all four travelers are seeking something along the way that they hope to find resolved by their destination, I could not stop myself from remembering &#34;The Wizard of Oz.&#34; In spite of heartfelt sentiments in both films, I think &#34;The Way&#34; is the more serious of the two.\nReview Title: Epiphany & Catharsis Along The Way\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Kundalini Yoga With Grace & Strength\nReview Date: 2016/09/18\nStore: Rated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Special Interests\nProduct Description: ['From the Back Cover', 'With Grace & Strength', \"is a video that delivers.

Their relationship has reached a critical point. Mary's beliefs led to the breakdown of her marriage and left a teenage Chris with some emotional scars, so the topic comes with baggage. Trying to keep an open mind, Chris agrees to enter Mary's world.\"]\nAverage Rating: 3.5\nProduct Details: {'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Daniel Brown']}\nReview Text: In this thought-provoking documentary, Mary Rodwell, therapist to the alien abduction community, travels around Australia with her scientifically minded, skeptical son, Chris in tow.<br /><br />I found this documentary to brilliantly written and edited and I think it gives a balanced and honest portrayal of the people featured: loving mother and son, &#34;flippant&#34; Australian astrophysicist (Dr. Lion Weaver) and an audience full of skeptical (bordering on rude) students, an astronomer (Dr. Rhagvir Bhathel) who filters signals from deep space, a roomful of folks interested in the topic (members of one of Mary's support groups, I believe), some of whom had actually sighted UFOs, a polygraph tester (Gavin Wilson) for the Federal Police, and two men who claimed to have had close encounters with aliens.<br /><br />The first of these two men, Greg Dinal, claimed he had seen a UFO in 1967, describing it as a reddish ball in the sky that grew until it was as big as a football field. His experiences did not pass the lie detector test, although in telling his story, I found him entirely credible. The second man, Peter Curry, described an incredible experience that happened at 7:15 a.m. in 1992. He awoke to find a blonde female &#34;straddling&#34; him. He obtained evidence (hairs) that were scientifically tested. The DNA results: close to human; rare Chinese Mongoloid type; near African pygmy. The polygraph expert asked him if there were five aliens in his home at Hurlstone Park and he affirmed this. He passed the polygraph test.<br /><br />Mary shows Chris a video of lights in the sky, at night, near Silbury Hill in England, where crop circles have appeared. Neither Mary nor Chris can determine exactly what the lights are.<br /><br />There was nothing in this documentary that caused me to believe that anyone has ever been abducted by aliens, although I do believe it is possible. And the hairs that Peter Curry collected and the subsequent DNA results lend credibility to alien visitations of humans. My own personal belief is that aliens have probably visited Earth, perhaps between 20,000 and 40,000 years ago and possibly more recently. I base this on Puma Punku in Bolivia and some evidence in a documentary titled &#34;Pyramid Code&#34; about ancient sites in Egypt. Erich von Daniken's book, &#34;Chariots of the Gods&#34; (1968) also presented a lot of intriguing evidence. (My belief is that aliens visited Earth and that they might have altered DNA of early people. I have no idea if they have visited us in modern times, but I don't see why not, especially if they want to see the results of their experimentation.) These sites were not covered in &#34;My Mum Talks to Aliens,&#34; which focuses on people who have been abducted.<br /><br />So, like Mary's son Chris, I remain skeptical but open-minded about those individuals who claim to have been abducted by aliens. But Mary believes it, and she is a wonderful supporter of those who claim to have had those experiences.<br /><br />As for crop circles, I suspect that some technical genius(es) in England invented personal drones long before they hit the mainstream. I believe that they then programmed those drones to follow a template, knocking wheat or corn over in fields for whatever reason -- to test the accuracy of their drones, or to baffle the rest of us.\nReview Title: Fighting A Fight She Believes In\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2016/12/17\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Alcohol use', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a)', 'Italiano', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', 'Polski', '\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e', 'Portugu\u00eas', 'Deutsch', 'Fran\u00e7ais'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', '\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629', '\u010ce\u0161tina', 'Dansk', 'Deutsch', '\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a)', 'Suomi', 'Filipino', 'Fran\u00e7ais', '\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea', '\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940', 'Magyar', 'Indonesia', 'Italiano', '\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e', '\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4', 'Bahasa Melayu', 'Norsk Bokm\u00e5l', 'Nederlands', 'Polski', 'Portugu\u00eas (Brasil)', 'Portugu\u00eas (Portugal)', 'Rom\u00e2n\u0103', '\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439', 'Svenska', '\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bcd', '\u0c24\u0c46\u0c32\u0c41\u0c17\u0c41', '\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22', 'T\u00fcrk\u00e7e', '\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430', 'Ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t', '\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7b80\u4f53\uff09', '\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7e41\u9ad4\uff09'], 'Directors': ['Paul Weitz', 'Roman Coppola', 'Will Graham', 'Patricia Rozema', 'Azazel Jacobs', 'Tricia Brock', 'Gael Garcia Bernal'], 'Producers': ['Paul Weitz', 'Roman Coppola', 'Jason Schwartzman', 'Will Graham'], 'Starring': ['Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal', 'Lola Kirke', 'Saffron Burrows'], 'Studio': ['Amazon Studios']}\nReview Text: I love the series, the actors and the casting.

We both thought that Alex Maier did a phenomenal job with this film -- interviews, music, etc. -- but especially the editing! And we both appreciated his articulate, eloquent narration. Alex had to navigate tricky spots several times to set up his camera, make the climb, and retrieve his camera. He really captured the essence of America's arid landscape as he backpacked 800 miles across southern Utah and northern Arizona. Some of this terrain is tough! At times he went hours without water and other times he was chest deep in water at the base of steep canyons. A recurring theme is the self-empowerment of solving problems and figuring one's way out of tricky situations. He makes mistakes along the way and accepts those with humor and humility. I loved the recurring footage of shooting stars in the night sky!

We almost stopped this movie after hijackers took over the plane, but we stuck with it. It left me feeling a little rattled. But the next day I found myself thinking about the two main characters. One is Tobias Ellis (virtuoso performance by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) the pilot and the other is Vedat (brilliant performance by Omid Memar), a terrorist who wasn't in on the end game of the terrorist's plan. Tobias Ellis, a role model of a human being, keeps his head under horrific circumstances, always putting his concern for others ahead of himself. Vedat is an emotional basket case who trusted his mentor, a man who wanted to draw attention to injustice through terrorism. Once the hijacking occurs, the tension level rises and keeps on rising right up until the penultimate minute. And, today it had me thinking about what a famous peacemaker once said about the true measure of a man and his actions in times of controversy and challenges.",
