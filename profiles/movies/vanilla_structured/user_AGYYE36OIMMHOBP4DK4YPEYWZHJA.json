I also have no interest in Dancing with the Stars, so I wasn't caught up in the, \"OMG! Dmitry is teaching me how to dance!\" thing.<br /><br />Pros:  The dances might be fun, if you can figure out how to do them.<br /><br />Cons: There is little in the way of instruction, and the *instructors* seem to assume you can catch on after one quick demonstration - which is generally badly explained and poorly filmed. I am sorry, but saying, \"Okay? Got it? Let's do it to tempo...\" each time a step is shown does not count as *teaching* a step...<br /><br />A dancer may know the moves merely by name, but I doubt a dancer has need of a video like this.<br /><br />The instructors seem to have a limited repertoire of comments - I quickly tired of hearing, \"Excellent... Excellent.  That's great!  Excellent!\"<br /><br />There is NO warm-up - which could result in injury to someone who does not understand the importance of limbering up your muscles before launching into a workout routine.<br /><br />The cool down is limited and rather boring.  It felt tacked on and rather useless.<br /><br />All in all, I much prefer my other dance workout vids over this one.<br /><br />And I have to say, these female dancers have some of the most well endowed chests I've seen on slender dancer types.\nReview Title: Too Little Instruction\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: 10 Minute Solution: Hip Hop Dance Mix\nReview Date: 2011/04/19\nStore: Kristin Jacobs  (Actor),     Andrea Ambandos  (Director)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Exercise & Fitness\nProduct Description: ['Ten minutes is all it takes to dance your way to a slimmer, more sculpted body using the latest hip-hop moves.

I  have bad knees, and there are too many twisting moves in these routines that could cause me injury.  I noted that the days after doing this workout, my knees would ache. I finally put two and two together and started substituting for those moves, but that kind of defeats the purpose.<br /><br />I also found I never worked up much of a sweat with this one and did not hit my target heart rate.  This is likely due to the fact I could never quite pull off the moves, what with my knees, my carpeted floor, and the fact that I am not coordinated enough to get the upper and lower body moves to mesh well.<br /><br />Not only was this workout a disappointment physically, I didn't seem to have as much fun doing these moves as I do some of my other workouts.  The dances just didn't flow for me.  I seem to do much better with my other 10 Minute mixes.  There is nothing wrong with the instructor. She is enthusiastic and fresh (if a bit fast paced), but this was just not the right DVD for me.

It has some of my favorite elements.  I like the mile by mile structure, so I can play one mile, or combine them.  I appreciate the high energy of the walkers, the fact that Leslie has someone show a modified lower impact version, the ability to play it with or without the instruction/verbal track, and the music... I think this is some of the best music on her DVDs if, like me, you enjoy electronica and dance techno style. But my favorite element is likely the color changes in the outfits.  I like that each mile, the costumes change to follow a shared color scheme - I love details like that and I LOVE color and design... (Even the lighting on the Walk At Home sign changes every mile!) My favorite Leslie DVDs tend to be the ones with color embellishments, like the HIIT Dance Party walks and the color miles on the Ultimate 5 day Walk Plan. The moves are traditional Leslie, so nothing much new here, except the use of short high energy boosts of various types - but I find that if you've done one Leslie workout, you have a pretty good idea of the types of moves you will need to be able to accomplish.  She does keep switching things up, so I never get bored, but everything is pretty easy to master. On the downside, the warmup and cool down are both inserted into the first and last miles respectively, so if you just choose something like mile 3, there is not warm up or cool down.  I prefer when the warm up and the cool down are separate so I can use them with any combination of miles.  Also, Leslie seems to do more chatting in this one, moving around and talking to everyone while in the middle of the workout rather than leading the steps.  That's okay with me on some level as I always enjoy getting to know the other walkers a bit - it is amazing how much personality can come through just by watching someone walk! - but it seems a bit heavy handed this time.  Michael was the other distraction. He is a new backup walker, and seems a bit of a class clown, wanting to be the focus of attention.  It is obvious he and his wife are a high energy couple and were having a great time.  I admire their sense of fun and energy, but I also found his antics a bit wearisome after a while.  Still, I will probably just learn to ignore them more as I watch the workout more often.  Maybe this different approach is a marketing strategy, trying to appeal to a younger audience or something.  I certainly have noticed a that Leslie's videos have changed through out the years, become more colorful and playful, with a better musical soundtrack (in my opinion)  and with younger walkers - so maybe this is more of the same.\nReview Title: Another winner!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: DANCE That WALK \u2013 5000 Steps in One Easy Low Impact Walking Workout DVD\nReview Date: 2016/07/11\nStore: Gina Buber  (Actor, Director),     Ella Charles  (Director)    Rated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Exercise & Fitness\nProduct Description: ['Walking is the ultimate form of low-impact exercise for people of all ages and fitness levels.', 'But, walking can be boring, as well as weather and busy schedules can make it hard to get outside or fit a cardio workout into your day.

I am in my mid 50's and used to low to intermediate workouts but this one did not challenge me at all.  For example, I love a good Leslie Sansone workout but steer away from overly strenuous or high impact routines.  I think with this one, I probably would have gotten more of a workout sweeping my porch.  However, it makes a great workout for someone new to exercising, someone with limited mobility or an elderly person who wants a basic workout without the risk of injury.  I gave it to my mother and I think she will enjoy it - some of the music will bring back memories for her!\nReview Title: Great for certain exercisers, but not going to burn many calories.\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Build Balance and Inner Strength, 3 Low Impact, Core Cardio Workouts, Walk Strong 2.0 with Jessica Smith\nReview Date: 2016/08/24\nStore: Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Exercise & Fitness\nProduct Description: ['Lose your shoes to gain balance, postural alignment, core strength, range of motion -- even foot and ankle strength and mobility with these low impact, fusion-style routines.

It starts off so gently, I made the mistake of thinking it would be a cake walk... was I wrong!  Each of these workouts really did stretch me, and I ended up winded and sweaty!  Granted, I am not a heavy duty exercise queen, but I work out daily, even if for a short time and I am in pretty good shape.  This was a nice alternative to my usual cardio walk.  I like that each session was different and had a different focus as I tend to get &#34;bored&#34; with my workout DVDs fairly quickly and when I get bored, I end up making excuses not to exercise... This one has enough variety to keep me interested for a while.  I especially liked the second session that almost had a &#34;mindfulness&#34; feel to it - a Yoga, pilates, Thai chi kind of thing going on - relaxing, yet invigorating and challenging. Jessica and her mom work well together and are fun to watch - Jessica is encouraging while still being &#34;genuine&#34; and I don't get the forced &#34;cheerful cheerleader&#34; vibe I do from some other instructors. It can't be easy to encourage folks to do something many of us do not necessarily enjoy, so kudos to her for managing to do so and to do it without repeating the same platitudes like &#34;excellent&#34;, &#34;great&#34;, or &#34;good&#34; over and over ad nausea.

I also have other workout DVDs which require more concentration to keep up with the numerous steps - but I always know that if I am just not in the mood to fuss with steps, I can pull out one of my Leslie DVDs and get a good workout without the need to learn new moves.  I was a little hesitant to buy this new collection because I thought it would just be one mile on the first DVD, then that same mile with a new one for the second DVD, then the first two and a new third mile, etc.  But it turns out that each DVD has completely NEW miles and you can play them individually or in a sequence.  So in essence, you are getting a wide selection of miles with this set - and they all follow a similar sequence (slower pace - boosted fast pace - miracle mile toning session) so you get variation as well as familiarity. This is great for someone like me, because my time to work out varies a great deal and it is nice to be able to pick and choose what I need for the day.  The music is good, if somewhat repetitive and the use of the \"Miracle Miles band\" adds some basic toning work to the walk... all in all I was very pleased with this set and will get a lot of use out of it.

It has some of my favorite elements.  I like the mile by mile structure, so I can play one mile, or combine them.  I appreciate the high energy of the walkers, the fact that Leslie has someone show a modified lower impact version, the ability to play it with or without the instruction/verbal track, and the music... I think this is some of the best music on her DVDs if, like me, you enjoy electronica and dance techno style. But my favorite element is likely the color changes in the outfits.  I like that each mile, the costumes change to follow a shared color scheme - I love details like that and I LOVE color and design... (Even the lighting on the Walk At Home sign changes every mile!) My favorite Leslie DVDs tend to be the ones with color embellishments, like the HIIT Dance Party walks and the color miles on the Ultimate 5 day Walk Plan. The moves are traditional Leslie, so nothing much new here, except the use of short high energy boosts of various types - but I find that if you've done one Leslie workout, you have a pretty good idea of the types of moves you will need to be able to accomplish.  She does keep switching things up, so I never get bored, but everything is pretty easy to master. On the downside, the warmup and cool down are both inserted into the first and last miles respectively, so if you just choose something like mile 3, there is not warm up or cool down.  I prefer when the warm up and the cool down are separate so I can use them with any combination of miles.  Also, Leslie seems to do more chatting in this one, moving around and talking to everyone while in the middle of the workout rather than leading the steps.  That's okay with me on some level as I always enjoy getting to know the other walkers a bit - it is amazing how much personality can come through just by watching someone walk! - but it seems a bit heavy handed this time.  Michael was the other distraction. He is a new backup walker, and seems a bit of a class clown, wanting to be the focus of attention.  It is obvious he and his wife are a high energy couple and were having a great time.  I admire their sense of fun and energy, but I also found his antics a bit wearisome after a while.  Still, I will probably just learn to ignore them more as I watch the workout more often.  Maybe this different approach is a marketing strategy, trying to appeal to a younger audience or something.  I certainly have noticed a that Leslie's videos have changed through out the years, become more colorful and playful, with a better musical soundtrack (in my opinion)  and with younger walkers - so maybe this is more of the same.\nAnother winner!\nDANCE That WALK \u2013 5000 Steps in One Easy Low Impact Walking Workout DVD\nGina Buber  (Actor, Director),     Ella Charles  (Director)    Rated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Exercise & Fitness\n['Walking is the ultimate form of low-impact exercise for people of all ages and fitness levels.', 'But, walking can be boring, as well as weather and busy schedules can make it hard to get outside or fit a cardio workout into your day.

I am in my mid 50's and used to low to intermediate workouts but this one did not challenge me at all.  For example, I love a good Leslie Sansone workout but steer away from overly strenuous or high impact routines.  I think with this one, I probably would have gotten more of a workout sweeping my porch.  However, it makes a great workout for someone new to exercising, someone with limited mobility or an elderly person who wants a basic workout without the risk of injury.  I gave it to my mother and I think she will enjoy it - some of the music will bring back memories for her!\nGreat for certain exercisers, but not going to burn many calories.\nBuild Balance and Inner Strength, 3 Low Impact, Core Cardio Workouts, Walk Strong 2.0 with Jessica Smith\nFormat: DVD\nMovies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Exercise & Fitness\n['Lose your shoes to gain balance, postural alignment, core strength, range of motion -- even foot and ankle strength and mobility with these low impact, fusion-style routines.

It starts off so gently, I made the mistake of thinking it would be a cake walk... was I wrong!  Each of these workouts really did stretch me, and I ended up winded and sweaty!  Granted, I am not a heavy duty exercise queen, but I work out daily, even if for a short time and I am in pretty good shape.  This was a nice alternative to my usual cardio walk.  I like that each session was different and had a different focus as I tend to get &#34;bored&#34; with my workout DVDs fairly quickly and when I get bored, I end up making excuses not to exercise... This one has enough variety to keep me interested for a while.  I especially liked the second session that almost had a &#34;mindfulness&#34; feel to it - a Yoga, pilates, Thai chi kind of thing going on - relaxing, yet invigorating and challenging. Jessica and her mom work well together and are fun to watch - Jessica is encouraging while still being &#34;genuine&#34; and I don't get the forced &#34;cheerful cheerleader&#34; vibe I do from some other instructors. It can't be easy to encourage folks to do something many of us do not necessarily enjoy, so kudos to her for managing to do so and to do it without repeating the same platitudes like &#34;excellent&#34;, &#34;great&#34;, or &#34;good&#34; over and over ad nausea.

I also have other workout DVDs which require more concentration to keep up with the numerous steps - but I always know that if I am just not in the mood to fuss with steps, I can pull out one of my Leslie DVDs and get a good workout without the need to learn new moves.  I was a little hesitant to buy this new collection because I thought it would just be one mile on the first DVD, then that same mile with a new one for the second DVD, then the first two and a new third mile, etc.  But it turns out that each DVD has completely NEW miles and you can play them individually or in a sequence.  So in essence, you are getting a wide selection of miles with this set - and they all follow a similar sequence (slower pace - boosted fast pace - miracle mile toning session) so you get variation as well as familiarity. This is great for someone like me, because my time to work out varies a great deal and it is nice to be able to pick and choose what I need for the day.  The music is good, if somewhat repetitive and the use of the \"Miracle Miles band\" adds some basic toning work to the walk... all in all I was very pleased with this set and will get a lot of use out of it.

I also have no interest in Dancing with the Stars, so I wasn't caught up in the, \"OMG! Dmitry is teaching me how to dance!\" thing.<br /><br />Pros:  The dances might be fun, if you can figure out how to do them.<br /><br />Cons: There is little in the way of instruction, and the *instructors* seem to assume you can catch on after one quick demonstration - which is generally badly explained and poorly filmed. I am sorry, but saying, \"Okay? Got it? Let's do it to tempo...\" each time a step is shown does not count as *teaching* a step...<br /><br />A dancer may know the moves merely by name, but I doubt a dancer has need of a video like this.<br /><br />The instructors seem to have a limited repertoire of comments - I quickly tired of hearing, \"Excellent... Excellent.  That's great!  Excellent!\"<br /><br />There is NO warm-up - which could result in injury to someone who does not understand the importance of limbering up your muscles before launching into a workout routine.<br /><br />The cool down is limited and rather boring.  It felt tacked on and rather useless.<br /><br />All in all, I much prefer my other dance workout vids over this one.<br /><br />And I have to say, these female dancers have some of the most well endowed chests I've seen on slender dancer types.\nReview Title: Too Little Instruction\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: 10 Minute Solution: Hip Hop Dance Mix\nReview Date: 2011/04/19\nStore: Kristin Jacobs  (Actor),     Andrea Ambandos  (Director)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Exercise & Fitness\nProduct Description: ['Ten minutes is all it takes to dance your way to a slimmer, more sculpted body using the latest hip-hop moves.

I  have bad knees, and there are too many twisting moves in these routines that could cause me injury.  I noted that the days after doing this workout, my knees would ache. I finally put two and two together and started substituting for those moves, but that kind of defeats the purpose.<br /><br />I also found I never worked up much of a sweat with this one and did not hit my target heart rate.  This is likely due to the fact I could never quite pull off the moves, what with my knees, my carpeted floor, and the fact that I am not coordinated enough to get the upper and lower body moves to mesh well.<br /><br />Not only was this workout a disappointment physically, I didn't seem to have as much fun doing these moves as I do some of my other workouts.

I am in my mid 50's and used to low to intermediate workouts but this one did not challenge me at all.  For example, I love a good Leslie Sansone workout but steer away from overly strenuous or high impact routines.  I think with this one, I probably would have gotten more of a workout sweeping my porch.  However, it makes a great workout for someone new to exercising, someone with limited mobility or an elderly person who wants a basic workout without the risk of injury.  I gave it to my mother and I think she will enjoy it - some of the music will bring back memories for her!\nReview Title: Great for certain exercisers, but not going to burn many calories.\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Build Balance and Inner Strength, 3 Low Impact, Core Cardio Workouts, Walk Strong 2.0 with Jessica Smith\nReview Date: 2016/08/24\nStore: Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Exercise & Fitness\nProduct Description: ['Lose your shoes to gain balance, postural alignment, core strength, range of motion -- even foot and ankle strength and mobility with these low impact, fusion-style routines.

It starts off so gently, I made the mistake of thinking it would be a cake walk... was I wrong!  Each of these workouts really did stretch me, and I ended up winded and sweaty!  Granted, I am not a heavy duty exercise queen, but I work out daily, even if for a short time and I am in pretty good shape.  This was a nice alternative to my usual cardio walk.  I like that each session was different and had a different focus as I tend to get &#34;bored&#34; with my workout DVDs fairly quickly and when I get bored, I end up making excuses not to exercise... This one has enough variety to keep me interested for a while.  I especially liked the second session that almost had a &#34;mindfulness&#34; feel to it - a Yoga, pilates, Thai chi kind of thing going on - relaxing, yet invigorating and challenging. Jessica and her mom work well together and are fun to watch - Jessica is encouraging while still being &#34;genuine&#34; and I don't get the forced &#34;cheerful cheerleader&#34; vibe I do from some other instructors. It can't be easy to encourage folks to do something many of us do not necessarily enjoy, so kudos to her for managing to do so and to do it without repeating the same platitudes like &#34;excellent&#34;, &#34;great&#34;, or &#34;good&#34; over and over ad nausea.  I purchased this one as a test, to see if I might like the whole series - now I definitely will have to check out the other DVDs!\nReview Title: Two thumbs up!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Walk On: 3-DVD Set: 6, 30 Minute Walking Workouts\nReview Date: 2018/05/30\nStore: Jessica Smith  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Exercise & Fitness\nProduct Description: ['Get our classic \"Walk On: 3 DVD Super Set\" 2014 collection!

I also have other workout DVDs which require more concentration to keep up with the numerous steps - but I always know that if I am just not in the mood to fuss with steps, I can pull out one of my Leslie DVDs and get a good workout without the need to learn new moves.  I was a little hesitant to buy this new collection because I thought it would just be one mile on the first DVD, then that same mile with a new one for the second DVD, then the first two and a new third mile, etc.  But it turns out that each DVD has completely NEW miles and you can play them individually or in a sequence.  So in essence, you are getting a wide selection of miles with this set - and they all follow a similar sequence (slower pace - boosted fast pace - miracle mile toning session) so you get variation as well as familiarity. This is great for someone like me, because my time to work out varies a great deal and it is nice to be able to pick and choose what I need for the day.  The music is good, if somewhat repetitive and the use of the \"Miracle Miles band\" adds some basic toning work to the walk... all in all I was very pleased with this set and will get a lot of use out of it.  Thanks Leslie and team!\nReview Title: Lots of variety!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Feel Good Fusion with Jessica Smith: Barefoot Cardio, Strength, Pilates, Barre and Yoga Mix DVD, Fat Burning, Sculpting, Toning Low Impact Exercise (No Floor Work)\nReview Date: 2019/07/07\nStore: Jessica Smith  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Exercise & Fitness\nProduct Description: ['Surrounded by blue skies and sunshine with the ocean as our backdrop, these two barefoot routines develop balance, coordination, strength, endurance, but overall, a sense of well-being, enjoyment, and energy!
