But it does surprise me that as glad as the people were to be rid of Saddam and no longer be under a dictator, that the video creator would work so hard to make that look negative. Instead of talking about the free trade, he talks about the porn that is part of the free trade. Instead of talking about how the Iraqi soldiers are smiling and glad to not be serving a dictator, he talks about how they are making less money and have equipment that isn't as good as it used to be. Instead of talking about how the people are now able to have more opportunity at education and how women are able to be educated at all, he talks about how the tech school has been looted and needs computers. Instead of talking about all the happy people he comes in contact with, he talks about how some streets are barricaded off and there are lines for gas.  He talks about how safe the Kurdish region is but neglects to mention how much pain and agony they were in with ethnic cleansing, WMDs against them, and total suppression under Saddam before the war.  When he saw the weapons sale, he acted like it was a bad thing.  Instead of talking about how the people are now able to buy weapons to protect themselves, he makes it sound like the people there were just looking for ways to attack passing cars.... which just means the creator of the video lives in a country where he doesn't have to worry about a dictator overtaking him and his family every day.<br /><br />When he was with the soldiers and he had the chance to talk about (and talk to the soldiers about) all the great things they have done while they have been there to bring peace and help rebuild, instead he paints the troops as XBOX playing lonely saps who are stuck because we haven't brought them back yet... hardly what the soldiers would have said if he had asked them and posted their answers. Yes, they miss home. Yes, they miss spending Christmas back at home.  But every soldier I talk to was glad they were there and have LOTS of great stories about making a difference in the lives of those in Iraq and helping a country where only a select few used to have opportunity before.... and now the masses all have a shot at success. Oh, but the cussing complainers, he had room on the video for them...<br /><br />He keeps repeating how little money the Iraqis make, how many people get turned away from being able to work, how much effort it takes for them to be able to work. But he doesn't bother to talk about how little prospect they had when everything was run by a select few under Saddam (they were mostly unemployed peasants).  He mentions that most can't even read and write their own language and that we are training them. But instead of presenting it like the blessing it is (we actually pay THEM to learn), he paints it like we are pushing our rules on them and like it is propaganda time instead of language learning time. At 65 minutes in, he shows where we shot people who were where they should not be and they knew the penalty. Yet, the video creator paints it like they are shooting innocent people and even says, \"Do we know if they are armed or maybe even surrendering\"... Again, clearly the mindset of someone who has not been in that position before. I travel all over the world. I would be an idiot to think that when I am in dangerous places that the rules don't change.  That wasn't downtown Atlanta. The video creator tries to make our Army look like the Iraqi people must hate them shooting in the town in the middle of the night... but that isn't the case and the video creator never bothered to interview the people in the town and ask them.  But, thankfully, the soldiers understand better how to keep the law abiding people safe.  The law breakers get tired of it and that is the point.<br /><br />These people are willing to go through all this pain in order to be rid of a dictator and have a chance at success and providing for their families. They get paid $10 a day to get rid of landmines and they are very willing to do so.  The US led the way for them and the people there are grateful. It is unfortunate that the creator of the video neglected to point out these and many more reasons why (here is a great list of reasons why[...]<br />This video is old (2004 and older).  But I doubt it would have made a difference to the video creator when they made it. Their goal was to paint it as not worth it.  But they are wrong. There is no guarantee when Iraq is all on their own that it won't fall backwards instead of forward. But propaganda videos like this one work against the Iraqis and not for them.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe individual demonstrates a strong inclination towards critical and reflective analysis of media, specifically films and documentaries, as evidenced by polarized rating patterns. Consistently high ratings (4.1-5.0) coincide with positive anticipation or initial enjoyment of content, while starkly negative sentiments (1.0 ratings) emerge regarding perceived bias, propaganda, or deviations from expected themes, particularly concerning political and social issues. \n\nCommon themes include dissatisfaction when content appears to lack authenticity or a straightforward narrative. The individual appears particularly disillusioned with works that purport to be educational yet are dismissed as manipulative or inaccurate. This reflects a preference for media that presents well-researched and balanced viewpoints. Furthermore, there is an evident quality preference for storytelling that aligns with personal values, especially regarding nuanced takes on social issues and historical events, especially in relation to freedom and governance.\n\nPrice sensitivity is inferred indirectly; negative reactions seem to arise when perceived value (in terms of insights or entertainment) does not align with financial investment, suggesting that the person seeks a strong return on emotional or intellectual engagement for their expenditures. Overall, this analysis reveals a consumer keenly attuned to the authenticity and integrity of content, insisting on substantial intellectual engagement over mere entertainment.",
