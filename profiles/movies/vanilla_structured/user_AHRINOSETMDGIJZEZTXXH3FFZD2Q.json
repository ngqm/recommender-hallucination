The film goes nowhere, and it's half the story line that caries most crappy martial arts films, which is some foreigner or idiot trying to screw over China. I spent the last hour trying to figure out what the hell I just watched.\nReview Title: glad I was drunk\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2016/08/27\nAverage Rating: 4.3\nProduct Details: {'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Nima Nourizadeh'], 'Producers': ['Anthony Bregman', 'Kevin Frakes', 'Raj Brinder Singh', 'David Alpert', 'Britton Rizzio'], 'Starring': ['Jesse Eisenberg', 'Kristen Stewart', 'Topher Grace'], 'Studio': ['Lions Gate Films Inc.']}\nReview Text: Way too many plot holes.\nReview Title: plot holes everywhere\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2017/01/14\nAverage Rating: 3.7\nProduct Details: {'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Craig McMahon'], 'Producers': ['Craig McMahon', 'Cecil Chambers', 'Nathan Hill'], 'Starring': ['Sarah Oh'], 'Studio': ['Attic Underground Cinema']}\nReview Text: There were so many random moments in this film that distracted me because they had nothing to do with the main story line or they were incomplete thoughts.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe individual exhibits distinct patterns in their ratings and sentiments, often oscillating between high appreciation and strong dissatisfaction. A noticeable preference for character-driven narratives and engaging plots emerges, particularly reflected in higher ratings for well-structured content. Conversely, their ratings drop significantly for films perceived as lacking depth or coherence, highlighting an aversion to poorly executed storylines.\n\nCommon themes include a taste for drama and character exploration, but the individual values successful adaptations of written works, as evidenced by their frustration when key story elements are misrepresented. They are drawn to concise, meaningful narratives over convoluted plots or excessive filler, suggesting a preference for quality over quantity.\n\nIn terms of quality and price sensitivity, the reviewer demonstrates a higher tolerance for mid-range pricing when satisfied with product quality, but exhibits strong disappointment at perceived value loss, leading to lower ratings for movies that do not meet expectations. The preference leans towards compelling storytelling and character growth, with less emphasis on visual spectacle if the narrative fails to resonate.\n\nOverall, the core preferences indicate a discerning viewer who enjoys thoughtful storytelling and character depth, yet shows a low tolerance for narratives that lack clarity or that misrepresent the essence of the source material.",
