A couple days later I again watched the preview and then rented it. This movie begins with Noni Jean (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) winning her first billboard award, getting into her car and arriving at her hotel. All seems well but she's not what she appears. She decides she's had enough and is ready to let her self fall off a balcony.<br /><br />The young officer who guards her hotel room door lets her mother in and sees what's going on. He rescues her and she rescues him in a way as well. The story is excellent, touching at times and gives us a taste of life as a celebrity with all the pressure and control that goes with it.<br /><br />I'd never heard of this movie which is a shame because it is one of the better films I've seen in a while. I even added two songs to my favorites playlist, Blackbird and Grateful.<br /><br />As others mention, it does feel at times to be formulaic, but it works for this film. Gugu Mbatha-Raw transforms from hot body superstar to everyday girl so effortlessly. Her emotions are so real that your heart will break for her. Nate Parker is that real and honest person who also sees first hand the pressure and drive a loving parent can put on their children. He's a cop, gets shot at, and knows all to well that life is a precious thing. He wants her to be true to herself and be what she wants to be, not what the world expects of her. You can't help but cheer for these two to make it work. The movies doesn't disappoint. It is almost a modern day fairytale, but perhaps for young adults rather than children.\nReview Title: unexpectedly great\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2018/01/09\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Alexander Baranov', 'Ramil Sabitov'], 'Producers': ['Aleksandr Akopov', 'Tatyana Belichenko', 'Liliya Chekster', 'Ekaterina Efanova', 'Aleksey Kublitskiy', 'Aleksandra Shakhnazarova', 'Natalia Shneiderova', 'Anton Zlatopolskiy'], 'Starring': ['Marina Alexandrova', 'Yulia Aug', 'Alexander Yatsenko'], 'Studio': ['MagellanTV']}\nReview Text: I would love to see more of Russian history like these.\nReview Title: Five Stars\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Battalion 2015 DVD-R .RUSSIAN LANGUAGE ENGLISH SUBTITLES WORLD WAR I WWI MOVIE (Produced by : Fyodor BONDARCHUK) Dmitriy MESKHIEV\nReview Date: 2018/01/28\nStore: Format: DVD-R  This title is manufactured on demand using DVD-R, when sold by Amazon.com.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe individual exhibits a strong preference for emotionally resonant and well-acted films, favoring genres that explore complex human experiences, such as drama and historical narratives. Consistently high ratings (4.3 and above) for emotionally impactful movies reveal a sentiment towards storytelling that is both profound and relatable. However, they express strong dissatisfaction for low-quality content, as evidenced by a notably low rating (1.0) for a film deemed \"worthless.\"\n\nAcross their purchases, there is a recurring interest in films with significant character development and challenges of celebrity life, indicating a thematic fascination with personal growth and societal pressures. This person also shows an inclination towards international cinema, particularly Russian films, reflecting a broader appreciation for diverse cultural narratives.\n\nQuality appears to be a critical factor in their purchases, as they are willing to invest in films that resonate with them, while showing caution towards lower-rated titles\u2014implying a moderate price sensitivity influenced by perceived value. Overall, this consumer values thoughtful and engaging cinema, often taking the time to discover new releases and assess their worth, demonstrating a calculated approach to their viewing habits.",
