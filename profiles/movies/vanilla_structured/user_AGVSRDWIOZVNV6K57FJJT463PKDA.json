What a stinker. Plot is awful. Characters thin. Effects cheesy. \"Sets\" phony. The very idea of buying this on Blu-ray is laughable. Sheen is a joke. He should stick to what he knows: one-line sex jokes, hookers and beating up his wives.<br /><br />This is a third world-produced \"film\" that should have gone straight to video that I'd perhaps buy used for $1 at a garage sale, and then throw away to save space. This makes Plan 9 From Outer Space look plausible.<br /><br />Man am I glad I saw it on a backwater channel and didn't put any money out on this turkey, even as a rental. There is no doubt why it failed at the box office. It would have failed at 2:00 AM on Syfy channel.<br /><br />If this is what passes for good sci-fi, y'all have a pretty low threshold for quality.\nReview Title: Stinker\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: American Horror Story: Season 1\nReview Date: 2012/12/29\nStore: Connie Britton  (Actor),     Dylan McDermott  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Boxed Sets, Television\nProduct Description: [\"Brace yourself for an addictive thrill ride!

When we first see him, he is somewhere in the Peruvian jungle in 1936, running a booby trapped gauntlet (complete with an over sized rolling boulder) to fetch a solid gold idol. He loses this artifact to his chief rival, a French archeologist named Belloq (Paul Freeman), who then prepares to kill our hero. In the first of many serial like escapes, Indy eludes Belloq by hopping into a convenient plane. So, then: is Indiana Jones afraid of anything? Yes, snakes. The next time we see Jones, he\\'s a soft spoken, bespectacled professor. He is then summoned from his ivy covered environs by Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) to find the long lost Ark of the Covenant. The Nazis, it seems, are already searching for the Ark, which the mystical minded Hitler hopes to use to make his stormtroopers invincible. But to find the Ark, Indy must first secure a medallion kept under the protection of Indy\\'s old friend Abner Ravenwood, whose daughter, Marion (Karen Allen), evidently has a \"history\" with Jones. Whatever their personal differences, Indy and Marion become partners in one action packed adventure after another, ranging from wandering the snake pits of the Well of Souls to surviving the pyrotechnic unearthing of the sacred Ark. A joint project of Hollywood prodigies George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, with a script co written by Lawrence Kasdan and Philip Kaufman, among others, Raiders of the Lost Ark is not so much a movie as a 115 minute thrill ride. Costing 22 million dollars (nearly three times the original estimate), Raiders of the Lost Ark reaped 200 million dollars during its first run. It was followed by Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1985) and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), as well as a short lived TV series \"prequel.\"', 'Temple of Doom', 'The second of the George Lucas/Steven Spielberg', 'Indiana Jones', 'epics is set a year or so before the events in', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', \"(1984). After a brief brouhaha involving a precious vial and a wild ride down a raging Himalyan river, Indy (Harrison Ford) gets down to the problem at hand: retrieving a precious gem and several kidnapped young boys on behalf of a remote East Indian village. His companions this time around include a dimbulbed, easily frightened nightclub chanteuse (Kate Capshaw), and a feisty 12 year old kid named Short Round (Quan Ke Huy). Throughout, the plot takes second place to the thrills, which include a harrowing rollercoaster ride in an abandoned mineshaft and Indy's rescue of the heroine from a ritual sacrifice. There are also a couple of cute references to\", 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', \", notably a funny variation of Indy's shooting of the Sherpa warrior.\", 'Last Crusade', \"The third installment in the widely beloved Spielberg/Lucas Indiana Jones saga begins with an introduction to a younger Indy (played by the late River Phoenix), who, through a fast paced prologue, gives the audience insight into the roots of his taste for adventure, fear of snakes, and dogged determination to take historical artifacts out of the hands of bad guys and into the museums in which they belong. A grown up Indy (Harrison Ford) reveals himself shortly afterward in a familiar classroom scene, teaching archeology to a disproportionate number of starry eyed female college students in 1938. Once again, however, Mr. Jones is drawn away from his day job after an art collector (Julian Glover) approaches him with a proposition to find the much sought after Holy Grail. Circumstances reveal that there was another avid archeologist in search of the famed cup \u2014 Indiana Jones' father, Dr. Henry Jones (Sean Connery) \u2014 who had recently disappeared during his efforts. The junior and senior members of the Jones family find themselves in a series of tough situations in locales ranging from Venice to the most treacherous spots in the Middle East. Complicating the situation further is the presence of Elsa (Alison Doody), a beautiful and intelligent woman with one fatal flaw: she's an undercover Nazi agent. The search for the grail is a dangerous quest, and its discovery may prove fatal to those who seek it for personal gain. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade earned a then record breaking $50 million in its first week of release.\", 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull', 'Steven Spielberg and George Lucas bring you the greatest adventurer of all time in \u201ca nonstop thrill ride\u201d (Richard Corliss, TIME) that\u2019s packed with \u201csensational, awe inspiring spectacles\u201d (Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun Times).', 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull', 'finds Indy (Harrison Ford) trying to outrace a brilliant and beautiful agent (Cate Blanchett) for the mystical, all powerful Crystal Skull of Akator.

Expectations were high for this 1981 collaboration between the two men, who essentially invented the box office blockbuster with \u201870s efforts like', 'Jaws', 'and', 'Star Wars', ', and Spielberg (who directed) and Lucas (who co-wrote the story and executive produced) didn\u2019t disappoint. This wildly entertaining film has it all: non-stop action, exotic locations, grand spectacle, a hero for the ages, despicable villains, a beautiful love interest, humor, horror\u2026 not to mention lots of snakes. And along with all the bits that are so familiar by now--Indy (Harrison Ford) running from the giant boulder in a cave, using his pistol instead of his trusty whip to take out a scimitar-wielding bad guy, facing off with a hissing cobra, and on and on--there\u2019s real resonance in a potent storyline that brings together a profound religious-archaeological icon (the Ark of the Covenant, nothing less than \"a radio for speaking to God\") and the 20th century\u2019s most infamous criminals (the Nazis). Now', 'that\u2019s', 'entertainment.', '--Sam Graham', 'Temple of Doom', 'It\u2019s hard to imagine that a film with worldwide box office receipts topping $300 million worldwide could be labeled a disappointment, but some moviegoers considered', 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom', ', the second installment in Steven Spielberg and George Lucas\u2019 1980s adventure trilogy, to be just that. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a bad effort; any collaboration between these two cinema giants (Spielberg directed, while Lucas provided the story and was executive producer) is bound to have more than its share of terrific moments, and', 'Temple of Doom', 'is no exception. But in exchanging the very real threat of Nazi Germany for the cartoonish Thuggee cult, it loses some of the heft of its predecessor (', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', '); on the other hand, it\u2019s also the darkest and most disturbing of the three films, what with multiple scenes of children enslaved, a heart pulled out of a man\u2019s chest, and the immolation of a sacrificial victim, which makes it less fun than either', 'Raiders', 'or', 'The Last Crusade', ', notwithstanding a couple of riotous chase scenes and impressively grand sets. Many fans were also less than thrilled with the new love interest, a spoiled, querulous nightclub singer portrayed by Kate Capshaw, but a cute kid sidekick (\"Short Round,\" played by Ke Huy Quan) and, of course, the ever-reliable Harrison Ford as the cynical-but-swashbuckling hero more than make up for that character\u2019s shortcomings.', 'A six-minute introduction by Lucas and Spielberg is the prime special feature, with both men candidly addressing the film\u2019s good and bad points (Lucas points out that the second', 'Star Wars', 'film,', 'The Empire Strikes Back', ', was also the darkest of the original three; as for Spielberg, the fact that the leading lady would soon become his wife was the best part of the whole trip). Also good are \"The Creepy Crawlies,\" a mini-doc about the thousands of snakes, bugs, rats and other scary critters that populate the trilogy, and \"Travels with Indy,\" a look at some of the films\u2019 cool locations. Storyboards and a photo gallery are included as well.', '--Sam Graham', 'Last Crusade', 'Not as good as the first one, but better than the second. That\u2019s been the consensus opinion regarding', 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade', ', the final installment in Steven Spielberg and George Lucas\u2019 original adventure trilogy, throughout the nearly two decades since its 1989 theatrical release. It\u2019s a fair assessment. After the relatively dark and disturbing', 'Temple of Doom', '(1984),', 'The Last Crusade', '(1989) recalls the sheer fun of', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', '(1981). With its variety of colorful locations, multiple chase scenes (the opening sequence on a circus train, with River Phoenix as the young Indy, is one of the best of the series, as is the boat chase through the canals of Venice), and cloak-and-dagger vibe, it\u2019s the closest in tone to a James Bond outing, which director Spielberg has noted was the inspiration for the trilogy in the first place; what\u2019s more, it harkens back to', 'Raiders', \"in its choice of villains (i.e., the Nazis--Indy even comes face to face with Hitler at a rally in Berlin) and its quest for an antiquity of incalculable value and significance (the Holy Grail, the chalice said to have been the receptacle of Christ's blood as he hung on the cross). Add to that the presence of Sean Connery, playing Indy\u2019s father and having a field day opposite Harrison Ford, and you\u2019ve got a most welcome return to form.\", 'Special features include a six-minute introduction by Spielberg and Lucas, who discuss the grail as a metaphor for bringing Indy and his estranged father together and agree that', 'Crusade', 'is the funniest of the three films; \"Indy\u2019s Women,\" an American Film Institute tribute with leading ladies Karen Allen, Kate Capshaw, and Alison Doody each discussing her character (Capshaw candidly describes', 'Temple of Doom', '\u2019s Willie Scott as \"whiny, petulant, and annoying\"); \"Indy\u2019s Friends and Enemies,\" a look at the films\u2019 various villains and sidekicks; plus storyboards and photo galleries.', '--Sam Graham', 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull', 'Nearly 20 years after riding his last Crusade, Harrison Ford makes a welcome return as archaeologist/relic hunter Indiana Jones in', 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skul', \"l, an action-packed fourth installment that's, in a nutshell, less memorable than the first three but great nostalgia for fans of the series. Producer George Lucas and screenwriter David Koepp (\", 'War of the Worlds', \") set the film during the cold war, as the Soviets--replacing Nazis as Indy's villains of choice and led by a sword-wielding Cate Blanchett with black bob and sunglasses--are in pursuit of a crystal skull, which has mystical powers related to a city of gold. After escaping from them in a spectacular opening action sequence, Indy is coerced to head to Peru at the behest of a young greaser (Shia LaBeouf) whose friend--and Indy's colleague--Professor Oxley (John Hurt) has been captured for his knowledge of the skull's whereabouts. Whatever secrets the skull holds are tertiary; its reveal is the weakest part of the movie, as the CGI effects that inevitably accompany it feel jarring next to the boulder-rolling world of Indy audiences knew and loved. There's plenty of comedy, delightful stunts--ants play a deadly role here--and the return of\", 'Raiders', \"love interest Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, once shrill but now softened, giving her ex-love bemused glances and eye-rolls as he huffs his way to save the day. Which brings us to Ford: bullwhip still in hand, he's a little creakier, a lot grayer, but still twice the action hero of anyone in film today. With all the anticipation and hype leading up to the film's release, perhaps no reunion is sweeter than that of Ford with the role that fits him as snugly as that fedora hat.\", '--Ellen A.

When we first see him, he is somewhere in the Peruvian jungle in 1936, running a booby trapped gauntlet (complete with an over sized rolling boulder) to fetch a solid gold idol. He loses this artifact to his chief rival, a French archeologist named Belloq (Paul Freeman), who then prepares to kill our hero. In the first of many serial like escapes, Indy eludes Belloq by hopping into a convenient plane. So, then: is Indiana Jones afraid of anything? Yes, snakes. The next time we see Jones, he\\'s a soft spoken, bespectacled professor. He is then summoned from his ivy covered environs by Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) to find the long lost Ark of the Covenant. The Nazis, it seems, are already searching for the Ark, which the mystical minded Hitler hopes to use to make his stormtroopers invincible. But to find the Ark, Indy must first secure a medallion kept under the protection of Indy\\'s old friend Abner Ravenwood, whose daughter, Marion (Karen Allen), evidently has a \"history\" with Jones. Whatever their personal differences, Indy and Marion become partners in one action packed adventure after another, ranging from wandering the snake pits of the Well of Souls to surviving the pyrotechnic unearthing of the sacred Ark. A joint project of Hollywood prodigies George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, with a script co written by Lawrence Kasdan and Philip Kaufman, among others, Raiders of the Lost Ark is not so much a movie as a 115 minute thrill ride. Costing 22 million dollars (nearly three times the original estimate), Raiders of the Lost Ark reaped 200 million dollars during its first run. It was followed by Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1985) and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), as well as a short lived TV series \"prequel.\"', 'Temple of Doom', 'The second of the George Lucas/Steven Spielberg', 'Indiana Jones', 'epics is set a year or so before the events in', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', \"(1984). After a brief brouhaha involving a precious vial and a wild ride down a raging Himalyan river, Indy (Harrison Ford) gets down to the problem at hand: retrieving a precious gem and several kidnapped young boys on behalf of a remote East Indian village. His companions this time around include a dimbulbed, easily frightened nightclub chanteuse (Kate Capshaw), and a feisty 12 year old kid named Short Round (Quan Ke Huy). Throughout, the plot takes second place to the thrills, which include a harrowing rollercoaster ride in an abandoned mineshaft and Indy's rescue of the heroine from a ritual sacrifice. There are also a couple of cute references to\", 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', \", notably a funny variation of Indy's shooting of the Sherpa warrior.\", 'Last Crusade', \"The third installment in the widely beloved Spielberg/Lucas Indiana Jones saga begins with an introduction to a younger Indy (played by the late River Phoenix), who, through a fast paced prologue, gives the audience insight into the roots of his taste for adventure, fear of snakes, and dogged determination to take historical artifacts out of the hands of bad guys and into the museums in which they belong. A grown up Indy (Harrison Ford) reveals himself shortly afterward in a familiar classroom scene, teaching archeology to a disproportionate number of starry eyed female college students in 1938. Once again, however, Mr. Jones is drawn away from his day job after an art collector (Julian Glover) approaches him with a proposition to find the much sought after Holy Grail. Circumstances reveal that there was another avid archeologist in search of the famed cup \u2014 Indiana Jones' father, Dr. Henry Jones (Sean Connery) \u2014 who had recently disappeared during his efforts. The junior and senior members of the Jones family find themselves in a series of tough situations in locales ranging from Venice to the most treacherous spots in the Middle East. Complicating the situation further is the presence of Elsa (Alison Doody), a beautiful and intelligent woman with one fatal flaw: she's an undercover Nazi agent. The search for the grail is a dangerous quest, and its discovery may prove fatal to those who seek it for personal gain. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade earned a then record breaking $50 million in its first week of release.\", 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull', 'Steven Spielberg and George Lucas bring you the greatest adventurer of all time in \u201ca nonstop thrill ride\u201d (Richard Corliss, TIME) that\u2019s packed with \u201csensational, awe inspiring spectacles\u201d (Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun Times).', 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull', 'finds Indy (Harrison Ford) trying to outrace a brilliant and beautiful agent (Cate Blanchett) for the mystical, all powerful Crystal Skull of Akator.

This wildly entertaining film has it all: non-stop action, exotic locations, grand spectacle, a hero for the ages, despicable villains, a beautiful love interest, humor, horror\u2026 not to mention lots of snakes. And along with all the bits that are so familiar by now--Indy (Harrison Ford) running from the giant boulder in a cave, using his pistol instead of his trusty whip to take out a scimitar-wielding bad guy, facing off with a hissing cobra, and on and on--there\u2019s real resonance in a potent storyline that brings together a profound religious-archaeological icon (the Ark of the Covenant, nothing less than \"a radio for speaking to God\") and the 20th century\u2019s most infamous criminals (the Nazis). Now', 'that\u2019s', 'entertainment.', '--Sam Graham', 'Temple of Doom', 'It\u2019s hard to imagine that a film with worldwide box office receipts topping $300 million worldwide could be labeled a disappointment, but some moviegoers considered', 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom', ', the second installment in Steven Spielberg and George Lucas\u2019 1980s adventure trilogy, to be just that. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a bad effort; any collaboration between these two cinema giants (Spielberg directed, while Lucas provided the story and was executive producer) is bound to have more than its share of terrific moments, and', 'Temple of Doom', 'is no exception. But in exchanging the very real threat of Nazi Germany for the cartoonish Thuggee cult, it loses some of the heft of its predecessor (', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', '); on the other hand, it\u2019s also the darkest and most disturbing of the three films, what with multiple scenes of children enslaved, a heart pulled out of a man\u2019s chest, and the immolation of a sacrificial victim, which makes it less fun than either', 'Raiders', 'or', 'The Last Crusade', ', notwithstanding a couple of riotous chase scenes and impressively grand sets. Many fans were also less than thrilled with the new love interest, a spoiled, querulous nightclub singer portrayed by Kate Capshaw, but a cute kid sidekick (\"Short Round,\" played by Ke Huy Quan) and, of course, the ever-reliable Harrison Ford as the cynical-but-swashbuckling hero more than make up for that character\u2019s shortcomings.', 'A six-minute introduction by Lucas and Spielberg is the prime special feature, with both men candidly addressing the film\u2019s good and bad points (Lucas points out that the second', 'Star Wars', 'film,', 'The Empire Strikes Back', ', was also the darkest of the original three; as for Spielberg, the fact that the leading lady would soon become his wife was the best part of the whole trip). Also good are \"The Creepy Crawlies,\" a mini-doc about the thousands of snakes, bugs, rats and other scary critters that populate the trilogy, and \"Travels with Indy,\" a look at some of the films\u2019 cool locations. Storyboards and a photo gallery are included as well.', '--Sam Graham', 'Last Crusade', 'Not as good as the first one, but better than the second.

It\u2019s a fair assessment. After the relatively dark and disturbing', 'Temple of Doom', '(1984),', 'The Last Crusade', '(1989) recalls the sheer fun of', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', '(1981). With its variety of colorful locations, multiple chase scenes (the opening sequence on a circus train, with River Phoenix as the young Indy, is one of the best of the series, as is the boat chase through the canals of Venice), and cloak-and-dagger vibe, it\u2019s the closest in tone to a James Bond outing, which director Spielberg has noted was the inspiration for the trilogy in the first place; what\u2019s more, it harkens back to', 'Raiders', \"in its choice of villains (i.e., the Nazis--Indy even comes face to face with Hitler at a rally in Berlin) and its quest for an antiquity of incalculable value and significance (the Holy Grail, the chalice said to have been the receptacle of Christ's blood as he hung on the cross).

Producer George Lucas and screenwriter David Koepp (\", 'War of the Worlds', \") set the film during the cold war, as the Soviets--replacing Nazis as Indy's villains of choice and led by a sword-wielding Cate Blanchett with black bob and sunglasses--are in pursuit of a crystal skull, which has mystical powers related to a city of gold. After escaping from them in a spectacular opening action sequence, Indy is coerced to head to Peru at the behest of a young greaser (Shia LaBeouf) whose friend--and Indy's colleague--Professor Oxley (John Hurt) has been captured for his knowledge of the skull's whereabouts. Whatever secrets the skull holds are tertiary; its reveal is the weakest part of the movie, as the CGI effects that inevitably accompany it feel jarring next to the boulder-rolling world of Indy audiences knew and loved. There's plenty of comedy, delightful stunts--ants play a deadly role here--and the return of\", 'Raiders', \"love interest Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, once shrill but now softened, giving her ex-love bemused glances and eye-rolls as he huffs his way to save the day. Which brings us to Ford: bullwhip still in hand, he's a little creakier, a lot grayer, but still twice the action hero of anyone in film today.

Soon, their playful romantic dalliance turns into a complicated web of dangerous deceit as they are chased by Interpol, the Italian police, and Russian hit men in this suspense-filled, international action thriller.', 'Amazon.com', 'Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie use their star power to help propel', 'The Tourist', 'to its ultimate, satisfying destination. It just takes a little while to get there. Director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck (', 'The Lives of Others', ') sets a leisurely pace for', 'The Tourist', ', which lets the film be equal parts mystery, romance, thriller, and comedy. But because of its lush cinematography and location-based shooting,', 'The Tourist', \"is perhaps first and foremost a valentine to the city of Venice. Jolie plays Elise, an international woman of mystery, somehow caught up with a glamorous thief who's double-crossed a gangster, Shaw (Steven Berkoff, splendidly menacing). On a train from Paris to Venice, Elise meets Frank (Depp), a schlumpy math teacher from Wisconsin on holiday. Before the train hits Venice, poor Frank has become entangled in a dangerous web that he can't begin to understand. As the plot unfolds, a group of stone-headed thugs dashes after Frank and Elise, darting through canals, across tile rooftops, and into some of the most beautiful hotel rooms in the world. The cinematography of John Seale and the score by James Newton Howard set an immersive tone. Depp and Jolie do a respectable job with their roles, though perhaps because of the mysteries in the plot, as a couple, Elise and Frank lack a certain oomph. But the supporting actors, including Paul Bettany, Timothy Dalton, and Rufus Sewell, are uniformly excellent, and the story (based on the French film\", 'Anthony Zimmer', ') wraps up nicely. Yet the true star of', 'The Tourist', 'is enchanting Venice--and anyone dreaming of a romantic getaway will not want to miss this trip. --', 'A.T.

This stunning production captures all the celebrated beauty of the English countryside and its glorious, stately manors. It features lavish costumes and an exquisite soundtrack from noted composer Carl Davis.PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is the story of the lively and rebellious Elizabeth Bennet, one of five unmarried daughters living in the countryside of 19th-century England.

Will her romantic sparring with the mysterious and arrogant Darcy end in misfortune--or will love's true nature prevail?\", 'Amazon.com', \"Jane Austen's classic novel of 1813,\", 'Pride and Prejudice', ', still wins the hearts of countless schoolgirls with its romantic story of Elizabeth Bennet and her Mr. Darcy. Now, the 1996 BBC miniseries is winning over adults, with its faithful adaptation, gorgeous scenery, and superb acting.The essence of the story is the antagonism between Mr. Darcy, a wealthy single man who believes Elizabeth to be beneath him, and Elizabeth, who upon being insulted at a dance by the aloof Darcy refuses to associate with him in any manner. Austen evokes incredible tension with the wit and flirtation of the two characters, and director Simon Langton (who also directed', 'Upstairs Downstairs', \") successfully translates the repartee and conflict in this six-hour miniseries. Dialogue, for the most part, is painstakingly replicated, except when fleshing out and smoothing for modern sensibilities was necessary. Darcy, for instance, is drawn out, giving his personality significantly more depth.

What a stinker. Plot is awful. Characters thin. Effects cheesy. \"Sets\" phony. The very idea of buying this on Blu-ray is laughable. Sheen is a joke. He should stick to what he knows: one-line sex jokes, hookers and beating up his wives.<br /><br />This is a third world-produced \"film\" that should have gone straight to video that I'd perhaps buy used for $1 at a garage sale, and then throw away to save space. This makes Plan 9 From Outer Space look plausible.<br /><br />Man am I glad I saw it on a backwater channel and didn't put any money out on this turkey, even as a rental.

When we first see him, he is somewhere in the Peruvian jungle in 1936, running a booby trapped gauntlet (complete with an over sized rolling boulder) to fetch a solid gold idol. He loses this artifact to his chief rival, a French archeologist named Belloq (Paul Freeman), who then prepares to kill our hero. In the first of many serial like escapes, Indy eludes Belloq by hopping into a convenient plane. So, then: is Indiana Jones afraid of anything? Yes, snakes. The next time we see Jones, he\\'s a soft spoken, bespectacled professor. He is then summoned from his ivy covered environs by Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) to find the long lost Ark of the Covenant. The Nazis, it seems, are already searching for the Ark, which the mystical minded Hitler hopes to use to make his stormtroopers invincible. But to find the Ark, Indy must first secure a medallion kept under the protection of Indy\\'s old friend Abner Ravenwood, whose daughter, Marion (Karen Allen), evidently has a \"history\" with Jones. Whatever their personal differences, Indy and Marion become partners in one action packed adventure after another, ranging from wandering the snake pits of the Well of Souls to surviving the pyrotechnic unearthing of the sacred Ark. A joint project of Hollywood prodigies George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, with a script co written by Lawrence Kasdan and Philip Kaufman, among others, Raiders of the Lost Ark is not so much a movie as a 115 minute thrill ride. Costing 22 million dollars (nearly three times the original estimate), Raiders of the Lost Ark reaped 200 million dollars during its first run. It was followed by Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1985) and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), as well as a short lived TV series \"prequel.\"', 'Temple of Doom', 'The second of the George Lucas/Steven Spielberg', 'Indiana Jones', 'epics is set a year or so before the events in', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', \"(1984). After a brief brouhaha involving a precious vial and a wild ride down a raging Himalyan river, Indy (Harrison Ford) gets down to the problem at hand: retrieving a precious gem and several kidnapped young boys on behalf of a remote East Indian village. His companions this time around include a dimbulbed, easily frightened nightclub chanteuse (Kate Capshaw), and a feisty 12 year old kid named Short Round (Quan Ke Huy). Throughout, the plot takes second place to the thrills, which include a harrowing rollercoaster ride in an abandoned mineshaft and Indy's rescue of the heroine from a ritual sacrifice. There are also a couple of cute references to\", 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', \", notably a funny variation of Indy's shooting of the Sherpa warrior.\", 'Last Crusade', \"The third installment in the widely beloved Spielberg/Lucas Indiana Jones saga begins with an introduction to a younger Indy (played by the late River Phoenix), who, through a fast paced prologue, gives the audience insight into the roots of his taste for adventure, fear of snakes, and dogged determination to take historical artifacts out of the hands of bad guys and into the museums in which they belong. A grown up Indy (Harrison Ford) reveals himself shortly afterward in a familiar classroom scene, teaching archeology to a disproportionate number of starry eyed female college students in 1938. Once again, however, Mr. Jones is drawn away from his day job after an art collector (Julian Glover) approaches him with a proposition to find the much sought after Holy Grail. Circumstances reveal that there was another avid archeologist in search of the famed cup \u2014 Indiana Jones' father, Dr. Henry Jones (Sean Connery) \u2014 who had recently disappeared during his efforts. The junior and senior members of the Jones family find themselves in a series of tough situations in locales ranging from Venice to the most treacherous spots in the Middle East. Complicating the situation further is the presence of Elsa (Alison Doody), a beautiful and intelligent woman with one fatal flaw: she's an undercover Nazi agent. The search for the grail is a dangerous quest, and its discovery may prove fatal to those who seek it for personal gain. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade earned a then record breaking $50 million in its first week of release.\", 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull', 'Steven Spielberg and George Lucas bring you the greatest adventurer of all time in \u201ca nonstop thrill ride\u201d (Richard Corliss, TIME) that\u2019s packed with \u201csensational, awe inspiring spectacles\u201d (Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun Times).', 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull', 'finds Indy (Harrison Ford) trying to outrace a brilliant and beautiful agent (Cate Blanchett) for the mystical, all powerful Crystal Skull of Akator.

Expectations were high for this 1981 collaboration between the two men, who essentially invented the box office blockbuster with \u201870s efforts like', 'Jaws', 'and', 'Star Wars', ', and Spielberg (who directed) and Lucas (who co-wrote the story and executive produced) didn\u2019t disappoint. This wildly entertaining film has it all: non-stop action, exotic locations, grand spectacle, a hero for the ages, despicable villains, a beautiful love interest, humor, horror\u2026 not to mention lots of snakes. And along with all the bits that are so familiar by now--Indy (Harrison Ford) running from the giant boulder in a cave, using his pistol instead of his trusty whip to take out a scimitar-wielding bad guy, facing off with a hissing cobra, and on and on--there\u2019s real resonance in a potent storyline that brings together a profound religious-archaeological icon (the Ark of the Covenant, nothing less than \"a radio for speaking to God\") and the 20th century\u2019s most infamous criminals (the Nazis). Now', 'that\u2019s', 'entertainment.', '--Sam Graham', 'Temple of Doom', 'It\u2019s hard to imagine that a film with worldwide box office receipts topping $300 million worldwide could be labeled a disappointment, but some moviegoers considered', 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom', ', the second installment in Steven Spielberg and George Lucas\u2019 1980s adventure trilogy, to be just that. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a bad effort; any collaboration between these two cinema giants (Spielberg directed, while Lucas provided the story and was executive producer) is bound to have more than its share of terrific moments, and', 'Temple of Doom', 'is no exception. But in exchanging the very real threat of Nazi Germany for the cartoonish Thuggee cult, it loses some of the heft of its predecessor (', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', '); on the other hand, it\u2019s also the darkest and most disturbing of the three films, what with multiple scenes of children enslaved, a heart pulled out of a man\u2019s chest, and the immolation of a sacrificial victim, which makes it less fun than either', 'Raiders', 'or', 'The Last Crusade', ', notwithstanding a couple of riotous chase scenes and impressively grand sets. Many fans were also less than thrilled with the new love interest, a spoiled, querulous nightclub singer portrayed by Kate Capshaw, but a cute kid sidekick (\"Short Round,\" played by Ke Huy Quan) and, of course, the ever-reliable Harrison Ford as the cynical-but-swashbuckling hero more than make up for that character\u2019s shortcomings.', 'A six-minute introduction by Lucas and Spielberg is the prime special feature, with both men candidly addressing the film\u2019s good and bad points (Lucas points out that the second', 'Star Wars', 'film,', 'The Empire Strikes Back', ', was also the darkest of the original three; as for Spielberg, the fact that the leading lady would soon become his wife was the best part of the whole trip). Also good are \"The Creepy Crawlies,\" a mini-doc about the thousands of snakes, bugs, rats and other scary critters that populate the trilogy, and \"Travels with Indy,\" a look at some of the films\u2019 cool locations. Storyboards and a photo gallery are included as well.', '--Sam Graham', 'Last Crusade', 'Not as good as the first one, but better than the second. That\u2019s been the consensus opinion regarding', 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade', ', the final installment in Steven Spielberg and George Lucas\u2019 original adventure trilogy, throughout the nearly two decades since its 1989 theatrical release. It\u2019s a fair assessment. After the relatively dark and disturbing', 'Temple of Doom', '(1984),', 'The Last Crusade', '(1989) recalls the sheer fun of', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', '(1981). With its variety of colorful locations, multiple chase scenes (the opening sequence on a circus train, with River Phoenix as the young Indy, is one of the best of the series, as is the boat chase through the canals of Venice), and cloak-and-dagger vibe, it\u2019s the closest in tone to a James Bond outing, which director Spielberg has noted was the inspiration for the trilogy in the first place; what\u2019s more, it harkens back to', 'Raiders', \"in its choice of villains (i.e., the Nazis--Indy even comes face to face with Hitler at a rally in Berlin) and its quest for an antiquity of incalculable value and significance (the Holy Grail, the chalice said to have been the receptacle of Christ's blood as he hung on the cross). Add to that the presence of Sean Connery, playing Indy\u2019s father and having a field day opposite Harrison Ford, and you\u2019ve got a most welcome return to form.\", 'Special features include a six-minute introduction by Spielberg and Lucas, who discuss the grail as a metaphor for bringing Indy and his estranged father together and agree that', 'Crusade', 'is the funniest of the three films; \"Indy\u2019s Women,\" an American Film Institute tribute with leading ladies Karen Allen, Kate Capshaw, and Alison Doody each discussing her character (Capshaw candidly describes', 'Temple of Doom', '\u2019s Willie Scott as \"whiny, petulant, and annoying\"); \"Indy\u2019s Friends and Enemies,\" a look at the films\u2019 various villains and sidekicks; plus storyboards and photo galleries.', '--Sam Graham', 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull', 'Nearly 20 years after riding his last Crusade, Harrison Ford makes a welcome return as archaeologist/relic hunter Indiana Jones in', 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skul', \"l, an action-packed fourth installment that's, in a nutshell, less memorable than the first three but great nostalgia for fans of the series. Producer George Lucas and screenwriter David Koepp (\", 'War of the Worlds', \") set the film during the cold war, as the Soviets--replacing Nazis as Indy's villains of choice and led by a sword-wielding Cate Blanchett with black bob and sunglasses--are in pursuit of a crystal skull, which has mystical powers related to a city of gold. After escaping from them in a spectacular opening action sequence, Indy is coerced to head to Peru at the behest of a young greaser (Shia LaBeouf) whose friend--and Indy's colleague--Professor Oxley (John Hurt) has been captured for his knowledge of the skull's whereabouts. Whatever secrets the skull holds are tertiary; its reveal is the weakest part of the movie, as the CGI effects that inevitably accompany it feel jarring next to the boulder-rolling world of Indy audiences knew and loved. There's plenty of comedy, delightful stunts--ants play a deadly role here--and the return of\", 'Raiders', \"love interest Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, once shrill but now softened, giving her ex-love bemused glances and eye-rolls as he huffs his way to save the day. Which brings us to Ford: bullwhip still in hand, he's a little creakier, a lot grayer, but still twice the action hero of anyone in film today. With all the anticipation and hype leading up to the film's release, perhaps no reunion is sweeter than that of Ford with the role that fits him as snugly as that fedora hat.\", '--Ellen A.

Now, A&E and the BBC have brought this beloved classic to life in a compelling production directed by Upstairs, Downstairs' Simon Langton. This stunning production captures all the celebrated beauty of the English countryside and its glorious, stately manors. It features lavish costumes and an exquisite soundtrack from noted composer Carl Davis.PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is the story of the lively and rebellious Elizabeth Bennet, one of five unmarried daughters living in the countryside of 19th-century England. In a world where obtaining an advantageous marriage is a woman's sole occupation, Elizabeth's independent manner threatens her family's future. Will her romantic sparring with the mysterious and arrogant Darcy end in misfortune--or will love's true nature prevail?\", 'Amazon.com', \"Jane Austen's classic novel of 1813,\", 'Pride and Prejudice', ', still wins the hearts of countless schoolgirls with its romantic story of Elizabeth Bennet and her Mr. Darcy. Now, the 1996 BBC miniseries is winning over adults, with its faithful adaptation, gorgeous scenery, and superb acting.The essence of the story is the antagonism between Mr. Darcy, a wealthy single man who believes Elizabeth to be beneath him, and Elizabeth, who upon being insulted at a dance by the aloof Darcy refuses to associate with him in any manner. Austen evokes incredible tension with the wit and flirtation of the two characters, and director Simon Langton (who also directed', 'Upstairs Downstairs', \") successfully translates the repartee and conflict in this six-hour miniseries. Dialogue, for the most part, is painstakingly replicated, except when fleshing out and smoothing for modern sensibilities was necessary. Darcy, for instance, is drawn out, giving his personality significantly more depth. The acting sweeps you away to Regency England: Jennifer Ehle (of Wilde) is convincing as the obstinate Elizabeth, who, despite her mother's attempts to marry her off, spurs the attentions of Darcy. And Colin Firth (of\", 'The English Patient', ') will have women everywhere longing for a Mr. Darcy of their own.', 'For those who enjoy excellent Austen adaptations such as', 'Sense and Sensibility', 'and', 'Persuasion', '--this miniseries will round out the ultimate Austen library.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe individual's purchase history reveals a preference for action, science fiction, and suspense genres, particularly films that deliver thought-provoking narratives and engaging visuals. There is a clear inclination toward high-definition formats, suggesting a preference for quality media experiences. The sentiment analysis shows a divide in opinions: while some films receive high praise, especially those with strong storytelling and character development, others receive scathing reviews, indicating a low tolerance for poorly executed plots and clich\u00e9s.\n\nA recurring theme is a critical stance towards films perceived as derivative or lacking originality, particularly when comparing them to video games or other media. Their price sensitivity suggests they prefer affordable options, as seen in comments on not wanting to pay full price for certain titles.\n\nQuality expectations are high, especially regarding story depth and overall film execution. Disappointment recurs in evaluations of romantic or classic adaptations, hinting at a need for nuanced character portrayals over conventional narratives. Ultimately, this person's core preference gravitates toward immersive, high-quality viewing experiences that challenge conventional storytelling in genres they enjoy.",
