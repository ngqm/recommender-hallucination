But i get to the last 10 minutes, of the last episode, of the series...and it pixilates and is not viewable anymore. neither is the bonus disc. every other disc played fine, so its not my player, so i must assume its the rather minor looking scratches, or the manufacturing.  total bummer. now i have to go through the whole returns process, mail it back, and am wondering if its worth it.

The Behavioral Analysis Unit's most prominent agent is David Rossi (Joe Mantegna), a founding member of the BAU, who returns to help the team solve new cases, while pursuing some unfinished business of his own. Each member brings his or her own area of expertise to the table as they pinpoint predators' motivations and identify their emotional triggers in the attempt to stop them.\", 'Amazon.com', 'If watching a season of', 'Criminal Minds', \"simply makes you just want to watch more, that is a sign of success. Season six is a strong one that focuses on the BAU team's secrets. Emily Prentiss (Paget Brewster) has a story arc that is the highlight and gives you some of her international-spy back story, as well as a new secret for J.J. (A.J. Cook) and Aaron Hotchner (Thomas Gibson) to share. Episodes that focus on Dr. Spencer Reid (Matthew Gray Gubler) are always the bright spot of\", 'Criminal Minds', ', and it\\'s hard not to wish that his secret weren\\'t explored more in depth, but perhaps the creators are leaving that arc for season seven. We also get the introduction of a new character, Ashley Seaver (Rachel Nichols), whose father just happens to be a serial killer. David Rossi (Joe Mantegna) is a bit in the background for season six, but maybe it\\'s because he\\'s been at the center of previous seasons. Shemar Moore\\'s Derek Morgan is always nice to look at, but remains the least interesting character in the cast--even his \"secret\" isn\\'t very compelling--though it is always good to see him interacting with Penelope Garcia (Kirsten Vangsness), who has an appropriately lighthearted secret of her own. Overall, this is a strong season--and even if you\\'re not a longtime fan, it\\'s an easy show to just jump into. Extras include deleted scenes and some fun behind-the-scenes looks at the Paget Brewster arc, the season as a whole, and how various crime scenes are created.
