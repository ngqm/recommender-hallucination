But, sadly, it happened to be a typical Hollywood producer disease of those days (and there are still some like that today)... which means: the 2/3rd of the movie is given to the director and he makes something so good that it whacks you out of your chair (all of it: directory, screenplay, cinematography, acting, all the ideas) - there is really not much that I would tell be different that the best movies of those days there. However, then we come to the last 1/3rd and you can tell that the producer became more and more ignorant and tired of the narrative (too complicated for a simple soda/pop brain) and then the director/script were pushed into a crappy set of cliches and templates so overabundant in those days.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe individual's purchase history reveals a strong preference for World War II-themed films, as evidenced by consistently high ratings for related titles. There is a notable sentiment for historical realism and narrative depth, with a tendency to appreciate movies that provide unique perspectives, particularly those featuring veterans' stories. This consumer values quality storytelling and character development, often praising films for their engaging beginnings and criticizing weak endings, reflecting an expectation for coherence and satisfaction throughout. \n\nIn terms of quality preferences, almost all reviews feature high average ratings (4.1 to 5.0), indicating a consistent inclination towards well-produced and critically acclaimed content. While price sensitivity is apparent, particularly in the positive reception of lower-cost streaming options, their enthusiasm for quality storytelling suggests that they are willing to invest in higher-priced content if it meets their standards. Additionally, the critique of common Hollywood clich\u00e9s points towards a desire for originality and thoughtful filmmaking. Overall, this consumer is drawn to engaging narratives, historical contexts, and films with high production values, while remaining wary of predictable plots and unsatisfying conclusions.",

    "text": "The original Hollywood movie was much better. This series just took that 2 hrs movie and put it under a hydraulic press to squeeze a ~6 hours out of it. Nothing new, rare action moments mixed with quite a lot of boring sequences and a totally out of point adventures of Hanna in the decadent world of UK teenagers. Very timid attempts to show some moral dilemmas, but pretty meager acting on them makes it feel fake. Overall, the balance is 3 hours of adequate TV entertainment vs. three hours of wasted time.",
