When Count Dracula (Hamilton) is forced out of his castle to make room for an Olympic training facility, he relocates to New York City in search of discos, blood banks, and the fashion model who just might be the girl of his dreams. Will the Count take a bite out of the Big Apple - or will it's mean streets take a bite out of him? Susan Saint James, Richard Benjamin, Arte Johnson, Dick Shawn and the Jeffersons' Sherman Hemsley and Isabel Sanford also star in this outrageous romance about a guy who really loves the nightlife. ONCE BITTEN Jim Carrey is necking with a vampire in Once Bitten, a 1985 teen comedy also starring Lauren Hutton, Karen Kopins, and Cleavon Little (Blazing Saddles). When a vampire Countess (Hutton) seeks virgin blood, she soon discovers that it's not as easy to come by as it was in the good old days! When she crosses paths with the still-virginal Mark Kendall (Carrey in one of his earliest screen roles), it's a race against time to get to him before he gets it on. Once Bitten is a totally '80s teen vampire flick where the bloodsuckers don't sparkle, but the comedy most certainly does.\"]\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Horror/Things That Go Bump/Monsters, Comedy', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Blu-ray, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Jim Carrey, George Hamilton, Howard Storm, Susan Saint James, Stan Dragoti, Lauren Hutton, Sherman HemsleyJim Carrey, George Hamilton, Howard Storm, Susan Saint James, Stan Dragoti, Lauren Hutton, Sherman Hemsley   See more', 'Language': 'English', 'Runtime': '3 hours and 20 minutes', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 2.12 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'SFY15633BR', 'Director': 'Howard Storm, Stan Dragoti', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Blu-ray, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Run time': '3 hours and 20 minutes', 'Release date': 'February 10, 2015', 'Actors': 'Jim Carrey, Lauren Hutton, George Hamilton, Susan Saint James, Sherman Hemsley', 'Studio': 'Shout Factory', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: Wherelse can you get the TWO BEST VAMPIRE COMEDIES.
