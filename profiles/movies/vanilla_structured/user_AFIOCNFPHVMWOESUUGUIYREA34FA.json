Starting off from the dark and tragic ending of the fourth film,', 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix', 'begins in a somber and angst-filled tone that carries through the entire 138 minutes (the shortest of any', 'HP', \"movie despite being adapted from the longest book). Hopes of winning the Quidditch Cup have been replaced by woes like government corruption, distorted media spin, and the casualties of war. As the themes have matured, so have the primary characters' acting abilities. Ron (Rupert Grint), Hermione (Emma Watson), and especially Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) are more convincing than ever--in roles that are more demanding.  Harry is deeply traumatized from having witnessed Cedric Diggory's murder, but he will soon find that this was just another chapter in the continuing loss he will endure. Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) has returned and, in an attempt to conceal this catastrophe from the wizarding public, the Ministry of Magic has teamed up with the wizard newspaper The Daily Prophet to smear young Potter and wise Dumbledore (Michael Gambon)--seemingly the only two people in the public eye who believe the Dark Lord has returned. With no one else to stand against the wicked Death Eaters, the Hogwarts headmaster is forced to revive his secret anti-Voldemort society, the Order of the Phoenix. This welcomes back characters like Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson), kind Remus Lupin (David Thewlis), fatherly Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), and insidious Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), and introduces a short list of intriguing new faces. In the meantime, a semi-psychotic bureaucrat from the Ministry (brilliantly portrayed by Imelda Staunton) has seized power at Hogwarts, and Harry is forced to form a secret society of his own--lest the other young wizards at his school be left ill-equipped to defend themselves in the looming war between good and evil. In addition, Harry is filled with an inexplicable rage that only his Godfather Sirius seems to be able to understand.  This film, though not as frightening as its predecessor, earns its PG-13 rating mostly because of the ever-darkening tone. As always, the loyal fans of J.K.

Trained as an oil painter at Kanazawa University of Arts and Crafts, Hosoda honed his considerable skills working at famed anime production houses such as Toei and Studio Ghibli, as well as a celebrated collaboration on the Louis Vuitton exclusive, Superflat Monogram, with the prolific contemporary artist, Takashi Murakami.

The fifth', 'Harry Potter', 'film has arrived. The time is long past that this can be considered a simple \"children\\'s\" series--though children and adults alike will enjoy it immensely. Starting off from the dark and tragic ending of the fourth film,', 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix', 'begins in a somber and angst-filled tone that carries through the entire 138 minutes (the shortest of any', 'HP', \"movie despite being adapted from the longest book). Hopes of winning the Quidditch Cup have been replaced by woes like government corruption, distorted media spin, and the casualties of war. As the themes have matured, so have the primary characters' acting abilities. Ron (Rupert Grint), Hermione (Emma Watson), and especially Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) are more convincing than ever--in roles that are more demanding.  Harry is deeply traumatized from having witnessed Cedric Diggory's murder, but he will soon find that this was just another chapter in the continuing loss he will endure. Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) has returned and, in an attempt to conceal this catastrophe from the wizarding public, the Ministry of Magic has teamed up with the wizard newspaper The Daily Prophet to smear young Potter and wise Dumbledore (Michael Gambon)--seemingly the only two people in the public eye who believe the Dark Lord has returned. With no one else to stand against the wicked Death Eaters, the Hogwarts headmaster is forced to revive his secret anti-Voldemort society, the Order of the Phoenix. This welcomes back characters like Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson), kind Remus Lupin (David Thewlis), fatherly Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), and insidious Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), and introduces a short list of intriguing new faces. In the meantime, a semi-psychotic bureaucrat from the Ministry (brilliantly portrayed by Imelda Staunton) has seized power at Hogwarts, and Harry is forced to form a secret society of his own--lest the other young wizards at his school be left ill-equipped to defend themselves in the looming war between good and evil. In addition, Harry is filled with an inexplicable rage that only his Godfather Sirius seems to be able to understand.  This film, though not as frightening as its predecessor, earns its PG-13 rating mostly because of the ever-darkening tone. As always, the loyal fans of J.K. Rowling's books will suffer huge cuts from the original plot and character developments, but make no mistake: this is a good movie.\", '--Jordan Thompson']\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Format': 'Blu-ray, Widescreen, Color, Dubbed, Subtitled', 'Contributor': 'Rupert Grint, Bridgette Millar, Emma Watson, George Harris (II), Peter Cartwright, Richard Griffiths, Fiona Shaw, Robert Pattinson, Miles Jupp, David Yates (II), Geraldine Somerville, Daniel Radcliffe, Richard Macklin, Brendan Gleeson, Gary Oldman, Jason Boyd (III), Harry Melling, Natalia Tena, Adrian Rawlins, Kathryn Hunter, Ralph FiennesRupert Grint, Bridgette Millar, Emma Watson, George Harris (II), Peter Cartwright, Richard Griffiths, Fiona Shaw, Robert Pattinson, Miles Jupp, David Yates (II), Geraldine Somerville, Daniel Radcliffe, Richard Macklin, Brendan Gleeson, Gary Oldman, Jason Boyd (III), Harry Mel\u2026   See more', 'Language': 'German (Dolby Digital 5.1), Italian (Dolby Digital 5.1), Dutch (Dolby Digital 5.1), Japanese (Dolby Digital 5.1), Swedish (Dolby Digital 5.1), Catalan (Dolby Digital 5.1), English (Dolby Digital 5.1), French (Dolby Digital 5.1), Danish (Dolby Digital 5.1), English (PCM Surround), Spanish (Dolby Digital 5.1), Flemish (Dolby Digital 5.1)', 'Runtime': '2 hours and 18 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '2.40:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned)', 'Product Dimensions': '6.5 x 5.25 x 0.5 inches; 1.6 Ounces', 'Item model number': '085391156949', 'Director': 'David Yates (II)', 'Media Format': 'Blu-ray, Widescreen, Color, Dubbed, Subtitled', 'Run time': '2 hours and 18 minutes', 'Release date': 'December 11, 2007', 'Actors': 'Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Harry Melling, Richard Macklin', 'Dubbed': 'French, Spanish', 'Subtitles': 'English, Japanese, Portuguese, French, Spanish, Chinese, Korean, German, Italian, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Swedish, Norwegian, Catalan', 'Studio': 'WarnerBrothers', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: A must for the Potter fan's video library!\nReview Title: Five Stars\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n    Structure your response as:\n   \n    SUMMARY:\n    [Final synthesis of preferences and patterns]",
