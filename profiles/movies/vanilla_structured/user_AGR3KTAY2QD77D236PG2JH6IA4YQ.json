But the future Connor was raised to believe in is altered in part by the appearance of Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), a stranger whose last memory is of being on death row. Connor must decide whether Marcus has been sent from the future, or rescued from the past. As Skynet prepares its final onslaught, Connor and Marcus both embark on an odyssey that takes them into the heart of Skynets operations, where they uncover the terrible secret behind the possible annihilation of mankind.', ']]>', 'Amazon.com', 'Terminator Salvation', \"restores some of the balance of huge freakin' explosions and emotionally compelling plot to the\", 'Terminator', 'series. Set entirely after the nuclear assault that left the computer system Skynet in control of the world,', 'Terminator Salvation', \"follows John Connor (Christian Bale) as he grapples with both murderous robots and his superiors in the resistance, who aren't sure they believe the prophecies that Connor is destined to save humanity. Into the midst of this struggle tumbles Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington, who would later star in James Cameron's\", 'Avatar', '); the last thing he remembers was being executed in prison decades before. Baffled, he falls into company with Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin,', 'Star Trek', ') and a mute little girl, who soon get captured--but Wright then meets and bonds with Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood,', 'Eight Below', \"), a resistance fighter who remains loyal to the confused Wright even though Connor suspects he's not what he seems--or what he believes himself to be.\", 'Terminator Salvation', \"isn't the astonishing synthesis of action and feeling that either\", 'The Terminator', 'or', 'T2', 'were; the plot threads are poorly woven and fray completely in the last third of the movie.

I think that all the Terminator movies had a story line that was pretty plausible for an everyday event that could happen.  That coupled along with some points along the way that can only be overcome with some major action.  I guess without Arnold Schwarzenegger I should have already known there would not be much good action.<br /> The entire movie is all about the big `Time Paradox' that brings the `John Conner' guy into existence.  How he sent his father back to his mom.  And if he doesn't do this then he will not `be'.  Arnold does make a walk on appearance toward the end but it is really nothing.  I guess I watched it so I can join in the conversation whenever this title is up for discussion.  Just don't expect any action.  It's not a `fun' kill em' all kind of film; but rather a complex theoretical kind of head trip.\nReview Title: What a let down!!\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2013/06/21\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Tony Tilse', 'Rowan Woods', 'Andrew Prowse', 'Ian Watson', 'Peter Andrikidis', 'Geoff Bennett', 'Catherine Millar', 'Pino Amenta', 'Ian Barry', 'Brian Henson'], 'Studio': ['New Video']}\nReview Text: Just the, idea, alone, of trying to make a sci-fi fiction about a space adventure.

Your show will have to compete against the likes of Star Trek (Voyager, next generation, deep space nine, and also the original), and Dr. who also. But I think this far scape does do a good job. To even try such a task takes a lot of Gaul.<br /><br />Although, my account does not show that I have watched the entire first season, I have. I watch it on the other television, with somebody else's account. We went through the first season, so far. And I will continue to watch the, rest. It's already got my interest, that I have to see what happens to this guy. The way I remember it, the last time I checked, there is only four seasons.

But the future Connor was raised to believe in is altered in part by the appearance of Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), a stranger whose last memory is of being on death row.

Baffled, he falls into company with Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin,', 'Star Trek', ') and a mute little girl, who soon get captured--but Wright then meets and bonds with Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood,', 'Eight Below', \"), a resistance fighter who remains loyal to the confused Wright even though Connor suspects he's not what he seems--or what he believes himself to be.\", 'Terminator Salvation', \"isn't the astonishing synthesis of action and feeling that either\", 'The Terminator', 'or', 'T2', 'were; the plot threads are poorly woven and fray completely in the last third of the movie.

I think that all the Terminator movies had a story line that was pretty plausible for an everyday event that could happen.  That coupled along with some points along the way that can only be overcome with some major action.  I guess without Arnold Schwarzenegger I should have already known there would not be much good action.<br /> The entire movie is all about the big `Time Paradox' that brings the `John Conner' guy into existence.  How he sent his father back to his mom.  And if he doesn't do this then he will not `be'.  Arnold does make a walk on appearance toward the end but it is really nothing.  I guess I watched it so I can join in the conversation whenever this title is up for discussion.  Just don't expect any action.  It's not a `fun' kill em' all kind of film; but rather a complex theoretical kind of head trip.\nReview Title: What a let down!!\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2013/06/21\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Tony Tilse', 'Rowan Woods', 'Andrew Prowse', 'Ian Watson', 'Peter Andrikidis', 'Geoff Bennett', 'Catherine Millar', 'Pino Amenta', 'Ian Barry', 'Brian Henson'], 'Studio': ['New Video']}\nReview Text: Just the, idea, alone, of trying to make a sci-fi fiction about a space adventure. You already have almost insurmountable odds against you.

To even try such a task takes a lot of Gaul.<br /><br />Although, my account does not show that I have watched the entire first season, I have. I watch it on the other television, with somebody else's account. We went through the first season, so far. And I will continue to watch the, rest. It's already got my interest, that I have to see what happens to this guy. The way I remember it, the last time I checked, there is only four seasons.
