Although he's supposed to be gathering intel for the badass general (Stephen Lang) who'd like to lay waste to the planet and its inhabitants, Jake naturally begins to take a liking to the Na'vi, especially the feisty Neytiri (Zo\u00eb Saldana, whose entire performance, recorded by Cameron's complicated motion-capture system, exists as a digitally rendered Na'vi). The movie uses state-of-the-art 3D technology to plunge the viewer deep into Cameron's crazy toy box of planetary ecosystems and high-tech machinery.

Lawrence Talbot (Del Toro) is lured back to his family estate to investigate the savage murder of his brother by a bloodthirsty beast. There, Talbot must confront his childhood demons, his estranged father (Hopkins), his brother\u2019s grieving fianc\u00e9e (Emily Blunt, The Devil Wears Prada) and a suspicious Scotland Yard Inspector (Hugo Weaving, The Matrix Trilogy). When Talbot is bitten by the creature, he becomes eternally cursed and soon discovers a fate far worse than death. Inspired by the classic Universal film that launched a legacy of horror, The Wolfman brings the myth of a cursed man back to its iconic origins.', 'Amazon.com', 'The mist rising over the moors feels right, and so does the slant of moonlight coming over a Victorian village-scape. And if the moon is full, this must be', 'The Wolfman', \", Universal's 2010 attempt to revive one of the crown jewels in its deservedly legendary horror stable. Benicio Del Toro takes on the old Lon Chaney Jr. role of Lawrence Talbot, an American visitor to his ancestral home in England. Talbot's brother has recently been torn to bits by a beast in the forest, leaving behind a grieving fianc\u00e9e (Emily Blunt) and a not-visibly-grieving father (Anthony Hopkins). This central situation seems drained of blood even before the full-moon transfigurations begin to bloom, and Del Toro's Talbot--an actor by trade, which raises interesting possibilities for a story of a man divided by different personalities--is mystifyingly blank. The intriguing casting of Del Toro (what an opportunity for a cool werewolf!) comes to naught as Talbot seems to languish on the periphery of his own story. Hugo Weaving tries to generate some interest as the police inspector on the case, but he too is defeated by the combination of mechanical storytelling and bland computer-generated werewolves. The script skips from one exposition scene to the next, but nothing registers long enough to create character, tension, or the slimmest desire to see what happens in the next scene. Every once in a while director Joe Johnston (\", 'Jumanji', ') finds a grand staircase or CGI fog that conjures up the atmosphere of the old Universal horror classics, but otherwise this is a clueless affair--not as bad as', 'Van Helsing', ', but flat-out dull. The movie can\\'t even find a way to get the old Gypsy lady (Geraldine Chaplin stepping into Maria Ouspenskaya\\'s tiny shoes) to deliver a proper recitation of screenwriter Curt Siodmak\\'s great \"Even a man who is pure in heart\" doggerel from the 1941 film.

Well I fail to see their reasoning. This movie was full of action, the main actress was pretty cute ;), the plot was cool, the only things holding me back from giving it a 5 star were reasons as followed, dim lighting and hard to see some scenes, special effects weren't exactly the greatest (though not bad), and even though they made the wolves look more like the original wolfman, I still think a more wolf kinda look (like Van Helsing look) would have been prefered in my book, although I do realize it takes away from the whole WolfMAN thing, and I got that and all but I still prefer the werewolf look in this fashion. I just think it's cooler. That said this was pretty good. Oh, and the one other complaint would be that everything happened a little too fast for my taste as far as scene to scene goes.

This movie is to Predator what Jason X was to Friday The 13th franchise. This movie completely breaks the established lore at every conceivable turn for no reason whatsoever.

Predators are no longer hunters, they never had honor, they dont hunt for trophies, they cloak themselves by swallowing a pill, they collect spinal fluid to \"improve\" themselves, and this movie has a dumb political message for global warming. My God man, you can't make this crap up. Oh and some kid is smart enough to know how predator gear works and can use it. LOL what? Also tons of jokes about the male genitalia for no reason at all.

Lawrence Talbot (Del Toro) is lured back to his family estate to investigate the savage murder of his brother by a bloodthirsty beast. There, Talbot must confront his childhood demons, his estranged father (Hopkins), his brother\u2019s grieving fianc\u00e9e (Emily Blunt, The Devil Wears Prada) and a suspicious Scotland Yard Inspector (Hugo Weaving, The Matrix Trilogy). When Talbot is bitten by the creature, he becomes eternally cursed and soon discovers a fate far worse than death. Inspired by the classic Universal film that launched a legacy of horror, The Wolfman brings the myth of a cursed man back to its iconic origins.', 'Amazon.com', 'The mist rising over the moors feels right, and so does the slant of moonlight coming over a Victorian village-scape. And if the moon is full, this must be', 'The Wolfman', \", Universal's 2010 attempt to revive one of the crown jewels in its deservedly legendary horror stable. Benicio Del Toro takes on the old Lon Chaney Jr. role of Lawrence Talbot, an American visitor to his ancestral home in England. Talbot's brother has recently been torn to bits by a beast in the forest, leaving behind a grieving fianc\u00e9e (Emily Blunt) and a not-visibly-grieving father (Anthony Hopkins). This central situation seems drained of blood even before the full-moon transfigurations begin to bloom, and Del Toro's Talbot--an actor by trade, which raises interesting possibilities for a story of a man divided by different personalities--is mystifyingly blank. The intriguing casting of Del Toro (what an opportunity for a cool werewolf!) comes to naught as Talbot seems to languish on the periphery of his own story. Hugo Weaving tries to generate some interest as the police inspector on the case, but he too is defeated by the combination of mechanical storytelling and bland computer-generated werewolves. The script skips from one exposition scene to the next, but nothing registers long enough to create character, tension, or the slimmest desire to see what happens in the next scene. Every once in a while director Joe Johnston (\", 'Jumanji', ') finds a grand staircase or CGI fog that conjures up the atmosphere of the old Universal horror classics, but otherwise this is a clueless affair--not as bad as', 'Van Helsing', ', but flat-out dull. The movie can\\'t even find a way to get the old Gypsy lady (Geraldine Chaplin stepping into Maria Ouspenskaya\\'s tiny shoes) to deliver a proper recitation of screenwriter Curt Siodmak\\'s great \"Even a man who is pure in heart\" doggerel from the 1941 film.

Well I fail to see their reasoning. This movie was full of action, the main actress was pretty cute ;), the plot was cool, the only things holding me back from giving it a 5 star were reasons as followed, dim lighting and hard to see some scenes, special effects weren't exactly the greatest (though not bad), and even though they made the wolves look more like the original wolfman, I still think a more wolf kinda look (like Van Helsing look) would have been prefered in my book, although I do realize it takes away from the whole WolfMAN thing, and I got that and all but I still prefer the werewolf look in this fashion. I just think it's cooler. That said this was pretty good. Oh, and the one other complaint would be that everything happened a little too fast for my taste as far as scene to scene goes.

Although he's supposed to be gathering intel for the badass general (Stephen Lang) who'd like to lay waste to the planet and its inhabitants, Jake naturally begins to take a liking to the Na'vi, especially the feisty Neytiri (Zo\u00eb Saldana, whose entire performance, recorded by Cameron's complicated motion-capture system, exists as a digitally rendered Na'vi). The movie uses state-of-the-art 3D technology to plunge the viewer deep into Cameron's crazy toy box of planetary ecosystems and high-tech machinery.

There, Talbot must confront his childhood demons, his estranged father (Hopkins), his brother\u2019s grieving fianc\u00e9e (Emily Blunt, The Devil Wears Prada) and a suspicious Scotland Yard Inspector (Hugo Weaving, The Matrix Trilogy). When Talbot is bitten by the creature, he becomes eternally cursed and soon discovers a fate far worse than death. Inspired by the classic Universal film that launched a legacy of horror, The Wolfman brings the myth of a cursed man back to its iconic origins.', 'Amazon.com', 'The mist rising over the moors feels right, and so does the slant of moonlight coming over a Victorian village-scape. And if the moon is full, this must be', 'The Wolfman', \", Universal's 2010 attempt to revive one of the crown jewels in its deservedly legendary horror stable. Benicio Del Toro takes on the old Lon Chaney Jr. role of Lawrence Talbot, an American visitor to his ancestral home in England. Talbot's brother has recently been torn to bits by a beast in the forest, leaving behind a grieving fianc\u00e9e (Emily Blunt) and a not-visibly-grieving father (Anthony Hopkins). This central situation seems drained of blood even before the full-moon transfigurations begin to bloom, and Del Toro's Talbot--an actor by trade, which raises interesting possibilities for a story of a man divided by different personalities--is mystifyingly blank. The intriguing casting of Del Toro (what an opportunity for a cool werewolf!) comes to naught as Talbot seems to languish on the periphery of his own story. Hugo Weaving tries to generate some interest as the police inspector on the case, but he too is defeated by the combination of mechanical storytelling and bland computer-generated werewolves. The script skips from one exposition scene to the next, but nothing registers long enough to create character, tension, or the slimmest desire to see what happens in the next scene. Every once in a while director Joe Johnston (\", 'Jumanji', ') finds a grand staircase or CGI fog that conjures up the atmosphere of the old Universal horror classics, but otherwise this is a clueless affair--not as bad as', 'Van Helsing', ', but flat-out dull.

Well I fail to see their reasoning. This movie was full of action, the main actress was pretty cute ;), the plot was cool, the only things holding me back from giving it a 5 star were reasons as followed, dim lighting and hard to see some scenes, special effects weren't exactly the greatest (though not bad), and even though they made the wolves look more like the original wolfman, I still think a more wolf kinda look (like Van Helsing look) would have been prefered in my book, although I do realize it takes away from the whole WolfMAN thing, and I got that and all but I still prefer the werewolf look in this fashion. I just think it's cooler. That said this was pretty good. Oh, and the one other complaint would be that everything happened a little too fast for my taste as far as scene to scene goes.

This movie is to Predator what Jason X was to Friday The 13th franchise. This movie completely breaks the established lore at every conceivable turn for no reason whatsoever. It's not even worth the huge write up on why this movie is so absolutely asinine so just gonna have to take my word for it. I'll give you the gist of the issues. Predators are no longer hunters, they never had honor, they dont hunt for trophies, they cloak themselves by swallowing a pill, they collect spinal fluid to \"improve\" themselves, and this movie has a dumb political message for global warming. My God man, you can't make this crap up. Oh and some kid is smart enough to know how predator gear works and can use it. LOL what? Also tons of jokes about the male genitalia for no reason at all.

He's harping on as if the star wars universe is in the first 6 movies for us or the media that is put out on TV and theaters exclusively.  Disney \"made star wars fun again\". Excuse me? Never heard of Knights  of the Old Republic? Ever read the Dark Times Comics? Know anything about the Jedi Civil Wars (BTW there were multiple), Do you know who came up with the Rule Of Two to begin with? Do you know the names of Revan, Malak, Vitiate,  Malgus, Anjunta Pall, Freedom Nadd, Naga Sadow, Marka Ragnos, Tulak Horde, Meetra Surik, Jacen Solo, Darth Krayyt, Darth Bane, brah I got names for days you ain't never heard of because  you weren't  paying attention. We're mad they destroyed decades of established lore, rich lore. Lore they could have used to make vastly better  movies. Let's be honest the people who made these movies were passionless and not star wars fans. They had so much lore to use and used none of it. They kept drawing on the Skywalkers. Yo I'm tired of the Skywalkers and this universe is so much bigger then them. They are a tiny dot on the old timeline before  they buy out. Do you guys and gals out there know about the Infinite Empire? Way older then Sith or Jedi. Did you know the Republic was tens of thousands of years old? Before the Mandolorian how much did you know about Mando Culture? This is my point. Yall thinking our beef with this trilogy is something so small as Rey or Kylo which BTW were inferior characters to the ones they replaced thanks to Disney. You didn't partake in the games, graphics novels, books, comics, etc, etc. We, the most dedicated fans DID. It was a huge part of our lives and it was deeper than a set of movies to us. If you want just a tiny taste of how much different star wars gets from what you see on screen then just read the Revenge of the Sith Novelisation just to show how flushed out that story gets. Puts the films to absolute shame man. Try SWTOR out, Kotor too, start getting unto audiobooks as well because  I can tell you from where I sit to say you're  a star wars fan and not be able to drop names and events from the top of your head from various timelines or to not know the jedi and Sith codes and be able to easily recite them at the drop of the hat doesn't mark you as a fan but a casual and frankly that's not true Fandom. Real fans are interested in delving deeper.",
