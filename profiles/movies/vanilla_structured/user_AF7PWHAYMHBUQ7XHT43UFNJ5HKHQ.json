I can imagine people on a plane from here to Paris with only this movie to watch thinking it was indeed intolerable cruelty.\nReview Title: Sometimes a movie gets it all...\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Goldfinger\nReview Date: 2016/06/01\nCategories: Suspense, Adventure, Intense, Thrilling\nProduct Description: ['The third installment in the 007 series finds uberspy James Bond (Sean Connery) trying to thwart baddie Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe) and his elaborate gambit to corner the gold market by contaminating Fort Knox.']\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Guy Hamilton'], 'Producers': ['Albert R. Broccoli', 'Harry Saltzman'], 'Starring': ['Sean Connery', 'Honor Blackman', 'Gert Frobe']}\nReview Text: You have to remember how long ago this was released to really appreciate it, and you have to remember James Bond is unquestionably one of the most memorable and enduring of cinema heroes.  The stunning film (real film) photography no longer in vogue today and the bright clear colors only film can provide, the special effects (not computer enhanced), the writer's vision of future technology and how it wasn't so far off...so many things to enjoy.  The plot?  Fundamentally absurd but a fun romp into a scheme that might have worked in 1964.  The whole thing was supposed to be fun, actually.  I don't know if it was ever meant to be as popular as it has become, but sit down with ice tea and a bowl of popcorn and pretend it isn't 2016.  I think you'll be glad you did.\nReview Title: A lot to enjoy!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2016/06/09\nAverage Rating: 4.0\nProduct Details: {'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Israel Horovitz'], 'Producers': ['Rachael Horovitz', 'Gary Foster', 'Nitsa Benchetrit', 'David C. Barrot'], 'Starring': ['Kevin Kline', 'Kristin Scott Thomas', 'Maggie Smith'], 'Studio': ['Universal Pictures']}\nReview Text: There are redeeming moments in this movie, but they're rather few and far between.  Overall it is enjoyable and worth watching, but the acting is lukewarm and the plot drags along clumsily at times.  All 3 of the main actors are capable of much better work.  The supporting actors aren't bad, though.\nReview Title: Middle of the road...\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2016/06/19\nAverage Rating: 4.3\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Fred Schepisi'], 'Producers': ['Curtis Burch', 'Gerald Di Pego'], 'Starring': ['Clive Owen', 'Juliette Binoche', 'Bruce Davison'], 'Studio': ['Roadside Attractions']}\nReview Text: Generally well written, well acted and engaging.  In fact this could have been a five star movie.  Here is how:  (1) downplay the alcoholism a bit as it gets tedious and totally predictable early on  (2) include more humor...the funny parts are warm but brief and sporadic  (3) move the plot along a little quicker...there are times it drags ahead like a car with four flat tires trying to drive through a mud pit.  All in all a good effort, however.\nReview Title: Mostly very good...\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2016/06/27\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Brett Haley'], 'Producers': ['Brett Haley', 'Rebecca Green', 'Laura D. Smith Ireland'], 'Starring': ['Blythe Danner', 'Martin Starr', 'June Squibb'], 'Studio': ['PREFERRED CONTENT']}\nReview Text: It is always sad to see decent actors/actresses make a terrible movie just to get a payday, but in this case I'm afraid that's what happened.  The plot is totally without imagination, there are only a few humorous parts, the overall effect is one of boredom coupled with nearly complete lack of passion and emotion.  The solitary good point is there isn't anything offensive about it.  Of course, if you read what I've written, you already know there isn't much about it at all.  Save your time.  There are much better alternatives.\nReview Title: Save your time, please...\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2016/07/15\nAverage Rating: 4.6\nProduct Details: {'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Gower Champion'], 'Producers': ['Gant Gaither', 'Doane Harrison'], 'Starring': ['Debbie Reynolds', 'Cliff Robertson', 'David Janssen']}\nReview Text: Oh my goodness...a movie which went absolutely nowhere.  We kept waiting for it to, but it never did.  Please watch something else Debbie Reynolds did.  There are plenty of choices and this isn't one of them.  Sorry but there isn't anything positive to say about this one at all.\nReview Title: Went nowhere, said nothing, no humor, etc, etc...\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n    Structure your response as:\n   \n    SUMMARY:\n    [Final synthesis of preferences and patterns]",
