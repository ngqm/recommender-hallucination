At the height of WWII, a young submarine crew heads out to sea on a top-secret mission that all but ensures most will never make it home alive. Ordered to patrol the Atlantic and destroy an Allied armada bringing supplies to Britain, these raw recruits must band together, bracing themselves against a depth-charge assault from an unseen enemy - can the Captain and his crew summon the strength to escape their watery grave?', \"Oscar-nominated director Wolfgang Petersen's five-hour epic adventure deftly explores tensions as pressure builds to an explosive climax, packing a visceral punch few movies can match. As we hurtle through the sub's cramped quarters, telegraphing not only the controlled chaos of combat but the fearful faces of the U-boat's heroic crew, this adrenalin-rush of a war film still haunts audiences with one final heart-breaking dilemma: would you let others perish so you could survive?\", 'Nominated for 6 Oscars\u00ae Best Director, Best Writing, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing and Best EffectsNominated for a Golden Globe\u00ae for Best Picture']\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Special Interests', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Wolfgang Petersen, Hubertus Bengsch, Bernd Tauber, Martin Semmelrogge, Klaus Wennemann, J\u00fcrgen Prochnow, Herbert Gr\u00f6nemeyerWolfgang Petersen, Hubertus Bengsch, Bernd Tauber, Martin Semmelrogge, Klaus Wennemann, J\u00fcrgen Prochnow, Herbert Gr\u00f6nemeyer  See more', 'Language': 'English', 'Number Of Discs': '2', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.25 x 0.5 inches; 2.88 Ounces', 'Director': 'Wolfgang Petersen', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, NTSC', 'Run time': '4 hours and 53 minutes', 'Release date': 'May 13, 2014', 'Actors': 'J\u00fcrgen Prochnow, Herbert Gr\u00f6nemeyer, Klaus Wennemann, Hubertus Bengsch, Martin Semmelrogge', 'Studio': 'Sony Pictures Home', 'Number of discs': '2'}\nReview Text: Movie skipped some but ok\nReview Title: Ok\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Soldier Blue\nReview Date: 2019/06/30\nStore: Candice Bergen  (Actor),     Peter Strauss  (Actor)    Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Drama\nProduct Description: ['A wild west story of two survivors of an Indian attack who slowly fall in love.']\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Aspect Ratio': '2.35:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.54 x 5.34 x 7.41 inches; 0.71 Ounces', 'Item model number': '20569', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, Widescreen, NTSC', 'Run time': '1 hour and 55 minutes', 'Release date': 'December 12, 2006', 'Actors': 'Candice Bergen, Peter Strauss, Donald Pleasence, James Hampton, Mort Mills', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 1.0)', 'Studio': 'Lionsgate', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: Great\nReview Title: Great movie\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: The Mummy Collector's Set (The Mummy/ The Mummy Returns/ The Scorpion King)\nReview Date: 2019/06/30\nStore: Brendon Fraser  (Actor),     Arnold Vosloo  (Actor)    Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Action & Adventure\nProduct Description: ['Product Description', \"Unearth non-stop action with The Mummy Collector's Set.

When a circle rings the moon, trouble looms, Should you misplace your broom, sorry; a hand vac can't be used in an exorcism rite. Fun and excitement abound in the Owens family of wily witches. One problem, though: the men the Owens women fall in love with are doomed to an untimely death.  Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman bring a sparkling screen magic to Practical Magic, adapted from Alice Hoffman's bestseller and directed by Griffin Dunne (Addicted to Love). They play Sally and Gillian Owens, sisters hexed by a centuries -old curse...and coping with a witches brew of events involving a possible love match (Aidan Quinn) for one, a zombie (Goran Visnjic) for the other and a need to resume the age-old witchcraft taught by two doting Owens aunts (Stockard Channing and Dianne Wiest). Sit for a spell and enjoy.\", 'Review', 'Actor Griffin Dunne improves a bit on his first film as a director,', 'Addicted to Love', \", with this drama-comedy about a family of witches. Nicole Kidman and Sandra Bullock play spell-casting sisters of different temperaments: the former is a high-living, free-spirited sort, while Bullock's character is a homebody who can't get around a family curse that kills the men in their lives. A widowed single mom, Bullock gets into a jam with an abusive Bulgarian (Goran Visnjic) and is helped out by her sibling, but the result brings a good-looking, warm, inquisitive cop (Aidan Quinn) into their lives. The film has a variety of tonal changes--cute, scary, glum--that Dunne can't always effectively juggle. But the female-centric, celebratory nature of the film (the fantasies, the sharing, the witchy bonds) is infectious, and supporting roles by Dianne Wiest and Stockard Channing as Kidman and Bullock's magical aunts are a lot of fun.\", '--Tom Keogh']\n{'Genre': 'Science Fiction & Fantasy, Drama/Love & Romance, Comedy', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, AC-3, Dolby, Dubbed, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Denise Di Novi, Evan Rachel Wood, Ellen Geer, Mark Feuerstein, Herta Ware, Robin Swicord, Bruce Berman, Alexandra Artrip, Chloe Webb, Goran Visnjic, Sandra Bullock, Caprice Benedetti, Mary McLaglen, Stockard Channing, Alice Hoffman, Nicole Kidman, Griffin Dunne, Dianne Wiest, Adam Brooks, Akiva Goldsman, Aidan QuinnDenise Di Novi, Evan Rachel Wood, Ellen Geer, Mark Feuerstein, Herta Ware, Robin Swicord, Bruce Berman, Alexandra Artrip, Chloe Webb, Goran Visnjic, Sandra Bullock, Caprice Benedetti, Mary McLaglen, Stockard Channing, Alice Hoffman, Nicole Kidman, Griffin Dunne,\u2026   See more', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1), French (Dolby Digital 5.1), Unqualified', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 44 minutes', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'Item model number': '112617', 'Director': 'Griffin Dunne', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, AC-3, Dolby, Dubbed, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Run time': '1 hour and 44 minutes', 'Release date': 'November 3, 2009', 'Actors': 'Sandra Bullock, Nicole Kidman, Dianne Wiest, Stockard Channing, Aidan Quinn', 'Dubbed': 'French', 'Subtitles': 'English, French', 'Producers': 'Mary McLaglen, Denise Di Novi, Bruce Berman', 'Studio': 'WarnerBrothers', 'Writers': 'Robin Swicord, Akiva Goldsman, Adam Brooks', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nLove it\nVery happy",
