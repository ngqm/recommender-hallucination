In the middle of this bizarre city is a quaint little shop known as Mung Daal Catering, which is owned by Mung Daal, one of the ost accomplished chefs and well known in the entire world. However, things have become a bit hectic in the kitchen as of late, as Mung Daal has recently acquired a young apprentice named Chowder, whom he wishes to pass along all of his knowledge towards. Chowder is an energetic young lad who wishes to become the greatest chef in the world, but his love of food and his extremely short attention span often results in him causing unintended havoc. However, theyre not alone. Truffles works at Mung Daal Catering and she takes the orders that her husband, Mung Daal, must prepare. Shnitzel, a rock monster, also helps out in the kitchen as he has worked for Mung Daal for years. Along the way, theyll meet the many colorful and zany residents of Marzipan City, though there will always be new dishes to prepare and exciting recipes to follow.', ']]>', 'Amazon.com', 'Five more episodes of', 'Chowder', 'await fans of the surreal and sublimely silly animated television series on this delicious second volume DVD. As with its predecessor, the episodes are not in broadcast order, which has no effect on their enjoyment; each of the 22-minute stories (broken into two 11-minute episodes) stands on its own in terms of zaniness and visual charm. Strongest among the batch included here is the Emmy- and Annie-nominated \u201cBurple Nurples,\u201d which circles around a somewhat morbid conceit: in an attempt to make the title dish, aspiring chef Chowder accidentally laces it with rat poison, sending his boss and mentor Mung Daal on a mad quest to track down all of his creations. Other episodes underscore the show\u2019s gentle blend of kid-friendly storylines and out-and-out wackiness: \u201cMung on the Rocks\u201d gives Chowder a chance to prove himself by bailing Mung out of a pickle with his wife, Truffles, while its companion piece, \u201cSniffleball,\u201d finds our hero facing the classic conundrum: will he be the hero in a game of sniffleball or the goat? It\u2019s this inherent sweetness, mixed with the lovely, off-kilter artwork and characterizations that make', 'Chowder', 'so appealing to viewers of all ages.

In the middle of this bizarre city is a quaint little shop known as Mung Daal Catering, which is owned by Mung Daal, one of the ost accomplished chefs and well known in the entire world. However, things have become a bit hectic in the kitchen as of late, as Mung Daal has recently acquired a young apprentice named Chowder, whom he wishes to pass along all of his knowledge towards. Chowder is an energetic young lad who wishes to become the greatest chef in the world, but his love of food and his extremely short attention span often results in him causing unintended havoc. However, theyre not alone. Truffles works at Mung Daal Catering and she takes the orders that her husband, Mung Daal, must prepare. Shnitzel, a rock monster, also helps out in the kitchen as he has worked for Mung Daal for years. Along the way, theyll meet the many colorful and zany residents of Marzipan City, though there will always be new dishes to prepare and exciting recipes to follow.', ']]>', 'Amazon.com', 'Five more episodes of', 'Chowder', 'await fans of the surreal and sublimely silly animated television series on this delicious second volume DVD. As with its predecessor, the episodes are not in broadcast order, which has no effect on their enjoyment; each of the 22-minute stories (broken into two 11-minute episodes) stands on its own in terms of zaniness and visual charm. Strongest among the batch included here is the Emmy- and Annie-nominated \u201cBurple Nurples,\u201d which circles around a somewhat morbid conceit: in an attempt to make the title dish, aspiring chef Chowder accidentally laces it with rat poison, sending his boss and mentor Mung Daal on a mad quest to track down all of his creations. Other episodes underscore the show\u2019s gentle blend of kid-friendly storylines and out-and-out wackiness: \u201cMung on the Rocks\u201d gives Chowder a chance to prove himself by bailing Mung out of a pickle with his wife, Truffles, while its companion piece, \u201cSniffleball,\u201d finds our hero facing the classic conundrum: will he be the hero in a game of sniffleball or the goat?

In the middle of this bizarre city is a quaint little shop known as Mung Daal Catering, which is owned by Mung Daal, one of the ost accomplished chefs and well known in the entire world. However, things have become a bit hectic in the kitchen as of late, as Mung Daal has recently acquired a young apprentice named Chowder, whom he wishes to pass along all of his knowledge towards. Chowder is an energetic young lad who wishes to become the greatest chef in the world, but his love of food and his extremely short attention span often results in him causing unintended havoc. However, theyre not alone. Truffles works at Mung Daal Catering and she takes the orders that her husband, Mung Daal, must prepare. Shnitzel, a rock monster, also helps out in the kitchen as he has worked for Mung Daal for years. Along the way, theyll meet the many colorful and zany residents of Marzipan City, though there will always be new dishes to prepare and exciting recipes to follow.', ']]>', 'Amazon.com', 'Five more episodes of', 'Chowder', 'await fans of the surreal and sublimely silly animated television series on this delicious second volume DVD. As with its predecessor, the episodes are not in broadcast order, which has no effect on their enjoyment; each of the 22-minute stories (broken into two 11-minute episodes) stands on its own in terms of zaniness and visual charm. Strongest among the batch included here is the Emmy- and Annie-nominated \u201cBurple Nurples,\u201d which circles around a somewhat morbid conceit: in an attempt to make the title dish, aspiring chef Chowder accidentally laces it with rat poison, sending his boss and mentor Mung Daal on a mad quest to track down all of his creations. Other episodes underscore the show\u2019s gentle blend of kid-friendly storylines and out-and-out wackiness: \u201cMung on the Rocks\u201d gives Chowder a chance to prove himself by bailing Mung out of a pickle with his wife, Truffles, while its companion piece, \u201cSniffleball,\u201d finds our hero facing the classic conundrum: will he be the hero in a game of sniffleball or the goat?
