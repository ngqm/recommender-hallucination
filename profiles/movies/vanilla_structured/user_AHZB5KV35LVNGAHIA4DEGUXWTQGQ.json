Swiftly apprehended and originally sentenced to seven years in jail, Peterson has subsequently been behind bars for 34 years, 30 of which have been spent in solitary confinement. Shot from an intelligent, provocative and stylized approach, Bronson follows the metamorphosis of Mickey Peterson, who nicknamed himself Charles Bronson, into Britain's most dangerous prisoner.\", 'Amazon.com', \"Tom Hardy's performance in the lead role burns right through\", 'Bronson', ', the somewhat true tale of a real guy who, once the movie finishes, you\\'ll be very glad is still locked up in an English jail. There\\'s no obvious reason why Michael Peterson became what he proudly calls \"Britain\\'s most violent prisoner.\" His upbringing was normal, his parents meek but loving; he was even married with a child when, in 1974, he attempted a robbery that landed him in the slammer for the first time. Peterson saw this as \"an opportunity to sharpen my tools\" and make a name for himself; and that he did, eagerly taking on half a dozen guards at once and regularly spending time in solitary confinement (at one point for 69 straight days). A stint in \"the loony bin,\" where he killed another patient, followed, as did incarceration in a hospital for the criminally insane, a brief period on the outside (having been \"certified sane,\" he went to live in an uncle\\'s whorehouse, found work as a prizefighter, and fell in love), and then a permanent return to prison, where he decided to change his name to Charlie Bronson (after the American actor) and, improbably, became a pretty decent painter (a climactic scene with his art teacher perversely invokes the Belgian artist Ren\u00e9 Magritte). Not all of this really happened, but director and cowriter Nicolas Winding Refn\\'s film is hardly a documentary; with its saturated color palette, surreal framing devices (Bronson tells some of his tale to a rapt audience in a large theater), and frequent use of black humor, this is a highly stylized and often strange piece of work. Hardy, who has also been seen in Guy Ritchie\\'s', 'RocknRolla', \"and will be in George Miller's fourth\", 'Road Warrior', \"epic, delivers an extreme performance; sporting a shaved head and a John L. Sullivan handlebar mustache, he is a credible if occasionally cartoonish presence, a leering, profane, joyously violent cockney madman.

Not recommended.\nReview Title: Meandering Movie\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n    Structure your response as:\n   \n    SUMMARY:\n    [Final synthesis of preferences and patterns]",
  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThis individual exhibits a strong preference for stylistically unconventional and provocative films, evident in their affinity for ratings around 4.0 to 4.7 for compelling and unique narratives. They demonstrate a clear disdain for poorly executed films, frequently giving low ratings (1.0), particularly when they find them tedious or confusing. Common themes in their reviews highlight a focus on violence, dark humor, and complex character portrayals, indicating a taste for gritty and intense storytelling.\n\nPrice sensitivity appears low; the individual prioritizes quality and engaging content over affordability, as shown by the stable high ratings of select films despite varied price points. Additionally, they favor content with significant thematic depth and originality, steering away from typical mainstream productions.\n\nOverall, their core preferences include a penchant for innovative action and drama films, vivid storytelling, and a critical eye towards mediocrity. The recurring dissatisfaction with conventional plots suggests they seek out films that challenge norms and deliver a distinctive viewing experience.",
