BUT the cast of MST3000 rip it to shreds.  With the exception of Gypsy (extremely annoying), the cast has some good one liners: \"Mr Treveno has been hit again\" ; \"he just landed just short of the green\"; \"fresh panties all around\"; and  Tom Servo's obsession with Joe Don Baker's eating/farting.

Created by the now-legendary James L. Brooks (The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Rhoda, The Simpsons), the program was praised for dealing realistically with such subjects as racism, sexism, illiteracy, guns in school and drugs. Pete Dixon (Lloyd Haynes) is a dedicated and popular history teacher who fights the good fight on the side of his students. Joining him in his idealistic approach to education are guidance counselor Liz McIntyre (Denise Nicholas) and student teacher Alice Johnson (Karen Valentine). Experienced and slightly world-weary principal Seymour Kaufman (Michael Constantine) provides a balance to the youthful idealism of the '60s cultural revolution\u2014but at the end of the day, everyone is on the side of the students.

The Weathermen were born of sixties protest, but took their scheme to overthrow the U.S. government to especially violent extremes.

That journey, by which a fire-breathing revolutionary such as Bernadine Dohrn became a (still fiery) gray-haired wife and mother, is an intriguing one. This film, rich in period footage (and some unnecessary sensationalism) captures the era somewhat broadly.

The film does not at all glorify them, the directors simply told a story of why these American college students simply wanted to stop the senseless armed conflict in Vietnam and their stance against oppression and racism in America. While I don't agree with their politics i.e., communism, and their unrealistic premise of the majority of Americans would violently revolt against the American government, their commitment ( by death if necessary) to the cause for social change, as told by the director, is very engaging!! I absolutely can't get enough of Weatherman Niomi Jaffee's quote early in the film: &#34; if you sit in your little white house and go to your little  white job and allow the country you live in to murder people, and you sit there and don't do anything about it that's violence&#34;...if one is not part of the solution they're part of the problem. In the director's commentary, the director said when he interviewed the group said that they didn't want to be &#34;good Germans&#34; (in relation to Jaffe's quote)---wow!!<br /><br />I was only five years old when the group went underground, officially,in 1970 after the townhouse explosion (I had my own problems with racism) but I had heard of the name around 1975 and in 1980 when most of charges (the many bombings the group committed)were dropped because of arrogant, stupid, and corrupt tactics of the FBI.<br /><br />Too bad these directors, although nominated, didn't win the academy award for best documentary film---and these directors were not born during that time!! Any unearthed story from the turbulent 1960s that would educate today's young adults in order to further civilize and clean up bad behavior is alright by me.

The acting by all was fantastic, especially, Jeff Bridges and Rob Reiner.Remembered a bits and pieces of it on late night television in mid-seventies. I was too young to see it  the theaters. Just as well I was living it myself. Not in the US but in Toronto, Ontario, Canada--not as violent but the name calling was prevalent. Being a child that grew up in the 1970's it was just a terrible time as far as race relations.  Nevertheless, the film captured the  savagery and primitive  behavior of the time period of 1970 at the time of the US secondary school busing enactment.<br /><br />Didn't understand the point of why the black girls were ripping  the  white girl's close off? A very eerie scene!!! Probably a reaction to black men would possibly pay more attention to her for various reasons, coupled with black women's insecurity of the alleged notion of the western culture's standard of beauty is caucasian. Regardless the scene did it's job of capturing the viewer's emotions.<br /><br />Dare I say, and it still stands today, when a women who are clearly more attractive than a certain mass of women, the low self-esteem and/or not so attractive women get attention starved and feel angry and scared of being ostracized and, worse case, they believe, they'll die alone.<br /><br />Perhaps this film should be archived in the US National Film Registry.\nReview Title: Just an Ugly time for Black Americans in the early 1970's, and the film captured it.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: The War Game / Culloden [DVD]\nReview Date: 2016/01/28\nStore: Olivier Espitalier-Noel  (Actor),     George McBean  (Actor)    Rated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Drama\nAverage Rating: 4.2\nProduct Details: {'Format': 'DVD, NTSC, Black & White', 'Contributor': 'Peter Watkins, Olivier Espitalier-Noel, Robert Oates, Kathy Staff, Michael Aspel, Peter Graham, George McBeanPeter Watkins, Olivier Espitalier-Noel, Robert Oates, Kathy Staff, Michael Aspel, Peter Graham, George McBean   See more', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono)', 'Runtime': '2 hours', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'Unrated (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.5 x 0.5 inches; 2.93 Ounces', 'Director': 'Peter Watkins', 'Media Format': 'DVD, NTSC, Black & White', 'Run time': '2 hours', 'Release date': 'July 25, 2006', 'Actors': 'Olivier Espitalier-Noel, George McBean, Robert Oates, Peter Watkins, Michael Aspel', 'Studio': 'Project X', 'Writers': 'Peter Watkins', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: Your watching a fictional biography where a reporter is interviewing people before and after a nuclear strike in an English town in 1965.<br />Its ok given being desensitized by post 9/11 and watching Threads and the The Day After in 1984 as a teenager. It does mention current events such as Vietnam,LBJ interestingly.<br /><br />One Of the scenes where people were moved to people's houses and the women asked the cop if the people are &#34;colored&#34;. I had to roll my eyes up at that stupid girl's comment, but that was the behavior at that time.<br /><br />But keeping in mind this was 1965, not long after the Cuban missile crisis, this film would freak anyone out. It's less than an hour long. There's much commentary between scenes with a reporters interviewing civilians like a documentary but the reporter was also acting.<br /><br />It was hard to take seriously this film because the actresses'  hair seemed to be exempted from any radiation let alone dirt in some scenes. YouTube personality Tommy Sotomayor's takes on black women's obsession with weave would have a field day with this one.<br /><br />But actors, actresses and writers did their homework to capture the pompous ignorance of the civilized before the catastrophe then the raw emotion of the destress, despair and horror and how civil defense is pointless. With the exception of the hair issue, it's a black and white short version of Threads. But it was well-written with the all the intense camera angles at that which are common today. Winning the Oscar in 1967 as a documentary film (yah I know but that's what IMDB says) is well deserved.\nReview Title: It's hard to take this movie seriously when the women's beehive hair appears in place after a nuclear explosion.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Cinematic Titanic LIVE: East Meets Watts\nReview Date: 2016/04/24\nStore: Joel Hodgson  (Actor),     Trace Beaulieu  (Actor),     Sharp/Ford  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Comedy\nProduct Description: [\"Kung Fu hits the streets!

More than 125 Vietnam veterans, representing every major combat unit to see action, gathered in Detroit to heal a nation... and themselves. They risked everything to talk about the atrocities they had committed or witnessed in the presence of officers while stationed in Vietnam. These veterans saw themselves as winter soldiers battling against the wrongs of the war and the brutal training that had made them capable of unthinkable violence. Eighteen filmmakers calling themselves the Winterfilm Collective - including Barbara Kopple (Harlan County, USA), Robert Fiore (Pumping Iron) and Lucy Massie Phenix (You Got to Move) - captured this extraordinary event. Rarely seen since its 1972 Cannes premiere, Winter Soldier has been called one of the most powerful anti-war films ever made and remains to this day a remarkable plea for peace.', 'Amazon.com', 'The more things change, the more they stay the same. Thus it should come as little surprise that while the events described in', 'Winter Soldier', 'took place during the Vietnam conflict, the 2006 home video release of this 1972 documentary more or less coincides with recent, eerily similar revelations regarding the activities of U.S. military personnel stationed in Iraq, including the Abu Ghraib prison scandal and the alleged slaughter of civilians in the town of Haditha. The film centers on a day in January, 1971, when more than 100 former soldiers turned up at a motel in Detroit to give testimony as part of an investigation sponsored by a group calling itself Vietnam Veterans Against the War. Their stories are genuinely chilling, as they matter-of-factly describe civilians being thrown from helicopters, villages burned, children shot, women raped, and innocent people tortured, maimed (cutting off their ears was popular), or even skinned; the notorious My Lai massacre of 1968 was apparently more the rule than the exception. Some eighteen documentary filmmakers took part in the making of this production, including Barbara Kopple (', 'Harlan County, U.S.A.', ') and Robert Fiore (', 'Pumping Iron', '). But there is no great artistry on display here--the film is mostly a succession of talking heads, appearing in grainy black & white (there are also a few photographs and occasional color film footage shot in Vietnam) and recounting how they were brainwashed into believing that the atrocities in which they participated were \"in the best interests of our nation,\" as one puts it, especially since \"it wasn\\'t like (the Vietnamese) were human.\" Unlike Emile de Antonio\\x92s', 'In the Year of the Pig', ',', 'Winter Soldier', \"gives us nothing from the other side--the opposition to the opposition, if you will. All we have are the vets' terrible (and highly credible) tales of how officers who witnessed or took part in these horrors wrote them off as Standard Operating Procedure. Strong stuff, but the film starts to become repetitive and ultimately tedious after it passes the one hour mark. The abundance of bonus features, including a current interview with the filmmakers and three shorter films addressing the same theme as the main feature, will be of interest mainly to gluttons for punishment.\", '--Sam Graham', 'Review', '\"A live hand grenade brought home from a distant battlefield.\" --', 'David M.

That journey, by which a fire-breathing revolutionary such as Bernadine Dohrn became a (still fiery) gray-haired wife and mother, is an intriguing one. This film, rich in period footage (and some unnecessary sensationalism) captures the era somewhat broadly.

The film does not at all glorify them, the directors simply told a story of why these American college students simply wanted to stop the senseless armed conflict in Vietnam and their stance against oppression and racism in America. While I don't agree with their politics i.e., communism, and their unrealistic premise of the majority of Americans would violently revolt against the American government, their commitment ( by death if necessary) to the cause for social change, as told by the director, is very engaging!!

Being a child that grew up in the 1970's it was just a terrible time as far as race relations.  Nevertheless, the film captured the  savagery and primitive  behavior of the time period of 1970 at the time of the US secondary school busing enactment.<br /><br />Didn't understand the point of why the black girls were ripping  the  white girl's close off? A very eerie scene!!! Probably a reaction to black men would possibly pay more attention to her for various reasons, coupled with black women's insecurity of the alleged notion of the western culture's standard of beauty is caucasian. Regardless the scene did it's job of capturing the viewer's emotions.<br /><br />Dare I say, and it still stands today, when a women who are clearly more attractive than a certain mass of women, the low self-esteem and/or not so attractive women get attention starved and feel angry and scared of being ostracized and, worse case, they believe, they'll die alone.<br /><br />Perhaps this film should be archived in the US National Film Registry.\nJust an Ugly time for Black Americans in the early 1970's, and the film captured it.\nThe War Game / Culloden [DVD]\nOlivier Espitalier-Noel  (Actor),     George McBean  (Actor)    Rated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Drama\n{'Format': 'DVD, NTSC, Black & White', 'Contributor': 'Peter Watkins, Olivier Espitalier-Noel, Robert Oates, Kathy Staff, Michael Aspel, Peter Graham, George McBeanPeter Watkins, Olivier Espitalier-Noel, Robert Oates, Kathy Staff, Michael Aspel, Peter Graham, George McBean   See more', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono)', 'Runtime': '2 hours', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'Unrated (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.5 x 0.5 inches; 2.93 Ounces', 'Director': 'Peter Watkins', 'Media Format': 'DVD, NTSC, Black & White', 'Run time': '2 hours', 'Release date': 'July 25, 2006', 'Actors': 'Olivier Espitalier-Noel, George McBean, Robert Oates, Peter Watkins, Michael Aspel', 'Studio': 'Project X', 'Writers': 'Peter Watkins', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nYour watching a fictional biography where a reporter is interviewing people before and after a nuclear strike in an English town in 1965.<br />Its ok given being desensitized by post 9/11 and watching Threads and the The Day After in 1984 as a teenager. It does mention current events such as Vietnam,LBJ interestingly.<br /><br />One Of the scenes where people were moved to people's houses and the women asked the cop if the people are &#34;colored&#34;. I had to roll my eyes up at that stupid girl's comment, but that was the behavior at that time.<br /><br />But keeping in mind this was 1965, not long after the Cuban missile crisis, this film would freak anyone out. It's less than an hour long. There's much commentary between scenes with a reporters interviewing civilians like a documentary but the reporter was also acting.<br /><br />It was hard to take seriously this film because the actresses'  hair seemed to be exempted from any radiation let alone dirt in some scenes. YouTube personality Tommy Sotomayor's takes on black women's obsession with weave would have a field day with this one.<br /><br />But actors, actresses and writers did their homework to capture the pompous ignorance of the civilized before the catastrophe then the raw emotion of the destress, despair and horror and how civil defense is pointless. With the exception of the hair issue, it's a black and white short version of Threads. But it was well-written with the all the intense camera angles at that which are common today. Winning the Oscar in 1967 as a documentary film (yah I know but that's what IMDB says) is well deserved.\nIt's hard to take this movie seriously when the women's beehive hair appears in place after a nuclear explosion.\nCinematic Titanic LIVE: East Meets Watts\nJoel Hodgson  (Actor),     Trace Beaulieu  (Actor),     Sharp/Ford  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Comedy\n[\"Kung Fu hits the streets!

More than 125 Vietnam veterans, representing every major combat unit to see action, gathered in Detroit to heal a nation... and themselves. They risked everything to talk about the atrocities they had committed or witnessed in the presence of officers while stationed in Vietnam. These veterans saw themselves as winter soldiers battling against the wrongs of the war and the brutal training that had made them capable of unthinkable violence. Eighteen filmmakers calling themselves the Winterfilm Collective - including Barbara Kopple (Harlan County, USA), Robert Fiore (Pumping Iron) and Lucy Massie Phenix (You Got to Move) - captured this extraordinary event. Rarely seen since its 1972 Cannes premiere, Winter Soldier has been called one of the most powerful anti-war films ever made and remains to this day a remarkable plea for peace.', 'Amazon.com', 'The more things change, the more they stay the same. Thus it should come as little surprise that while the events described in', 'Winter Soldier', 'took place during the Vietnam conflict, the 2006 home video release of this 1972 documentary more or less coincides with recent, eerily similar revelations regarding the activities of U.S. military personnel stationed in Iraq, including the Abu Ghraib prison scandal and the alleged slaughter of civilians in the town of Haditha. The film centers on a day in January, 1971, when more than 100 former soldiers turned up at a motel in Detroit to give testimony as part of an investigation sponsored by a group calling itself Vietnam Veterans Against the War. Their stories are genuinely chilling, as they matter-of-factly describe civilians being thrown from helicopters, villages burned, children shot, women raped, and innocent people tortured, maimed (cutting off their ears was popular), or even skinned; the notorious My Lai massacre of 1968 was apparently more the rule than the exception. Some eighteen documentary filmmakers took part in the making of this production, including Barbara Kopple (', 'Harlan County, U.S.A.', ') and Robert Fiore (', 'Pumping Iron', '). But there is no great artistry on display here--the film is mostly a succession of talking heads, appearing in grainy black & white (there are also a few photographs and occasional color film footage shot in Vietnam) and recounting how they were brainwashed into believing that the atrocities in which they participated were \"in the best interests of our nation,\" as one puts it, especially since \"it wasn\\'t like (the Vietnamese) were human.\" Unlike Emile de Antonio\\x92s', 'In the Year of the Pig', ',', 'Winter Soldier', \"gives us nothing from the other side--the opposition to the opposition, if you will. All we have are the vets' terrible (and highly credible) tales of how officers who witnessed or took part in these horrors wrote them off as Standard Operating Procedure. Strong stuff, but the film starts to become repetitive and ultimately tedious after it passes the one hour mark. The abundance of bonus features, including a current interview with the filmmakers and three shorter films addressing the same theme as the main feature, will be of interest mainly to gluttons for punishment.\", '--Sam Graham', 'Review', '\"A live hand grenade brought home from a distant battlefield.\" --', 'David M.

I m going to read a declaration of a state of war...Within the next 14 days we will attack a symbol or institution of American injustice --Bernardine Dohrn', 'Thirty years ago, with these words, a group of young American radicals called The Weathermen announced their intention to overthrow the U.S. government. Fueled by outrage over the Vietnam War and racism in America, they went undergound during the 1970s, bombing targets across the country that they felt symbolized the real violence that the U.S. government and capitalist power were wreaking throughout the world. From pitched battles with police on Chicago s city streets, to bombing the U.S. Capitol building, to breaking acid-guru Timothy Leary out of prison, this carefully organized clandestine network attempted to incite a national revolution, while successfully evading one of the largest FBI manhunts in history.', 'One of the top documentaries of the year, this award-winning film interweaves extensive archival material with modern-day interviews to explore the incredible story of The Weather Underground. As former members reflect candidly about the idealistic passion that drove them to bring the war home, they paint a compelling portrait of troubled and revolutionary times, with unexpected and often striking connections to the current world situation.', 'Special Features:', 'Commentary From Former Weathermen Bernardine Dohrn and Bill Ayers; Filmmaker Commentary; Original Weathermen Audio Communiques; Bonus Film on Former Weatherman David Gilbert: A Lifetime of Struggle; Excerpt from Emile de Antonio film Underground; Filmmaker Biographies; Filmmaker Statement; Spanish Subtitles; Interactive Menus; Scene Selection', 'Amazon.com', \"The key players in the radical movement known as the Weather Underground are skillfully brought to life in this Oscar-nominated documentary. The Weathermen were born of sixties protest, but took their scheme to overthrow the U.S. government to especially violent extremes. Never a well-populated movement, the Underground petered out as its leaders aged during the seventies; by decade's end, weary of hiding, most of them had turned themselves over to the authorities. That journey, by which a fire-breathing revolutionary such as Bernadine Dohrn became a (still fiery) gray-haired wife and mother, is an intriguing one. This film, rich in period footage (and some unnecessary sensationalism) captures the era somewhat broadly. But the present-day interviews with the participants, contrasted with their radical selves, provides an exceptionally detailed look inside the organization itself.

The film does not at all glorify them, the directors simply told a story of why these American college students simply wanted to stop the senseless armed conflict in Vietnam and their stance against oppression and racism in America. While I don't agree with their politics i.e., communism, and their unrealistic premise of the majority of Americans would violently revolt against the American government, their commitment ( by death if necessary) to the cause for social change, as told by the director, is very engaging!! I absolutely can't get enough of Weatherman Niomi Jaffee's quote early in the film: &#34; if you sit in your little white house and go to your little  white job and allow the country you live in to murder people, and you sit there and don't do anything about it that's violence&#34;...if one is not part of the solution they're part of the problem. In the director's commentary, the director said when he interviewed the group said that they didn't want to be &#34;good Germans&#34; (in relation to Jaffe's quote)---wow!!<br /><br />I was only five years old when the group went underground, officially,in 1970 after the townhouse explosion (I had my own problems with racism) but I had heard of the name around 1975 and in 1980 when most of charges (the many bombings the group committed)were dropped because of arrogant, stupid, and corrupt tactics of the FBI.<br /><br />Too bad these directors, although nominated, didn't win the academy award for best documentary film---and these directors were not born during that time!! Any unearthed story from the turbulent 1960s that would educate today's young adults in order to further civilize and clean up bad behavior is alright by me.

The acting by all was fantastic, especially, Jeff Bridges and Rob Reiner.Remembered a bits and pieces of it on late night television in mid-seventies. I was too young to see it  the theaters. Just as well I was living it myself. Not in the US but in Toronto, Ontario, Canada--not as violent but the name calling was prevalent. Being a child that grew up in the 1970's it was just a terrible time as far as race relations.  Nevertheless, the film captured the  savagery and primitive  behavior of the time period of 1970 at the time of the US secondary school busing enactment.<br /><br />Didn't understand the point of why the black girls were ripping  the  white girl's close off? A very eerie scene!!! Probably a reaction to black men would possibly pay more attention to her for various reasons, coupled with black women's insecurity of the alleged notion of the western culture's standard of beauty is caucasian. Regardless the scene did it's job of capturing the viewer's emotions.<br /><br />Dare I say, and it still stands today, when a women who are clearly more attractive than a certain mass of women, the low self-esteem and/or not so attractive women get attention starved and feel angry and scared of being ostracized and, worse case, they believe, they'll die alone.<br /><br />Perhaps this film should be archived in the US National Film Registry.\nReview Title: Just an Ugly time for Black Americans in the early 1970's, and the film captured it.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: The War Game / Culloden [DVD]\nReview Date: 2016/01/28\nStore: Olivier Espitalier-Noel  (Actor),     George McBean  (Actor)    Rated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Drama\nAverage Rating: 4.2\nProduct Details: {'Format': 'DVD, NTSC, Black & White', 'Contributor': 'Peter Watkins, Olivier Espitalier-Noel, Robert Oates, Kathy Staff, Michael Aspel, Peter Graham, George McBeanPeter Watkins, Olivier Espitalier-Noel, Robert Oates, Kathy Staff, Michael Aspel, Peter Graham, George McBean   See more', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono)', 'Runtime': '2 hours', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'Unrated (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.5 x 0.5 inches; 2.93 Ounces', 'Director': 'Peter Watkins', 'Media Format': 'DVD, NTSC, Black & White', 'Run time': '2 hours', 'Release date': 'July 25, 2006', 'Actors': 'Olivier Espitalier-Noel, George McBean, Robert Oates, Peter Watkins, Michael Aspel', 'Studio': 'Project X', 'Writers': 'Peter Watkins', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: Your watching a fictional biography where a reporter is interviewing people before and after a nuclear strike in an English town in 1965.<br />Its ok given being desensitized by post 9/11 and watching Threads and the The Day After in 1984 as a teenager. It does mention current events such as Vietnam,LBJ interestingly.<br /><br />One Of the scenes where people were moved to people's houses and the women asked the cop if the people are &#34;colored&#34;. I had to roll my eyes up at that stupid girl's comment, but that was the behavior at that time.<br /><br />But keeping in mind this was 1965, not long after the Cuban missile crisis, this film would freak anyone out. It's less than an hour long. There's much commentary between scenes with a reporters interviewing civilians like a documentary but the reporter was also acting.<br /><br />It was hard to take seriously this film because the actresses'  hair seemed to be exempted from any radiation let alone dirt in some scenes. YouTube personality Tommy Sotomayor's takes on black women's obsession with weave would have a field day with this one.<br /><br />But actors, actresses and writers did their homework to capture the pompous ignorance of the civilized before the catastrophe then the raw emotion of the destress, despair and horror and how civil defense is pointless. With the exception of the hair issue, it's a black and white short version of Threads. But it was well-written with the all the intense camera angles at that which are common today. Winning the Oscar in 1967 as a documentary film (yah I know but that's what IMDB says) is well deserved.\nReview Title: It's hard to take this movie seriously when the women's beehive hair appears in place after a nuclear explosion.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Cinematic Titanic LIVE: East Meets Watts\nReview Date: 2016/04/24\nStore: Joel Hodgson  (Actor),     Trace Beaulieu  (Actor),     Sharp/Ford  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Comedy\nProduct Description: [\"Kung Fu hits the streets!

More than 125 Vietnam veterans, representing every major combat unit to see action, gathered in Detroit to heal a nation... and themselves. They risked everything to talk about the atrocities they had committed or witnessed in the presence of officers while stationed in Vietnam. These veterans saw themselves as winter soldiers battling against the wrongs of the war and the brutal training that had made them capable of unthinkable violence. Eighteen filmmakers calling themselves the Winterfilm Collective - including Barbara Kopple (Harlan County, USA), Robert Fiore (Pumping Iron) and Lucy Massie Phenix (You Got to Move) - captured this extraordinary event. Rarely seen since its 1972 Cannes premiere, Winter Soldier has been called one of the most powerful anti-war films ever made and remains to this day a remarkable plea for peace.', 'Amazon.com', 'The more things change, the more they stay the same. Thus it should come as little surprise that while the events described in', 'Winter Soldier', 'took place during the Vietnam conflict, the 2006 home video release of this 1972 documentary more or less coincides with recent, eerily similar revelations regarding the activities of U.S. military personnel stationed in Iraq, including the Abu Ghraib prison scandal and the alleged slaughter of civilians in the town of Haditha. The film centers on a day in January, 1971, when more than 100 former soldiers turned up at a motel in Detroit to give testimony as part of an investigation sponsored by a group calling itself Vietnam Veterans Against the War. Their stories are genuinely chilling, as they matter-of-factly describe civilians being thrown from helicopters, villages burned, children shot, women raped, and innocent people tortured, maimed (cutting off their ears was popular), or even skinned; the notorious My Lai massacre of 1968 was apparently more the rule than the exception. Some eighteen documentary filmmakers took part in the making of this production, including Barbara Kopple (', 'Harlan County, U.S.A.', ') and Robert Fiore (', 'Pumping Iron', '). But there is no great artistry on display here--the film is mostly a succession of talking heads, appearing in grainy black & white (there are also a few photographs and occasional color film footage shot in Vietnam) and recounting how they were brainwashed into believing that the atrocities in which they participated were \"in the best interests of our nation,\" as one puts it, especially since \"it wasn\\'t like (the Vietnamese) were human.\" Unlike Emile de Antonio\\x92s', 'In the Year of the Pig', ',', 'Winter Soldier', \"gives us nothing from the other side--the opposition to the opposition, if you will. All we have are the vets' terrible (and highly credible) tales of how officers who witnessed or took part in these horrors wrote them off as Standard Operating Procedure. Strong stuff, but the film starts to become repetitive and ultimately tedious after it passes the one hour mark.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe individual displays a strong preference for vintage movies and documentaries, particularly those that highlight social issues, historical events, and cultural critiques from the 1960s to the 1980s. Consistently high ratings (often 4.6 and above) indicate a genuine appreciation for quality storytelling and significant themes, particularly those addressing political and social justice. The sentiment in their reviews reflects nostalgia and a critical analysis of historical contexts, particularly regarding race relations and war.\n\nRecurring themes include science fiction, war documentaries, and classic comedies, suggesting a diverse taste that values both entertainment and education. The individual seems to favor quality over quantity, as they have ignored more recent products with lower quality ratings. \n\nWhile price sensitivity is not clearly indicated, a tendency towards purchasing value-based collections (e.g., complete series) suggests a willingness to invest in extensive viewing experiences. Lower ratings are primarily reserved for content that does not meet expectations, especially regarding formatting or representational accuracy, indicating a discerning taste for presentation and substance.\n\nIn conclusion, the core preferences can be synthesized as a strong affinity for classic, impactful cinema and television that reflects or critiques societal issues, combined with a thoughtful engagement with the historical context of these works.",
