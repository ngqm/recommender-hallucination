The story is great too, It's a classic, if you are a boy or a girl it doesn't matter, each can relate.

Well, not an edge of your seat roller coaster ride where you pee your pants or barf in your own face, but more like a nervous passenger in the car while your recently immigrated relative drives on 405 with their new license. You might be thinking, well...that doesn't sound pleasant, but to people like me who like this crap, it is very enjoyable. It is nice for once to not know what the hell is going on in advance, what to expect from the characters, to rely on the same song sung by a different singer over and over and over again in television and movies gets old quick. It's usually always the same damn drivel recycled, and thankfully that is not the case with this show.<br /><br />Having a show where boy meets girl is not the center of the plot is nice as well. I can't recall a series where there is more than one \"bad guy\" and added to that developed characters you get sympathy for, save for maybe Dexter. Also a new thing is having different \"bad guy\" types/categories. For example you'll never see a show with zombies AND Psycho serial killers, especially not with Nazi evil scientists and slutty nuns. I mean call me crazy but even Dexter has drawn it's line of bridges it won't cross. This show doesn't care, it walks in the room and lays it's gigantic balls on the table and say's \"See this, I'm doing it, because **** You, that's why\"<br /><br />I liked season one, it was completely different from this one, and that is something I also really like a lot. The anthological nature of the series is pretty cool, because honestly with that much chaos you can't keep it up without the show turning to poo. Also, The opening credits nerps me out, I feel like I am watching old scare tv from the early 90's late 80's, in the dark as a fragile minded preteen. Remember Elvira? Freakshow? Tales from the crypt? We've needed something new that follows those footsteps, the bastard child of the creepshow. Watch a few episodes, you might really like it.\nReview Title: This show is great.

No complaints there.

The fact that it is part 1 & part 2 of crank makes it great. Sometimes you get value packs and it's one movie you want and one movie from 1976 only your dad has watched and he didn't much care for it. I'd say buy this, it's worth it. I'm not going to explain the plot for you, but the movies are good. I just wanted to comment that the value you get is worth the cost and the quality of the packaging and the disks are first rate. Nothing cheap about this disk set, simple yes, but well manufactured.\nReview Title: Good movie, Even better value pack.\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Sleeping Beauty (Two-Disc Platinum Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo + BD Live) [Blu-ray]\nReview Date: 2012/01/26\nStore: Mary Costa  (Actor),     Eleanor Audley  (Actor),     Clyde Geronimi  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    G    Format: Blu-ray\nCategories: Movies & TV, Blu-ray, Movies\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Kids & Family, Special Interests, Action & Adventure', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Multiple Formats', 'Contributor': 'Winston Hibler, Verna Felton, Dal McKennon, Milt Banta, Joe Rinaldi, Marvin Miller, Bill Peet, Clyde Geronimi, Bill Amsbery, Pinto Colvig, Barbara Luddy, Barbara Jo Allen, Mary Costa, Taylor Holmes, Ted Sears, Candy Candido, Charles Perrault, Erdman Penner, Eleanor Audley, Bill Shirley, Bill ThompsonWinston Hibler, Verna Felton, Dal McKennon, Milt Banta, Joe Rinaldi, Marvin Miller, Bill Peet, Clyde Geronimi, Bill Amsbery, Pinto Colvig, Barbara Luddy, Barbara Jo Allen, Mary Costa, Taylor Holmes, Ted Sears, Candy Candido, Charles Perrault, Erdman Penner, Eleanor Audle\u2026  See more', 'Language': 'English', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 15 minutes'}\nReview Text: First of all let me state the truth, I haven't watched this movie in a long time and when I did ( some 20 years ago) I recalled it being dull and flat in it's imagery. Not the same, this remastered bluray is amazing. The colors are striking and its amazing how everything \"pops\". The story is great too, It's a classic, if you are a boy or a girl it doesn't matter, each can relate. This is a set I would highly recommend, and I would suggest buying it new and joining the Disney Movie rewards program, if you are going to buy the movies you might as well join the free points program, registering your movies gives you free streaming options ( on certain disks) an affordable disc replacement program and a few other minor benefits, its free so might as well.

My kid loves music and sing a longs, although you should know there are no follow the bouncing ball sing along here. The sing along, is more like a pageant that the kids throw on a day off school where they sing their favorite songs from school.<br /><br />The only thing is there seems to be an exceptional amount of trailers or commercials for other cartoons on it. The longest I have ever experienced in any movie.\nReview Title: It's cute ( a lot of trailers though)\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2012/12/13\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'frightening scenes', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Bradley Buecker', 'Alfonso Gomez-Rejon', 'Michael Uppendahl', 'Loni Peristere', 'John J.

Well, not an edge of your seat roller coaster ride where you pee your pants or barf in your own face, but more like a nervous passenger in the car while your recently immigrated relative drives on 405 with their new license. You might be thinking, well...that doesn't sound pleasant, but to people like me who like this crap, it is very enjoyable. It is nice for once to not know what the hell is going on in advance, what to expect from the characters, to rely on the same song sung by a different singer over and over and over again in television and movies gets old quick. It's usually always the same damn drivel recycled, and thankfully that is not the case with this show.<br /><br />Having a show where boy meets girl is not the center of the plot is nice as well. I can't recall a series where there is more than one \"bad guy\" and added to that developed characters you get sympathy for, save for maybe Dexter. Also a new thing is having different \"bad guy\" types/categories. For example you'll never see a show with zombies AND Psycho serial killers, especially not with Nazi evil scientists and slutty nuns. I mean call me crazy but even Dexter has drawn it's line of bridges it won't cross. This show doesn't care, it walks in the room and lays it's gigantic balls on the table and say's \"See this, I'm doing it, because **** You, that's why\"<br /><br />I liked season one, it was completely different from this one, and that is something I also really like a lot. The anthological nature of the series is pretty cool, because honestly with that much chaos you can't keep it up without the show turning to poo. Also, The opening credits nerps me out, I feel like I am watching old scare tv from the early 90's late 80's, in the dark as a fragile minded preteen. Remember Elvira? Freakshow? Tales from the crypt? We've needed something new that follows those footsteps, the bastard child of the creepshow. Watch a few episodes, you might really like it.\nReview Title: This show is great. We've needed a good \"horror\" show on TV for awhile now.\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n    Structure your response as:\n   \n    SUMMARY:\n    [Final synthesis of preferences and patterns]",
