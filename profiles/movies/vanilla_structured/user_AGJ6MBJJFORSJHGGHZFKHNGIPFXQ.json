The worst of the neighborhood baddies is Richie Madano (William Forsythe), a crack-smoking killer who murders his partner and terrorizes the neighborhood. Technically, Felino is a terrible cop--touching evidence at murder scenes, stealing evidence, intimidating witnesses--but only by breaking those rules can he bring in this horrible criminal.

Julianna Margulies (', 'ER', \") has a small but thankless role as Richie's hooker girlfriend, and Gina Gershon (\", 'Face/Off', ',', 'Bound', \") has an equally thankless role as Richie's foul-mouthed, bar-owning sister.
