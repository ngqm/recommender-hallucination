  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:  \nThe individual demonstrates a strong preference for romantic and historically-themed films, particularly adaptations of classic literature. Consistently high ratings (averaging above 4.5) for adaptations indicate a sentimental connection to familiar narratives and characters, as seen in their focus on Jane Austen and classic French literature. The person values high-quality production, strong performances, and attention to detail in cinematography and period settings. \n\nThey exhibit a preference for DVDs over streaming formats, suggesting an appreciation for physical collections and potentially a desire for nostalgia or tangible ownership. Price sensitivity is not explicitly evident in the average ratings, as they tend to rate highly regardless of the collection\u2019s price or format, implying a willingness to invest in quality.\n\nThe patterns show that while they enjoy mainstream films, there's also an openness to lesser-known titles, evidenced by their positive feedback on independent or art-house films. Family-friendly content, like children\u2019s programming, receives equal acclaim, underscoring a role as a family-oriented buyer.\n\nOverall, this person gravitates towards emotionally resonant narratives and high production values in romantic and historical contexts, while also engaging with family-oriented media for younger audiences.",
