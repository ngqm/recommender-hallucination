Complemented by an energizing, vintage R&B soundtrack, this tender, colorful film is a fitting tribute to an American family.', 'Bonus Content:', 'Production Notes', 'Production Notes', 'Cast and Filmmakers', 'Cast and Filmmakers', ']]>', 'Amazon.com', \"Spike Lee's semiautobiographical, 1994 film about the good and bad times for a Brooklyn family in the '70s has passion and nostalgic good feeling, but it is also a mess of random reflections and arbitrary storytelling. The centerpiece of the movie is a little girl (Zelda Harris) who views the ups and downs of her parents' experiences (mom and dad are played by Delroy Lindo and Alfre Woodard), and who navigates the life of her neighborhood. Lee tosses in a lot of '70s detail (watching\", 'The Partridge Family', \") and other diversions (Harris's journey through suburbia), but he has no master sensibility controlling the flow of it all. The film is more wearying than anything, although bright spots include Lindo's fine performance as a talented man suffering from irrelevance.\", '--Tom Keogh']\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Aspect Ratio': '1.85:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.38 x 0.6 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': '2020515', 'Director': 'Spike Lee', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Closed-captioned, Anamorphic, Color, NTSC, Widescreen, Dolby', 'Run time': '1 hour and 54 minutes', 'Release date': 'September 1, 2015', 'Actors': 'Alfre Woodard, Delroy Lindo, Spike Lee, David Patrick Kelly, Zelda Harris', 'Dubbed': 'French', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish', 'Producers': 'Spike Lee', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1), French (Dolby Digital 5.1), Unqualified', 'Studio': 'Universal Pictures Home Entertainment', 'Writers': 'Joie Susannah Lee, Cinque Lee, Spike Lee', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: One of my favorite films from my chilhood.

He can't read music (he lied on his application) and his attitude sucks, but he's the best natural drummer the college has ever had, so he quickly rises through the marching band ranks. The school year brings Devon the obligatory girlfriend (Zo\u00eb Saldana, smart and charming); clashes with his old-school band director (Orlando Jones); and well-earned redemption at the championship marching band showdown.

This formulaic yet surprisingly captivating movie honors the military precision of college football marching bands, those battalions of eager, sternly disciplined brass sections, drummers, and fly girls who turn halftime shows into well-oiled Vegas variety acts on steroids. Devon (played by Will Smith prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Nick Cannon) is a cocky Brooklyn kid with a snare-drumming scholarship to (fictional) Atlanta A&T University. He can't read music (he lied on his application) and his attitude sucks, but he's the best natural drummer the college has ever had, so he quickly rises through the marching band ranks. The school year brings Devon the obligatory girlfriend (Zo\u00eb Saldana, smart and charming); clashes with his old-school band director (Orlando Jones); and well-earned redemption at the championship marching band showdown. No surprises here, but great chemistry all around, and a fantastic, positive role-model showcase for a musical form that has evolved far beyond the main street parades of Smalltown, U.S.A. --\", 'Jeff Shannon']\n{'Aspect Ratio': '2.35:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 2.72 Ounces', 'Item model number': '2248800', 'Director': 'Charles Stone III', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Color, Dolby, Widescreen, Closed-captioned, NTSC', 'Run time': '2 hours and 2 minutes', 'Release date': 'January 29, 2008', 'Actors': 'Nick Cannon, Zoe Saldana, Orlando Jones, Leonard Roberts, GQ', 'Dubbed': 'French, Spanish', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish', 'Studio': '20th Century Studios', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nLoved this movie when it came out!

Featuring a hip-hop soundtrack and dazzling dance moves, Drumline \"shakes, rattles and rolls the house!\" (Washington Post).', 'Amazon.com', \"Once you've seen\", 'Drumline', \", halftime shows will become works of art. This formulaic yet surprisingly captivating movie honors the military precision of college football marching bands, those battalions of eager, sternly disciplined brass sections, drummers, and fly girls who turn halftime shows into well-oiled Vegas variety acts on steroids. Devon (played by Will Smith prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Nick Cannon) is a cocky Brooklyn kid with a snare-drumming scholarship to (fictional) Atlanta A&T University. He can't read music (he lied on his application) and his attitude sucks, but he's the best natural drummer the college has ever had, so he quickly rises through the marching band ranks. The school year brings Devon the obligatory girlfriend (Zo\u00eb Saldana, smart and charming); clashes with his old-school band director (Orlando Jones); and well-earned redemption at the championship marching band showdown. No surprises here, but great chemistry all around, and a fantastic, positive role-model showcase for a musical form that has evolved far beyond the main street parades of Smalltown, U.S.A. --\", 'Jeff Shannon']\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Aspect Ratio': '2.35:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 2.72 Ounces', 'Item model number': '2248800', 'Director': 'Charles Stone III', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Color, Dolby, Widescreen, Closed-captioned, NTSC', 'Run time': '2 hours and 2 minutes', 'Release date': 'January 29, 2008', 'Actors': 'Nick Cannon, Zoe Saldana, Orlando Jones, Leonard Roberts, GQ', 'Dubbed': 'French, Spanish', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish', 'Studio': '20th Century Studios', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: Loved this movie when it came out!
