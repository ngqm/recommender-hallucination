Kenneth Branagh\\'s film, written by costar Rita Rudner and Martin Bergman, is buoyed by its vast and talented cast, whose chemistry keeps the action crackling, even when most of the action is the characters speaking. The friends are reunited at Peter\\'s posh country home after the death of his father, for one last New Year\\'s Eve. The bons mots fly, and the interaction of the actors is, as the Brits say, brilliant. Peter (played by the sublime Stephen Fry): \"It\\'s funny, with both my parents gone, I suddenly have this overwhelming urge to act maturely.\" Andrew (Branagh): \"Oh, well, I don\\'t think anybody really matures. Adults are just children who owe money.\" Yet buried among the one-liners and drawing-room manners are disappointment, heartbreak, and a heavy secret (which, many years after the film\\'s original 1992 release, doesn\\'t pack the same wallop). Emma Thompson shows nuance and delight as Maggie while Hugh Laurie shows his dramatic capabilities. Other winning performances are given by Imelda Staunton and Tony Slattery.
