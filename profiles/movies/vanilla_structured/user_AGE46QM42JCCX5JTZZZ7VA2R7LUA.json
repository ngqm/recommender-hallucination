Anne Hathaway shines as Jane and embodies her spirit perfectly.  The script is fun and flirty with plenty of wit and charm.  They work in many references to Jane Austen's novels.  James McAvoy makes me drool, he is sweet and sexy.

Fortysomething straight-laced Cal Weaver (Carell) is living the dream\u2014good job, nice house, great kids and marriage to his high school sweetheart, Emily (Julianne Moore). So when Cal learns that his wife has cheated on him and wants a divorce, his \u201cperfect\u201d life quickly unravels. Cal, who hasn't dated in decades, stands out as the epitome of un-smooth so handsome player Jacob Palmer (Gosling) takes him on as wingman and prot\u00e9g\u00e9, opening Cal\u2019s eyes to the many options before him: flirty women, manly drinks and a sense of style. Despite Cal's makeover and his many new conquests, the one thing that can\u2019t be made over is his heart, which seems to keep leading Cal back to where he began.

Enter Jacob (Gosling, who's never been better) as a happy bachelor whose tips for Cal will be ones that even the most happily wed female viewers will secretly want their mates to hear. Marisa Tomei has a hilarious turn as a temptress who's way out of Cal's league.
