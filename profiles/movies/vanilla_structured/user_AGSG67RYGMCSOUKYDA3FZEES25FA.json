Moreover, the general production in terms of set and filming is very good.  However, the movie feels a bit disjointed and far-fetched.  One gets the sense that anyone can be randomly denounced at any moment and suffer a catastrophic fall.  The sense of vulnerability borders on flippancy, and as such, doesn't seem very believable.  Tom Hardy is a war hero, and though celebrated people could surely suffer falls in the Soviet Union, his seems so swift and complete as to seem far-fetched.  I'd call it overdone in a basic sense.  I also thought that the storyline of his wife not being in love with him (marrying him out of fear) didn't ring true and felt like a distraction.  Hardy's character is a smart fellow, and though one should never discount the power of self-deception and willed ignorance, he seems to have no idea that his wife doesn't share his feelings.

The palpable sense of suffering and longing that John Lakeman experiences as he perseveres in his mission is just brilliantly done.  Michael Dorman is absolutely superb in the role.  You can't help but fall for the guy.  He's a good man doing dark things, missing his wife badly, and in way over his undercover head.  The engineering riffs will make your head spin.  You know it's English, but you have no idea what it all means, and they are really funny and important to pounding home the sense of futility in John (how is he to come up to speed on this stuff?).  The folk singing angle adds to the whole picture (Dorman has a pleasant voice).  This show reminds me of Charles Frazier's Inman (in his novel, Cold Mountain).  Like Inman, John is increasingly sick of the things he must do (Inman in war and John in intelligence), and though both are really adept at violence, they want to be quit of it and return home to their love.

He says that one of Barack Obama's first actions in office was to send a bust of Winston Churchill back to British.  The implication is that he insulted an ally, presumably because of his hatred of British imperialism in the Kenya of \"his fathers\" (as D'Souza likes to say).  The real story is that there were two Churchill busts in the White House, both by the same sculptor.  One had been on loan by Tony Blair to George Bush.  When Bush finished his term, the bust was given back, as one would expect with something on loan.  The other remained in the White House, outside Obama's private office.  So here we see D'Souza misleading people.  Yes, a bust was given back, as it needed to be, but no, Obama was not insulting the British by returning a bust, and in fact, the other bust was placed in a prominent spot (just not the Oval Office, as the \"on loan\" bust had been). Either D'Souza knows all this and he intends to deceive viewers, or else he is a sloppy hack.  I'd bet on the former.  Dinesh D'Souza is like some propaganda dream child, an immigrant from Mumbai who is happy to deny America's issues and to vilify Obama.  To give him his due, presumably he makes some decent coin with his books and films, a minor miracle given that they are not worth a dime.\nReview Title: Glamorous Hogwash\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: The Commuter\nReview Date: 2019/01/11\nCategories: Suspense, Action, Cerebral, Ominous\nProduct Description: ['A man who gets caught up in a criminal conspiracy during his daily commute home and works against the clock to stop a deadly attack to save the lives of his fellow train passengers.']\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Jaume Serra'], 'Producers': ['Andrew Rona', 'Alex Heineman'], 'Starring': ['Liam Neeson', 'Vera Farmiga', 'Patrick Wilson']}\nReview Text: Just to get a picky detail out of the way, the film depicts Liam Neeson's Metro North commuter train stopping at 86th Street and Lexington Avenue.  Such a train doesn't run on that line, so the film essentially mashes a subway train and a commuter train.  It's no crime to make up a detail like this, but there seems like there is little point to it except to fit in some additional stations between Grand Central and 125th Street.  Lots of people from New York would look at that film train stopping at 86th and be bugged by the unnecessary fiction.<br /><br />While the film is entertaining, it's wildly implausible, both in the general plot and in the details.  The Bad Woman (Vera Farmiga) seems to haver the power to reach Liam Neeson on phones that belong to other people, people with no previous connection to Neeson.  It stretches credulity.  Without spoiling the plot too much, the Bad Guys want someone dead, and they want Neeson's help to make it so, but since they know the target is getting off at Cold Spring, a sniper at the station would do the trick nicely and save them the very unlikely Neeson plot.  Of course, in this case, you wouldn't have the movie.  While in the midst of it, you can be entertained, but if you step back from it, the details are such that it's a pretty dumb film.\nReview Title: Wildly Implausible\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I think a character like Hardy would realize that his wife doesn't share his feelings.\nReview Title: A Bit Overdone\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2016/02/05\nAverage Rating: 4.6\nProduct Details: {'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Lenny Abrahamson'], 'Producers': ['Ed Guiney', 'David Barron', 'Stevie Lee'], 'Starring': ['Domhnall Gleeson', 'Maggie Gyllenhaal', 'Scoot McNairy'], 'Studio': ['Magnolia']}\nReview Text: I was expecting a wonderful, offbeat flick.  This is certainly offbeat, but it isn't wonderful.  The trailer is excellent, but the film itself is pretty dull, and that's not easy to do when you have Michael Fassbender as the star.  The story really needed some serious tweeking.

The palpable sense of suffering and longing that John Lakeman experiences as he perseveres in his mission is just brilliantly done.  Michael Dorman is absolutely superb in the role.  You can't help but fall for the guy.  He's a good man doing dark things, missing his wife badly, and in way over his undercover head.  The engineering riffs will make your head spin.  You know it's English, but you have no idea what it all means, and they are really funny and important to pounding home the sense of futility in John (how is he to come up to speed on this stuff?).  The folk singing angle adds to the whole picture (Dorman has a pleasant voice).  This show reminds me of Charles Frazier's Inman (in his novel, Cold Mountain).  Like Inman, John is increasingly sick of the things he must do (Inman in war and John in intelligence), and though both are really adept at violence, they want to be quit of it and return home to their love.  I love this show.\nReview Title: Fantastic Show\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2017/10/02\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Denis Villeneuve'], 'Producers': ['Basil Iwanyk'], 'Starring': ['Emily Blunt', 'Benicio Del Toro', 'Josh Brolin'], 'Studio': ['Lionsgate']}\nReview Text: This is a brilliant film in every way.  The characters are complex, the plot is riveting, the acting is really fine, and the cinematography is wonderful.  I'd say more about specifics, but I've no wish to spoil anything for anyone.  Suffice it to say that the people who gave this film poor marks are incomprehensible to me except for those who (a) cannot abide by any violence, (b) cannot pay adequate attention to the details of the plot, or (c) require an unambiguously happy ending where everything comes out just fine without any sense of loss.  If this describes you, don't bother with this film because you'll hate it.\nReview Title: Magnificent Film\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2018/08/07\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': [\"Dinesh D'Souza\", 'John Sullivan'], 'Producers': ['Ann Balog'], 'Starring': [\"Dinesh D'Souza\"], 'Studio': ['Lionsgate']}\nReview Text: You only have to watch a little while before you get your first taste of D'Souza misdirection and deception.  He says that one of Barack Obama's first actions in office was to send a bust of Winston Churchill back to British.  The implication is that he insulted an ally, presumably because of his hatred of British imperialism in the Kenya of \"his fathers\" (as D'Souza likes to say).  The real story is that there were two Churchill busts in the White House, both by the same sculptor.  One had been on loan by Tony Blair to George Bush.  When Bush finished his term, the bust was given back, as one would expect with something on loan.  The other remained in the White House, outside Obama's private office.  So here we see D'Souza misleading people.  Yes, a bust was given back, as it needed to be, but no, Obama was not insulting the British by returning a bust, and in fact, the other bust was placed in a prominent spot (just not the Oval Office, as the \"on loan\" bust had been). Either D'Souza knows all this and he intends to deceive viewers, or else he is a sloppy hack.  I'd bet on the former.  Dinesh D'Souza is like some propaganda dream child, an immigrant from Mumbai who is happy to deny America's issues and to vilify Obama.  To give him his due, presumably he makes some decent coin with his books and films, a minor miracle given that they are not worth a dime.\nReview Title: Glamorous Hogwash\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: The Commuter\nReview Date: 2019/01/11\nCategories: Suspense, Action, Cerebral, Ominous\nProduct Description: ['A man who gets caught up in a criminal conspiracy during his daily commute home and works against the clock to stop a deadly attack to save the lives of his fellow train passengers.']\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Jaume Serra'], 'Producers': ['Andrew Rona', 'Alex Heineman'], 'Starring': ['Liam Neeson', 'Vera Farmiga', 'Patrick Wilson']}\nReview Text: Just to get a picky detail out of the way, the film depicts Liam Neeson's Metro North commuter train stopping at 86th Street and Lexington Avenue.  Such a train doesn't run on that line, so the film essentially mashes a subway train and a commuter train.  It's no crime to make up a detail like this, but there seems like there is little point to it except to fit in some additional stations between Grand Central and 125th Street.  Lots of people from New York would look at that film train stopping at 86th and be bugged by the unnecessary fiction.<br /><br />While the film is entertaining, it's wildly implausible, both in the general plot and in the details.  The Bad Woman (Vera Farmiga) seems to haver the power to reach Liam Neeson on phones that belong to other people, people with no previous connection to Neeson.  It stretches credulity.  Without spoiling the plot too much, the Bad Guys want someone dead, and they want Neeson's help to make it so, but since they know the target is getting off at Cold Spring, a sniper at the station would do the trick nicely and save them the very unlikely Neeson plot.  Of course, in this case, you wouldn't have the movie.  While in the midst of it, you can be entertained, but if you step back from it, the details are such that it's a pretty dumb film.\nReview Title: Wildly Implausible\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n    Structure your response as:\n   \n    SUMMARY:\n    [Final synthesis of preferences and patterns]",
  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe analyzed purchase history reveals a pattern of preference for action and suspense genres, particularly those featuring strong male leads and complex narratives. The individual consistently rates films in this arena highly, with average ratings often above 4.0. However, a notable tolerance for violence and darker themes is observed, reflecting a liking for intense, flawed characters immersed in morally ambiguous situations. \n\nConversely, there are critical sentiments towards films perceived as disjointed or unrealistic, scoring lower ratings when the storyline lacks depth or coherence, as seen in the negative reviews. Review sentiments indicate a discerning viewer who values production quality, strong performances, and cohesive storylines.\n\nThe individual reveals a moderate price sensitivity, opting for well-reviewed productions but showing signs of dissatisfaction when expectations set by trailers or cast are not met, particularly if they feel the film fails to deliver on its premise. \n\nOverall, core preferences include a strong inclination for engaging narratives with action-oriented themes, a high standard for storytelling quality, and an appreciation for emotional and psychological depth in characters, while being critical of films that stray into implausibility or perform poorly against anticipated expectations.",

Moreover, her home life is usually thankless because her children blame her and fail to cooperate at every turn.  But on the other hand, Carmen is a magnetic character, someone endearing despite the fact that she's dealing in pretty wicked stuff.  She never wanted to get sucked into the gangster life, and it's as if she's mired in quicksand, being pulled back into it again and again by circumstance and because she loves her family.  Would it be realistic for someone to escape death or prison so often?  Not really.  But Carmen is so damn watchable that you can suspend natural disbelief and simply enjoy the character and her acting.",
