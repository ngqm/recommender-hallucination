(In the second season, I saw quite a bit more as he paraded around sans clothing!)  After watching this show once, I watched it again...and again.  At first, you think, man, these guys are beasts, then you realize that they are pretty insecure and have really failed at growing up but disguise this with tons of money.  They are having a great time, but it's so superficial that even they occasionally notice.  I know you aren't supposed to feel sorry for them, that they've made their beds etc., but really, you can't help it.  They've exchanged all the stuff that makes life meaningful, their families and children, tossed it away for money and easy sex. Terry, the ringleader, more or less shows the others what direction to take, especially James (The Anthony Stewart Head character.) All he cares about is money and a parade of very young women in his bed.  James, poor schlub, is probably an OK guy who is completely ruled by his sex drive.  We find out that he cheated on his wife the night before they were married.  His kids and now ex-wife hate him.  Gary, still married to his first love, is ruled with an iron hand.  He can only fantasize about the easy sex that the other men enjoy.  Patrick, a loving son, has never married, but is apparantly just as cavalier with relationships as the other men.  He's also quite strange.<br /><br />If you watch this series expecting to like these guys, you're going to be disappointed.  If you want to see some great acting and some truely appalling characters, this show is for you.  Its incredibly funny, but not for everybody.  I wouldn't let my kids watch it.\nReview Title: Funny and Sad!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: The Best of Abbott & Costello, Vol. 3 (Abbott & Costello Go to Mars / Abbott & Costello in the Foreign Legion / Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein / Abbott & Costello Meet the Invisible Man / Abbott & Costello Meet the Killer / Comin' Round the Mountain / Lost in Alaska / Mexican Hayride)\nReview Date: 2007/08/11\nStore: Bud Abbott  (Actor),     Lou Costello  (Actor),     Charles Barton  (Director),     Charles Lamont  (Director)    &                   1                  more   Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Comedy\nProduct Description: [\"Includes the following movies, Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein Mexican Hayride Abbott and Costello Meet the Killer, Boris Karloff Abbott and Costello in the Foreign Legion Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man Comin' Round the Mountain Lost in Alaska Abbott and Costello Go to Mars\", 'NOTE:', 'There is a message on the title menu which states \"flip the disc over to play the other two episodes.\"']\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'DVD Movie, Blu-ray Movie, Comedy', 'Format': 'Black & White, Closed-captioned, Dolby, Full Screen, NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Jean Yarbrough, John Grant, Charles Bradstreet, Robert Lees, Charles Lamont, Bud Abbott, Lon Chaney, Jr., Nancy Guild, Jane Randolph, Lou Costello, Frederic I.

The balance between the films is uneven, but I guess every movie can't be a gem.  A little pricey for what you get, actually.  I remember watching these movies as a kid and being absolutely thrilled with them.  Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein and Abbott and Costello Meet the Killer will have you laughing in the aisles.

Unlike the more modern versions, there is nothing sickening or gory here, but it's a very clever film.  Somewhere, years ago, I read a comparison of the 2008 version and this one.  They mentioned that in the older film, it reflected the Cold War mentality--the enemy is out there, trying to get in, and in the modern adaptation, the enemy is already inside and is hiding amongst us.  I thought it was an interesting point to make, but I just like the movie.  It's a family favorite that I grew up watching and all my brothers and sisters quote dialog from it at the drop of a hat.\nReview Title: Great Film made when they still understood scary doesn't have to mean gore\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n    Structure your response as:\n   \n    SUMMARY:\n    [Final synthesis of preferences and patterns]",

Their elation quickly turns to fear as they realize that their experiment has freed a mysterious being from its frozen prison. Paranoia spreads like an epidemic as a creature that can mimic anything it touches will pit human against human as it tries to survive and flourish in this spine-tingling thriller."
