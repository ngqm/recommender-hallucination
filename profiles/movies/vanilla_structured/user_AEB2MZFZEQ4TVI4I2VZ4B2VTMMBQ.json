I admit that this spinoff (yes - let's be honest, that's what it was - with some cast members from the original, just like any spinoff) didn't quite do it for me the way the original show did - but it was the first season, and I think it deserved more of a chance (like more episodes, and a chance at a second season, etc..).

Recurring themes?  Blah blah blah...  Every sitcom over the past few decades are using much of \"the same old\" story-lines, themes, plot mechanisms.  The half-hour sitcom \"Grand Story\" has never been done better than Bill Lawrence and crew do it. I just shake my head at some of the whining, complaining folks.  YOU try doing a great, consistently funny, and actually often-meaningful show.  Then, try doing like a COUPLE DOZEN of them, EVERY YEAR, for NEARLY A DECADE.  (Head shaking some more).  Sheesh.  These are the brilliant storytellers of our time, imho.  Yes, of a genre, to be sure; but - stuff's just brilliant.  Season One, Two, Three - these may always be my favorites, but.. I love all of 'em, pretty much.<br /><br />If you own Scrubs 1 through 8, it'd be a mistake not sporting the mere 17-ish bucks for this, to complete your Scrubs collection.

I assure you - I've done the homework.<br />People are complaining about this on the iTunes website right now.  A lowdown trick most likely devised by a Jr. Exec at Sci<br /><br />I have purchased these, and verified - it is DEFINITELY NOT MIKE ROWE'S VOICE - and I have a couple of them on a DVR recorded from Science channel this month.  On those broadcast versions - it IS Mike Rowe.  The difference is enormous.<br />I am seriously considering demanding a refund.  This is NOT what I paid for.  Mike's narratives of science, and especially cosmology, is as musical as the soundtrack - filled with an emotion and wonderment that makes the whole production far more compelling.  I simply would NEVER have purchased these had I known that Science Channel had replaced Mike Rowe's voice - NO DOUBT due to not wanting to share the $ with Mike and his representation.  And frankly - THAT STINKS.  To me - it's NO DIFFERENT than if I bought a car in which the dealer replaced the deluxe, hi-power, hi-efficiency 8-cylinder engine with a basic stripped down six-cylinder -- WITHOUT TELLING ME.  And that would be illegal.<br /><br />THIS SHOULD BE ILLEGAL TOO.  It is simply not what I paid for.\nReview Title: Classic BAIT-AND-SWITCH  -  Mike Rowe's voice on cable broadcast, but NOT ON THESE VERSIONS.. should be illegal...\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: The Complete Beatrix Potter Collection, Vol. 1 [DVD]\nReview Date: 2015/02/23\nStore: Rated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Kids & Family\nProduct Description: ['Quick Shipping !!!

Few children will fail to enjoy these charming stories.  The expertly done animation brings the original Beatrix Potter illustrations to life. Truly it's almost as though she'd somehow done the animation herself.  This BBC production team has worked magic here.  Each of the nine stories is framed with beautifully done live-acted, dramatic scenes, depicting Miss Potter at her home and in the countryside surrounding her farmhouse in the Lake District (I'm quite sure it was filmed at the location, but not certain).  Her warmth and very spirited demeanor are readily conveyed by  the actress's relaxed and natural performance; the period decor and the furnishings, along with the early 20th century Lake District countryside settings, seem just to \"take one there\" - all of it, as convincing as the BBC always seems to be at \"period England\": you are _there_.<br /><br />These scenes are extremely effective, as \"bookends\" to the animated stories, at \"guiding the viewer\" in to the world and mind of Beatrix Potter.  As the various stories' origins are dramatically depicted, with Miss Potter writing the stories in the form of letters to various children in her life; as she prepares, and occasionally mid-story, she talks aloud about precipitating events and the various characters within.  As the stories unfold, it is her voice, as Beatrix, doing the narratives, no doubt as written.  And of course each of the stories within the letters' pages include various of her brilliant illustrations (which are, again, clearly the templates for the animated characters on the DVD).<br /><br />The animated stories themselves - I've already described how true to the original books' artwork the animation is.  Add to that what is perhaps the most compelling aspect of this collection, the voice-over actors' performances.  I certainly recognize the names, and have been told it's a veritable \"who's-who\" of British acting, but regardless - they do it very well.  It's hard to point one out that stands apart from the rest - each is extremely well done..  Of course, many folks will recognize the voice of Dr. House - that is Hugh Laurie - as the friendly and gregarious \"Johnny Town-mouse\";  so expressive and present (and no cutting remark or blatant put-downs, though I was almost expecting it ;-)  Mr. Laurie was in professional form that day.  ;-)<br /><br />Before I wrap up, I've got to mention the soundtrack.  The accompanying music is phenomenal, simply ... yeah, phenomenal.  It is never too loud or overbearing as it sets the mood for each scene, each moment.  It is, in fact, almost soothing; relaxing.  That's not to say that it's lacking energy or \"sleepy\" - in fact it is vibrant and filled with energy; only it is a calm and assertive energy (to shamelessly borrow a phrase from Caesar, the Dog Whisperer ;-).  It seems to fit the story content perfectly, while producing a sort-of relaxed, enamored or captivated feeling - the kids will enjoy this greatly, and will not likely keep bouncing off the walls (if that's what they were doing - just a guess) but rather will likely settle down and really enjoy each of these stories.  At the same time, that relaxed feel will likely have the adults sitting down to enjoy them with the kids.<br /><br />The marriage of this collection's incredible animation and overall production quality with such professionally voice-acted performances has resulted in a true children's classic (of a classic).  This collection, these videos, is the \"one of these.. not like the other ones\"...  And that's a really GOOD thing, actually.\nReview Title: Exceptional production.

The unmistakable and evocative voice of John Rhys Davies sets the mood - literally, the tone - of each segment, and raises the level of interest and wonder considerably (for me anyway).<br /><br />It almost seems that the individual segments were intended to air as a series comprised of five or six \"episodes\"; regardless, these were ultimately edited in to a single presentation, with only the briefest pause or segue from one to the next.<br /><br />The subtitles:  From what I can tell, the subtitles rely upon a very poor implementation of voice-recognition software - such that the spoken words \"flightless bird\" become \"ficus bird\" in the subtitles, etc...

Few children will fail to enjoy these charming stories.  The expertly done animation brings the original Beatrix Potter illustrations to life. Truly it's almost as though she'd somehow done the animation herself.  This BBC production team has worked magic here.  Each of the nine stories is framed with beautifully done live-acted, dramatic scenes, depicting Miss Potter at her home and in the countryside surrounding her farmhouse in the Lake District (I'm quite sure it was filmed at the location, but not certain).  Her warmth and very spirited demeanor are readily conveyed by  the actress's relaxed and natural performance; the period decor and the furnishings, along with the early 20th century Lake District countryside settings, seem just to \"take one there\" - all of it, as convincing as the BBC always seems to be at \"period England\": you are _there_.<br /><br />These scenes are extremely effective, as \"bookends\" to the animated stories, at \"guiding the viewer\" in to the world and mind of Beatrix Potter.  As the various stories' origins are dramatically depicted, with Miss Potter writing the stories in the form of letters to various children in her life; as she prepares, and occasionally mid-story, she talks aloud about precipitating events and the various characters within.  As the stories unfold, it is her voice, as Beatrix, doing the narratives, no doubt as written.  And of course each of the stories within the letters' pages include various of her brilliant illustrations (which are, again, clearly the templates for the animated characters on the DVD).<br /><br />The animated stories themselves - I've already described how true to the original books' artwork the animation is.  Add to that what is perhaps the most compelling aspect of this collection, the voice-over actors' performances.  I certainly recognize the names, and have been told it's a veritable \"who's-who\" of British acting, but regardless - they do it very well.  It's hard to point one out that stands apart from the rest - each is extremely well done..  Of course, many folks will recognize the voice of Dr. House - that is Hugh Laurie - as the friendly and gregarious \"Johnny Town-mouse\";  so expressive and present (and no cutting remark or blatant put-downs, though I was almost expecting it ;-)  Mr. Laurie was in professional form that day.  ;-)<br /><br />Before I wrap up, I've got to mention the soundtrack.  The accompanying music is phenomenal, simply ... yeah, phenomenal.  It is never too loud or overbearing as it sets the mood for each scene, each moment.  It is, in fact, almost soothing; relaxing.  That's not to say that it's lacking energy or \"sleepy\" - in fact it is vibrant and filled with energy; only it is a calm and assertive energy (to shamelessly borrow a phrase from Caesar, the Dog Whisperer ;-).  It seems to fit the story content perfectly, while producing a sort-of relaxed, enamored or captivated feeling - the kids will enjoy this greatly, and will not likely keep bouncing off the walls (if that's what they were doing - just a guess) but rather will likely settle down and really enjoy each of these stories.  At the same time, that relaxed feel will likely have the adults sitting down to enjoy them with the kids.<br /><br />The marriage of this collection's incredible animation and overall production quality with such professionally voice-acted performances has resulted in a true children's classic (of a classic).  This collection, these videos, is the \"one of these.. not like the other ones\"...  And that's a really GOOD thing, actually.\nExceptional production.

And, as I recall, the show was billed as \"Scrubs: Medical School\" when it aired.  Season 8 of Scrubs was clearly the final season - with JD's two-part \"goodbye\" episode (which was really sad for me, in all honesty) being the real Series Finale of the final season of Scrubs.  I admit that this spinoff (yes - let's be honest, that's what it was - with some cast members from the original, just like any spinoff) didn't quite do it for me the way the original show did - but it was the first season, and I think it deserved more of a chance (like more episodes, and a chance at a second season, etc..).  I know I was disappointed when they axed it, regardless of it's \"holding up\" to the original.<br /><br />ANYONE WHO WAS A TRUE FAN OF THE ORIGINAL WILL FIND PLENTY TO ENJOY FROM THIS SHOW.  re-hashed plots?  Recurring themes?  Blah blah blah...  Every sitcom over the past few decades are using much of \"the same old\" story-lines, themes, plot mechanisms.  The half-hour sitcom \"Grand Story\" has never been done better than Bill Lawrence and crew do it. I just shake my head at some of the whining, complaining folks.  YOU try doing a great, consistently funny, and actually often-meaningful show.  Then, try doing like a COUPLE DOZEN of them, EVERY YEAR, for NEARLY A DECADE.  (Head shaking some more).  Sheesh.  These are the brilliant storytellers of our time, imho.  Yes, of a genre, to be sure; but - stuff's just brilliant.  Season One, Two, Three - these may always be my favorites, but.. I love all of 'em, pretty much.<br /><br />If you own Scrubs 1 through 8, it'd be a mistake not sporting the mere 17-ish bucks for this, to complete your Scrubs collection.  (Yes, I said it was a spinoff.  It's also the final piece of the Scrubs legacy, and Ken Jenkins and John C. alone make it more-than worth it).\nReview Title: \"Scrubs\" or \"Scrubs: Medical School\"?

It is for the product, DVDs of Season 2 of Cougar Town.  My first shipment arrived and disk 1 and 2 were unreadable by 3 computer and 2 commercial dvd players.  Disks were just plain bad, and not qc'd.  So, I went through the return/replace process, which is very streamlined, especially for getting replacement products.  So -- I received the SECOND shipment, and first off I notice the same hazy-looking marks around the outside of the disks.  So far, the first two disks are also corrupt, although they were at least _recognized_ as DVD disks, unlike the first shipment's.  The failures come when, yes, trying to play them.  Hangs, stutters, freezes.  Happens in all drives.  And yes, I checked my hardware with a few of my several hundred DVDs.  So --- two shipments and each had corrupt, unreadable disks.  Not pleased here. Still pondering weather I'll try for a third replacement, or just get a refund.<br /><br />******** Addendum, some years later (yipes - how time flies)<br />I saw that 7 of 12 people rated my review as \"Unhelpful\".  That's unfortunate.  I was just trying to convey my experience when I made this purchase - and I do believe that the quality of the medium, in this case DVDs, is a valid and pertinent subject for review.  Apologies to those that for some reason felt that my relating of a bad (two times) experience with a purchase was somehow \"unhelpful\".<br /><br />So - I figure I should mention that the SHOW - Cougar Town, is F***ING AWESOME.

The unmistakable and evocative voice of John Rhys Davies sets the mood - literally, the tone - of each segment, and raises the level of interest and wonder considerably (for me anyway).<br /><br />It almost seems that the individual segments were intended to air as a series comprised of five or six \"episodes\"; regardless, these were ultimately edited in to a single presentation, with only the briefest pause or segue from one to the next.<br /><br />The subtitles:  From what I can tell, the subtitles rely upon a very poor implementation of voice-recognition software - such that the spoken words \"flightless bird\" become \"ficus bird\" in the subtitles, etc...  It is hilariously bad.  I'm pretty sure these are a product of the streaming system and not a part of the original production.<br /><br />Worthwhile show\nReview Title: Interesting collection of archaeological and scientific studies and controversies\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n    Structure your response as:\n   \n    SUMMARY:\n    [Final synthesis of preferences and patterns]",

    "text": "What I managed to stomach was full of highly debatable theory asserted as irrefutable truth; pseudo-science at it's worst.<br /><br />I especially recommend the review from John P. Jones III - an intelligent and quite fair assessment across all four episodes; also Charles Dawson's review gives a good sense of this absurdly simplistic presentation,<br /><br />Concluding that this was well-researched - with the highly opinionated, narrowly-focused  conclusions having _zero_ supporting evidence; coupled with lack of any basis or application of scientific method upon which to predicate them?  Put simply, there _was_ no proper research - it is all conjecture with a very clear end-goal.  Make a quite contrary assertion and then backpedal your way to a purely pseudo-science based (fetid) collection of misinformation as your premise.  Unquestioning acceptance is a disquieting indictment of our educational system.<br /><br />Logic, the scientific method, well-founded anthropological and archaeological discipline and procedure - these are completely missing from this production, and from a number of naively biased testimonials as well.  It makes one sad.... claiming conflict and war as the pillars supporting the evolution and growth toward modern culture, toward \"civilized\" society is a twisted, misguided and warped _misinterpretation_ of humanity's pivotal moments in time.  It goes well beyond over-simplified.",
