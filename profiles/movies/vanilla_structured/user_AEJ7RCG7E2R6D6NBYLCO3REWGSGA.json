The central figure, Atlantic City treasurer Nucky Thompson (Steve Buscemi), aims to please all of his constituents, but loses several powerful supporters after bootlegger Chalky White (Michael Kenneth Williams) kills a Klansman. Estranged from his brother, Eli (Shea Whigham), and former assistant, Jimmy (Michael Pitt), Nucky and his common-law wife (Kelly Macdonald) become more of a team. If domesticity suits Nucky, FBI agent Van Alden (Michael Shannon) looks askance at drinkers and nonbelievers, even as he holes up with Nucky's pregnant ex-girlfriend (Paz de la Huerta, the weakest link in an otherwise strong cast), while his wife remains in the Midwest. With enemies like the Commodore (Dabney Coleman) trying to remove him from office, Nucky hires Irish Lothario Slater (Charlie Cox), who helps to keep the booze flowing, meting out the occasional head-butt as necessary. Other new arrivals include a brutal butcher (William Forsythe) and a persistent federal prosecutor (Julianne Nicholson), who wields more power than the other wives and girlfriends combined, though Jimmy's mother (Gretchen Mol) becomes more Machiavellian by the minute. Nucky also joins forces with Arnold Rothstein (Michael Stuhlbarg), while Jimmy aligns with Al Capone (Stephen Graham) and Lucky Luciano (Vincent Piazza). Of course, it wouldn't be a gangster epic without casualties, and several men give in to their darker impulses, resulting in some spectacularly bloody business--including the murder of a major character.

Having read the other reviews I thought it might be interesting and fun to watch.  I don't understand the 'Sharpes Fever' that seems to be going around.  The series is, unfortunately, quite hokey in my humble opinion.  The acting left something to be desired, and if your desire is to simply watch some attractive folks on the tv screen and you are not concerned with the hokey plots or poor acting this should suffice nicely.  Yes, I know it is an older series and the standards were different then from now, but hokey is hokey there is no getting around it.  I do enjoy the more vintage series shows, but this is simply not one of them.  Still have not finished the set and probably won't, just uninspired all around.\nReview Title: So So\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Lark Rise to Candleford: Season 1\nReview Date: 2013/03/26\nStore: Hallinan, Olivia  (Actor),     Sawalha, Julia  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Studio Specials, Warner Home Video, Drama\nProduct Description: ['Product Description', 'The BBC drama series adapted from Mary Gaskells classic novels of small town gossip, secrets and romance. 1842.

Glad I just ordered season one, and not the entire series, as I likely will not even finish season one, but give it to my grandkids to watch.

With the Civil War raging, and the death toll rising, the president focuses his energies on passage of the 13th Amendment.

While still mourning the loss of one son, Mary (Sally Field) can't bear to lose another. Playwright Tony Kushner, who adapted the screenplay, takes a page from the procedural handbook in tracing Lincoln's steps to win over enough representatives to abolish slavery, while simultaneously bringing a larger-than-life leader down to a more manageable size. In his stooped-shoulder slouch and Columbo-like speech, Day-Lewis succeeds so admirably that the more outspoken characters, like congressman Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones) and lobbyist W.N.

I can't say for sure what I was expecting, but this was not it.  The movie consisted of long and sometimes painfully drawn out dialogue and little action.  The movie revolved entirely around the passage of the 13th Amendment as a means to end the war, or at least bring the South to the bargaining table.  What it did, for me, was cast Washington in a light not much different than that of today with the bribes, deals and rangling going on for the advancement of one side's agenda.  If they thought to portray Lincoln as a hero, they instead cast him as no better than the dishonest congress he dealt with to gain passage of the bill.  I should have expected no more from Hollywood, but for some odd reason I did.  Overall a huge disappointment and a movie I would not recommend unless you go into it knowing in advance that Washington is crooked as all get out and Honest Abe was not so honest and entirely void ethics.  If that is what you want to see for entertainment, then I would recommend you simply watch the nightly news.\nReview Title: Not So Impressed\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Upstairs, Downstairs Season 2 (2012)\nReview Date: 2013/04/06\nStore: Keeley Hawes  (Actor),     Ed Stoppard  (Actor),     Anthony Byrne  (Director),     Marc Jobst  (Director)    &                   1                  more   Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, BBC, All BBC Titles\nProduct Description: ['Product Description', 'Upstairs, Downstairs Season 2 (2012)', 'The sumptuous new production Upstairs Downstairs, one of the most beloved television series of all time returns for a second season!

Rose soon finds she has her work cut out as she recruits a new 'downstairs' family to help run the elegance and finery of the 'upstairs' world. Both upstairs and downstairs, it soon becomes apparent there lies a labyrinth of secrets, lies and scandal.

That is, if you were royalty, and ran a fantastic mansion at 165 Eaton Place, in one of London\\'s poshest neighborhoods. This show, as indicated in its title, revels in its overall ability to convey life as it unfolds upstairs, among the elite, and downstairs, among those who work tirelessly to keep the palace running. From the first episode, \"The Fledgling,\" the plot is placed politically, socially, and romantically as newlyweds Sir Hallam Holland (Ed Stoppard) and Lady Agnes (Keeley Hawes) decide to sweep the cobwebs out of the old family haunt in favor of modernization. While mundane house dramas unfurl, increasing tenfold once Sir Hallam\\'s nosy, old-fashioned mother, Maud (Eileen Atkins), decides that she and her pet monkey will be moving in, larger political dramas pepper the personal landscape. For example, in \"The Fledgling,\" as well as the next episodes, \"The Ladybird\" and \"The Cuckoo,\" Agnes\\'s sister, Lady Persephone (Claire Foy), is increasingly misled by the newly formed fascist party, and mounting tensions between Jewish household members and Persie\\'s ilk, including German official Ribbentrop (Edward Baker-Duly), loom large. As would be expected in this royal tale, much of the plot comprises Agnes\\'s ability to bear children and the political expectations Sir Hallam must meet even when morally conflicted.', \"The most winning aspect of this miniseries is in its display of what the servants attend throughout; their challenges seem equally as difficult as the challenges presented in tandem upstairs.

Lavish scenes showing preparation for parties, plus those in which the servants simply keep up with daily tasks, may shock those who are not familiar with formal etiquette from the past. Amanjit (Art Malik), Maud's secretary who lives upstairs separate from the rest of the servants, serves as a character who straddles both worlds, offering us glimpses into a man who can relate to both classes.

It is only a short series but well worth viewing.  The story line moved along nicely, the characters were well done and I found it engaging.  Not a complicated or involved drama, but still it managed to keep me captivated.  Sorry that it was not longer.  I had also purchased the &#34;Lark Rise&#34; series and did not finish that as it was too much like watching the British version of Little House on the Prairie, but North & South had a more adult story line that I found entertaining.  If you are looking for some light, but enjoyable summer viewing while you wait for the Downton saga to continue, give North & South a try, I believe you will be pleased.\nReview Title: Good Viewing\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Upstairs Downstairs: Series One, 40th Anniversary Edition\nReview Date: 2013/04/25\nStore: Jackson, Gordon  (Actor),     Langton, David  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Boxed Sets, Television\nProduct Description: ['\"Charmingly seductive\" --The New York Times', '6+ hours of new bonus material', 'Iconic British series seen on Masterpiece Theatre and A&E', 'Upstairs: the wealthy, aristocratic Bellamys.

I have also enjoyed the modern remake of Upstairs Downstairs and enjoyed it very much.  So, I thought I would venture back in time and watch the original inspiration for the remake.  Oh it was painful to say the least!  Yes, it is an older creation, but I was not quite expecting the poor acting that I encountered.  I tried to give this every chance to redeem itself, but each episode just seemed to get longer and the acting worse.  If you can suffer the flat acting it might be possible to appreciate this series for the vintage piece that it is - I was not able to do that and I returned it to Amazon on their Buy-Back program because I knew that I would never finish watching it.\nReview Title: Not that Wonderful\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

If domesticity suits Nucky, FBI agent Van Alden (Michael Shannon) looks askance at drinkers and nonbelievers, even as he holes up with Nucky's pregnant ex-girlfriend (Paz de la Huerta, the weakest link in an otherwise strong cast), while his wife remains in the Midwest.

The series is, unfortunately, quite hokey in my humble opinion.  The acting left something to be desired, and if your desire is to simply watch some attractive folks on the tv screen and you are not concerned with the hokey plots or poor acting this should suffice nicely.  Yes, I know it is an older series and the standards were different then from now, but hokey is hokey there is no getting around it.

Personally I found it to be something near to the British version of \"Little House on the Prairie\" and I can't say I was impressed at all.

In drawing from Doris Kearns Goodwin's\", 'Team of Rivals', \", the director instead depicts a career-defining moment in the career of Abraham Lincoln (an uncharacteristically restrained Daniel Day-Lewis). With the Civil War raging, and the death toll rising, the president focuses his energies on passage of the 13th Amendment. Even those sympathetic to the cause question his timing, but Lincoln doesn't see the two issues as separate, and the situation turns personal when his son, Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), chooses to enlist rather than to study law. While still mourning the loss of one son, Mary (Sally Field) can't bear to lose another. Playwright Tony Kushner, who adapted the screenplay, takes a page from the procedural handbook in tracing Lincoln's steps to win over enough representatives to abolish slavery, while simultaneously bringing a larger-than-life leader down to a more manageable size. In his stooped-shoulder slouch and Columbo-like speech, Day-Lewis succeeds so admirably that the more outspoken characters, like congressman Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones) and lobbyist W.N.

I can't say for sure what I was expecting, but this was not it.  The movie consisted of long and sometimes painfully drawn out dialogue and little action.  The movie revolved entirely around the passage of the 13th Amendment as a means to end the war, or at least bring the South to the bargaining table.  What it did, for me, was cast Washington in a light not much different than that of today with the bribes, deals and rangling going on for the advancement of one side's agenda.  If they thought to portray Lincoln as a hero, they instead cast him as no better than the dishonest congress he dealt with to gain passage of the bill.  I should have expected no more from Hollywood, but for some odd reason I did.  Overall a huge disappointment and a movie I would not recommend unless you go into it knowing in advance that Washington is crooked as all get out and Honest Abe was not so honest and entirely void ethics.  If that is what you want to see for entertainment, then I would recommend you simply watch the nightly news.\nNot So Impressed\nUpstairs, Downstairs Season 2 (2012)\nKeeley Hawes  (Actor),     Ed Stoppard  (Actor),     Anthony Byrne  (Director),     Marc Jobst  (Director)    &                   1                  more   Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, BBC, All BBC Titles\n['Product Description', 'Upstairs, Downstairs Season 2 (2012)', 'The sumptuous new production Upstairs Downstairs, one of the most beloved television series of all time returns for a second season!

It's 1936, and six years since parlormaid Rose left 165 Eaton Place, fate brings her back, as housekeeper to its new owners: Sir Hallam and his wife Lady Agnes, and Maud, Lady Holland, his mother. Rose soon finds she has her work cut out as she recruits a new 'downstairs' family to help run the elegance and finery of the 'upstairs' world. Both upstairs and downstairs, it soon becomes apparent there lies a labyrinth of secrets, lies and scandal. Set against the historical backdrop of a Britain with a new King, with sexual, social and political tensions, this new series provides an evolving take on the master-servant relationship.\", 'Amazon.com', 'Remade from the hit 1970s serial, this new version of', 'Upstairs, Downstairs', ', condensed into three hour-long episodes, creates for a modern eye a vision of what 1936 in England must have looked like. That is, if you were royalty, and ran a fantastic mansion at 165 Eaton Place, in one of London\\'s poshest neighborhoods. This show, as indicated in its title, revels in its overall ability to convey life as it unfolds upstairs, among the elite, and downstairs, among those who work tirelessly to keep the palace running. From the first episode, \"The Fledgling,\" the plot is placed politically, socially, and romantically as newlyweds Sir Hallam Holland (Ed Stoppard) and Lady Agnes (Keeley Hawes) decide to sweep the cobwebs out of the old family haunt in favor of modernization. While mundane house dramas unfurl, increasing tenfold once Sir Hallam\\'s nosy, old-fashioned mother, Maud (Eileen Atkins), decides that she and her pet monkey will be moving in, larger political dramas pepper the personal landscape. For example, in \"The Fledgling,\" as well as the next episodes, \"The Ladybird\" and \"The Cuckoo,\" Agnes\\'s sister, Lady Persephone (Claire Foy), is increasingly misled by the newly formed fascist party, and mounting tensions between Jewish household members and Persie\\'s ilk, including German official Ribbentrop (Edward Baker-Duly), loom large. As would be expected in this royal tale, much of the plot comprises Agnes\\'s ability to bear children and the political expectations Sir Hallam must meet even when morally conflicted.', \"The most winning aspect of this miniseries is in its display of what the servants attend throughout; their challenges seem equally as difficult as the challenges presented in tandem upstairs. When Agnes promotes ex-housekeeper Rose Buck (Jean Marsh) to hire and manage the house crew, Rose rises to the occasion and commands many interesting scenes in which she hires, fires, and coaches team members like the butler, Pritchard (Adrian Scarborough), head chef Mrs. Thackeray (Anne Reid), young footman Johnny (Nico Mirallegro), and maid Ivy (Ellie Kendrick). Lavish scenes showing preparation for parties, plus those in which the servants simply keep up with daily tasks, may shock those who are not familiar with formal etiquette from the past.

I have never seen the original series so I was not certain if jumping in now would be confusing, but it is not, the story does a nice job of looping back to explain any references to the original series making it easy on viewers like me.  I cannot compare this series to the original, but that might be a good thing, allowing this series to stand on its own merits.  The characters are easy to warm up to, and the story line moves along at a nice pace.  This is proving to be a nice filler and I am going to be sorry to see it end so quickly.

Thornton befriends Margaret's father but incurs her wrath for his severity with his workers. What she doesn't notice is Thornton's core sense of responsibility for his employees' welfare.

I can't say for sure what I was expecting, but this was not it.  The movie consisted of long and sometimes painfully drawn out dialogue and little action.  The movie revolved entirely around the passage of the 13th Amendment as a means to end the war, or at least bring the South to the bargaining table.  What it did, for me, was cast Washington in a light not much different than that of today with the bribes, deals and rangling going on for the advancement of one side's agenda.  If they thought to portray Lincoln as a hero, they instead cast him as no better than the dishonest congress he dealt with to gain passage of the bill.  I should have expected no more from Hollywood, but for some odd reason I did.  Overall a huge disappointment and a movie I would not recommend unless you go into it knowing in advance that Washington is crooked as all get out and Honest Abe was not so honest and entirely void ethics.  If that is what you want to see for entertainment, then I would recommend you simply watch the nightly news.\nReview Title: Not So Impressed\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Upstairs, Downstairs Season 2 (2012)\nReview Date: 2013/04/06\nStore: Keeley Hawes  (Actor),     Ed Stoppard  (Actor),     Anthony Byrne  (Director),     Marc Jobst  (Director)    &                   1                  more   Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, BBC, All BBC Titles\nProduct Description: ['Product Description', 'Upstairs, Downstairs Season 2 (2012)', 'The sumptuous new production Upstairs Downstairs, one of the most beloved television series of all time returns for a second season!

It's 1936, and six years since parlormaid Rose left 165 Eaton Place, fate brings her back, as housekeeper to its new owners: Sir Hallam and his wife Lady Agnes, and Maud, Lady Holland, his mother. Rose soon finds she has her work cut out as she recruits a new 'downstairs' family to help run the elegance and finery of the 'upstairs' world. Both upstairs and downstairs, it soon becomes apparent there lies a labyrinth of secrets, lies and scandal. Set against the historical backdrop of a Britain with a new King, with sexual, social and political tensions, this new series provides an evolving take on the master-servant relationship.\", 'Amazon.com', 'Remade from the hit 1970s serial, this new version of', 'Upstairs, Downstairs', ', condensed into three hour-long episodes, creates for a modern eye a vision of what 1936 in England must have looked like. That is, if you were royalty, and ran a fantastic mansion at 165 Eaton Place, in one of London\\'s poshest neighborhoods. This show, as indicated in its title, revels in its overall ability to convey life as it unfolds upstairs, among the elite, and downstairs, among those who work tirelessly to keep the palace running. From the first episode, \"The Fledgling,\" the plot is placed politically, socially, and romantically as newlyweds Sir Hallam Holland (Ed Stoppard) and Lady Agnes (Keeley Hawes) decide to sweep the cobwebs out of the old family haunt in favor of modernization. While mundane house dramas unfurl, increasing tenfold once Sir Hallam\\'s nosy, old-fashioned mother, Maud (Eileen Atkins), decides that she and her pet monkey will be moving in, larger political dramas pepper the personal landscape. For example, in \"The Fledgling,\" as well as the next episodes, \"The Ladybird\" and \"The Cuckoo,\" Agnes\\'s sister, Lady Persephone (Claire Foy), is increasingly misled by the newly formed fascist party, and mounting tensions between Jewish household members and Persie\\'s ilk, including German official Ribbentrop (Edward Baker-Duly), loom large. As would be expected in this royal tale, much of the plot comprises Agnes\\'s ability to bear children and the political expectations Sir Hallam must meet even when morally conflicted.', \"The most winning aspect of this miniseries is in its display of what the servants attend throughout; their challenges seem equally as difficult as the challenges presented in tandem upstairs. When Agnes promotes ex-housekeeper Rose Buck (Jean Marsh) to hire and manage the house crew, Rose rises to the occasion and commands many interesting scenes in which she hires, fires, and coaches team members like the butler, Pritchard (Adrian Scarborough), head chef Mrs. Thackeray (Anne Reid), young footman Johnny (Nico Mirallegro), and maid Ivy (Ellie Kendrick). Lavish scenes showing preparation for parties, plus those in which the servants simply keep up with daily tasks, may shock those who are not familiar with formal etiquette from the past. Amanjit (Art Malik), Maud's secretary who lives upstairs separate from the rest of the servants, serves as a character who straddles both worlds, offering us glimpses into a man who can relate to both classes. While ultimately modern change is afoot in the Holland household, it is slow moving, and viewers will enjoy watching it come incrementally, through refined displays. --\", 'Trinie Dalton']\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Aspect Ratio': '1.78:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 2.72 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'DE177642D', 'Director': 'Various', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, NTSC', 'Run time': '3 hours', 'Release date': 'April 26, 2011', 'Actors': 'Various', 'Studio': 'BBC Home Entertainment', 'Number of discs': '2'}\nReview Text: Purchased both seasons of this continuing story of '165' while I am waiting for the next season of Downton Abby.

Daniela Denby-Ashe plays Margaret Hale, forthright and strong-willed daughter of a former vicar (Tim Pigott-Smith) who relocates his family from a pastoral village outside London to unforgiving, largely illiterate Milton, a factory town where John Thornton (Richard Armitage) and his mother (Sinead Cusack), survivors of poverty, rule their cotton mill with an iron hand. Thornton befriends Margaret's father but incurs her wrath for his severity with his workers. What she doesn't notice is Thornton's core sense of responsibility for his employees' welfare. On the other hand, he misinterprets some of Margaret's own actions and intentions. Equally stubborn, the two drag out their obvious attraction over many painful months and events.\", 'North & South', \"'s two leads are both very good, though Armitage's brooding, penetrating performance may very well be considered a classic one day. There are other wonders in the cast: Cusack and Pigott-Smith are superb, and Brendan Coyle is memorable as a firebrand union organizer who ultimately becomes an ally to a softening Thornton. The miniseries script by Sandy Welch is a persuasive mix of historical context and character study. Brian Percival's direction is full of moments that linger in the imagination, such as the winter-dream look of a busy cotton mill, with thousands of snowy fibers floating in the air.\", '--Tom Keogh']\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Drama', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Closed-captioned, Color, NTSC, Subtitled', 'Contributor': 'Sinead Cusack, Elizabeth Gaskell, Daniela Denby-ashe, Richard Armitage, Tim Pigott-smith', 'Language': 'Unqualified, English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo)', 'Number Of Discs': '2', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.5 x 0.5 inches; 3.2 Ounces', 'Item model number': '794051245328', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Closed-captioned, Color, NTSC, Subtitled', 'Run time': '3 hours and 53 minutes', 'Release date': 'May 16, 2006', 'Actors': 'Daniela Denby-ashe, Richard Armitage, Sinead Cusack, Tim Pigott-smith', 'Subtitles': 'English', 'Studio': 'BBC Video', 'Writers': 'Elizabeth Gaskell', 'Number of discs': '2'}\nReview Text: Once again, I purchased this DVD while waiting for my next Downton Abby fix.  It is only a short series but well worth viewing.  The story line moved along nicely, the characters were well done and I found it engaging.  Not a complicated or involved drama, but still it managed to keep me captivated.  Sorry that it was not longer.  I had also purchased the &#34;Lark Rise&#34; series and did not finish that as it was too much like watching the British version of Little House on the Prairie, but North & South had a more adult story line that I found entertaining.
