  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe analysis of the purchase history reveals a strong preference for drama and suspense genres, particularly mystery and crime series. The individual consistently expresses frustration over Amazon's pricing strategy and content access restrictions, indicating a low tolerance for perceived unfair monetization practices, such as paying for additional content after initial access. This sentiment is underscored by repeated low ratings for products where access was limited or altered.\n\nQuality is a significant factor, as evidenced by high ratings for movies and shows featuring well-regarded actors and meaningful storytelling, reflecting appreciation for strong performances and emotional resonance in content. The individual is engaged in binge-watching, likely due to their insomnia, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive access to entire series without cost barriers.\n\nPrice sensitivity is prominent, as the reviewer clearly articulates dissatisfaction with additional charges for later seasons and episodes. There is a recurring theme of loyalty to familiar and beloved shows, yet a strong aversion to being charged unexpectedly or having content altered post-viewing initiation.\n\nOverall, the core preferences highlight a desire for accessible, high-quality video content in the drama genre, aligned with a willingness to pay for value but a strong resistance to perceived exploitation by streaming services.",

It is a complex drama, not sure where they are going with this, I hope it ends happy, so much struggle, it keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The characters are incredibly talented actors/actresses. I know not everyone is into cowboy theme, but this is so good, one must give it a chance if you can take the intensity. Costner outdid himself on this .",
