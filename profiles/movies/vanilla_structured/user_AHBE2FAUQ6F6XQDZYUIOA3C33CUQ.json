      "Season Two opens with LAPD detective Martin Riggs (Clayne Crawford) south of the California border, where he's willing to risk it all in order to take down the drug cartel kingpin he believes is responsible for the death of his wife. But three little words from Riggs' partner, Roger Murtaugh (Damon Wayans), change everything. Soon the good cop/crazy good cop duo is back on the street, solving homicides, fighting crime, wrecking cars and blowing up whatever gets in the way. But matters of the heart take the guys to unexpected places. Is Riggs falling for a friend from his past? Why is Murtaugh sleeping on the couch? And wait! Is the Riggs/Murtaugh partnership on the rocks too? Season Two delivers lethal humor, action and drama in 22 insanely excellent episodes."
