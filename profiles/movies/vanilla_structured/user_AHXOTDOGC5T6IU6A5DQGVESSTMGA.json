Dr. Harrison's medical practices, such as his refusal to amputate a man's arm because it's broken, are all the more radical because they are so fundamental by today's standards. In subsequent episodes, he recommends Miss Smith get spectacles to cure her headaches, and saves his love's life by cooling her fever after conservative doctor, Dr. Morgan (John Bowe), recommends the old school practice of burying her in blankets in front of a raging fire. In Part Two, Lady Ludlow (Francesca Annis) throws a garden party at her estate, treating all the women in their fancy hats to a new novelty: ice cream. This scene foreshadows Ludlow's future concern at a railroad plan involving her land that would connect Cranford to Manchester, symbolizing the ruin of this idyllic setting.\", \"In fact, fluffy and clever as some scenes are, death and rebirth assert themselves in each showing, both physically and idealistically. Part Four shows an auctioning off of a deceased man's antiques, and focuses on issues of class and women's education, as Mr. Carter teaches a peasant boy to read while his assistant fumes at her trappings as a seamstress. Part Five ushers in a new period of medical emergencies, securing Dr. Harrison's shaky position in town. In total,\", 'Cranford', 'offers a powerful, if sentimental, look at how death begets life, love, and passion.', '--Trinie Dalton']\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Drama', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Closed-captioned, Color, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Various', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo), Unqualified (DTS ES 6.1)', 'Number Of Discs': '2', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Package Dimensions': '7.44 x 5.39 x 0.67 inches; 5.6 Ounces', 'Item model number': '883929012404', 'Director': 'Various', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Closed-captioned, Color, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Run time': '4 hours and 55 minutes', 'Release date': 'May 20, 2008', 'Actors': 'Various', 'Subtitles': 'English', 'Studio': 'BBC Home Entertainment', 'Number of discs': '2'}\nReview Text: I enjoyed Cranford very much! Having grown up in a small, rural community, I found Cranford charmingly realistic. The gossip in the close knit little town often leads to humorous situations, while the sweetness of the characters leads to compassion through their sorrows. Overall, I found Cranford to be &#34;family friendly&#34; with the possible exceptions of an incident with a broken arm (protruding bone) and another that insinuates a child using a large rock to finish killing a rabbit caught in a trap (although it only shows a rabbit lying on the ground & the child raising the rock). By today's standards those scenes are very mild (I've seen much worse on TV, but wanted to mention them should anyone with small children be concerned). I'm sure I will soon be purchasing &#34;Return to Cranford&#34;.\nReview Title: Small Town Reality at It's Best\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: The Legend of Lizzie Borden\nReview Date: 2015/08/29\nStore: Elizabeth Montgomery  (Actor),     Fionnula Flanagan  (Actor),     Paul Wendkos  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Drama\nProduct Description: ['Product Description', \"In a stylized retelling of the events of August 4, 1892, the film begins when the parents of New England spinster Lizzie Andrew Borden were found brutally murdered in their Fall River, Massachusetts home.

Although it may stray a bit from the actual events (as they appear based on court transcripts in the book, &#34; A Private Disgrace&#34;, Elizabeth Montgomery is fabulous as Lizzie. I also love Katherine Helmond as her sister Emma. The music is perfectly haunting! I read recently that Elizabeth Montgomery was actually a descendant of Lizze. I highly recommend this DVD!  \u263a\nReview Title: Mesmerizing rendition!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n    Structure your response as:\n   \n    SUMMARY:\n    [Final synthesis of preferences and patterns]",
