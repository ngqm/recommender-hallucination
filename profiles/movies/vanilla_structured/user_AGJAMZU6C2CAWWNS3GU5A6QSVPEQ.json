UNVEILED SEX , GORE, AND PROFANITY. The concept is pretty easy to understand:  It's the old \"downtrodden immigrants being misunderstood and ill-treated\" plot that has been told hundreds of times.  BUT it is so well written, acted, and directed that I had to force myself to not binge-watch the whole season in one day!  As I mentioned first, there are scenes of blatant sex and shots of gooey, dismembered corpses - though none of it truly gratuitous.  It was all somewhat necessary to advance the plot.  I just hope Amazon doesn't pull another \"The Expanse only the first one's free\" bait and switch on me again.....\nReview Title: Best original series to come along in some time!

I've been wanting this set for years, and it finally dropped to a price I could afford. The case for the disks is cheaply made and not the most convenient in the world -- but if that keeps the price down, I'm fine with a little extra work to get to the next disk in the series.<br /><br />Now when I want to relax, I can just turn on my DVD player and enjoy some good, odd, British secret agent stories -- and of course the captivating Dame Diana Rigg. &#34;Mrs. Peel, we're needed!&#34;\nReview Title: Love it!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Knight and Day\nReview Date: 2016/10/14\nStore: Tom Cruise  (Actor),     Cameron Diaz  (Actor),     James Mangold  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG-13    Format: Blu-ray\nCategories: Movies & TV, Featured Categories, Blu-ray\nProduct Description: ['In the action-comedy KNIGHT AND DAY, Tom Cruise is a covert agent and Cameron Diaz is a woman caught between him and those he claims set him up.

A friend &#34;borrowed&#34; it, and I haven't seen that disk since.  I decided I like it enough to go ahead an buy it again on BluRay.<br /><br />The movie is a great, fun, action/comedy -- the kind you know won't win any academy awards but you don't care. Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz have good chemistry and comedic timing -- but what really makes the movie is the end.  So as not to spoil anything, it suffices to say that some things come full circle.  Great popcorn movie.\nReview Title: I decided I like it enough to go ahead an buy it again ...\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: DCU: Batman: Gotham By Gaslight (Blu-Ray)\nReview Date: 2019/01/07\nStore: Bruce Greenwood  (Actor),     Jennifer Carpenter  (Actor),     Sam Liu  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: Blu-ray\nCategories: Movies & TV, Blu-ray, Movies\nProduct Description: ['DCU: Batman: Gotham By Gaslight (Blu-Ray)', 'Gotham City, at the turn of the century, is experiencing a golden era of discovery and industry as showcased by affluent businessman Bruce Wayne\u2019s World Fair.

I was anticipating seeing Batman using a lot of cool \"steampunkish\" gadgets and a dark, gritty atmosphere.  I guess they were trying to keep it from freaking out younger viewers, but the story and animation style just never grabbed my attention and held it.

UNVEILED SEX , GORE, AND PROFANITY. The concept is pretty easy to understand:  It's the old \"downtrodden immigrants being misunderstood and ill-treated\" plot that has been told hundreds of times.  BUT it is so well written, acted, and directed that I had to force myself to not binge-watch the whole season in one day!  As I mentioned first, there are scenes of blatant sex and shots of gooey, dismembered corpses - though none of it truly gratuitous.  It was all somewhat necessary to advance the plot.  I just hope Amazon doesn't pull another \"The Expanse only the first one's free\" bait and switch on me again.....\nReview Title: Best original series to come along in some time!

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe individual demonstrates a clear preference for high-quality films and series across various genres, particularly those that blend action, adventure, and a hint of romance or comedy. Consistently high ratings (around 4.5 to 5.0) for diverse titles indicate strong satisfaction with storylines that offer depth, character development, and nostalgic elements, as seen in their strong connection to both classic and contemporary content.\n\nTheir reviews highlight a fondness for well-crafted narratives that may include mature content, suggesting comfort with films that explore complex themes rather than overly sanitized depictions. Across the purchase history, there is a recurring appreciation for productions featuring established actors and directors, reflecting a bias towards trusted names in entertainment.\n\nThis consumer exhibits a willingness to invest in media that meets quality standards but is also sensitive to pricing, particularly when purchasing items they\u2019ve desired for some time. They show tolerance for minor deficiencies in product quality (like packaging) as long as the price remains reasonable. Overall, their preferences lean towards intelligent, engaging storytelling presented through both nostalgic and new formats, prioritizing quality over sheer volume.",

Taken as it is, this movie is a wonderful and inspiring movie about people defying the odds and the status-quo to prove that the present \"common knowledge\" was dead wrong.  The actors' chemistry, the script, the directing, the sets - all did a fine job of capturing my attention and pulling me, sweaty palms and all, into the adventure. Great fun that I hope will inspire people to realize \"You don't change the world simply by looking at it. You change it through the way you choose to live in it\".",
