Der Bingle is a turn-of-the-century blacksmith who is knocked unconscious only to awaken in sixth-century Camelot. But thanks to some American know-how, the crooner is quickly hailed as a wiz of a wizard and granted the right to teach Rhonda Fleming, the King\\'s fetching niece, some decidedly contemporary romantic tricks. Alas, there\\'s trouble afoot when Bing locks \"magical\" horns with the all-powerful Merlin and is challenged to a joust by Sir Lancelot for the hand of the beautiful princess! Co-starring Sir Cedric Hardwicke and William Bendix, the classic fantasy also features a marvelous score by Jimmy Van Heusen and Johnny Burke, along with such hits as \"Busy Doing Nothing\" and \"Once and for Always.\" The Emperor Waltz: Just imagine: Viennese royalty, elegantly dressed ladies, dashing courtiers, and Bing Crosby in his old straw hat sharing the Danube and the court of Emperor Franz Joseph. It\\'s a recipe for sure-fire fun. Bing plays Virgil Smith, an American phonograph salesman whose fox terrier companion takes a fancy to the persnickety poodle of countess Johanna Augusta (Joan Fontaine). While some may call it puppy love, it turns out that romance is not just going to the dogs. Virgil\\'s openness and congeniality start to melt the icy coolness of the Viennese royal, who struggles with whether or not to dare defy convention in her tradition-oriented homeland. The lush scenery provides a gorgeous backdrop for the wooing and canoeing that take place in the land of blue rivers and Strauss waltzes. Add an element of good old American humor and Bing\\'s smooth sounds, and The Emperor Waltz is a delightfully entertaining trip to the musical wonders of old Vienna, Hollywood-style. Music, merriment, and romance blend blissfully while Bing sings \"Friendly Mountains\" and \"I Kiss Your Hand, Madam,\" and Strauss melodies fill the air.

Add an element of good old American humor and Bing\\'s smooth sounds, and The Emperor Waltz is a delightfully entertaining trip to the musical wonders of old Vienna, Hollywood-style. Music, merriment, and romance blend blissfully while Bing sings \"Friendly Mountains\" and \"I Kiss Your Hand, Madam,\" and Strauss melodies fill the air.

The other movie is good, too. The movie is loosely based on Mark Twain's classic story-- sticking with the highlights. This interpretation has just the right mix of music and story-telling. The cast is great. If you like Bing Crosby, this movie is a can't miss.\nReview Title: The other movie is good, too\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Salsa Dance DVD Video SalsaCrazy Series, Volume 1 - Salsa Dancing Guide for Beginners - Step by Step Dance Club Lesson\nReview Date: 2014/11/22\nStore: Rated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Special Interests\nProduct Description: ['Product Description', 'Salsa Dance!', \"The ultimate step by step guide to salsa dance, from your very first steps.

We looked like the dancers on the DVD, if only a \"touch\" less professional (okay, a lot less professional but it WAS our first time). Now we\\'re working our way through the DVDs, Learn to Dance Salsa 2 and Learn to Dance Salsa 3 and I can actually say that we are getting better and better all the time. Plus, it is a lot of fun to practice!', \"What makes this DVD a standout? The instructors start out by explaining the basics of Salsa so that once you work into the actual dance movements, you have some idea of what Salsa actually is and where it fits in the dance spectrum. You aren't just mimicking steps but actually expressing a certain mood and feeling. That is a major plus right there. If you are going to Salsa, you want to create a total effect, not look like a robot going through the motions.\", \"The instruction itself is very easy to follow, with both full-length and close-up shots of the dancers' feet, going at a very easy, step by step pace at first and gradually working up to a brisker tempo. We found ourselves smiling from start to finish, amazed at how much fun this was. Be forewarned, however- depending on your partner, you may be compelled to take a few romantic interludes as Salsa can be amazingly sexy and just moving together in rhythmic harmony while practicing the moves that lead one's thoughts to further romance...but that's another plus, to my way of thinking (think of it as a free bonus, if you will). --K.

The tango scene is the best in any film I have seen. My wife and I really love Latin dances, salsa in particular, but, tango, although it originated in Argentina, is not considered a Latin dance. Watch this movie and you'll agree, the tango has just as much passion as Latin dance. Antonia and Katya are fiery-hot in that number.<br /><br />Based on a true story, this movie is inspiring.
