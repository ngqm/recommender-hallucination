Of course, the real issue in Rand's scenario is not metal alloy but the fact that government regulation and a misguided sense of collectivism and altruism is strangling the elite members of society, something the movie reminds us of with grim regularity.

(And if you find Rand\\'s ideas absurd, you\\'ll find this movie a little like watching a cult meeting.) As to the question \"Who is John Galt?\" you\\'ll have to move on to', 'Atlas Shrugged: Part Two', \", released in 2012, to pick that up--but be ready to work at sorting the plot out anew, because Part One's cast has been replaced by a new roster of actors.\", '--Robert Horton']\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Aspect Ratio': '2.35:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.6 x 5.3 x 7.5 inches; 2.72 Ounces', 'Item model number': '22914266', 'Director': 'Paul Johansson', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Run time': '1 hour and 37 minutes', 'Release date': 'November 8, 2011', 'Actors': 'Patrick Fischler, Taylor Schilling, Grant Bowler, Matthew Marsden, Edi Gathegi', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish', 'Producers': 'Harmon M.

The global economy is on the brink of collapse. Brilliant creators, from artists to industrialists, continue to mysteriously disappear.

Despite the fact that most of the actors are upgrades over', 'Part I', \", the middle section feels even clumsier in laying out the cardboard characters and ham-fisted dialogue, or in shifting from talky scenes to tinny digital effects--although Rand's device of slowly teasing out the arrival of this John Galt fellow remains a darned good dramatic gimmick.

The journey moves quickly over the arc of the old colonial empires, into America's empire of liberty, and we see the unfolding realignment of nations and the shape of the global future.\", 'Amazon.com', \"Watching Dinesh D'Souza's\", \"2016: Obama's America\", 'in the wake of the 2012 U.S. presidential election is an interesting experience. Since the film was clearly produced and released (in July \\'12) with the intention of convincing Americans not to reelect Barack Obama, does the fact that he won anyway render it irrelevant? Or is it a good thing that now that Obama will remain in the White House, we\\'ll have a chance to see if D\\'Souza\\'s dire predictions about the havoc the president will wreak on the nation (cutting the military, raising taxes, continuing to ignore Iran\\'s nuclear potential, spending money irresponsibly, and so on) will come true? It\\'s the filmmaker\\'s contention that Obama\\'s dreams, aspirations, and values come from his father; although he barely knew Barack Obama Sr., his mother passed on his influence--influence that was largely misguided, as the elder Obama was a radical anti-colonialist whose son has spent his life trying to \"become worthy of his father\\'s love\u2026 the love he never got.\" D\\'Souza illustrates his thesis by way of reenactments, interviews (including plenty of face time for himself), footage from visits to Kenya (Obama Sr.\\'s native country) and Indonesia (where the president briefly lived with his mother and stepfather), and excerpts from Obama\\'s first book,', 'Dreams from My Father', ', read by the president himself. He does his case no favors by not talking to anyone with a differing point of view; at the same time, he tends to prod those he does interview into giving the answers that he wants to hear (\"Do you see Israel as a little colonial power in the Middle East?\" is typical), and his references to \"founding fathers\" of Obama\\'s alleged radicalism (William Ayers, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, et al.) are old and tired. About an hour into the story, having declared the new brand of anti-colonialism (unlike the older kind, which helped India, D\\'Souza\\'s own homeland, rid itself of the British) to be \"anti-capitalist (and) anti-Christian,\" he declares that Obama \"possesses a Third World, anti-American view.\" At that point, pretty much all pretense of objectivity is abandoned; this is where the true believers will move closer and turn up the volume, while others will turn off their TVs in disgust. That\\'s unfortunate, as the end result will be that those predisposed to mistrust Obama will find nothing to soften their view here; neither will those who think it\\'s nothing but hateful, divisive nonsense.', '--Sam Graham']\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG (Parental Guidance Suggested)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 0.7 x 5.4 inches; 2.72 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'LGT33285DVD', 'Director': \"Dinesh D'Souza, John Sullivan\", 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Dolby, Color, AC-3, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Run time': '1 hour and 29 minutes', 'Release date': 'October 16, 2012', 'Subtitles': 'English', 'Studio': 'Lionsgate', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: He hates us.
