Though it was actually the third time director-star Paul Wegener had played the eponymous creation, the earlier efforts (sadly lost) were rough drafts for this elaborate dramatization of the Jewish legend. When the Emperor decrees that the Jews of mediaeval Prague should be evicted from the ghetto, a mystical rabbi creates a clay giant and summons the demon Astaroth who breathes out in smoky letters the magic word that will animate the golem. Intended as a protector and avenger, the golem is twisted by the machinations of a lovelorn assistant and, like many a monster to come, runs riot, terrorizing guilty and innocent alike until a little girl innocently ends his rampage. Wegener's golem is an impressively solid figure, the Frankenstein monster with a slightly comical clay wig.

Liev Schreiber narrates.', 'Amazon.com', 'Originally broadcast on PBS,', 'The Jewish-Americans', 'covers 350 years in the lives of Jews who have struggled to maintain their religious identity and still be fully accepted as Americans. It is a story at once specific and universal, one that can be appreciated by any ethnic or religious minority who tests whether \"democracy, like America, can find room for everyone.\" Beginning with 23 Jewish exiles seeking safe haven in New Amsterdam in 1654, writer-director David Grubin does an admirable job of charting the often rocky and treacherous course for Jews in this country, and their personal \"tug of war between being American and being a Jew.\" Do they consider themselves Jewish-Americans, or American Jews? Carl Reiner, Mandy Patinkin, Sid Caesar, Jules Feiffer, playwright Tony Kushner, and Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg are among the more recognizable personalities who offer illuminating commentary and bittersweet reminiscences. But Grubin presents what he calls \"an ensemble of voices\" rather than \"a star-studded parade.\" Authors, historians, sociologists, academics, and rabbis share a rich personal and cultural history.', 'Narrated by Liev Schreiber,', 'The Jewish-Americans', 'is comprised of three two-hour episodes, \"They Came to Stay,\" \"The Best of Times, the Worst of Times,\" and \"Home.\" Each is a richly textured tapestry of talking heads, still photos, archival footage, and audio and film clips (the inevitable', \"Gentleman's Agreement\", '), and reveal how Jews have become woven into the fabric of Jewish life. Songwriter Irving Berlin wrote \"God Bless America,\" and the holiday classics \"White Christmas\" and \"Easter Parade.\" Jerry Siegel and Joe Schuster created Superman. Another crossover pop culture success was Gertrude Berg as Molly Goldberg of the Bronx, offering sage advice and homespun wisdom on radio, television and the movies. One illuminating segment reveals how assimilated movie mogul Louis B. Mayer\\'s', 'Andy Hardy', 'films, with their \"fairy tale visions of small town life,\" were the \"American fantasies of a Jewish immigrant.\" Anti-Semitism rears its ugly head throughout the series. Grubin captures the hysteria surrounding the murder trial of Georgia factory worker Leo Franks, who, in 1915, was falsely convicted in the murder of 13-year-old Mary Phagan, and subsequently lynched by a homicidal mob. The segment that addresses the Holocaust documents America\\'s indifference in dealing with Hitler\\'s \"Final Solution.\" Grubin notes how political activism has long been a part of Jewish-American life, and how Jews took an active role in the Civil Rights struggle. As the old saying goes, you don\\'t have to be Jewish to be compelled and profoundly moved by this ambitious documentary miniseries. But it couldn\\'t hurt.', '--Donald Liebenson']\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Special Interests', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Language': 'Unqualified, English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo)', 'Number Of Discs': '1', 'Runtime': '6 hours', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.78:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.55 x 5.36 x 7.47 inches; 4 Ounces', 'Item model number': '705225', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Run time': '6 hours', 'Release date': 'February 5, 2008', 'Studio': 'PBS', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: I enjoyed this film\nReview Title: Four Stars\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: A Yiddish World Remembered\nReview Date: 2014/06/23\nStore: Andrew Goldberg  (Director, Producer)    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Documentary\nProduct Description: ['In A Yiddish World Remembered, the story of Jewish life in Eastern Europe is brought to life again by some of the remaining eyewitnesses.

When the Emperor decrees that the Jews of mediaeval Prague should be evicted from the ghetto, a mystical rabbi creates a clay giant and summons the demon Astaroth who breathes out in smoky letters the magic word that will animate the golem. Intended as a protector and avenger, the golem is twisted by the machinations of a lovelorn assistant and, like many a monster to come, runs riot, terrorizing guilty and innocent alike until a little girl innocently ends his rampage. Wegener's golem is an impressively solid figure, the Frankenstein monster with a slightly comical clay wig.

(Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Independently Distributed, Documentary\n['Product Description', 'This six-hour documentary follows 350 years of Jewish-American history, from the first settlement in the 17th century to the present, and explores the experience of immigration and assimilation. Liev Schreiber narrates.', 'Amazon.com', 'Originally broadcast on PBS,', 'The Jewish-Americans', 'covers 350 years in the lives of Jews who have struggled to maintain their religious identity and still be fully accepted as Americans. It is a story at once specific and universal, one that can be appreciated by any ethnic or religious minority who tests whether \"democracy, like America, can find room for everyone.\" Beginning with 23 Jewish exiles seeking safe haven in New Amsterdam in 1654, writer-director David Grubin does an admirable job of charting the often rocky and treacherous course for Jews in this country, and their personal \"tug of war between being American and being a Jew.\" Do they consider themselves Jewish-Americans, or American Jews? Carl Reiner, Mandy Patinkin, Sid Caesar, Jules Feiffer, playwright Tony Kushner, and Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg are among the more recognizable personalities who offer illuminating commentary and bittersweet reminiscences. But Grubin presents what he calls \"an ensemble of voices\" rather than \"a star-studded parade.\" Authors, historians, sociologists, academics, and rabbis share a rich personal and cultural history.', 'Narrated by Liev Schreiber,', 'The Jewish-Americans', 'is comprised of three two-hour episodes, \"They Came to Stay,\" \"The Best of Times, the Worst of Times,\" and \"Home.\" Each is a richly textured tapestry of talking heads, still photos, archival footage, and audio and film clips (the inevitable', \"Gentleman's Agreement\", '), and reveal how Jews have become woven into the fabric of Jewish life. Songwriter Irving Berlin wrote \"God Bless America,\" and the holiday classics \"White Christmas\" and \"Easter Parade.\" Jerry Siegel and Joe Schuster created Superman. Another crossover pop culture success was Gertrude Berg as Molly Goldberg of the Bronx, offering sage advice and homespun wisdom on radio, television and the movies. One illuminating segment reveals how assimilated movie mogul Louis B. Mayer\\'s', 'Andy Hardy', 'films, with their \"fairy tale visions of small town life,\" were the \"American fantasies of a Jewish immigrant.\" Anti-Semitism rears its ugly head throughout the series. Grubin captures the hysteria surrounding the murder trial of Georgia factory worker Leo Franks, who, in 1915, was falsely convicted in the murder of 13-year-old Mary Phagan, and subsequently lynched by a homicidal mob. The segment that addresses the Holocaust documents America\\'s indifference in dealing with Hitler\\'s \"Final Solution.\" Grubin notes how political activism has long been a part of Jewish-American life, and how Jews took an active role in the Civil Rights struggle. As the old saying goes, you don\\'t have to be Jewish to be compelled and profoundly moved by this ambitious documentary miniseries. But it couldn\\'t hurt.', '--Donald Liebenson']\n{'Genre': 'Special Interests', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Language': 'Unqualified, English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo)', 'Number Of Discs': '1', 'Runtime': '6 hours', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.78:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.55 x 5.36 x 7.47 inches; 4 Ounces', 'Item model number': '705225', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Run time': '6 hours', 'Release date': 'February 5, 2008', 'Studio': 'PBS', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nI enjoyed this film\nFour Stars\nA Yiddish World Remembered\nAndrew Goldberg  (Director, Producer)    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Documentary\n['In A Yiddish World Remembered, the story of Jewish life in Eastern Europe is brought to life again by some of the remaining eyewitnesses.

Though it was actually the third time director-star Paul Wegener had played the eponymous creation, the earlier efforts (sadly lost) were rough drafts for this elaborate dramatization of the Jewish legend. When the Emperor decrees that the Jews of mediaeval Prague should be evicted from the ghetto, a mystical rabbi creates a clay giant and summons the demon Astaroth who breathes out in smoky letters the magic word that will animate the golem. Intended as a protector and avenger, the golem is twisted by the machinations of a lovelorn assistant and, like many a monster to come, runs riot, terrorizing guilty and innocent alike until a little girl innocently ends his rampage. Wegener's golem is an impressively solid figure, the Frankenstein monster with a slightly comical clay wig. The wonderfully grotesque Prague sets and the alchemical atmosphere remain potent.\", '--Kim Newman']\nAverage Rating: 4.3\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Horror, Classics/Silent Films', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, NTSC, Black & White, Silent', 'Contributor': 'Carl Ebert, Paul Wegener, Ernst Deutsch, Lyda Salmonova, Max Kronert, Henrik Galeen, Dore Paetzold, Loni Nest, Lothar Mthel, Otto Gebhr, Greta Schrder, Hans Strm, Albert Steinrck, Carl BoeseCarl Ebert, Paul Wegener, Ernst Deutsch, Lyda Salmonova, Max Kronert, Henrik Galeen, Dore Paetzold, Loni Nest, Lothar Mthel, Otto Gebhr, Greta Schrder, Hans Strm, Albert Steinrck, Carl Boese  See more', 'Language': 'English', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 31 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.33:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'Unrated (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.75 x 5.5 x 0.5 inches; 1.6 Ounces', 'Item model number': '2254731', 'Director': 'Carl Boese, Paul Wegener', 'Media Format': 'NTSC, Multiple Formats, Silent, Black & White', 'Run time': '1 hour and 31 minutes', 'Release date': 'September 24, 2002', 'Actors': 'Paul Wegener, Albert Steinrck, Ernst Deutsch, Lyda Salmonova, Hans Strm', 'Studio': 'Kino Lorber films', 'Writers': 'Henrik Galeen, Paul Wegener', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: I can't say anything bad about this film, But I really cant say I enjoyed it.

Liev Schreiber narrates.', 'Amazon.com', 'Originally broadcast on PBS,', 'The Jewish-Americans', 'covers 350 years in the lives of Jews who have struggled to maintain their religious identity and still be fully accepted as Americans. It is a story at once specific and universal, one that can be appreciated by any ethnic or religious minority who tests whether \"democracy, like America, can find room for everyone.\" Beginning with 23 Jewish exiles seeking safe haven in New Amsterdam in 1654, writer-director David Grubin does an admirable job of charting the often rocky and treacherous course for Jews in this country, and their personal \"tug of war between being American and being a Jew.\" Do they consider themselves Jewish-Americans, or American Jews? Carl Reiner, Mandy Patinkin, Sid Caesar, Jules Feiffer, playwright Tony Kushner, and Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg are among the more recognizable personalities who offer illuminating commentary and bittersweet reminiscences. But Grubin presents what he calls \"an ensemble of voices\" rather than \"a star-studded parade.\" Authors, historians, sociologists, academics, and rabbis share a rich personal and cultural history.', 'Narrated by Liev Schreiber,', 'The Jewish-Americans', 'is comprised of three two-hour episodes, \"They Came to Stay,\" \"The Best of Times, the Worst of Times,\" and \"Home.\" Each is a richly textured tapestry of talking heads, still photos, archival footage, and audio and film clips (the inevitable', \"Gentleman's Agreement\", '), and reveal how Jews have become woven into the fabric of Jewish life. Songwriter Irving Berlin wrote \"God Bless America,\" and the holiday classics \"White Christmas\" and \"Easter Parade.\" Jerry Siegel and Joe Schuster created Superman. Another crossover pop culture success was Gertrude Berg as Molly Goldberg of the Bronx, offering sage advice and homespun wisdom on radio, television and the movies. One illuminating segment reveals how assimilated movie mogul Louis B. Mayer\\'s', 'Andy Hardy', 'films, with their \"fairy tale visions of small town life,\" were the \"American fantasies of a Jewish immigrant.\" Anti-Semitism rears its ugly head throughout the series. Grubin captures the hysteria surrounding the murder trial of Georgia factory worker Leo Franks, who, in 1915, was falsely convicted in the murder of 13-year-old Mary Phagan, and subsequently lynched by a homicidal mob. The segment that addresses the Holocaust documents America\\'s indifference in dealing with Hitler\\'s \"Final Solution.\" Grubin notes how political activism has long been a part of Jewish-American life, and how Jews took an active role in the Civil Rights struggle. As the old saying goes, you don\\'t have to be Jewish to be compelled and profoundly moved by this ambitious documentary miniseries. But it couldn\\'t hurt.', '--Donald Liebenson']\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Special Interests', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Language': 'Unqualified, English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo)', 'Number Of Discs': '1', 'Runtime': '6 hours', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.78:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.55 x 5.36 x 7.47 inches; 4 Ounces', 'Item model number': '705225', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Run time': '6 hours', 'Release date': 'February 5, 2008', 'Studio': 'PBS', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: I enjoyed this film\nReview Title: Four Stars\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: A Yiddish World Remembered\nReview Date: 2014/06/23\nStore: Andrew Goldberg  (Director, Producer)    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Documentary\nProduct Description: ['In A Yiddish World Remembered, the story of Jewish life in Eastern Europe is brought to life again by some of the remaining eyewitnesses. Narrated by Academy Award nominated actor Elliott Gould and accompanied by never-before-seen archival films, vintage photographs, and, of course, traditional Klezmer and cantorial music, the documentary takes a realistic and enlightening look at this unique and all-but-vanished way of life. For those in rural communities, there was often no running water or electricity. For many, anti-Semitism was a part of daily life. But for everyone, crowded conditions and poverty seemed to prevail. Despite these trials, through the eyes of the individuals interviewed, we learn that Jewish communities were close-knit and often even joyous places to live. This television special explores everything from the fascinating language of Yiddish to the Rabbis and Rebbes that often ran the communities to the powerful Jewish movements of Khasidism, Bundism and Zionism.
