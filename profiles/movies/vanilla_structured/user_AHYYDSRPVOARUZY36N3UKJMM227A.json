I really don't understand the bad reviews.  This is a MOVIE, not a cure for what ails amerikkka.  Black folks know the jokes and teasing is exactly what happens in our community.  That is because from the time we were stolen/kidnapped until now, we have been brainwashed by the status quo to hate and despise our very own skin.<br />I enjoyed the movie and look forward to watching it with my grandson.  He will get a kick out of it.  A movie like this, you expect to be a little campy.  It is a vampire flick. Period.  Those that take issue with anything past that, need to relax and look inward.  Somthing inside you is unhappy.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe individual demonstrates a strong preference for family-friendly entertainment, particularly films that are rated PG-13 or lower. Their consistent high ratings (averaging 4.6 to 5.0) reflect an appreciation for romantic comedies and light-hearted comedies, especially those created by Tyler Perry, highlighting a trend towards familiarity and comfort in genres. \n\nThemes observed in their choices include an attraction to uplifting narratives featuring relatable characters, along with a preference for humorous, clean content that can be enjoyed by a broad audience, including family and children. The sentiment across multiple reviews emphasizes enjoyment of heartwarming stories with minimal explicit content, suggesting a desire for wholesome entertainment.\n\nQuality-wise, the individual shows a recurring inclination toward engaging performances and quality storytelling, as noted by their favorable views on the acting and emotional depth of characters, while remaining price-sensitive by consistently choosing DVDs as their format of choice rather than more expensive digital options.\n\nLastly, the mix of genres, from romantic comedy to horror, indicates a flexible appreciation for diverse narratives, yet consistently points to the importance of relatability and emotional connection in their viewing experience.",
