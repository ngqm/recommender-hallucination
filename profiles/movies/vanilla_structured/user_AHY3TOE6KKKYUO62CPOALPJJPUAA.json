I was on active duty in the Navy in the midst of the Cold War, which always seemed to leave us on the knife\u2019s edge between peace and war. Everyone should see this, especially the politicians, most of whom seem totally ignorant of the effects of playing chicken with nuclear weapons. This will scare the beejeezus out of you. As well it should.\nReview Title: By the time the missiles fly, it is too late....\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: The Princess Bride (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray]\nReview Date: 2018/11/01\nStore: Cary Elwes;Peter Falk;Chris Sarandon;Fred Savage;Robin Wright  (Actor),     Rob Reiner  (Director)    Rated:    PG    Format: Blu-ray\nCategories: Movies & TV, Blu-ray, Movies\nProduct Description: ['From celebrated director Rob Reiner ( When Harry Met Sally ) and Oscar (r) winning* screenwriter William Goldman ( Chaplin ) comes \"an enchanting fantasy\" ( Time ) filled with adventure, romance and plenty of \"good hearted fun\" (Roger Ebert)!

The sound is especially fabulous. I found the picture quaility superior to my DVD Version but I am watching on an older Panasonic plasma 720p HDTV and am totally impressed. As for the packaging, I agree it was poor planning to put the info sheet onto the back of the book, but it peeled off easily and I then placed it on the last page of the book facing the Blu Ray. Easy fix. And the text was lovely, with essays written by both Sloan\u2019s Crosley and William Goldman. Any fan will love this!\nReview Title: Criterion\u2014-A truly worthwhile addition to your collection!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n    Structure your response as:\n   \n    SUMMARY:\n    [Final synthesis of preferences and patterns]",
