With spectacular, painstakingly authentic special effects that have stood the test of time, Kubrick's film is nothing less than a cinematic milestone--puzzling, provocative, and perfect.\", '--Jeff Shannon']\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Blu-ray, Color, AC-3, Closed-captioned, Dubbed, Original recording remastered, Special Edition, Subtitled, Widescreen, DolbyMultiple Formats, Blu-ray, Color, AC-3, Closed-captioned, Dubbed, Original recording remastered, Special Edition, Subtitled, Widescreen, Dolby   See more', 'Contributor': 'Sean Sullivan, David Hines, John Ashley, Douglas Rain, Simon Davis, Penny Brahms, Leonard Rossiter, Edwina Carroll, William Sylvester, Stanley Kubrick, Gary Lockwood, Vivian Kubrick, Keir Dullea, Robert Beatty, Ed Bishop, Ann Gillis, Glenn Beck, Margaret Tyzack, Daniel Richter, Alan Gifford, Frank MillerSean Sullivan, David Hines, John Ashley, Douglas Rain, Simon Davis, Penny Brahms, Leonard Rossiter, Edwina Carroll, William Sylvester, Stanley Kubrick, Gary Lockwood, Vivian Kubrick, Keir Dullea, Robert Beatty, Ed Bishop, Ann Gillis, Glenn Beck, Margaret Tyzack, Daniel Richt\u2026   See more', 'Language': 'English (PCM), Spanish (Dolby Digital 5.1)', 'Runtime': '2 hours and 29 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '2.20:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'G (General Audience)', 'Product Dimensions': '5.12 x 0.59 x 6.69 inches; 0.32 Ounces', 'Item model number': '3350293', 'Director': 'Stanley Kubrick', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Blu-ray, Color, AC-3, Closed-captioned, Dubbed, Original recording remastered, Special Edition, Subtitled, Widescreen, Dolby', 'Run time': '2 hours and 29 minutes', 'Release date': 'October 23, 2007', 'Actors': 'Keir Dullea, Gary Lockwood, Ed Bishop, Penny Brahms, Edwina Carroll', 'Dubbed': 'Spanish', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish, French', 'Studio': 'WarnerBrothers', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: Love this movie, was great price, quality and delivery!\nReview Title: Five Stars\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n    Structure your response as:\n   \n    SUMMARY:\n    [Final synthesis of preferences and patterns]",
