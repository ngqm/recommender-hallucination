When I put something away in the fridge, I try to choose a container I will use again. When I use a Ziplock I wash it out and put it away to be used again. I haven't forgotten my cloth and reusable plastic bags to use at the store. IKEA has some for .75 that fold up small enough to fit a couple or three in your purse or one in your pocket.  I did forget my car cup when I went for coffee and I felt bad about it, not just slightly remiss. I've been watching the recycle symbols on things I buy to make sure they have a 1 or 2. I will be writing to companies to ask them to make sure they are using those recyclables. I will also request they make large refill sizes for soap and the like. I'd use bar soap but it kills my skin.<br />This documentary is that eye opening. It will change how you think about everything you consume. Watch it and encourage others to as well, try not to be too obnoxious about it :).<br />All in all it was an easy film to watch, entertaining as well as informative. Dragged a bit towards the end but not so much I was wondering when it would be over.<br />04/03/2015<br />I just wanted to update that we haven't purchased but one new box of plastic storage bags since we watched this, and they are for long term storage, and will used again. We still use plastic trash bags, as we don't see any way to do away with them and keep sanitary.<br />On a side note, since we have been using reusable containers our crisper and our meat keeper are much cleaner, and our produce keeps longer, our stuff in the freezer keeps better.  So not only does using single use bags hurt the environment, they cost you more money, as your food doesn't last as long.<br />Thanks for the documentary.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe purchase history reveals a discerning viewer with a clear aversion to gratuitous violence in media, as evidenced by a low rating for a film that did not meet expectations of a light-hearted comedy. Despite this, they appreciate strong performances and well-crafted narratives, as shown by high ratings for works deemed engaging and thought-provoking. \n\nA recurring theme is a preference for content that encourages environmental awareness and personal growth, illustrated by a glowing review for a documentary that led to significant lifestyle changes. This suggests the individual values educational and transformative experiences, seeking media that resonates beyond entertainment.\n\nQuality is evidently prioritized, as reflected in the tendency to rate meaningful and impactful content highly, while expressing disappointment with poorly made products or those perceived as scams. There\u2019s also a hint of price sensitivity, particularly when disappointing purchases lead to requests for refunds.\n\nOverall, the core preferences suggest this individual enjoys quality storytelling that is either entertaining or socially enlightening, while rejecting content that feels exploitative or fails to deliver genuine value. They are also conscious of the environmental impact of their consumption choices.",
