It was a blockbuster there. If I'm not mistaken, it's the first Korean movie to be released in two parts and the first where all the CG/special effects were done in Korea. Anyway, it's a fantastic movie if you're a fan of the fantasy genre. There's also a heavy dose of heart. There will be many familiar faces if you watch Korean dramas or movies.
