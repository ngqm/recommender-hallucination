It is difficult to conceive of anyone who would want to be close to Ward's wife, or who would agree with her values and actions. It is a great light summer movie, where you don't have to look too far to understand the characters. Depth there is not, but it is a light-hearted movie.\nReview Title: I wouldn't want to have to live with Ward's wife--not in this lifetime...or ever\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2015/07/16\nAverage Rating: 2.2\nProduct Details: {'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Ana Grillo', 'Beth Nelsen'], 'Producers': ['Ana Blue Grillo', 'Beth Nelsen'], 'Starring': ['---'], 'Studio': ['Indie Crush']}\nReview Text: For a teen audience.

The recurrent themes include a preference for intelligent narratives that incorporate analytical thinking, such as the integration of mathematics in crime-solving contexts.\n\nPrice sensitivity appears low, with a willingness to invest in a variety of media formats, including DVDs, regardless of potential content advisories like violence or foul language, often valuing the overall experience over explicit content warnings.\n\nInterestingly, there's a discernible drop in ratings for comedies, with lower scores assigned to films perceived as predictable or lacking depth. This suggests a distinct preference for substance over superficial entertainment.

    "text": "I would have given this 5 stars, no question, but I have had a difficult time getting it to load so I can see the rest of the episodes. I think the premise of the series is quite interesting, and raises some difficult questions for the family. The characters of the &#34;synths&#34; are quite interesting, in an AI (Artificial Intelligence) kind of way. I am looking forward to how some of the human/synth problems are resolved. A very unique and fun series to watch. I highly recommend it. I was completely taken by surprise about how much I have enjoyed this series.",
