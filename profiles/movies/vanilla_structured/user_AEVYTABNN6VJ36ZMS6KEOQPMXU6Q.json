Southern Belle Amantha Starr is away atan exclusive girls' school when her father dies unexpectedly. She learnsshe is now penniless: Her father had lost everything--their money, theirplantation and their slaves. Worse, the truth comes out that her motherwas part African American--and under the law of Louisiana, Amantha mustbe sold into slavery. She is purchased by plantation owner Hamish Bond, who soon falls in love with his beautiful new slave--earningAmantha the resentment of overseer Rau Ru . When the UnitedStates' Civil War breaks out, Bond loses his plantation and reveals tothe newly freed Amantha that he yearned his fortune as a slave trader.",

She ends up under the protection of Hamish Bond (Clark Gable, close to the end of his long, remarkable career and still radiating an easy, charismatic masculinity), a plantation owner with secrets of his own. For much of the movie, slavery and the Civil War are just a colorful backdrop for a turgid romance--but just when you're ready to write the movie off, a scene unexpectedly digs into something more emotionally and politically complex. Poitier plays Bond's plantation foreman; every time he appears,",
