I was very happy with the result. I was sweaty, did my own stretching additional to warm up after the workout. I have been looking for a video like this to help advance me. I have prior experience with kettlbells and I can appreciate the instructors vision/ideals into this video.  I have had pain in the past from using higher weights and high reps and after doing these videos and the stretching I seriously feel good. I don't give this review lightly. I don't find it boring either as I add on to my other workouts and excited to have a video to use my heavier bells in. I thought there wasn't a way for me to advance past using a 25 pound bell but this dvd helped. My heavier ones 35 pound ones are in use now. I usually dead lifted my 25 pound bell. With this video I dared to dead lift 70 pounds when I weigh 130 and no pain feels awesome!  It makes me think I could go even heavier eventually as I build up tolerance.\nReview Title: Lauren Brooks' The Kettlebell Body DVd\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: One Piece - Collection Ten\nReview Date: 2017/07/19\nStore: Colleen Clinkebeard  (Actor),     Luci Christian  (Actor),     Mike McFarland  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Anime\nProduct Description: ['Hoping to save their beloved boat, the Straw Hats drop anchor at the shipbuilding city of Water 7, but the prognosis for the Going Merry proves far worse than expected.

I have prior experience with kettlbells and I can appreciate the instructors vision/ideals into this video.  I have had pain in the past from using higher weights and high reps and after doing these videos and the stretching I seriously feel good. I don't give this review lightly. I don't find it boring either as I add on to my other workouts and excited to have a video to use my heavier bells in. I thought there wasn't a way for me to advance past using a 25 pound bell but this dvd helped. My heavier ones 35 pound ones are in use now. I usually dead lifted my 25 pound bell.

I was very happy with the result. I was sweaty, did my own stretching additional to warm up after the workout. I have been looking for a video like this to help advance me. I have prior experience with kettlbells and I can appreciate the instructors vision/ideals into this video.  I have had pain in the past from using higher weights and high reps and after doing these videos and the stretching I seriously feel good. I don't give this review lightly. I don't find it boring either as I add on to my other workouts and excited to have a video to use my heavier bells in. I thought there wasn't a way for me to advance past using a 25 pound bell but this dvd helped. My heavier ones 35 pound ones are in use now. I usually dead lifted my 25 pound bell. With this video I dared to dead lift 70 pounds when I weigh 130 and no pain feels awesome!
