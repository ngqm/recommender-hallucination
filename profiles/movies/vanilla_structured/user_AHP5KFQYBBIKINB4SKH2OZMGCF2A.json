Its an older movie-think along the lines of the first Conan the Barbarian and first Clash of the Titans.  Well-we bought it, watched it and it was actually a really good movie.  the graphics-are older but still really good for time that the movie was made.  Story line was good, acting was good.  I especially enjoyed the little ferrets in the movie.  Adorable and reminded my of the one I use to have.\nReview Title: A pleasant surprize\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Godzilla: King of the Monsters Special Edition (DVD)\nReview Date: 2019/11/21\nStore: Kyle Chandler  (Actor),     Vera Farmiga  (Actor)    Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Fully Loaded DVDs, Special Editions\nProduct Description: ['Godzilla: King of the Monsters Special Edition (DVD): The story follows the heroic efforts of the crypto-zoological agency Monarch as its members face off against a battery of god-sized monsters, including the mighty Godzilla, who collides with Mothra, Rodan, and his ultimate nemesis, the three-headed King Ghidorah.
