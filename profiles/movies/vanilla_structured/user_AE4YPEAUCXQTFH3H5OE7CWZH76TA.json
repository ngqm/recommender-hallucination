It might have been almost watchable if it had starred, say, Meg Ryan, whose sometimes irritating cuteness might have lightened up the heroine's basically dour and unpleasant personality. Instead we're sentenced to two hours of the dreadful Kate Capshaw. It's not necessarily that she's a bad actress; she just seems like an awful person. Ellen DeGeneres isn't much more fun to watch. And the solution to the mystery of the love letter is not merely ridiculous; it's insultingly stupid.<br />Tom Selleck, as always, lights up the screen (too bad he's only on it for about 15 minutes), and the other supporting players are fine as well. And the scenes of New England are pretty. Maybe an enterprising fan will find a way to digitally insert them into a better movie.\nReview Title: Blech!\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Serendipity\nReview Date: 2002/07/15\nStore: John Cusack  (Actor),     Kate Beckinsale  (Actor),     Peter Chelsom  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Studio Specials, Miramax Home Entertainment, All Titles\nProduct Description: [\"Irresistible stars John Cusack (AMERICA'S SWEETHEARTS, HIGH FIDELITY) and Kate Beckinsale (PEARL HARBOR, BROKEDOWN PALACE) are drawn together and take a chance on love in this critically acclaimed romantic comedy!

And Kate Beckinsale is reliably interesting, as well as beautiful. So I can't figure out how they wound up in this half-hearted loser of a movie. In addition to numerous irritating implausibilities (starting with Cusack not knowing the definition of \"serendipity\"), the main characters have no, well, characteristics, beyond their obsession with each other. Cusack ultimately treats the woman in his life horribly, but we're supposed to forgive him because he does it all for true love. Yuck. It's a shame, because this promised to be the kind of fluffy New York love story we all needed this past year. It seems as if either the movie got edited to death after production, or the writer just didn't care enough to make the story interesting in the first place--I can't tell which.<br />In any case, \"Serendipity\" turns out to be a sad waste of time and talent. If you're a Cusack fan, get \"Say Anything,\"  \"High Fidelity,\" \"The Grifters,\" or even \"Grosse Pointe Blank.\" If Beckinsale's the one you want to watch, try \"Haunted,\" \"Cold Comfort Farm,\" \"Last Days of Disco,\" or even \"Brokedown Palace.\"\nReview Title: A depressing waste of some fine actors.\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Kate & Leopold\nReview Date: 2002/07/15\nStore: Meg Ryan  (Actor),     Hugh Jackman  (Actor),     James Mangold  (Director, Writer)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Studio Specials, Miramax Home Entertainment, All Titles\nProduct Description: [\"Meg Ryan (YOU'VE GOT MAIL) and Hugh Jackman (X-MEN) are paired as star-crossed lovers who discover that passion and chivalry never go out of style!

But it suffers from a bad case of Meg Ryan wrinkling up her adorable little nose and sighing at her hellish, though expensive, life.<br />It's also one of these new movies that specializes in insulting the intelligence of its audience. An example: the \"villain\" (a confused character played by Bradley Whitford--he's supposed to be bad, but I'm pretty sure he's not supposed to be an idiot) gets caught lying about an opera he hasn't really seen. Here's the thing: Many, many people in New York City (not just incredibly rich ones) love opera. If you don't know the plot of an opera, there's no point in lying about it, because the chances of getting caught are very high. But, apparently, the people who made this movie believe that the potential audience of this movie thinks that opera is only ever watched by upper-class snobs. And of course, in the end, true love conquers all, which in this case means the woman gives up everything she's worked for all her life, not to mention all her family and friends, to be with her man.<br />I can't say I didn't enjoy watching this movie.

Post-plastic-surgery, the gorgeous Tamara Drewe comes home to her boring rural village -- ostensibly to fix up and sell her deceased mother's house, but also to show up everyone who was cruel to her when she was a bright, angry teenager with an outsize nose. One of those people was her writer neighbor, a serial adulterer who reigns over the fawning guests at the farm/writer's colony actually run by his devoted and ultra-capable wife. Throw in the hot local handyman, a couple of dangerously bored teenaged girls, the drummer from a punk band, and a mannerless dog. All kinds of trouble ensue. Don't expect any noble characters or heroic actions from this movie; watch it to enjoy the spectacle of people behaving mostly -- but not totally -- badly, and doing it in a generally clever and funny way.\nReview Title: Utterly charming and totally British\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

But thanks to modern comforts like plastic surgery, Tamara's blossomed into a beauty and successful writer. When she returns to Ewedown, she manages to turn the entire tiny town on its ear. The cast is first rate, including Roger Allam as Nicholas, a bestselling novelist and randy old goat who cheats on his long-suffering wife, Beth (Tamsin Greig), who runs the writers' retreat that centers on Nicholas and his giant ego. Tamara attracts the attention of her childhood pal Andy (Luke Evans) and an annoying rock drummer, Ben (Dominic Cooper), as well as the distasteful Nicholas.

Post-plastic-surgery, the gorgeous Tamara Drewe comes home to her boring rural village -- ostensibly to fix up and sell her deceased mother's house, but also to show up everyone who was cruel to her when she was a bright, angry teenager with an outsize nose. One of those people was her writer neighbor, a serial adulterer who reigns over the fawning guests at the farm/writer's colony actually run by his devoted and ultra-capable wife.

It might have been almost watchable if it had starred, say, Meg Ryan, whose sometimes irritating cuteness might have lightened up the heroine's basically dour and unpleasant personality. Instead we're sentenced to two hours of the dreadful Kate Capshaw. It's not necessarily that she's a bad actress; she just seems like an awful person. Ellen DeGeneres isn't much more fun to watch. And the solution to the mystery of the love letter is not merely ridiculous; it's insultingly stupid.<br />Tom Selleck, as always, lights up the screen (too bad he's only on it for about 15 minutes), and the other supporting players are fine as well. And the scenes of New England are pretty. Maybe an enterprising fan will find a way to digitally insert them into a better movie.\nReview Title: Blech!\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Serendipity\nReview Date: 2002/07/15\nStore: John Cusack  (Actor),     Kate Beckinsale  (Actor),     Peter Chelsom  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Studio Specials, Miramax Home Entertainment, All Titles\nProduct Description: [\"Irresistible stars John Cusack (AMERICA'S SWEETHEARTS, HIGH FIDELITY) and Kate Beckinsale (PEARL HARBOR, BROKEDOWN PALACE) are drawn together and take a chance on love in this critically acclaimed romantic comedy!

And Kate Beckinsale is reliably interesting, as well as beautiful. So I can't figure out how they wound up in this half-hearted loser of a movie. In addition to numerous irritating implausibilities (starting with Cusack not knowing the definition of \"serendipity\"), the main characters have no, well, characteristics, beyond their obsession with each other. Cusack ultimately treats the woman in his life horribly, but we're supposed to forgive him because he does it all for true love. Yuck. It's a shame, because this promised to be the kind of fluffy New York love story we all needed this past year. It seems as if either the movie got edited to death after production, or the writer just didn't care enough to make the story interesting in the first place--I can't tell which.<br />In any case, \"Serendipity\" turns out to be a sad waste of time and talent. If you're a Cusack fan, get \"Say Anything,\"  \"High Fidelity,\" \"The Grifters,\" or even \"Grosse Pointe Blank.\" If Beckinsale's the one you want to watch, try \"Haunted,\" \"Cold Comfort Farm,\" \"Last Days of Disco,\" or even \"Brokedown Palace.\"\nReview Title: A depressing waste of some fine actors.\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Kate & Leopold\nReview Date: 2002/07/15\nStore: Meg Ryan  (Actor),     Hugh Jackman  (Actor),     James Mangold  (Director, Writer)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Studio Specials, Miramax Home Entertainment, All Titles\nProduct Description: [\"Meg Ryan (YOU'VE GOT MAIL) and Hugh Jackman (X-MEN) are paired as star-crossed lovers who discover that passion and chivalry never go out of style!

And Liev Schreiber is very funny.  But it suffers from a bad case of Meg Ryan wrinkling up her adorable little nose and sighing at her hellish, though expensive, life.<br />It's also one of these new movies that specializes in insulting the intelligence of its audience. An example: the \"villain\" (a confused character played by Bradley Whitford--he's supposed to be bad, but I'm pretty sure he's not supposed to be an idiot) gets caught lying about an opera he hasn't really seen. Here's the thing: Many, many people in New York City (not just incredibly rich ones) love opera. If you don't know the plot of an opera, there's no point in lying about it, because the chances of getting caught are very high. But, apparently, the people who made this movie believe that the potential audience of this movie thinks that opera is only ever watched by upper-class snobs. And of course, in the end, true love conquers all, which in this case means the woman gives up everything she's worked for all her life, not to mention all her family and friends, to be with her man.<br />I can't say I didn't enjoy watching this movie.

Their feedback reveals a disdain for mediocre performances, especially when portrayed by actors they consider capable, indicating a distinct preference for quality in casting.\n\nAcross their purchases, there\u2019s a mix of sensitivity to price and an inclination towards established titles, hinting at a balance between seeking good value and a tendency to invest in known, successful films. The individual appreciates quality cinematography and well-crafted narratives but can overlook flaws if the overall experience is enjoyable.\n\nOverall, their core preferences suggest a love for clever, character-driven romantic comedies that maintain a balance of humor and emotional resonance, while also demonstrating a critical view of cinematic execution when expectations are not met.",
