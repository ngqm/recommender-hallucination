My only complaint would be there was too much unnecessary language but was willing to lower my standards for some entertainment that did not focus on the sexual relationships of the characters. What planet do these people live in that in a professional setting they swear in every sentence. Considering that they portray educated people, surely they use more articulate language to express their feelings.<br /><br />Season 2  however was just too much. Too much drama, too much personal angst and definitely too visually inappropriate in the last episode. I never want to watch other people have sex and if this is the direction the show continues to take, this is the end of me watching this series.\nReview Title: Sad at the turn of events\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2013/07/30\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Graeme Harper', 'Euros Lyn', 'Jamie Magnus Stone', 'Douglas Mackinnon', 'Rachel Talalay', 'James Strong', 'Charlie Palmer', 'James Hawes', 'Joe Ahearne', 'Toby Haynes'], 'Starring': ['Christopher Eccleston', 'Billie Piper'], 'Studio': ['BBC America']}\nReview Text: I tend to like shows that are a little on the odd side and with characters that are unusual so this show fit the bill.
