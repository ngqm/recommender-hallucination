A distant gal-pal told me she had started this and said \"Shannon, this odd bump is protruding from my face! It's my CHIN!\"(she is hilarious)<br />I decided to give it a try. Previously, I had watched maybe 5 minutes of Tae Bo, 2 of a Richard Simmons, and seconds of an overpriced infomercial one. WOW! I LOVE this! It is for a beginner, others may find it too low cardio. For me it is a fun dance that someone sweetly talks you through. Great camerawork, and as Ms H says, it's most important to have fun. At last, a workout that you feel great about it AND yourself, no matter what level. You also can't help but feel beautiful and powerful with these sensual movements. And I don't need to move furniture, unless I want to, lol! That means you can download it to your travel computer (SO easy with Amazon's video library) and do it at a hotel. This was my first try at Amazon's library feature, if you haven't tried it, it is TERRIFIC!<br />But back to this video...her voice is like silk, which is important if you plan on watching over and over. This is a wonderful way to start moving if you are very large or have been inactive for a long time because it is very easy to adapt to anyone's limitations. By the same token, as you progress, it's just as easy to kick it up. All this for less than the price of one class!\nReview Title: A BEGINNERS Delight!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Elf (DVD)\nReview Date: 2014/03/29\nStore: Jon Favreau  (Director),     Leon Redbone  (Actor),     Will Ferrell  (Actor)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Holidays & Seasonal, Christmas, Comedy\nProduct Description: ['Product Description', \"This hilarious Christmas film tells the tale of a young orphan child who mistakenly crawls into Santa's bag of gifts on Christmas Eve and is transported back to the North Pole and raised as an elf.

They hold all of the legal strings to do so, as this was before any recognition, be it civil union or marriage, could be given the couple.<br /><br />Hannah is a flawed woman, not always rising to the occasion for Rachel, played beautifully by the luminous Ann Hagemann (The Showdown, Fall Away). The film captures the viewer as the history and current turmoil is told, however, the ending was slightly reworked, and not for the better. Sadly, at the final few moments, it sinks to a bit of hokey, in my opinion.<br /><br />The acting, the story, so much of this film is good. It could have been better, but still worth a watch.<br /><br />As a bit of an aside, many of the actors and participants worked for less than their usual fee because they felt the story was important. Ms. Gless, who has long been married to Cagney & Lacey creator Barney Rosenzweig, has never forgotten her gay fan base.<br />At a time when so many are only 'in it for the money', being a part of this project was a privilege.\nReview Title: Worth Watching, up to a point\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Swing Dance Instructions on DVD: Beginner's Swing Volume 1, A Step-by-Step Guide\nReview Date: 2015/02/10\nStore: Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Movies\nAverage Rating: 5.0\nProduct Details: {'Media Format': 'DVD'}\nReview Text: I don't think there is a more fun type of music than swing, the only music peppy enough to get a war torn world from the 1940s up and dancing.<br /><br />It's even more fun to DANCE swing!<br />I took a few ballroom and tango lessons many, many years ago, way before Dancing with the Stars was even conceived.

They hold all of the legal strings to do so, as this was before any recognition, be it civil union or marriage, could be given the couple.<br /><br />Hannah is a flawed woman, not always rising to the occasion for Rachel, played beautifully by the luminous Ann Hagemann (The Showdown, Fall Away).

It could have been better, but still worth a watch.<br /><br />As a bit of an aside, many of the actors and participants worked for less than their usual fee because they felt the story was important.

A distant gal-pal told me she had started this and said \"Shannon, this odd bump is protruding from my face! It's my CHIN!\"(she is hilarious)<br />I decided to give it a try. Previously, I had watched maybe 5 minutes of Tae Bo, 2 of a Richard Simmons, and seconds of an overpriced infomercial one. WOW! I LOVE this! It is for a beginner, others may find it too low cardio. For me it is a fun dance that someone sweetly talks you through. Great camerawork, and as Ms H says, it's most important to have fun. At last, a workout that you feel great about it AND yourself, no matter what level. You also can't help but feel beautiful and powerful with these sensual movements. And I don't need to move furniture, unless I want to, lol! That means you can download it to your travel computer (SO easy with Amazon's video library) and do it at a hotel. This was my first try at Amazon's library feature, if you haven't tried it, it is TERRIFIC!<br />But back to this video...her voice is like silk, which is important if you plan on watching over and over. This is a wonderful way to start moving if you are very large or have been inactive for a long time because it is very easy to adapt to anyone's limitations. By the same token, as you progress, it's just as easy to kick it up.
