My mom liked it and she and I would watch every episode when it originally aired, particularly the one where Lee and Amanda finally got married. I don't have a DVR or enough time in the day to hunt and search for the episodes, which many times air out of order. Can we get this on DVD?<br /><br />Here is a really, super smart idea.<br /><br />Anyone ready for this one?<br /><br />Take pre-orders. Release the ENTIRE SHOW on DVD, then send it out to those who have pre-ordered it. That makes a lot of sense. Why am I seeing some new series, which haven't been on but even 1-2 seasons, before they are out on DVD.<br /><br />Sopranos? NIP/TUCK? These series are still being aired with new episodes weekly. I know they are popular, but come on, this show was good too.<br /><br />How hard can this be? There are a lot of people that like the series, and want to see it again. There was a time I had to wait 2 years in between the time it was on one station in syndication before it came back on another station.<br /><br />AS OF 3/9/2010....<br /><br />This series has been released on DVD. The earlier review was written 3 years ago. I had actually forgot I had written a review of this until I went to review it and it gave me the option to EDIT, and EDIT I shall.<br /><br />I still give it 5 stars. The network and production company did great by it, or as best as they could; given it's age. It has been over 20 years since it has been on and I bet the original tape/film is not as good as it once was, but it isn't as bad as it could be either.<br /><br />But don't look for extras--out takes, commentaries, promo commercials or even a \"behind the scenes\"; because it isn't on this wonderful 5 disc set. I say wonderful because the packaging is awesome. It is one jewel case with single sided DVDs which take no more room than at best 2 DVDs on the shelf, which goes into a cardboard sleeve. It comes with a booklet to explain each episode and the characters. The DVD artwork is good. The DVDs are clearly marked and the \"menu\" screen is simple. You can play ALL episodes at once or select individual ones.<br /><br />As far as the quality, it might not have been digitally remastered as you can literally see the \"scratches\" in the file. The DVDs play without skipping and the episodes are just as wonderful as I remember them being.<br /><br />If you love the series, here it is. I can not wait for the rest of the seasons and hope they are as quickly released as Nash Bridges has been.\nReview Title: Scarecrow & Mrs King Needs To Be (IS FINALLY) On DVD\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: CSI: Miami: Season 1\nReview Date: 2007/12/13\nStore: David Caruso  (Actor),     Emily Procter  (Actor),     Bryan Spicer  (Director),     Charles Correll  (Director)    &                   1                  more   Rated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Paramount Home Entertainment, Drama\nProduct Description: ['Product Description', 'David Caruso, Emily Procter, Kim Delaney.

Having lived here most of my life, I didn't see anything interesting about it.<br /><br />So, when CSI: Crime Scene Investigation came along, I decided to give it a try and see what it had to offer. Maybe it would be interesting, after all I enjoyed Profiler until it was cancelled; and this was similiar, yet only to a point.<br /><br />30 minutes into CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, I fell asleep. And, each time I would watch the episodes, I'd nod off. After a few times, I gave it up. (Nothing personal to the cast, but they were not that interesting).<br /><br />But to each their own. If one likes it and another doesn't; it doesn't make it a wrong choice, just personal choices and certainly you shouldn't be comparing the way something is done in one city to what is done in another. We are all looking for something different when we watch TV, and that fuels the choices we make.<br /><br />In 2002, another CSI was coming out, this time with David Caruso as the lead actor and set in Miami. I was thinking Miami Vice with David Caruso; not a pretty sight, but worth a try.<br /><br />Tried it I did, and got hooked (so hooked I own season 1-4 on DVD) and watch it whenever time permits.<br /><br />Here I am, now 5 years later, looking forward to getting season 5 on DVD (I have to wait until Christmas cause someone in my family decided it'd be funny to give it to me as a gift).<br /><br />I find the characters compelling and more approachable, the kind of people you'd call for help.<br /><br />Yes (biting my own tongue), that even includes Caruso's \"Horatio Caine\"; one of the best characters on the series. Tough when he has to be, compassionate where it warrants, never once forgetting about the families that are left behind. That to me is his only concern, and that is where it should be. It's that commitment I am attracted to.<br /><br />Yes, he threatens dirtbags (oh my favorite parts of the episodes), but think about this, you would want Caine on your side to find your loved one's killer and would want him to do everything he could to ensure justice was done. No, you wouldn't like it if you were guilty of a crime, who would?<br /><br />He's good with women and children, having perhaps too much of a protective instinct, which is lacking in today's society. Maybe that's why some people dislike his character. (Note: Caine's father killed his mother when he was younger, so there might be a reason for his attitude).<br /><br />His tricks or nuances are his way of letting those around him know that he is always thinking, thinking about ways to get one step ahead of the killer and bring him/her to justice. Not to mention those little \"nuances\" make the suspect nervous, if you're guilty he will make you squirm.<br /><br />The science is at times gruesome, then again, murder isn't pretty. We seem to forget that.<br /><br />Alexx talking to the victims reminds us that these were once people too, that they had families, they were not just something that was discarded as trash.<br /><br />We forget too often after people are dead that they were here and touched someone's life. We forget that they were someone's mother, father, daughter, son, brother, sister. They started out their day planning in some cases to come home to all of us, but fate intervened.<br /><br />Alexx reminds us of this, and I personally like it. We need to be reminded of the consequences of greed, corruption and personal desires.<br /><br />As far as Calleigh, Eric, Speed (who I miss in the series) and the rest of the CSI: Miami team, they are a diverse group that reminds us how workplace politics play a crucial role in how outcomes are determined; they have dedicated their lives to putting criminals behind bars and finding closure for the families.<br /><br />Some of the stories are interesting, some make you think, and others are about par for the course when it comes to reality.<br /><br />If you like it, you like it, there is no explaining it; you either have it on DVD or are planning to get it.<br /><br />If you don't like it, no one is making you watch it or buy it, so leave it alone (clothing is clothing, I can dress like a model by buying certain clothes at Walmart). Don't waste your money, you're better off getting something you do like.<br /><br />If you don't like the acting, don't watch it. This is after all--FICTION. The telling of a story that's purpose is to entertain.<br /><br />And, I plan to keep watching as long as it's on.\nReview Title: Quit Picking At It, Like It or Leave It\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: CSI: Miami: Season 2\nReview Date: 2007/12/13\nStore: David Caruso  (Actor),     Emily Procter  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Paramount Home Entertainment, Drama\nProduct Description: ['Actors: Adam Rodriguez, David Caruso, Emily Procter, Khandi Alexander, Rory Cochrane Special Features: Widescreen Format.

Yes, it's a contrived \"we have your kid, you want him back, you pay\" plot and storyline. But, it's how it is played out that makes this movie good entertainment.<br /><br />Now, no \"fictional\" movie is ever going to depict real life. But, suspend the \"reality\" for the movie and you go along for a wild ride. Tom Mullen (Gibson) is an airline executive, built the company from the ground-up, and will do anything to protect it. Kate (Russo) is his wife, who obviously has seen the ups and downs of their life, but has honored her \"for better for worse\" marriage vows. Then, they have a talented and bright child Sean (Brawley Nolte) who isn't too neglected and seems to have adequate child/parent time with each parent.<br /><br />In what we should expect to happen, does indeed happen, the child is taken for ransom. But, it's in the how and the who that really grips us. He is taken from a public place which shows the kidnappers as thumbing their nose under everyone, and shows us we are too complacent in our feelings of security in public places, even during the day.<br /><br />Det. Jimmy Shaker (Sinise) is the ring-leader, and I think his identity coming out sooner is to me part of the whole riddle and scheme of the movie, after all, he has no motive....well he does, but we will get to that later. He seems to be functionally insane. He can function in public, do his job and then he's a psycho on top of it all. How else can you do what he did??<br /><br />After a botched \"money drop\" attempt, Mullen finds himself in a situation where he ponders \"would paying the money really insure my son's safe return\"? And he's right. We know it wouldn't. And he attempts to convince his wife that it's not about the money, it's about getting their son back alive. Once the kidnapper has their money, they have no reassurance if the boy will come back alive, which is the whole point behind paying the ransom, now isn't it?<br /><br />So... since it's all about money, why not turn it into a bounty? Which is what Mullen does. Who wouldn't turn in someone they know for $2 million? Which is what he is counting on, and Shaker didn't. Now Shaker has to keep calm (which he can't do, since his scheme is coming apart at the seems along with everyone he's around) and he's going beserk, while everyone else is trying to abandon the plan.<br /><br />And Shaker doesn't like people \"bailing\" on him. Can anyone say \"psycho\"?<br /><br />Shaker decides to give in, and gives the child back alive, killing all his co-horts in the process. But, it's when his greed gets the better of him he gets found out. Had he followed the plan, likely he would have been sipping margaritas in Mexico, but he had to have to money early and pays the ultimate price. Apparently his meds didn't kick in to save his brain or his life.<br /><br />Yes, Mel Gibson might have over-acted as the father. But since it's fiction who are we to argue with that? I did enjoy the balcony scene where for a moment we thought he was going to jump. After all, he thought he'd killed his son. I was hoping he wouldn't jump, then again Shaker wouldn't have won either, but it didn't happen, which was a good thing.<br /><br />Rene Russo was wonderful as the mother, she had a more realistic charm  in the role, but likely wouldn't have faired as well against Sinise.<br /><br />Gary Sinise was wonderful in the movie as far as the crazy bad guy. He stands out more so in the movie since you're wondering what the heck set this guy off. He can play bad guys just as well as good guys (which is why I just love him in CSI: NY).<br /><br />As Shaker is talking/rambling on, we realize one thing, the motive. He wonderfully explains his motive--he saw criminals everyday getting off by buying their way out of trouble. Mullen had recently done so with the Jackie Brown deal. Since Mullen didn't mind paying to stay out of jail/prison, then why not pay to get his son back?<br /><br />Brawley Nolte did a wonderful job as Sean, and it does tug at your heartstrings to see how he was treated and then when he recognizes his kidnapper's voice.<br /><br />Donnie Wahlberg did a wonderful job as the only friend the kid seemed to have in the whole ordeal, and made him a promise that was eventually carried out.<br /><br />The rest of the cast were wonderful, and I wish I could remember all the actors in this movie.<br /><br />The FBI were portrayed as neutral, they were trying to help the Mullens get their son back, while the father decided to take things into his own hands.  At least it stayed away from \"the FBI saved the day\" plot. The movie played out on it's own, and could have been directed by anyone. The cast seemed to compliment each other.<br /><br />If you have DVR (and you're not paying any extra to record it), record it from a movie channel once, if you like buy it; if not, then save the money, and delete.<br /><br />I for one, am going to get the DVD.\nReview Title: Wow!!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Vegas: Season 1, Vol. 1\nReview Date: 2009/11/03\nStore: Tony Curtis  (Actor),     Judy Landers  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Drama\nProduct Description: ['Handsome, fun loving, private eye, Dan Tanna, drives around Las Vegas in his vintage Thunderbird solving private cases but is also on retainer to a wealthy casino owner to keep crime out of his hotels.

That is the economy, and times we live in. And, it really sucks since we as the consumers suffer as a result. Unfortunately, we the viewers asked for this, so we have to take some responsibility. I have learned to cut out certain things in order to still afford my entertainment...<br /><br />BUT....<br /><br />And, remember, this is my opinion.....not a fact...<br /><br />Buying something like this, the price depends on how bad you really want it....how available it is anywhere else, the quality and the integrity of the merchant. What does owning this series mean to you? It is, in it's own way, a collectible. So that should be taken into consideration.<br /><br />Also, there might be some copyright issues to work out to get all of it on DVD. Let's face it, we all know about the mountains of paperwork required for cars & homes....and we aren't fully informed about what goes into producing older shows, from studios perhaps no longer in business or producers long deceased.<br /><br />An interesting fact, this is produced by CBS entertainment; and correct me if I am wrong--this series aired on ABC when it ran from 1978-1981. I was 2 at the time, but I remember Aaron Spelling being the ABC king with much of his series, even into the early 80's--Love Boat, TJ Hooker, Fantasy Island.....<br /><br />That could be an issue as well.<br /><br />However, this is to review the product itself.<br /><br />For me, yes, $25.99 (which is what I was charged) is well worth it. This series is over 30 years old, never found it's own audience as it followed behind Charlie's Angels. So it was destined to fail by the Powers That Be (PTB). Still, the people who remember it from back then or it's limited run in re-runs appreciate the fact that even some of it is available. I know I do.<br /><br />The DVDs are a great quality, given what the studios have to work with. And even on an HDTV with an HD upgradable DVD player, from a distance they look no worse than newer DVDs. There were no problems with skips, jumps or freezing. The case is around the same size as a standard DVD, which makes storage easy...especially if you have a lot of DVDs.They are snapped into place, so there are no issues with them popping out and moving, though with the shipping services that is not always guaranteed, but mine survived the postal service.<br /><br />All in all, if you want the series and have the money, pick it up. And while it isn't always visually accurate (driving scenes especially) it does what it was meant to do--entertain.\nReview Title: Short Lived on the Screen,  Long Lived in our Hearts\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Nash Bridges: Season 3\nReview Date: 2009/12/28\nStore: Johnson, Don  (Actor),     Marin, Cheech  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Paramount Home Entertainment, Action & Adventure\nProduct Description: ['Nash Bridges', \"(Don Johnson) is a high-action drama about a San Francisco police investigator who deserves his reputation as a topnotch cop, but who's not always so successful when it comes to his personal life.

It dominated my Friday nights from 1996-2001. BUT, this is not what I remembered and we should get a price break on it; however; this is to RATE the item. And, I HATE rating it like I do, cause I loved this series.<br /><br />So, here goes...<br /><br />If I were to rate it based on the action & storylines I remember--I'd be 5 stars.<br /><br />If I were to rate it based on the lack of the music or music changes from the original CBS airings--It'd be NO STARS.<br /><br />Now, I am usually an easy-going person. But, when I want the COMPLETE SERIES or the COMPLETE SEASON, I want it complete & unaltered. That is not what I got. One episode for example--REVELATIONS; is a mess. One of my most favorite episodes of this season and truthfully, the \"new\" ending really sucks.<br /><br />At the end as Nash was driving away in the 'Cuda, you heard Van Morrison's \"Into The Mystic\". I know because I had to call the production office to find the name of the song.<br /><br />Alas, it was replaced by something else and less meaningful. Same as the episode \"Sacraments\"--the song at the end (in the original airing) was Eric Clapton's \"My Father's Eyes\"; again replaced with something less meaningful and to me, degrades the series and what it accomplished. I haven't seen the entire season, but I would bet most of the really great music has been altered. That is what made this series what it was at times--the music.<br /><br />If I were not so dedicated to the series, and didn't want to waste my time recording it on DVR and transferring it to my own DVDS, I would stop ordering future seasons. I am half tempted to do so.....BUT...I asked for it on DVD and as my mother said \"be careful what you wish for\" as well as \"having a thing isn't so pleasing as wanting\"....so I will have to deal with it. I would encourage people who remember the series for what it was to contact Paramount and voice your displeasure, as I intend to do. I thought seasons 1 & 2 were \"over-sights\", clearly it is not.<br /><br />The good things? The packaging is still good--plastic case designed to hold multiple discs, a real space-saving design. The item arrived in great shape and when promised. But don't expect any special features.<br /><br />Overall, I will give it 3 stars; though I hope CBS can quit *crewing up a good thing. If it's the money deal, I would pay more for what I want & remember as opposed to cheap for cheap :)\nReview Title: The series is still good--music sucks\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: NCIS: Season 7 [DVD]\nReview Date: 2010/06/30\nStore: David McCallum  (Actor),     Cote de Pablo  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Action & Adventure\nAverage Rating: 4.9\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Action & Adventure/Television, Television', 'Format': 'AC-3, Color, Dolby, DVD, Subtitled, Widescreen, NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Sean Murray, Mark Harmon, David McCallum, Rocky Carroll, Pauley Perrette, Cote de Pablo, Michael WeatherlySean Murray, Mark Harmon, David McCallum, Rocky Carroll, Pauley Perrette, Cote de Pablo, Michael Weatherly   See more', 'Language': 'English', 'Number Of Discs': '6'}\nReview Text: Ok, now this review might sound strange, BUT.....<br /><br />I am a late comer to NCIS, for several reasons. Over May, feeling a little under the weather and getting tired of all the stuff I already had on DVD, I bought seasons 1-6...I had only watched the shows in re-runs on USA and had occasionally watched some episodes of season 7 online (I had to cancel my TV service).<br /><br />WOW....is all I can say. From the pilot (Yankee White) in season 1 to the episode Aaliyah (season 6); this cast/crew has my attention. And, I guess they're going to keep it for a while. The fact it is character driven, to me as a viewer, is more important than story-driven. It's the people we as viewers attach ourselves to, who we learn to love/hate each week. Who we connect with, some for different reasons.<br /><br />I've had a hate/love relationship with Mark Harmon and his characters through his many projects. Who could forget he played Ted Bundy?<br /><br />Each character has their own place in our hearts....and this is in no particular order.<br /><br />As Leroy Jethro Gibbs, Mark Harmon has got my attention. His team is his family, often he gives into their \"wild ideas\", but he manages to keep them focused, and cares about them; such as seen in season 7's \"Flesh and Blood\" where at the end, he and DiNozzo share a steak and drink a beer almost like a father & son to show that blood isn't the only thing that connects people as family. Our family are the people we allow into our world, to share our lives with.<br /><br />Moving on to Ziva David; she's an enigma of sorts. She was a trained assassin, but has come to be such an asset of the team and has provided an interesting glimpse into how our American culture is still mis-understood. She has good instincts, a good heart and I believe she cares about the team as her family, such as in the season 7, episode 1 \"Truth or Consequences\"; she was prepared to die, she didn't want McGee or DiNozzo to risk their lives for her; though down the road she apologized to DiNozzo and appreciates his efforts in trying to watch out for her, meaning she is learning to adapt, showing we can change what we have turned into.<br /><br />Timothy McGee has truly come a long way since being a \"probie\" in seasons 1-2; as far as partners go, I prefer the McGee/DiNozzo pairing. McGee has stepped out from the \"geeky\" kid he was and can hold his own, thanks to DiNozzo's tricks and taunts. He is still the brains, but he has developed a personality and has the heart of a lion. The little brother who can dish it out as well, if not sometimes, better than taking it.<br /><br />Abby is still Abby, lol. What can be said about her we don't know. Don't let her clothes fool you. She's excellent in her field. The \"little\" sister of the family, who displayed such emotion when Ziva was rescued, we thought this was a family. Abby is the perpetual ray of sunshine who, even though science might tell her one thing, is prepared to see the other side.<br /><br />Moving on to Dr. Donald \"Ducky\" Mallard. Where do I start with him? He's the kindly grandfather or uncle in the whole mix and shows us that he has the best/worst job of the team. He sees the worst in humanity with the bodies brought before him, but he always teaches us that the dead do talk to us, though not the way we're used to. He shows care and compassion when doing his job, and he is an essential part of the team. He is thorough in his job and even gives Jethro a few good zings to keep him in place. Ducky reminds us there is always something we don't know and if we're in doubt, keep looking. His stories keep us entertained, but provide some kind of lesson in there.<br /><br />Director Vance...while a good guy in this, I don't hold to having the \"boss\" in the mix. He's good, don't get me wrong. I wouldn't be him for the world. Sorry, no knock on the actor, but seriously, most of us don't like our bosses. So he is in the worst position possible, though he tries to make the best of it. And, amazingly he surprises us most of the time. But still, don't like too much of the bureaucrats' involvement.<br /><br />Let's not forget, one of the key members of this team, and next to Gibbs...last, but not least...<br /><br />NCIS Very Special (Senior) Agent Anthony DiNozzo. Yes, I know he's a goof-ball to some, but have you ever really observed him? He's the \"perfect\" guy (at least for this girl, lol)...he has a steady and not too shabby job, a sense of humor, an unparalleled dedication to his co-workers, good looks (very easy on the eyes), romantic, charming..and when he gets down to business, absolutely the best investigator on the team, again, next to Gibbs.<br /><br />DiNozzo is the eternal \"frat boy\", but at the same time, I don't think I would get on his bad side. While he might hide behind the face of a clown, DiNozzo has \"been there, done that\" and it's his sense of humor that holds the balance to sanity with the demands of his job. He's seen the worst of the worst, and the job is stressful, so his goofiness is key to \"keeping it together\". He can be a bit unconventional, but if he were like Gibbs, he'd be....well Gibbs. DiNozzo also has a soft and kind heart, though he wants to hide it; particularly in \"Flesh and Blood\" where he paid his father's bill & \"Obsession\" where his obsession to find the woman led him to call her, and the team was able to figure out what happened. DiNozzo stayed with her until she died, proving he is human after all.<br /><br />He too has grown up since the first season, but not at the rate he should have, lol. Then again, would we want him to change? I know I don't. And trust me, I was schooled in coming around to being a \"DiNozzo Girl\". He is who is his, he does his job and if that satisfies Gibbs, we don't question Gibbs.<br /><br />All in all, this isn't just another \"crime procedural/drama\". This show goes ABOVE that level. I still love CSI: NY and CSI: Miami, just not as much as NCIS. Gibbs, Ziva, McGee, Abby, Ducky and Tony DiNozzo have become part of our culture and part of our family.<br /><br />They're still going good at 7 seasons, and at this rate....here is to 7 more (and hopefully more).<br /><br />I'm glad I only have to wait two months to get it....otherwise we'd have a rule coming up on that one. I can hold off on CSI: NY and Miami (and in that order). But, mess with my NCIS...might have to invoke a GIBBS RULE.<br /><br />ADDED on 9/8/2010:<br /><br />As of note; the two-part \"starter\" episodes of JAG (Ice Queen & Meltdown are what I call a \"starter-pilot\") they are still \"Official\" \"JAG\" episodes as \"NCIS\" goes...Yankee White can be considered the Pilot as well. Some series do that. Yankee White is still considered as \"Episode 1\" :)...just as the NCIS: LA Pilot or \"starter\" episodes are still NCIS :)<br /><br />And, I have had no performance issues with the DVDs and I own all 7 seasons.\nReview Title: NCIS, best show out there :) **MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS**\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: CSI: Miami: Season 8\nReview Date: 2010/10/17\nStore: Adam Rodriguez  (Actor),     Jonathan Togo  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Paramount Home Entertainment, Boxed Sets\nProduct Description: [\"Join lead criminalist Horatio Caine (David Caruso) and his state-of-the-art forensics team as they investigate hot and steamy Miami crimes using cold hard facts.

IF YOU DON'T LIKE CSI: MIAMI AT ALL, DON'T WATCH IT AND DON'T BUY IT.<br /><br />IF YOU LIKE THE SERIES AND THE CHARACTERS, YOU MIGHT WANT TO PICK THIS UP.<br /><br />Now, that I've clarified a few things...<br /><br />This is the 2nd CSI franchise and FOR ME, is slightly better than the first one, though I tend to like CSI: NY more. Here is my order: CSI: NY & CSI: Miami, the original does not interest me, can not get into it, so I don't watch it, or make a negative review about it.<br /><br />All said and done, this review is about the item, not the series or the season itself.<br /><br />This season does feature some major cast/character changes, and those die-hards who want to hold on to their attachments to certain characters will be disappointed; but the producers seem to get some of it it sorted out by the end; at least with the return of Eric Delko.<br /><br />I won't get into any spoilers as some might not have been able to see the entire season.<br /><br />I will say that the story-lines were interesting, especially the CSI Trilogy crossover which is included in this set (DISC 3) and YES, every episode is included in this season set (CSI: MIAMI \"Bone Voyage\"/CSI: NY \"Hammer Down\"/CSI \"The Lost Girls\") which makes this DVD set a must get for the CSI: Miami fan.<br /><br />Unlike with the CSI: MIAMI/NY crossovers where you had to buy both series to have them completed...you do not need to get all three series for the crossover. It appears the trilogy is included on CSI season 10, but I am not sure if it is included on CSI: NY season 6 though.<br /><br />I am sure if you like all three series, having all the episodes on the discs 3x seems redundant, however if you're like me and only like 1 or 2 of the franchise, it makes it easier by having them all on on particular series' DVD set. Again, it is personal preference and you might not want to spend upwards to $150 ($50 each or less with shipping) to get the trilogy completed. So this makes a good value in that sense.<br /><br />As far as the \"product\"; the case this time around is 1 piece hard plastic snap case (slightly thicker than a standard DVD case) with all the discs in \"divided\" flip-sections (can't really explain it any better, sorry). The episodes are listed on the DVDs as well as on the \"insert\" in the case.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the series, you'll want to add this to your collection, if not, pass it up. All in all I think the producers and the manufacturer spent their time with this and it is quite an addition to your CSI: Miami collection.\nReview Title: CSI: Miami Season 8; not great, but pretty good\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Vegas: Season 2, Volume Two\nReview Date: 2011/03/29\nStore: Bart Braverman  (Actor),     Robert Urich  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Paramount Home Entertainment, Action & Adventure\nProduct Description: ['In this popular series, handsome, fun loving, private eye, Dan Tanna, drives around Las Vegas in his vintage Thunderbird solving private cases but is also on retainer to a wealthy casino owner to keep crime out of his hotels.

However, given the fact that this TV show began and ended 30 years ago, this is a rare collector's item. It's kind of like \"what would you pay for a rare collectible\"?? Also, remember this series aired on ABC, notice it's CBS Entertainment bringing it out, so that could be taken into consideration as to why it is being manufactured the way it is.<br /><br />But, since this isn't a \"price\" review, but \"product\" review, that is where I am heading....<br /><br />This, like the previous seasons/parts are in a space saving case with 3 DVDs and 11 episodes. Don't expect any extras, remember this was a short-lived series from the 1970's, that I personally don't think was marketed to it's potential. Two of the main stars are gone so there isn't a chance for any interviews or reunions. There are no episodes listed on the DVDs but they are listed on the inside of case insert (sorry I can't describe it any better).<br /><br />If you like the series, I would recommend buying it. Although today's cop/detective shows are more advanced, this is a great blast from the past and reminders of what Las Vegas used to look like.\nReview Title: Blast From The Past\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: NCIS: Season 11\nReview Date: 2014/08/28\nStore: Rocky Carroll  (Actor),     Mark Harmon  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Drama\nProduct Description: ['Season 11 of the hard-hitting drama NCIS takes action to greater heights.

If anyone has followed the news, you can tell how toxic the situation is on both sides. The actress, a week before filming, gave notice she wouldn't be back for the new season.<br /><br />That part has permeated Facebook, Twitter, and CBS in comments that every week are mostly: \"Bring Back Cote/Ziva\". Her replacement or rather a new NCIS team member was added with Emily Wickersham who portrays NSA Analyst Ellie Bishop, in a true \"probie\" role. She is quirky and analytical. Watching the behind the scenes special features, you can tell that Wickersham has been welcomed by the cast and crew, and does a great job in acting as a probie would - uncertain, aloof, and curious.<br /><br />She was created to be different from Ziva, as well as Kate. Given the fact of how much re-writing and planning had to be done at the last minute ... this cast (and crew) pulled it off beautifully!!<br /><br />This season also introduces us to a new NCIS spinoff ... New Orleans.<br /><br />This is the season where I had to mostly watch it online. I only missed three episodes, but now that I have the DVDs ... I'm caught up. If you haven't seen it, sorry, but there will be spoilers here.<br /><br />These are a few of my favorite episodes from this season:<br /><br />\"Past, Present, and Future\" - Ziva fans will love this choice (though they may not), and those who are sick to death over the fall-out will blast me (though they may praise me). Either way, the reasons are clear ... the lesson of cutting ties to a past life, even if it had several good moments. It served as a proper goodbye and in essence a \"full-circle\" to where her life began. Where her life might have been different. It shows us the choices we make and how we alone are responsible for our past, present, and future. A fitting end to a character who, I feel, her story was winding down after the death of her father.  He was her last Mossad connection. Given some of the protocol she fouled up on, this was the best ending.<br /><br />\"Under the Radar\" - The fans, who have taken to Twitter with good and bad things to say about NCIS, were at least rewarded/mentioned by way of this one. The team takes to Twitter to find an airplane with a C4 bomb. By using a \"hashtag\", the team is able to locate the plane and predict the course. This is the first episode without Ziva and it seems the team is doing well. They know about life's struggles, so they put it together. Being that they are representing a REAL agency (NCIS), they don't have time to count losses - pick up the pieces and move on. Roma Maffia (Profiler, Nip/Tuck) stops by, has us laughing, and exits with flair (thanks to DiNozzo).<br /><br />\"Once a Crook\" - This is a tricky DiNozzo-centric one. But, we learn more about his troubled past in Baltimore, while he was in uniform. We see where the need to save people comes from. The death of a Petty Officer brings DiNozzo face to face with someone from his past. Someone he tried to help, but couldn't. He finally makes his peace with Anton, who is apprehended for the Baltimore crime.  He also brings up \"Ziva\" and how her absence has been felt. While the team feels it, they have to move forward.<br /><br />\"Devil's Triad\" - Fornell, Gibbs, and Diane? What more needs to be said? The scenes in the car with Fornell and Gibbs are hilarious! The relationship with Fornell and Gibbs is so complex, and then there is Diane. At the end, poor Tobias gets suckered into getting back with Diane. Also, we see their daughter and how she reacts to her parents' relationship.<br /><br /> \"Crescent City\" - Parts One & Two<br /><br />These serve as the back-door pilots for NCIS: New Orleans. Normally I don't like \"back-door\" pilots. Though I understand the reason for them, for me, there is always too much going on in them to keep it all together. However, this two-parter is exciting from the word go. We get equal parts NCIS and equal parts of NOLA.<br /><br />The case involves a dead congressman who was part of the \"Fed-Five\". Mike Franks is mentioned, and we learn about Gibbs and Pride as \"probies\". It turns out one of the older agents framed the now deceased \"Privileged\" killer that was incarcerated. Between both the D.C and NOLA teams, they find out who the real killer was/is.<br /><br />This back-door pilot seems much more cohesive than \"Legend\" (NCIS: LA) from season six (6). I am definitely looking forward to the series premiere of NCIS: New Orleans.<br /><br />Moving on ...<br /><br />Next up:<br /><br />\"The Admiral's Daughter\" - This shows Tony at his absolute best! He's responsible for bringing an Admiral's wayward daughter home, which isn't easy for DiNozzo as he is suspected of murder (for what, the third ... fourth time). But, he soon finds himself running through France with the daughter as they stay ahead of a corrupt French Inspector. As it turns out, the daughter is working for the U.S. government and her father has no idea.<br /><br />\"Honor Thy Father\" (season finale) - When Ralph Waite passed on February 13, 2014, it was hard to imagine how NCIS could ever write this in. For shows that use death to get rid of characters, the task wasn't easy. Vance told Gibbs about his father's death, which meant Gibbs had to travel to Stillwater. Back in \"Better Angels\", Gibbs had asked his dad to move in with him. The older Gibbs still had some fight to him. This was a touching tribute to Papa Gibbs. And, the episode didn't end on a cliff-hanger. Beautiful episode.<br /><br />Out of 24 episodes and missing a few ... having eight (8) ultimate favorites, this makes this season as one of my FAVORITES of NCIS. Normally I average around four to five (4-5) ULTIMATE favorites.<br /><br />Most complaints or reviews center on the departure of Cote de Pablo and the addition of Emily Wickersham. Some say the ratings have gone down, but NCIS was just awarded the Golden Nymph for being the most watched show worldwide. So, the show is barely on the way out as some are claiming. In fact, the ratings are still \"solid\".<br /><br />In addition, season 10 (last with de Pablo) ended with 21.34 million viewers, whereas seasons 11 ended with 19.77 million, a drop of only 1.5 million from season 10. That is only a drop of less than 10% of the viewers. However, after season three (3) the series had two straight years of drops in viewership going from 15.27 million at the end of the third to 14.41 at the end of the fifth. Seasons 7 (19.33 million), 8 (19.46 million), 9 (19.49 million) only saw minor upticks year to year in viewership.<br /><br />Season 11 is ABOVE seasons 7-9 in terms of viewership. Only season 10 stood out as the highest rated season since the series began in 2003-2004. Obviously the cast and crew are doing something right.<br /><br />Being odd and quirky myself, and having my own \"style\" of working, I liked Emily Wickersham's \"Ellie Bishop\" right off. Since she was introduced in episode nine (9), fifteen episodes didn't really give the writers time to smooth things over. After all, it took some of us several years to appreciate other characters as well. I agree Bishop needs some fine-tuning, so I am interested to see how she develops in season 12.<br /><br />With regard to the packaging, same as the last eleven (11) seasons - slim line, light, paperboard package, with slim line plastic cases housing two (2) DVDs per case.<br /><br />Normally I don't watch special features, but there is a great tribute to Ralph Waite, how they went about casting for Ellie Bishop, how they changed directions to begin production on time, plus some great tidbits about the new soundtrack. This is \"jam-packed\" with behind the scenes videos.<br /><br />Given the numbers, this particular season stands out among the highest rated, preceded ONLY by season 10. I'm definitely giving this season - five stars.\nReview Title: Best Season of the Series!!

Baywatch premiered in April 1989 and enjoyed a successful run throughout the '90s before coming to an end in 2001.

This Region 0/Non-region specific DVD set is riddled with problems. And, I don\u2019t know where to begin as some may find the \u201cissues\u201d I\u2019ve listed in a different order of importance.<br /><br />To note: I do like Baywatch. I enjoyed the NBC (1989-1990) season (the one shown on this page) much more (actually loved that season), and hung around for Season 2 on Fox (1991-1992). I didn\u2019t watch past season three (3) though. So I\u2019m not Baywatch bashing. This review isn\u2019t based on the series, but the quality of the DVD set (this product).<br /><br />I will say this \u2013 first off \u2026 no closed captioning for the deaf/hard of hearing or other language subtitles. Those who are deaf/hard of hearing will not be able to watch or enjoy this (unless they have other equipment to caption it).<br /><br />As I only speak/understand English the lack of language selection wasn\u2019t a problem for me, however others needing French or Spanish (which seem to be the most popular for DVDs) subtitles will not be able to enjoy this set.<br /><br />If those are a problem \u2026 sadly, you will want to avoid this set. That loses a star for me.<br /><br />** Second problem? Loss of another star \u2026<br /><br />Lack of an episode listing guide. Most DVD sets have a guide as to what is on the DVD (and in what order), even if it is on the INSIDE of the liner. This doesn\u2019t. No episode listing on the discs either. There was no separate booklet or outside box issued \u2013 just the plastic case wrapped in plastic wrap. There are two discs which have some episodes out of order, at least when comparing it to IMDB (which has it listed by air date, as does Wikipedia). However, the pilot \u2013 \u201cPanic at Malibu Pier\u201d \u2013 is included on disc one.<br /><br />** Third problem?<br /><br />The DVD case. The middle disc holder is a problem. There are seven (7) pretty wide slits that allow dirt and or fingerprints to contaminate the discs. Not a smart move. Also it is a bit rough to get the discs out. If you watch them frequently you might have a huge problem with removal.<br /><br />Moving on \u2026 let\u2019s go with playback. This is where it loses another \u201ccollective\u201d star for me with the following \u2026<br /><br />These are REGION 0/NO REGION discs, and as I am based in the USA, they did register and seemingly play in my DVD player. My laptop recognized DISC #1, but read DISC #2 as BLANK on the first try, on the second it did better. That was a bit concerning. So, if you play DVDs on your computer \u2013 be cautious.<br /><br />Menu Options \u2013 the menu options don\u2019t exist in the way of selecting languages or closed captioning (subtitles). The disc has the individual episodes or a play all function.<br /><br />Extras \u2013 NONE \u2013 there are ZERO extras. Don\u2019t expect any \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d information, interviews, or commentary. As one who enjoys the commentary but it isn\u2019t a deal breaker, it wasn\u2019t a huge deal not to have it. Others who want those things will be disappointed.<br /><br />Quality \u2013 There was NO effort to restore quality in the pilot episode/movie. While I understand the pilot is from April 1989, it looks like it was copied from a VHS tape. The quality for the rest of the episodes isn\u2019t too bad given that the episodes are nearly 30 years old. However it is not as good as it could be though, as some older series have been restored. For a show that ran 10 years and was a \u201cGlobal\u201d hit, this DVD set\u2019s quality is surprising. Even the \u201cKnight Rider\u201d DVDs have more features than this and \u201cKnight Rider\u201d ran from 1982-1986.<br /><br />Sound \u2013 Given the fact this hasn\u2019t been re-mastered, the sound quality isn\u2019t that bad, then again I am not one who likes the \u201ctheater surround sound\u201d deal as I live in an apartment and can\u2019t fully appreciate the feature (nor do I like \u201cloud\u201d things). I didn\u2019t have to blast the sound my HDTV, so that is a good thing. However, sound preferences are different to each person. Something to keep in mind.<br /><br />MUSIC \u2013 To be honest, I don\u2019t remember the season one (1) theme (I\u2019ve read it was Peter Cetera\u2019s \u201cSave Me\u201d). I know that season two (2) was Jim Jamison\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m Always There\u201d (which is not on the season 2, mismarked 1 set that I have). The opening theme from this season is missing from this set. There is a song from \u201cShark Derby\u201d that remains in it at the end. That one I definitely remember.<br /><br />If you can ignore all of these problems and issues; and enjoy the series (particularly this season) \u2013 I\u2019d go ahead and get it. I thoroughly enjoyed re-living some of my childhood and watching these episodes which I remembered more about than I thought (especially since it has been 30 years since it premiered). If the issues/problems I\u2019ve noted are deal-breakers, you may want to steer clear \u2013 particularly on the closed captioning.\nReview Title: No Closed Captioning is Just the Beginning of Issues\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Airwolf - The Complete Series\nReview Date: 2019/09/25\nStore: Jan-Michael Vincent  (Actor),     Ernest Borgnine  (Actor),     Various  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Action & Adventure\nProduct Description: ['Jan-Michael Vincent stars as Stringfellow Hawke, a reclusive renegade pilot who\\'s assigned to top-secret missions for the CIA by the mysterious \"Archangel\" (Alex Cord).

The special effects were fake and embarrassing, the recycled scenes and images could get tiresome, dialogue could be cheesy, and the story-lines were simple if not comical.<br /><br />With that said \u2026<br /><br />I wasn\u2019t really an Airwolf fan. It had an interesting premise. Some of the main actors and guest stars were great in their roles, but this wasn\u2019t my cup of tea. So, I understand someone who may not like the same TV shows I do.<br /><br />Anyway \u2026<br /><br />This review has FAR more to do with the packaging and presentation than a complete critique of the series, scripts, or actors. I got this as a gift for my mom who really liked the series (and since it was in her acceptable price range), I got it.<br /><br />This contains all \u201cfour\u201d seasons. If you\u2019re wondering about why the fourth is different \u2013 please research it via IMDB or Wikipedia.<br /><br />CBS seasons 1 (mid-season replacement), 2, 3:<br /><br />Jan-Michael Vincent (1944-2019) as Stringfellow Hawke<br />Ernest Borgnine (1917-2012) as Dominic \u201cDom\u201d Santini<br />Jean Bruce Scott [seasons 2 & 3] as Caitlin O\u2019Shannessy<br />Alex Cord as Michael Coldsmith Briggs III (Archangel \u2013 The Firm)<br /><br />REALLY bad USA season 4:<br /><br />Barry Van Dyke as St. John Hawke<br />Geraint Wyn Davies as Major. Mike Rivers<br />Michelle Scarabelli as Joanna \u201cJo\u201d Santini<br />Anthony Sherwood as Jason Locke (The Company)<br /><br />The scripts for season 4 were already done when the actors were cast thus no time for character development (this was according to one of the cast members). However, they did a decent job with what they were given. Some stood out more than others. I don\u2019t blame the actors for the BAD season 4 \u2013 I blame the bad special effects, filming style, and scripts.<br /><br />Moving on to the product \u2026<br /><br />The packaging \u2013 awful. Really awful for the amount of CDs in it \u2013 14 total discs. If not carefully packaged, this could arrive crushed from transport. Judging from some photos, it looks like I was blessed to receive this as intact as it is. It \u201cunloads\u201d from the bottom so it is easy to drop them as you open the package, move it, or even by picking it up.<br /><br />The DVDs \u2013<br /><br />They\u2019re two discs to a sleeve and roughly 5-6 episodes per disc. No \u201cepisode information\u201d; and the episodes have no closed captioning at all. There is no language selection \u2013 English only. No special features at all. The menu is basic with two options \u2013 play all or episode selection. That\u2019s it.<br /><br />Sound quality is pretty bad for seasons 1-3, worse on season 4. On my HDTV I had to have it up on 17/18 when I usually listen on 6/7. I don\u2019t have perfect hearing, but I try to select the lowest possible, with closed caption so as not to disturb my neighbors.<br /><br />Picture quality is standard for a 1980\u2019s TV show \u2013 for seasons 1, 2, and 3. Season four, due to how it was filmed has questionable quality. Some parts are quite clear, some are blurry, and some look a bit \u201cfake\u201d. Had I not gotten this directly from Amazon, sold by them, I\u2019d almost think it was bootleg quality.<br /><br />It is acceptable for those who don\u2019t care about special extras such as \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d, commentary, language selection, or closed captioning.<br /><br />If all you want is the series with no extras \u2013 this is it. No frills.<br /><br />For what I paid, which was about $20, it isn\u2019t too bad. In fact, that\u2019s all my mom would let me pay for it \ud83d\ude02 (lol)<br /><br />So, yes the 3-star rating is generous, but also fair.\nReview Title: Not Up To Specs\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

My mom liked it and she and I would watch every episode when it originally aired, particularly the one where Lee and Amanda finally got married. I don't have a DVR or enough time in the day to hunt and search for the episodes, which many times air out of order. Can we get this on DVD?<br /><br />Here is a really, super smart idea.<br /><br />Anyone ready for this one?<br /><br />Take pre-orders. Release the ENTIRE SHOW on DVD, then send it out to those who have pre-ordered it. That makes a lot of sense. Why am I seeing some new series, which haven't been on but even 1-2 seasons, before they are out on DVD.<br /><br />Sopranos? NIP/TUCK? These series are still being aired with new episodes weekly. I know they are popular, but come on, this show was good too.<br /><br />How hard can this be? There are a lot of people that like the series, and want to see it again. There was a time I had to wait 2 years in between the time it was on one station in syndication before it came back on another station.<br /><br />AS OF 3/9/2010....<br /><br />This series has been released on DVD. The earlier review was written 3 years ago. I had actually forgot I had written a review of this until I went to review it and it gave me the option to EDIT, and EDIT I shall.<br /><br />I still give it 5 stars. The network and production company did great by it, or as best as they could; given it's age. It has been over 20 years since it has been on and I bet the original tape/film is not as good as it once was, but it isn't as bad as it could be either.<br /><br />But don't look for extras--out takes, commentaries, promo commercials or even a \"behind the scenes\"; because it isn't on this wonderful 5 disc set. I say wonderful because the packaging is awesome. It is one jewel case with single sided DVDs which take no more room than at best 2 DVDs on the shelf, which goes into a cardboard sleeve. It comes with a booklet to explain each episode and the characters. The DVD artwork is good. The DVDs are clearly marked and the \"menu\" screen is simple. You can play ALL episodes at once or select individual ones.<br /><br />As far as the quality, it might not have been digitally remastered as you can literally see the \"scratches\" in the file. The DVDs play without skipping and the episodes are just as wonderful as I remember them being.<br /><br />If you love the series, here it is. I can not wait for the rest of the seasons and hope they are as quickly released as Nash Bridges has been.\nScarecrow & Mrs King Needs To Be (IS FINALLY) On DVD\nCSI: Miami: Season 1\nDavid Caruso  (Actor),     Emily Procter  (Actor),     Bryan Spicer  (Director),     Charles Correll  (Director)    &                   1                  more   Rated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Paramount Home Entertainment, Drama\n['Product Description', 'David Caruso, Emily Procter, Kim Delaney.

Having lived here most of my life, I didn't see anything interesting about it.<br /><br />So, when CSI: Crime Scene Investigation came along, I decided to give it a try and see what it had to offer. Maybe it would be interesting, after all I enjoyed Profiler until it was cancelled; and this was similiar, yet only to a point.<br /><br />30 minutes into CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, I fell asleep. And, each time I would watch the episodes, I'd nod off. After a few times, I gave it up. (Nothing personal to the cast, but they were not that interesting).<br /><br />But to each their own. If one likes it and another doesn't; it doesn't make it a wrong choice, just personal choices and certainly you shouldn't be comparing the way something is done in one city to what is done in another. We are all looking for something different when we watch TV, and that fuels the choices we make.<br /><br />In 2002, another CSI was coming out, this time with David Caruso as the lead actor and set in Miami. I was thinking Miami Vice with David Caruso; not a pretty sight, but worth a try.<br /><br />Tried it I did, and got hooked (so hooked I own season 1-4 on DVD) and watch it whenever time permits.<br /><br />Here I am, now 5 years later, looking forward to getting season 5 on DVD (I have to wait until Christmas cause someone in my family decided it'd be funny to give it to me as a gift).<br /><br />I find the characters compelling and more approachable, the kind of people you'd call for help.<br /><br />Yes (biting my own tongue), that even includes Caruso's \"Horatio Caine\"; one of the best characters on the series. Tough when he has to be, compassionate where it warrants, never once forgetting about the families that are left behind. That to me is his only concern, and that is where it should be. It's that commitment I am attracted to.<br /><br />Yes, he threatens dirtbags (oh my favorite parts of the episodes), but think about this, you would want Caine on your side to find your loved one's killer and would want him to do everything he could to ensure justice was done. No, you wouldn't like it if you were guilty of a crime, who would?<br /><br />He's good with women and children, having perhaps too much of a protective instinct, which is lacking in today's society. Maybe that's why some people dislike his character. (Note: Caine's father killed his mother when he was younger, so there might be a reason for his attitude).<br /><br />His tricks or nuances are his way of letting those around him know that he is always thinking, thinking about ways to get one step ahead of the killer and bring him/her to justice. Not to mention those little \"nuances\" make the suspect nervous, if you're guilty he will make you squirm.<br /><br />The science is at times gruesome, then again, murder isn't pretty. We seem to forget that.<br /><br />Alexx talking to the victims reminds us that these were once people too, that they had families, they were not just something that was discarded as trash.<br /><br />We forget too often after people are dead that they were here and touched someone's life. We forget that they were someone's mother, father, daughter, son, brother, sister. They started out their day planning in some cases to come home to all of us, but fate intervened.<br /><br />Alexx reminds us of this, and I personally like it. We need to be reminded of the consequences of greed, corruption and personal desires.<br /><br />As far as Calleigh, Eric, Speed (who I miss in the series) and the rest of the CSI: Miami team, they are a diverse group that reminds us how workplace politics play a crucial role in how outcomes are determined; they have dedicated their lives to putting criminals behind bars and finding closure for the families.<br /><br />Some of the stories are interesting, some make you think, and others are about par for the course when it comes to reality.<br /><br />If you like it, you like it, there is no explaining it; you either have it on DVD or are planning to get it.<br /><br />If you don't like it, no one is making you watch it or buy it, so leave it alone (clothing is clothing, I can dress like a model by buying certain clothes at Walmart).

Yes, it's a contrived \"we have your kid, you want him back, you pay\" plot and storyline. But, it's how it is played out that makes this movie good entertainment.<br /><br />Now, no \"fictional\" movie is ever going to depict real life. But, suspend the \"reality\" for the movie and you go along for a wild ride. Tom Mullen (Gibson) is an airline executive, built the company from the ground-up, and will do anything to protect it. Kate (Russo) is his wife, who obviously has seen the ups and downs of their life, but has honored her \"for better for worse\" marriage vows. Then, they have a talented and bright child Sean (Brawley Nolte) who isn't too neglected and seems to have adequate child/parent time with each parent.<br /><br />In what we should expect to happen, does indeed happen, the child is taken for ransom. But, it's in the how and the who that really grips us. He is taken from a public place which shows the kidnappers as thumbing their nose under everyone, and shows us we are too complacent in our feelings of security in public places, even during the day.<br /><br />Det. Jimmy Shaker (Sinise) is the ring-leader, and I think his identity coming out sooner is to me part of the whole riddle and scheme of the movie, after all, he has no motive....well he does, but we will get to that later. He seems to be functionally insane. He can function in public, do his job and then he's a psycho on top of it all. How else can you do what he did??<br /><br />After a botched \"money drop\" attempt, Mullen finds himself in a situation where he ponders \"would paying the money really insure my son's safe return\"? And he's right. We know it wouldn't. And he attempts to convince his wife that it's not about the money, it's about getting their son back alive. Once the kidnapper has their money, they have no reassurance if the boy will come back alive, which is the whole point behind paying the ransom, now isn't it?<br /><br />So... since it's all about money, why not turn it into a bounty? Which is what Mullen does. Who wouldn't turn in someone they know for $2 million? Which is what he is counting on, and Shaker didn't. Now Shaker has to keep calm (which he can't do, since his scheme is coming apart at the seems along with everyone he's around) and he's going beserk, while everyone else is trying to abandon the plan.<br /><br />And Shaker doesn't like people \"bailing\" on him. Can anyone say \"psycho\"?<br /><br />Shaker decides to give in, and gives the child back alive, killing all his co-horts in the process. But, it's when his greed gets the better of him he gets found out. Had he followed the plan, likely he would have been sipping margaritas in Mexico, but he had to have to money early and pays the ultimate price. Apparently his meds didn't kick in to save his brain or his life.<br /><br />Yes, Mel Gibson might have over-acted as the father. But since it's fiction who are we to argue with that? I did enjoy the balcony scene where for a moment we thought he was going to jump. After all, he thought he'd killed his son. I was hoping he wouldn't jump, then again Shaker wouldn't have won either, but it didn't happen, which was a good thing.<br /><br />Rene Russo was wonderful as the mother, she had a more realistic charm  in the role, but likely wouldn't have faired as well against Sinise.<br /><br />Gary Sinise was wonderful in the movie as far as the crazy bad guy. He stands out more so in the movie since you're wondering what the heck set this guy off. He can play bad guys just as well as good guys (which is why I just love him in CSI: NY).<br /><br />As Shaker is talking/rambling on, we realize one thing, the motive. He wonderfully explains his motive--he saw criminals everyday getting off by buying their way out of trouble. Mullen had recently done so with the Jackie Brown deal. Since Mullen didn't mind paying to stay out of jail/prison, then why not pay to get his son back?<br /><br />Brawley Nolte did a wonderful job as Sean, and it does tug at your heartstrings to see how he was treated and then when he recognizes his kidnapper's voice.<br /><br />Donnie Wahlberg did a wonderful job as the only friend the kid seemed to have in the whole ordeal, and made him a promise that was eventually carried out.<br /><br />The rest of the cast were wonderful, and I wish I could remember all the actors in this movie.<br /><br />The FBI were portrayed as neutral, they were trying to help the Mullens get their son back, while the father decided to take things into his own hands.  At least it stayed away from \"the FBI saved the day\" plot. The movie played out on it's own, and could have been directed by anyone. The cast seemed to compliment each other.<br /><br />If you have DVR (and you're not paying any extra to record it), record it from a movie channel once, if you like buy it; if not, then save the money, and delete.<br /><br />I for one, am going to get the DVD.\nWow!!\nVegas: Season 1, Vol. 1\nTony Curtis  (Actor),     Judy Landers  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Drama\n['Handsome, fun loving, private eye, Dan Tanna, drives around Las Vegas in his vintage Thunderbird solving private cases but is also on retainer to a wealthy casino owner to keep crime out of his hotels.

That is the economy, and times we live in. And, it really sucks since we as the consumers suffer as a result. Unfortunately, we the viewers asked for this, so we have to take some responsibility. I have learned to cut out certain things in order to still afford my entertainment...<br /><br />BUT....<br /><br />And, remember, this is my opinion.....not a fact...<br /><br />Buying something like this, the price depends on how bad you really want it....how available it is anywhere else, the quality and the integrity of the merchant. What does owning this series mean to you? It is, in it's own way, a collectible. So that should be taken into consideration.<br /><br />Also, there might be some copyright issues to work out to get all of it on DVD. Let's face it, we all know about the mountains of paperwork required for cars & homes....and we aren't fully informed about what goes into producing older shows, from studios perhaps no longer in business or producers long deceased.<br /><br />An interesting fact, this is produced by CBS entertainment; and correct me if I am wrong--this series aired on ABC when it ran from 1978-1981. I was 2 at the time, but I remember Aaron Spelling being the ABC king with much of his series, even into the early 80's--Love Boat, TJ Hooker, Fantasy Island.....<br /><br />That could be an issue as well.<br /><br />However, this is to review the product itself.<br /><br />For me, yes, $25.99 (which is what I was charged) is well worth it. This series is over 30 years old, never found it's own audience as it followed behind Charlie's Angels. So it was destined to fail by the Powers That Be (PTB). Still, the people who remember it from back then or it's limited run in re-runs appreciate the fact that even some of it is available. I know I do.<br /><br />The DVDs are a great quality, given what the studios have to work with. And even on an HDTV with an HD upgradable DVD player, from a distance they look no worse than newer DVDs. There were no problems with skips, jumps or freezing. The case is around the same size as a standard DVD, which makes storage easy...especially if you have a lot of DVDs.They are snapped into place, so there are no issues with them popping out and moving, though with the shipping services that is not always guaranteed, but mine survived the postal service.<br /><br />All in all, if you want the series and have the money, pick it up. And while it isn't always visually accurate (driving scenes especially) it does what it was meant to do--entertain.\nShort Lived on the Screen,  Long Lived in our Hearts\nNash Bridges: Season 3\nJohnson, Don  (Actor),     Marin, Cheech  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Paramount Home Entertainment, Action & Adventure\n['Nash Bridges', \"(Don Johnson) is a high-action drama about a San Francisco police investigator who deserves his reputation as a topnotch cop, but who's not always so successful when it comes to his personal life.

It dominated my Friday nights from 1996-2001. BUT, this is not what I remembered and we should get a price break on it; however; this is to RATE the item. And, I HATE rating it like I do, cause I loved this series.<br /><br />So, here goes...<br /><br />If I were to rate it based on the action & storylines I remember--I'd be 5 stars.<br /><br />If I were to rate it based on the lack of the music or music changes from the original CBS airings--It'd be NO STARS.<br /><br />Now, I am usually an easy-going person. But, when I want the COMPLETE SERIES or the COMPLETE SEASON, I want it complete & unaltered. That is not what I got. One episode for example--REVELATIONS; is a mess. One of my most favorite episodes of this season and truthfully, the \"new\" ending really sucks.<br /><br />At the end as Nash was driving away in the 'Cuda, you heard Van Morrison's \"Into The Mystic\". I know because I had to call the production office to find the name of the song.<br /><br />Alas, it was replaced by something else and less meaningful. Same as the episode \"Sacraments\"--the song at the end (in the original airing) was Eric Clapton's \"My Father's Eyes\"; again replaced with something less meaningful and to me, degrades the series and what it accomplished. I haven't seen the entire season, but I would bet most of the really great music has been altered. That is what made this series what it was at times--the music.<br /><br />If I were not so dedicated to the series, and didn't want to waste my time recording it on DVR and transferring it to my own DVDS, I would stop ordering future seasons. I am half tempted to do so.....BUT...I asked for it on DVD and as my mother said \"be careful what you wish for\" as well as \"having a thing isn't so pleasing as wanting\"....so I will have to deal with it. I would encourage people who remember the series for what it was to contact Paramount and voice your displeasure, as I intend to do. I thought seasons 1 & 2 were \"over-sights\", clearly it is not.<br /><br />The good things? The packaging is still good--plastic case designed to hold multiple discs, a real space-saving design. The item arrived in great shape and when promised. But don't expect any special features.<br /><br />Overall, I will give it 3 stars; though I hope CBS can quit *crewing up a good thing. If it's the money deal, I would pay more for what I want & remember as opposed to cheap for cheap :)\nThe series is still good--music sucks\nNCIS: Season 7 [DVD]\nDavid McCallum  (Actor),     Cote de Pablo  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Action & Adventure\n{'Genre': 'Action & Adventure/Television, Television', 'Format': 'AC-3, Color, Dolby, DVD, Subtitled, Widescreen, NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Sean Murray, Mark Harmon, David McCallum, Rocky Carroll, Pauley Perrette, Cote de Pablo, Michael WeatherlySean Murray, Mark Harmon, David McCallum, Rocky Carroll, Pauley Perrette, Cote de Pablo, Michael Weatherly   See more', 'Language': 'English', 'Number Of Discs': '6'}\nOk, now this review might sound strange, BUT.....<br /><br />I am a late comer to NCIS, for several reasons. Over May, feeling a little under the weather and getting tired of all the stuff I already had on DVD, I bought seasons 1-6...I had only watched the shows in re-runs on USA and had occasionally watched some episodes of season 7 online (I had to cancel my TV service).<br /><br />WOW....is all I can say. From the pilot (Yankee White) in season 1 to the episode Aaliyah (season 6); this cast/crew has my attention. And, I guess they're going to keep it for a while. The fact it is character driven, to me as a viewer, is more important than story-driven. It's the people we as viewers attach ourselves to, who we learn to love/hate each week. Who we connect with, some for different reasons.<br /><br />I've had a hate/love relationship with Mark Harmon and his characters through his many projects. Who could forget he played Ted Bundy?<br /><br />Each character has their own place in our hearts....and this is in no particular order.<br /><br />As Leroy Jethro Gibbs, Mark Harmon has got my attention. His team is his family, often he gives into their \"wild ideas\", but he manages to keep them focused, and cares about them; such as seen in season 7's \"Flesh and Blood\" where at the end, he and DiNozzo share a steak and drink a beer almost like a father & son to show that blood isn't the only thing that connects people as family. Our family are the people we allow into our world, to share our lives with.<br /><br />Moving on to Ziva David; she's an enigma of sorts. She was a trained assassin, but has come to be such an asset of the team and has provided an interesting glimpse into how our American culture is still mis-understood. She has good instincts, a good heart and I believe she cares about the team as her family, such as in the season 7, episode 1 \"Truth or Consequences\"; she was prepared to die, she didn't want McGee or DiNozzo to risk their lives for her; though down the road she apologized to DiNozzo and appreciates his efforts in trying to watch out for her, meaning she is learning to adapt, showing we can change what we have turned into.<br /><br />Timothy McGee has truly come a long way since being a \"probie\" in seasons 1-2; as far as partners go, I prefer the McGee/DiNozzo pairing. McGee has stepped out from the \"geeky\" kid he was and can hold his own, thanks to DiNozzo's tricks and taunts. He is still the brains, but he has developed a personality and has the heart of a lion. The little brother who can dish it out as well, if not sometimes, better than taking it.<br /><br />Abby is still Abby, lol. What can be said about her we don't know. Don't let her clothes fool you. She's excellent in her field. The \"little\" sister of the family, who displayed such emotion when Ziva was rescued, we thought this was a family. Abby is the perpetual ray of sunshine who, even though science might tell her one thing, is prepared to see the other side.<br /><br />Moving on to Dr. Donald \"Ducky\" Mallard. Where do I start with him? He's the kindly grandfather or uncle in the whole mix and shows us that he has the best/worst job of the team. He sees the worst in humanity with the bodies brought before him, but he always teaches us that the dead do talk to us, though not the way we're used to. He shows care and compassion when doing his job, and he is an essential part of the team. He is thorough in his job and even gives Jethro a few good zings to keep him in place. Ducky reminds us there is always something we don't know and if we're in doubt, keep looking. His stories keep us entertained, but provide some kind of lesson in there.<br /><br />Director Vance...while a good guy in this, I don't hold to having the \"boss\" in the mix. He's good, don't get me wrong. I wouldn't be him for the world. Sorry, no knock on the actor, but seriously, most of us don't like our bosses. So he is in the worst position possible, though he tries to make the best of it. And, amazingly he surprises us most of the time. But still, don't like too much of the bureaucrats' involvement.<br /><br />Let's not forget, one of the key members of this team, and next to Gibbs...last, but not least...<br /><br />NCIS Very Special (Senior) Agent Anthony DiNozzo. Yes, I know he's a goof-ball to some, but have you ever really observed him? He's the \"perfect\" guy (at least for this girl, lol)...he has a steady and not too shabby job, a sense of humor, an unparalleled dedication to his co-workers, good looks (very easy on the eyes), romantic, charming..and when he gets down to business, absolutely the best investigator on the team, again, next to Gibbs.<br /><br />DiNozzo is the eternal \"frat boy\", but at the same time, I don't think I would get on his bad side. While he might hide behind the face of a clown, DiNozzo has \"been there, done that\" and it's his sense of humor that holds the balance to sanity with the demands of his job. He's seen the worst of the worst, and the job is stressful, so his goofiness is key to \"keeping it together\". He can be a bit unconventional, but if he were like Gibbs, he'd be....well Gibbs. DiNozzo also has a soft and kind heart, though he wants to hide it; particularly in \"Flesh and Blood\" where he paid his father's bill & \"Obsession\" where his obsession to find the woman led him to call her, and the team was able to figure out what happened. DiNozzo stayed with her until she died, proving he is human after all.<br /><br />He too has grown up since the first season, but not at the rate he should have, lol. Then again, would we want him to change? I know I don't. And trust me, I was schooled in coming around to being a \"DiNozzo Girl\". He is who is his, he does his job and if that satisfies Gibbs, we don't question Gibbs.<br /><br />All in all, this isn't just another \"crime procedural/drama\". This show goes ABOVE that level. I still love CSI: NY and CSI: Miami, just not as much as NCIS. Gibbs, Ziva, McGee, Abby, Ducky and Tony DiNozzo have become part of our culture and part of our family.<br /><br />They're still going good at 7 seasons, and at this rate....here is to 7 more (and hopefully more).<br /><br />I'm glad I only have to wait two months to get it....otherwise we'd have a rule coming up on that one. I can hold off on CSI: NY and Miami (and in that order). But, mess with my NCIS...might have to invoke a GIBBS RULE.<br /><br />ADDED on 9/8/2010:<br /><br />As of note; the two-part \"starter\" episodes of JAG (Ice Queen & Meltdown are what I call a \"starter-pilot\") they are still \"Official\" \"JAG\" episodes as \"NCIS\" goes...Yankee White can be considered the Pilot as well. Some series do that. Yankee White is still considered as \"Episode 1\" :)...just as the NCIS: LA Pilot or \"starter\" episodes are still NCIS :)<br /><br />And, I have had no performance issues with the DVDs and I own all 7 seasons.\nNCIS, best show out there :) **MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS**\nCSI: Miami: Season 8\nAdam Rodriguez  (Actor),     Jonathan Togo  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Paramount Home Entertainment, Boxed Sets\n[\"Join lead criminalist Horatio Caine (David Caruso) and his state-of-the-art forensics team as they investigate hot and steamy Miami crimes using cold hard facts.

IF YOU DON'T LIKE CSI: MIAMI AT ALL, DON'T WATCH IT AND DON'T BUY IT.<br /><br />IF YOU LIKE THE SERIES AND THE CHARACTERS, YOU MIGHT WANT TO PICK THIS UP.<br /><br />Now, that I've clarified a few things...<br /><br />This is the 2nd CSI franchise and FOR ME, is slightly better than the first one, though I tend to like CSI: NY more. Here is my order: CSI: NY & CSI: Miami, the original does not interest me, can not get into it, so I don't watch it, or make a negative review about it.<br /><br />All said and done, this review is about the item, not the series or the season itself.<br /><br />This season does feature some major cast/character changes, and those die-hards who want to hold on to their attachments to certain characters will be disappointed; but the producers seem to get some of it it sorted out by the end; at least with the return of Eric Delko.<br /><br />I won't get into any spoilers as some might not have been able to see the entire season.<br /><br />I will say that the story-lines were interesting, especially the CSI Trilogy crossover which is included in this set (DISC 3) and YES, every episode is included in this season set (CSI: MIAMI \"Bone Voyage\"/CSI: NY \"Hammer Down\"/CSI \"The Lost Girls\") which makes this DVD set a must get for the CSI: Miami fan.<br /><br />Unlike with the CSI: MIAMI/NY crossovers where you had to buy both series to have them completed...you do not need to get all three series for the crossover. It appears the trilogy is included on CSI season 10, but I am not sure if it is included on CSI: NY season 6 though.<br /><br />I am sure if you like all three series, having all the episodes on the discs 3x seems redundant, however if you're like me and only like 1 or 2 of the franchise, it makes it easier by having them all on on particular series' DVD set. Again, it is personal preference and you might not want to spend upwards to $150 ($50 each or less with shipping) to get the trilogy completed. So this makes a good value in that sense.<br /><br />As far as the \"product\"; the case this time around is 1 piece hard plastic snap case (slightly thicker than a standard DVD case) with all the discs in \"divided\" flip-sections (can't really explain it any better, sorry). The episodes are listed on the DVDs as well as on the \"insert\" in the case.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the series, you'll want to add this to your collection, if not, pass it up.

However, given the fact that this TV show began and ended 30 years ago, this is a rare collector's item. It's kind of like \"what would you pay for a rare collectible\"?? Also, remember this series aired on ABC, notice it's CBS Entertainment bringing it out, so that could be taken into consideration as to why it is being manufactured the way it is.<br /><br />But, since this isn't a \"price\" review, but \"product\" review, that is where I am heading....<br /><br />This, like the previous seasons/parts are in a space saving case with 3 DVDs and 11 episodes. Don't expect any extras, remember this was a short-lived series from the 1970's, that I personally don't think was marketed to it's potential. Two of the main stars are gone so there isn't a chance for any interviews or reunions. There are no episodes listed on the DVDs but they are listed on the inside of case insert (sorry I can't describe it any better).<br /><br />If you like the series, I would recommend buying it. Although today's cop/detective shows are more advanced, this is a great blast from the past and reminders of what Las Vegas used to look like.\nBlast From The Past\nNCIS: Season 11\nRocky Carroll  (Actor),     Mark Harmon  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Drama\n['Season 11 of the hard-hitting drama NCIS takes action to greater heights.

If anyone has followed the news, you can tell how toxic the situation is on both sides. The actress, a week before filming, gave notice she wouldn't be back for the new season.<br /><br />That part has permeated Facebook, Twitter, and CBS in comments that every week are mostly: \"Bring Back Cote/Ziva\". Her replacement or rather a new NCIS team member was added with Emily Wickersham who portrays NSA Analyst Ellie Bishop, in a true \"probie\" role. She is quirky and analytical. Watching the behind the scenes special features, you can tell that Wickersham has been welcomed by the cast and crew, and does a great job in acting as a probie would - uncertain, aloof, and curious.<br /><br />She was created to be different from Ziva, as well as Kate. Given the fact of how much re-writing and planning had to be done at the last minute ... this cast (and crew) pulled it off beautifully!!<br /><br />This season also introduces us to a new NCIS spinoff ... New Orleans.<br /><br />This is the season where I had to mostly watch it online. I only missed three episodes, but now that I have the DVDs ... I'm caught up. If you haven't seen it, sorry, but there will be spoilers here.<br /><br />These are a few of my favorite episodes from this season:<br /><br />\"Past, Present, and Future\" - Ziva fans will love this choice (though they may not), and those who are sick to death over the fall-out will blast me (though they may praise me). Either way, the reasons are clear ... the lesson of cutting ties to a past life, even if it had several good moments. It served as a proper goodbye and in essence a \"full-circle\" to where her life began. Where her life might have been different. It shows us the choices we make and how we alone are responsible for our past, present, and future. A fitting end to a character who, I feel, her story was winding down after the death of her father.  He was her last Mossad connection. Given some of the protocol she fouled up on, this was the best ending.<br /><br />\"Under the Radar\" - The fans, who have taken to Twitter with good and bad things to say about NCIS, were at least rewarded/mentioned by way of this one. The team takes to Twitter to find an airplane with a C4 bomb. By using a \"hashtag\", the team is able to locate the plane and predict the course. This is the first episode without Ziva and it seems the team is doing well. They know about life's struggles, so they put it together. Being that they are representing a REAL agency (NCIS), they don't have time to count losses - pick up the pieces and move on. Roma Maffia (Profiler, Nip/Tuck) stops by, has us laughing, and exits with flair (thanks to DiNozzo).<br /><br />\"Once a Crook\" - This is a tricky DiNozzo-centric one. But, we learn more about his troubled past in Baltimore, while he was in uniform. We see where the need to save people comes from. The death of a Petty Officer brings DiNozzo face to face with someone from his past. Someone he tried to help, but couldn't. He finally makes his peace with Anton, who is apprehended for the Baltimore crime.  He also brings up \"Ziva\" and how her absence has been felt. While the team feels it, they have to move forward.<br /><br />\"Devil's Triad\" - Fornell, Gibbs, and Diane? What more needs to be said? The scenes in the car with Fornell and Gibbs are hilarious! The relationship with Fornell and Gibbs is so complex, and then there is Diane. At the end, poor Tobias gets suckered into getting back with Diane. Also, we see their daughter and how she reacts to her parents' relationship.<br /><br /> \"Crescent City\" - Parts One & Two<br /><br />These serve as the back-door pilots for NCIS: New Orleans. Normally I don't like \"back-door\" pilots. Though I understand the reason for them, for me, there is always too much going on in them to keep it all together. However, this two-parter is exciting from the word go. We get equal parts NCIS and equal parts of NOLA.<br /><br />The case involves a dead congressman who was part of the \"Fed-Five\". Mike Franks is mentioned, and we learn about Gibbs and Pride as \"probies\". It turns out one of the older agents framed the now deceased \"Privileged\" killer that was incarcerated. Between both the D.C and NOLA teams, they find out who the real killer was/is.<br /><br />This back-door pilot seems much more cohesive than \"Legend\" (NCIS: LA) from season six (6). I am definitely looking forward to the series premiere of NCIS: New Orleans.<br /><br />Moving on ...<br /><br />Next up:<br /><br />\"The Admiral's Daughter\" - This shows Tony at his absolute best! He's responsible for bringing an Admiral's wayward daughter home, which isn't easy for DiNozzo as he is suspected of murder (for what, the third ... fourth time). But, he soon finds himself running through France with the daughter as they stay ahead of a corrupt French Inspector. As it turns out, the daughter is working for the U.S. government and her father has no idea.<br /><br />\"Honor Thy Father\" (season finale) - When Ralph Waite passed on February 13, 2014, it was hard to imagine how NCIS could ever write this in. For shows that use death to get rid of characters, the task wasn't easy. Vance told Gibbs about his father's death, which meant Gibbs had to travel to Stillwater. Back in \"Better Angels\", Gibbs had asked his dad to move in with him. The older Gibbs still had some fight to him. This was a touching tribute to Papa Gibbs. And, the episode didn't end on a cliff-hanger. Beautiful episode.<br /><br />Out of 24 episodes and missing a few ... having eight (8) ultimate favorites, this makes this season as one of my FAVORITES of NCIS. Normally I average around four to five (4-5) ULTIMATE favorites.<br /><br />Most complaints or reviews center on the departure of Cote de Pablo and the addition of Emily Wickersham. Some say the ratings have gone down, but NCIS was just awarded the Golden Nymph for being the most watched show worldwide. So, the show is barely on the way out as some are claiming. In fact, the ratings are still \"solid\".<br /><br />In addition, season 10 (last with de Pablo) ended with 21.34 million viewers, whereas seasons 11 ended with 19.77 million, a drop of only 1.5 million from season 10. That is only a drop of less than 10% of the viewers. However, after season three (3) the series had two straight years of drops in viewership going from 15.27 million at the end of the third to 14.41 at the end of the fifth. Seasons 7 (19.33 million), 8 (19.46 million), 9 (19.49 million) only saw minor upticks year to year in viewership.<br /><br />Season 11 is ABOVE seasons 7-9 in terms of viewership. Only season 10 stood out as the highest rated season since the series began in 2003-2004. Obviously the cast and crew are doing something right.<br /><br />Being odd and quirky myself, and having my own \"style\" of working, I liked Emily Wickersham's \"Ellie Bishop\" right off. Since she was introduced in episode nine (9), fifteen episodes didn't really give the writers time to smooth things over. After all, it took some of us several years to appreciate other characters as well. I agree Bishop needs some fine-tuning, so I am interested to see how she develops in season 12.<br /><br />With regard to the packaging, same as the last eleven (11) seasons - slim line, light, paperboard package, with slim line plastic cases housing two (2) DVDs per case.<br /><br />Normally I don't watch special features, but there is a great tribute to Ralph Waite, how they went about casting for Ellie Bishop, how they changed directions to begin production on time, plus some great tidbits about the new soundtrack. This is \"jam-packed\" with behind the scenes videos.<br /><br />Given the numbers, this particular season stands out among the highest rated, preceded ONLY by season 10. I'm definitely giving this season - five stars.\nBest Season of the Series!!

This Region 0/Non-region specific DVD set is riddled with problems. And, I don\u2019t know where to begin as some may find the \u201cissues\u201d I\u2019ve listed in a different order of importance.<br /><br />To note: I do like Baywatch. I enjoyed the NBC (1989-1990) season (the one shown on this page) much more (actually loved that season), and hung around for Season 2 on Fox (1991-1992). I didn\u2019t watch past season three (3) though. So I\u2019m not Baywatch bashing. This review isn\u2019t based on the series, but the quality of the DVD set (this product).<br /><br />I will say this \u2013 first off \u2026 no closed captioning for the deaf/hard of hearing or other language subtitles. Those who are deaf/hard of hearing will not be able to watch or enjoy this (unless they have other equipment to caption it).<br /><br />As I only speak/understand English the lack of language selection wasn\u2019t a problem for me, however others needing French or Spanish (which seem to be the most popular for DVDs) subtitles will not be able to enjoy this set.<br /><br />If those are a problem \u2026 sadly, you will want to avoid this set. That loses a star for me.<br /><br />** Second problem? Loss of another star \u2026<br /><br />Lack of an episode listing guide. Most DVD sets have a guide as to what is on the DVD (and in what order), even if it is on the INSIDE of the liner. This doesn\u2019t. No episode listing on the discs either. There was no separate booklet or outside box issued \u2013 just the plastic case wrapped in plastic wrap. There are two discs which have some episodes out of order, at least when comparing it to IMDB (which has it listed by air date, as does Wikipedia). However, the pilot \u2013 \u201cPanic at Malibu Pier\u201d \u2013 is included on disc one.<br /><br />** Third problem?<br /><br />The DVD case. The middle disc holder is a problem. There are seven (7) pretty wide slits that allow dirt and or fingerprints to contaminate the discs. Not a smart move. Also it is a bit rough to get the discs out. If you watch them frequently you might have a huge problem with removal.<br /><br />Moving on \u2026 let\u2019s go with playback. This is where it loses another \u201ccollective\u201d star for me with the following \u2026<br /><br />These are REGION 0/NO REGION discs, and as I am based in the USA, they did register and seemingly play in my DVD player. My laptop recognized DISC #1, but read DISC #2 as BLANK on the first try, on the second it did better. That was a bit concerning. So, if you play DVDs on your computer \u2013 be cautious.<br /><br />Menu Options \u2013 the menu options don\u2019t exist in the way of selecting languages or closed captioning (subtitles). The disc has the individual episodes or a play all function.<br /><br />Extras \u2013 NONE \u2013 there are ZERO extras. Don\u2019t expect any \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d information, interviews, or commentary. As one who enjoys the commentary but it isn\u2019t a deal breaker, it wasn\u2019t a huge deal not to have it. Others who want those things will be disappointed.<br /><br />Quality \u2013 There was NO effort to restore quality in the pilot episode/movie. While I understand the pilot is from April 1989, it looks like it was copied from a VHS tape. The quality for the rest of the episodes isn\u2019t too bad given that the episodes are nearly 30 years old. However it is not as good as it could be though, as some older series have been restored. For a show that ran 10 years and was a \u201cGlobal\u201d hit, this DVD set\u2019s quality is surprising. Even the \u201cKnight Rider\u201d DVDs have more features than this and \u201cKnight Rider\u201d ran from 1982-1986.<br /><br />Sound \u2013 Given the fact this hasn\u2019t been re-mastered, the sound quality isn\u2019t that bad, then again I am not one who likes the \u201ctheater surround sound\u201d deal as I live in an apartment and can\u2019t fully appreciate the feature (nor do I like \u201cloud\u201d things). I didn\u2019t have to blast the sound my HDTV, so that is a good thing. However, sound preferences are different to each person. Something to keep in mind.<br /><br />MUSIC \u2013 To be honest, I don\u2019t remember the season one (1) theme (I\u2019ve read it was Peter Cetera\u2019s \u201cSave Me\u201d). I know that season two (2) was Jim Jamison\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m Always There\u201d (which is not on the season 2, mismarked 1 set that I have). The opening theme from this season is missing from this set. There is a song from \u201cShark Derby\u201d that remains in it at the end. That one I definitely remember.<br /><br />If you can ignore all of these problems and issues; and enjoy the series (particularly this season) \u2013 I\u2019d go ahead and get it. I thoroughly enjoyed re-living some of my childhood and watching these episodes which I remembered more about than I thought (especially since it has been 30 years since it premiered). If the issues/problems I\u2019ve noted are deal-breakers, you may want to steer clear \u2013 particularly on the closed captioning.\nNo Closed Captioning is Just the Beginning of Issues\nAirwolf - The Complete Series\nJan-Michael Vincent  (Actor),     Ernest Borgnine  (Actor),     Various  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Action & Adventure\n['Jan-Michael Vincent stars as Stringfellow Hawke, a reclusive renegade pilot who\\'s assigned to top-secret missions for the CIA by the mysterious \"Archangel\" (Alex Cord).

The special effects were fake and embarrassing, the recycled scenes and images could get tiresome, dialogue could be cheesy, and the story-lines were simple if not comical.<br /><br />With that said \u2026<br /><br />I wasn\u2019t really an Airwolf fan. It had an interesting premise. Some of the main actors and guest stars were great in their roles, but this wasn\u2019t my cup of tea. So, I understand someone who may not like the same TV shows I do.<br /><br />Anyway \u2026<br /><br />This review has FAR more to do with the packaging and presentation than a complete critique of the series, scripts, or actors. I got this as a gift for my mom who really liked the series (and since it was in her acceptable price range), I got it.<br /><br />This contains all \u201cfour\u201d seasons.

Mike Rivers<br />Michelle Scarabelli as Joanna \u201cJo\u201d Santini<br />Anthony Sherwood as Jason Locke (The Company)<br /><br />The scripts for season 4 were already done when the actors were cast thus no time for character development (this was according to one of the cast members). However, they did a decent job with what they were given. Some stood out more than others. I don\u2019t blame the actors for the BAD season 4 \u2013 I blame the bad special effects, filming style, and scripts.<br /><br />Moving on to the product \u2026<br /><br />The packaging \u2013 awful. Really awful for the amount of CDs in it \u2013 14 total discs. If not carefully packaged, this could arrive crushed from transport. Judging from some photos, it looks like I was blessed to receive this as intact as it is. It \u201cunloads\u201d from the bottom so it is easy to drop them as you open the package, move it, or even by picking it up.<br /><br />The DVDs \u2013<br /><br />They\u2019re two discs to a sleeve and roughly 5-6 episodes per disc. No \u201cepisode information\u201d; and the episodes have no closed captioning at all. There is no language selection \u2013 English only. No special features at all. The menu is basic with two options \u2013 play all or episode selection. That\u2019s it.<br /><br />Sound quality is pretty bad for seasons 1-3, worse on season 4. On my HDTV I had to have it up on 17/18 when I usually listen on 6/7. I don\u2019t have perfect hearing, but I try to select the lowest possible, with closed caption so as not to disturb my neighbors.<br /><br />Picture quality is standard for a 1980\u2019s TV show \u2013 for seasons 1, 2, and 3. Season four, due to how it was filmed has questionable quality. Some parts are quite clear, some are blurry, and some look a bit \u201cfake\u201d. Had I not gotten this directly from Amazon, sold by them, I\u2019d almost think it was bootleg quality.<br /><br />It is acceptable for those who don\u2019t care about special extras such as \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d, commentary, language selection, or closed captioning.<br /><br />If all you want is the series with no extras \u2013 this is it. No frills.<br /><br />For what I paid, which was about $20, it isn\u2019t too bad. In fact, that\u2019s all my mom would let me pay for it \ud83d\ude02 (lol)<br /><br />So, yes the 3-star rating is generous, but also fair.\nNot Up To Specs",

My mom liked it and she and I would watch every episode when it originally aired, particularly the one where Lee and Amanda finally got married. I don't have a DVR or enough time in the day to hunt and search for the episodes, which many times air out of order. Can we get this on DVD?<br /><br />Here is a really, super smart idea.<br /><br />Anyone ready for this one?<br /><br />Take pre-orders. Release the ENTIRE SHOW on DVD, then send it out to those who have pre-ordered it. That makes a lot of sense. Why am I seeing some new series, which haven't been on but even 1-2 seasons, before they are out on DVD.<br /><br />Sopranos? NIP/TUCK? These series are still being aired with new episodes weekly. I know they are popular, but come on, this show was good too.<br /><br />How hard can this be? There are a lot of people that like the series, and want to see it again. There was a time I had to wait 2 years in between the time it was on one station in syndication before it came back on another station.<br /><br />AS OF 3/9/2010....<br /><br />This series has been released on DVD. The earlier review was written 3 years ago. I had actually forgot I had written a review of this until I went to review it and it gave me the option to EDIT, and EDIT I shall.<br /><br />I still give it 5 stars. The network and production company did great by it, or as best as they could; given it's age. It has been over 20 years since it has been on and I bet the original tape/film is not as good as it once was, but it isn't as bad as it could be either.<br /><br />But don't look for extras--out takes, commentaries, promo commercials or even a \"behind the scenes\"; because it isn't on this wonderful 5 disc set. I say wonderful because the packaging is awesome. It is one jewel case with single sided DVDs which take no more room than at best 2 DVDs on the shelf, which goes into a cardboard sleeve. It comes with a booklet to explain each episode and the characters. The DVD artwork is good. The DVDs are clearly marked and the \"menu\" screen is simple. You can play ALL episodes at once or select individual ones.<br /><br />As far as the quality, it might not have been digitally remastered as you can literally see the \"scratches\" in the file. The DVDs play without skipping and the episodes are just as wonderful as I remember them being.<br /><br />If you love the series, here it is. I can not wait for the rest of the seasons and hope they are as quickly released as Nash Bridges has been.\nReview Title: Scarecrow & Mrs King Needs To Be (IS FINALLY) On DVD\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: CSI: Miami: Season 1\nReview Date: 2007/12/13\nStore: David Caruso  (Actor),     Emily Procter  (Actor),     Bryan Spicer  (Director),     Charles Correll  (Director)    &                   1                  more   Rated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Paramount Home Entertainment, Drama\nProduct Description: ['Product Description', 'David Caruso, Emily Procter, Kim Delaney.

Having lived here most of my life, I didn't see anything interesting about it.<br /><br />So, when CSI: Crime Scene Investigation came along, I decided to give it a try and see what it had to offer. Maybe it would be interesting, after all I enjoyed Profiler until it was cancelled; and this was similiar, yet only to a point.<br /><br />30 minutes into CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, I fell asleep. And, each time I would watch the episodes, I'd nod off. After a few times, I gave it up. (Nothing personal to the cast, but they were not that interesting).<br /><br />But to each their own. If one likes it and another doesn't; it doesn't make it a wrong choice, just personal choices and certainly you shouldn't be comparing the way something is done in one city to what is done in another. We are all looking for something different when we watch TV, and that fuels the choices we make.<br /><br />In 2002, another CSI was coming out, this time with David Caruso as the lead actor and set in Miami. I was thinking Miami Vice with David Caruso; not a pretty sight, but worth a try.<br /><br />Tried it I did, and got hooked (so hooked I own season 1-4 on DVD) and watch it whenever time permits.<br /><br />Here I am, now 5 years later, looking forward to getting season 5 on DVD (I have to wait until Christmas cause someone in my family decided it'd be funny to give it to me as a gift).<br /><br />I find the characters compelling and more approachable, the kind of people you'd call for help.<br /><br />Yes (biting my own tongue), that even includes Caruso's \"Horatio Caine\"; one of the best characters on the series. Tough when he has to be, compassionate where it warrants, never once forgetting about the families that are left behind. That to me is his only concern, and that is where it should be. It's that commitment I am attracted to.<br /><br />Yes, he threatens dirtbags (oh my favorite parts of the episodes), but think about this, you would want Caine on your side to find your loved one's killer and would want him to do everything he could to ensure justice was done. No, you wouldn't like it if you were guilty of a crime, who would?<br /><br />He's good with women and children, having perhaps too much of a protective instinct, which is lacking in today's society. Maybe that's why some people dislike his character. (Note: Caine's father killed his mother when he was younger, so there might be a reason for his attitude).<br /><br />His tricks or nuances are his way of letting those around him know that he is always thinking, thinking about ways to get one step ahead of the killer and bring him/her to justice. Not to mention those little \"nuances\" make the suspect nervous, if you're guilty he will make you squirm.<br /><br />The science is at times gruesome, then again, murder isn't pretty. We seem to forget that.<br /><br />Alexx talking to the victims reminds us that these were once people too, that they had families, they were not just something that was discarded as trash.<br /><br />We forget too often after people are dead that they were here and touched someone's life. We forget that they were someone's mother, father, daughter, son, brother, sister. They started out their day planning in some cases to come home to all of us, but fate intervened.<br /><br />Alexx reminds us of this, and I personally like it. We need to be reminded of the consequences of greed, corruption and personal desires.<br /><br />As far as Calleigh, Eric, Speed (who I miss in the series) and the rest of the CSI: Miami team, they are a diverse group that reminds us how workplace politics play a crucial role in how outcomes are determined; they have dedicated their lives to putting criminals behind bars and finding closure for the families.<br /><br />Some of the stories are interesting, some make you think, and others are about par for the course when it comes to reality.<br /><br />If you like it, you like it, there is no explaining it; you either have it on DVD or are planning to get it.<br /><br />If you don't like it, no one is making you watch it or buy it, so leave it alone (clothing is clothing, I can dress like a model by buying certain clothes at Walmart). Don't waste your money, you're better off getting something you do like.<br /><br />If you don't like the acting, don't watch it. This is after all--FICTION. The telling of a story that's purpose is to entertain.<br /><br />And, I plan to keep watching as long as it's on.\nReview Title: Quit Picking At It, Like It or Leave It\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: CSI: Miami: Season 2\nReview Date: 2007/12/13\nStore: David Caruso  (Actor),     Emily Procter  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Paramount Home Entertainment, Drama\nProduct Description: ['Actors: Adam Rodriguez, David Caruso, Emily Procter, Khandi Alexander, Rory Cochrane Special Features: Widescreen Format.

Yes, it's a contrived \"we have your kid, you want him back, you pay\" plot and storyline. But, it's how it is played out that makes this movie good entertainment.<br /><br />Now, no \"fictional\" movie is ever going to depict real life. But, suspend the \"reality\" for the movie and you go along for a wild ride. Tom Mullen (Gibson) is an airline executive, built the company from the ground-up, and will do anything to protect it. Kate (Russo) is his wife, who obviously has seen the ups and downs of their life, but has honored her \"for better for worse\" marriage vows. Then, they have a talented and bright child Sean (Brawley Nolte) who isn't too neglected and seems to have adequate child/parent time with each parent.<br /><br />In what we should expect to happen, does indeed happen, the child is taken for ransom. But, it's in the how and the who that really grips us. He is taken from a public place which shows the kidnappers as thumbing their nose under everyone, and shows us we are too complacent in our feelings of security in public places, even during the day.<br /><br />Det. Jimmy Shaker (Sinise) is the ring-leader, and I think his identity coming out sooner is to me part of the whole riddle and scheme of the movie, after all, he has no motive....well he does, but we will get to that later. He seems to be functionally insane. He can function in public, do his job and then he's a psycho on top of it all. How else can you do what he did??<br /><br />After a botched \"money drop\" attempt, Mullen finds himself in a situation where he ponders \"would paying the money really insure my son's safe return\"? And he's right. We know it wouldn't. And he attempts to convince his wife that it's not about the money, it's about getting their son back alive. Once the kidnapper has their money, they have no reassurance if the boy will come back alive, which is the whole point behind paying the ransom, now isn't it?<br /><br />So... since it's all about money, why not turn it into a bounty? Which is what Mullen does. Who wouldn't turn in someone they know for $2 million? Which is what he is counting on, and Shaker didn't. Now Shaker has to keep calm (which he can't do, since his scheme is coming apart at the seems along with everyone he's around) and he's going beserk, while everyone else is trying to abandon the plan.<br /><br />And Shaker doesn't like people \"bailing\" on him. Can anyone say \"psycho\"?<br /><br />Shaker decides to give in, and gives the child back alive, killing all his co-horts in the process. But, it's when his greed gets the better of him he gets found out. Had he followed the plan, likely he would have been sipping margaritas in Mexico, but he had to have to money early and pays the ultimate price. Apparently his meds didn't kick in to save his brain or his life.<br /><br />Yes, Mel Gibson might have over-acted as the father. But since it's fiction who are we to argue with that? I did enjoy the balcony scene where for a moment we thought he was going to jump. After all, he thought he'd killed his son. I was hoping he wouldn't jump, then again Shaker wouldn't have won either, but it didn't happen, which was a good thing.<br /><br />Rene Russo was wonderful as the mother, she had a more realistic charm  in the role, but likely wouldn't have faired as well against Sinise.<br /><br />Gary Sinise was wonderful in the movie as far as the crazy bad guy. He stands out more so in the movie since you're wondering what the heck set this guy off. He can play bad guys just as well as good guys (which is why I just love him in CSI: NY).<br /><br />As Shaker is talking/rambling on, we realize one thing, the motive. He wonderfully explains his motive--he saw criminals everyday getting off by buying their way out of trouble. Mullen had recently done so with the Jackie Brown deal. Since Mullen didn't mind paying to stay out of jail/prison, then why not pay to get his son back?<br /><br />Brawley Nolte did a wonderful job as Sean, and it does tug at your heartstrings to see how he was treated and then when he recognizes his kidnapper's voice.<br /><br />Donnie Wahlberg did a wonderful job as the only friend the kid seemed to have in the whole ordeal, and made him a promise that was eventually carried out.<br /><br />The rest of the cast were wonderful, and I wish I could remember all the actors in this movie.<br /><br />The FBI were portrayed as neutral, they were trying to help the Mullens get their son back, while the father decided to take things into his own hands.  At least it stayed away from \"the FBI saved the day\" plot. The movie played out on it's own, and could have been directed by anyone. The cast seemed to compliment each other.<br /><br />If you have DVR (and you're not paying any extra to record it), record it from a movie channel once, if you like buy it; if not, then save the money, and delete.<br /><br />I for one, am going to get the DVD.\nReview Title: Wow!!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Vegas: Season 1, Vol. 1\nReview Date: 2009/11/03\nStore: Tony Curtis  (Actor),     Judy Landers  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Drama\nProduct Description: ['Handsome, fun loving, private eye, Dan Tanna, drives around Las Vegas in his vintage Thunderbird solving private cases but is also on retainer to a wealthy casino owner to keep crime out of his hotels.

That is the economy, and times we live in. And, it really sucks since we as the consumers suffer as a result. Unfortunately, we the viewers asked for this, so we have to take some responsibility. I have learned to cut out certain things in order to still afford my entertainment...<br /><br />BUT....<br /><br />And, remember, this is my opinion.....not a fact...<br /><br />Buying something like this, the price depends on how bad you really want it....how available it is anywhere else, the quality and the integrity of the merchant. What does owning this series mean to you? It is, in it's own way, a collectible. So that should be taken into consideration.<br /><br />Also, there might be some copyright issues to work out to get all of it on DVD. Let's face it, we all know about the mountains of paperwork required for cars & homes....and we aren't fully informed about what goes into producing older shows, from studios perhaps no longer in business or producers long deceased.<br /><br />An interesting fact, this is produced by CBS entertainment; and correct me if I am wrong--this series aired on ABC when it ran from 1978-1981. I was 2 at the time, but I remember Aaron Spelling being the ABC king with much of his series, even into the early 80's--Love Boat, TJ Hooker, Fantasy Island.....<br /><br />That could be an issue as well.<br /><br />However, this is to review the product itself.<br /><br />For me, yes, $25.99 (which is what I was charged) is well worth it. This series is over 30 years old, never found it's own audience as it followed behind Charlie's Angels. So it was destined to fail by the Powers That Be (PTB). Still, the people who remember it from back then or it's limited run in re-runs appreciate the fact that even some of it is available. I know I do.<br /><br />The DVDs are a great quality, given what the studios have to work with. And even on an HDTV with an HD upgradable DVD player, from a distance they look no worse than newer DVDs. There were no problems with skips, jumps or freezing. The case is around the same size as a standard DVD, which makes storage easy...especially if you have a lot of DVDs.They are snapped into place, so there are no issues with them popping out and moving, though with the shipping services that is not always guaranteed, but mine survived the postal service.<br /><br />All in all, if you want the series and have the money, pick it up. And while it isn't always visually accurate (driving scenes especially) it does what it was meant to do--entertain.\nReview Title: Short Lived on the Screen,  Long Lived in our Hearts\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Nash Bridges: Season 3\nReview Date: 2009/12/28\nStore: Johnson, Don  (Actor),     Marin, Cheech  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Paramount Home Entertainment, Action & Adventure\nProduct Description: ['Nash Bridges', \"(Don Johnson) is a high-action drama about a San Francisco police investigator who deserves his reputation as a topnotch cop, but who's not always so successful when it comes to his personal life.

It dominated my Friday nights from 1996-2001. BUT, this is not what I remembered and we should get a price break on it; however; this is to RATE the item. And, I HATE rating it like I do, cause I loved this series.<br /><br />So, here goes...<br /><br />If I were to rate it based on the action & storylines I remember--I'd be 5 stars.<br /><br />If I were to rate it based on the lack of the music or music changes from the original CBS airings--It'd be NO STARS.<br /><br />Now, I am usually an easy-going person. But, when I want the COMPLETE SERIES or the COMPLETE SEASON, I want it complete & unaltered. That is not what I got. One episode for example--REVELATIONS; is a mess. One of my most favorite episodes of this season and truthfully, the \"new\" ending really sucks.<br /><br />At the end as Nash was driving away in the 'Cuda, you heard Van Morrison's \"Into The Mystic\". I know because I had to call the production office to find the name of the song.<br /><br />Alas, it was replaced by something else and less meaningful. Same as the episode \"Sacraments\"--the song at the end (in the original airing) was Eric Clapton's \"My Father's Eyes\"; again replaced with something less meaningful and to me, degrades the series and what it accomplished. I haven't seen the entire season, but I would bet most of the really great music has been altered. That is what made this series what it was at times--the music.<br /><br />If I were not so dedicated to the series, and didn't want to waste my time recording it on DVR and transferring it to my own DVDS, I would stop ordering future seasons. I am half tempted to do so.....BUT...I asked for it on DVD and as my mother said \"be careful what you wish for\" as well as \"having a thing isn't so pleasing as wanting\"....so I will have to deal with it. I would encourage people who remember the series for what it was to contact Paramount and voice your displeasure, as I intend to do. I thought seasons 1 & 2 were \"over-sights\", clearly it is not.<br /><br />The good things? The packaging is still good--plastic case designed to hold multiple discs, a real space-saving design. The item arrived in great shape and when promised. But don't expect any special features.<br /><br />Overall, I will give it 3 stars; though I hope CBS can quit *crewing up a good thing. If it's the money deal, I would pay more for what I want & remember as opposed to cheap for cheap :)\nReview Title: The series is still good--music sucks\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: NCIS: Season 7 [DVD]\nReview Date: 2010/06/30\nStore: David McCallum  (Actor),     Cote de Pablo  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Action & Adventure\nAverage Rating: 4.9\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Action & Adventure/Television, Television', 'Format': 'AC-3, Color, Dolby, DVD, Subtitled, Widescreen, NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Sean Murray, Mark Harmon, David McCallum, Rocky Carroll, Pauley Perrette, Cote de Pablo, Michael WeatherlySean Murray, Mark Harmon, David McCallum, Rocky Carroll, Pauley Perrette, Cote de Pablo, Michael Weatherly   See more', 'Language': 'English', 'Number Of Discs': '6'}\nReview Text: Ok, now this review might sound strange, BUT.....<br /><br />I am a late comer to NCIS, for several reasons. Over May, feeling a little under the weather and getting tired of all the stuff I already had on DVD, I bought seasons 1-6...I had only watched the shows in re-runs on USA and had occasionally watched some episodes of season 7 online (I had to cancel my TV service).<br /><br />WOW....is all I can say. From the pilot (Yankee White) in season 1 to the episode Aaliyah (season 6); this cast/crew has my attention. And, I guess they're going to keep it for a while. The fact it is character driven, to me as a viewer, is more important than story-driven. It's the people we as viewers attach ourselves to, who we learn to love/hate each week. Who we connect with, some for different reasons.<br /><br />I've had a hate/love relationship with Mark Harmon and his characters through his many projects. Who could forget he played Ted Bundy?<br /><br />Each character has their own place in our hearts....and this is in no particular order.<br /><br />As Leroy Jethro Gibbs, Mark Harmon has got my attention. His team is his family, often he gives into their \"wild ideas\", but he manages to keep them focused, and cares about them; such as seen in season 7's \"Flesh and Blood\" where at the end, he and DiNozzo share a steak and drink a beer almost like a father & son to show that blood isn't the only thing that connects people as family. Our family are the people we allow into our world, to share our lives with.<br /><br />Moving on to Ziva David; she's an enigma of sorts. She was a trained assassin, but has come to be such an asset of the team and has provided an interesting glimpse into how our American culture is still mis-understood. She has good instincts, a good heart and I believe she cares about the team as her family, such as in the season 7, episode 1 \"Truth or Consequences\"; she was prepared to die, she didn't want McGee or DiNozzo to risk their lives for her; though down the road she apologized to DiNozzo and appreciates his efforts in trying to watch out for her, meaning she is learning to adapt, showing we can change what we have turned into.<br /><br />Timothy McGee has truly come a long way since being a \"probie\" in seasons 1-2; as far as partners go, I prefer the McGee/DiNozzo pairing. McGee has stepped out from the \"geeky\" kid he was and can hold his own, thanks to DiNozzo's tricks and taunts. He is still the brains, but he has developed a personality and has the heart of a lion. The little brother who can dish it out as well, if not sometimes, better than taking it.<br /><br />Abby is still Abby, lol. What can be said about her we don't know. Don't let her clothes fool you. She's excellent in her field. The \"little\" sister of the family, who displayed such emotion when Ziva was rescued, we thought this was a family. Abby is the perpetual ray of sunshine who, even though science might tell her one thing, is prepared to see the other side.<br /><br />Moving on to Dr. Donald \"Ducky\" Mallard. Where do I start with him? He's the kindly grandfather or uncle in the whole mix and shows us that he has the best/worst job of the team. He sees the worst in humanity with the bodies brought before him, but he always teaches us that the dead do talk to us, though not the way we're used to. He shows care and compassion when doing his job, and he is an essential part of the team. He is thorough in his job and even gives Jethro a few good zings to keep him in place. Ducky reminds us there is always something we don't know and if we're in doubt, keep looking. His stories keep us entertained, but provide some kind of lesson in there.<br /><br />Director Vance...while a good guy in this, I don't hold to having the \"boss\" in the mix. He's good, don't get me wrong. I wouldn't be him for the world. Sorry, no knock on the actor, but seriously, most of us don't like our bosses. So he is in the worst position possible, though he tries to make the best of it. And, amazingly he surprises us most of the time. But still, don't like too much of the bureaucrats' involvement.<br /><br />Let's not forget, one of the key members of this team, and next to Gibbs...last, but not least...<br /><br />NCIS Very Special (Senior) Agent Anthony DiNozzo. Yes, I know he's a goof-ball to some, but have you ever really observed him? He's the \"perfect\" guy (at least for this girl, lol)...he has a steady and not too shabby job, a sense of humor, an unparalleled dedication to his co-workers, good looks (very easy on the eyes), romantic, charming..and when he gets down to business, absolutely the best investigator on the team, again, next to Gibbs.<br /><br />DiNozzo is the eternal \"frat boy\", but at the same time, I don't think I would get on his bad side. While he might hide behind the face of a clown, DiNozzo has \"been there, done that\" and it's his sense of humor that holds the balance to sanity with the demands of his job. He's seen the worst of the worst, and the job is stressful, so his goofiness is key to \"keeping it together\". He can be a bit unconventional, but if he were like Gibbs, he'd be....well Gibbs. DiNozzo also has a soft and kind heart, though he wants to hide it; particularly in \"Flesh and Blood\" where he paid his father's bill & \"Obsession\" where his obsession to find the woman led him to call her, and the team was able to figure out what happened. DiNozzo stayed with her until she died, proving he is human after all.<br /><br />He too has grown up since the first season, but not at the rate he should have, lol. Then again, would we want him to change? I know I don't. And trust me, I was schooled in coming around to being a \"DiNozzo Girl\". He is who is his, he does his job and if that satisfies Gibbs, we don't question Gibbs.<br /><br />All in all, this isn't just another \"crime procedural/drama\". This show goes ABOVE that level. I still love CSI: NY and CSI: Miami, just not as much as NCIS. Gibbs, Ziva, McGee, Abby, Ducky and Tony DiNozzo have become part of our culture and part of our family.<br /><br />They're still going good at 7 seasons, and at this rate....here is to 7 more (and hopefully more).<br /><br />I'm glad I only have to wait two months to get it....otherwise we'd have a rule coming up on that one. I can hold off on CSI: NY and Miami (and in that order). But, mess with my NCIS...might have to invoke a GIBBS RULE.<br /><br />ADDED on 9/8/2010:<br /><br />As of note; the two-part \"starter\" episodes of JAG (Ice Queen & Meltdown are what I call a \"starter-pilot\") they are still \"Official\" \"JAG\" episodes as \"NCIS\" goes...Yankee White can be considered the Pilot as well. Some series do that. Yankee White is still considered as \"Episode 1\" :)...just as the NCIS: LA Pilot or \"starter\" episodes are still NCIS :)<br /><br />And, I have had no performance issues with the DVDs and I own all 7 seasons.\nReview Title: NCIS, best show out there :) **MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS**\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: CSI: Miami: Season 8\nReview Date: 2010/10/17\nStore: Adam Rodriguez  (Actor),     Jonathan Togo  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Paramount Home Entertainment, Boxed Sets\nProduct Description: [\"Join lead criminalist Horatio Caine (David Caruso) and his state-of-the-art forensics team as they investigate hot and steamy Miami crimes using cold hard facts.

IF YOU DON'T LIKE CSI: MIAMI AT ALL, DON'T WATCH IT AND DON'T BUY IT.<br /><br />IF YOU LIKE THE SERIES AND THE CHARACTERS, YOU MIGHT WANT TO PICK THIS UP.<br /><br />Now, that I've clarified a few things...<br /><br />This is the 2nd CSI franchise and FOR ME, is slightly better than the first one, though I tend to like CSI: NY more. Here is my order: CSI: NY & CSI: Miami, the original does not interest me, can not get into it, so I don't watch it, or make a negative review about it.<br /><br />All said and done, this review is about the item, not the series or the season itself.<br /><br />This season does feature some major cast/character changes, and those die-hards who want to hold on to their attachments to certain characters will be disappointed; but the producers seem to get some of it it sorted out by the end; at least with the return of Eric Delko.<br /><br />I won't get into any spoilers as some might not have been able to see the entire season.<br /><br />I will say that the story-lines were interesting, especially the CSI Trilogy crossover which is included in this set (DISC 3) and YES, every episode is included in this season set (CSI: MIAMI \"Bone Voyage\"/CSI: NY \"Hammer Down\"/CSI \"The Lost Girls\") which makes this DVD set a must get for the CSI: Miami fan.<br /><br />Unlike with the CSI: MIAMI/NY crossovers where you had to buy both series to have them completed...you do not need to get all three series for the crossover. It appears the trilogy is included on CSI season 10, but I am not sure if it is included on CSI: NY season 6 though.<br /><br />I am sure if you like all three series, having all the episodes on the discs 3x seems redundant, however if you're like me and only like 1 or 2 of the franchise, it makes it easier by having them all on on particular series' DVD set. Again, it is personal preference and you might not want to spend upwards to $150 ($50 each or less with shipping) to get the trilogy completed. So this makes a good value in that sense.<br /><br />As far as the \"product\"; the case this time around is 1 piece hard plastic snap case (slightly thicker than a standard DVD case) with all the discs in \"divided\" flip-sections (can't really explain it any better, sorry). The episodes are listed on the DVDs as well as on the \"insert\" in the case.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the series, you'll want to add this to your collection, if not, pass it up. All in all I think the producers and the manufacturer spent their time with this and it is quite an addition to your CSI: Miami collection.\nReview Title: CSI: Miami Season 8; not great, but pretty good\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Vegas: Season 2, Volume Two\nReview Date: 2011/03/29\nStore: Bart Braverman  (Actor),     Robert Urich  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Paramount Home Entertainment, Action & Adventure\nProduct Description: ['In this popular series, handsome, fun loving, private eye, Dan Tanna, drives around Las Vegas in his vintage Thunderbird solving private cases but is also on retainer to a wealthy casino owner to keep crime out of his hotels.

However, given the fact that this TV show began and ended 30 years ago, this is a rare collector's item. It's kind of like \"what would you pay for a rare collectible\"?? Also, remember this series aired on ABC, notice it's CBS Entertainment bringing it out, so that could be taken into consideration as to why it is being manufactured the way it is.<br /><br />But, since this isn't a \"price\" review, but \"product\" review, that is where I am heading....<br /><br />This, like the previous seasons/parts are in a space saving case with 3 DVDs and 11 episodes. Don't expect any extras, remember this was a short-lived series from the 1970's, that I personally don't think was marketed to it's potential. Two of the main stars are gone so there isn't a chance for any interviews or reunions. There are no episodes listed on the DVDs but they are listed on the inside of case insert (sorry I can't describe it any better).<br /><br />If you like the series, I would recommend buying it. Although today's cop/detective shows are more advanced, this is a great blast from the past and reminders of what Las Vegas used to look like.\nReview Title: Blast From The Past\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: NCIS: Season 11\nReview Date: 2014/08/28\nStore: Rocky Carroll  (Actor),     Mark Harmon  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Drama\nProduct Description: ['Season 11 of the hard-hitting drama NCIS takes action to greater heights.

If anyone has followed the news, you can tell how toxic the situation is on both sides. The actress, a week before filming, gave notice she wouldn't be back for the new season.<br /><br />That part has permeated Facebook, Twitter, and CBS in comments that every week are mostly: \"Bring Back Cote/Ziva\". Her replacement or rather a new NCIS team member was added with Emily Wickersham who portrays NSA Analyst Ellie Bishop, in a true \"probie\" role. She is quirky and analytical. Watching the behind the scenes special features, you can tell that Wickersham has been welcomed by the cast and crew, and does a great job in acting as a probie would - uncertain, aloof, and curious.<br /><br />She was created to be different from Ziva, as well as Kate. Given the fact of how much re-writing and planning had to be done at the last minute ... this cast (and crew) pulled it off beautifully!!<br /><br />This season also introduces us to a new NCIS spinoff ... New Orleans.<br /><br />This is the season where I had to mostly watch it online. I only missed three episodes, but now that I have the DVDs ... I'm caught up. If you haven't seen it, sorry, but there will be spoilers here.<br /><br />These are a few of my favorite episodes from this season:<br /><br />\"Past, Present, and Future\" - Ziva fans will love this choice (though they may not), and those who are sick to death over the fall-out will blast me (though they may praise me). Either way, the reasons are clear ... the lesson of cutting ties to a past life, even if it had several good moments. It served as a proper goodbye and in essence a \"full-circle\" to where her life began. Where her life might have been different. It shows us the choices we make and how we alone are responsible for our past, present, and future. A fitting end to a character who, I feel, her story was winding down after the death of her father.  He was her last Mossad connection. Given some of the protocol she fouled up on, this was the best ending.<br /><br />\"Under the Radar\" - The fans, who have taken to Twitter with good and bad things to say about NCIS, were at least rewarded/mentioned by way of this one. The team takes to Twitter to find an airplane with a C4 bomb. By using a \"hashtag\", the team is able to locate the plane and predict the course. This is the first episode without Ziva and it seems the team is doing well. They know about life's struggles, so they put it together. Being that they are representing a REAL agency (NCIS), they don't have time to count losses - pick up the pieces and move on. Roma Maffia (Profiler, Nip/Tuck) stops by, has us laughing, and exits with flair (thanks to DiNozzo).<br /><br />\"Once a Crook\" - This is a tricky DiNozzo-centric one. But, we learn more about his troubled past in Baltimore, while he was in uniform. We see where the need to save people comes from. The death of a Petty Officer brings DiNozzo face to face with someone from his past. Someone he tried to help, but couldn't. He finally makes his peace with Anton, who is apprehended for the Baltimore crime.  He also brings up \"Ziva\" and how her absence has been felt. While the team feels it, they have to move forward.<br /><br />\"Devil's Triad\" - Fornell, Gibbs, and Diane? What more needs to be said? The scenes in the car with Fornell and Gibbs are hilarious! The relationship with Fornell and Gibbs is so complex, and then there is Diane. At the end, poor Tobias gets suckered into getting back with Diane. Also, we see their daughter and how she reacts to her parents' relationship.<br /><br /> \"Crescent City\" - Parts One & Two<br /><br />These serve as the back-door pilots for NCIS: New Orleans. Normally I don't like \"back-door\" pilots. Though I understand the reason for them, for me, there is always too much going on in them to keep it all together. However, this two-parter is exciting from the word go. We get equal parts NCIS and equal parts of NOLA.<br /><br />The case involves a dead congressman who was part of the \"Fed-Five\". Mike Franks is mentioned, and we learn about Gibbs and Pride as \"probies\". It turns out one of the older agents framed the now deceased \"Privileged\" killer that was incarcerated. Between both the D.C and NOLA teams, they find out who the real killer was/is.<br /><br />This back-door pilot seems much more cohesive than \"Legend\" (NCIS: LA) from season six (6). I am definitely looking forward to the series premiere of NCIS: New Orleans.<br /><br />Moving on ...<br /><br />Next up:<br /><br />\"The Admiral's Daughter\" - This shows Tony at his absolute best! He's responsible for bringing an Admiral's wayward daughter home, which isn't easy for DiNozzo as he is suspected of murder (for what, the third ... fourth time). But, he soon finds himself running through France with the daughter as they stay ahead of a corrupt French Inspector. As it turns out, the daughter is working for the U.S. government and her father has no idea.<br /><br />\"Honor Thy Father\" (season finale) - When Ralph Waite passed on February 13, 2014, it was hard to imagine how NCIS could ever write this in. For shows that use death to get rid of characters, the task wasn't easy. Vance told Gibbs about his father's death, which meant Gibbs had to travel to Stillwater. Back in \"Better Angels\", Gibbs had asked his dad to move in with him. The older Gibbs still had some fight to him. This was a touching tribute to Papa Gibbs. And, the episode didn't end on a cliff-hanger. Beautiful episode.<br /><br />Out of 24 episodes and missing a few ... having eight (8) ultimate favorites, this makes this season as one of my FAVORITES of NCIS. Normally I average around four to five (4-5) ULTIMATE favorites.<br /><br />Most complaints or reviews center on the departure of Cote de Pablo and the addition of Emily Wickersham. Some say the ratings have gone down, but NCIS was just awarded the Golden Nymph for being the most watched show worldwide. So, the show is barely on the way out as some are claiming. In fact, the ratings are still \"solid\".<br /><br />In addition, season 10 (last with de Pablo) ended with 21.34 million viewers, whereas seasons 11 ended with 19.77 million, a drop of only 1.5 million from season 10. That is only a drop of less than 10% of the viewers. However, after season three (3) the series had two straight years of drops in viewership going from 15.27 million at the end of the third to 14.41 at the end of the fifth. Seasons 7 (19.33 million), 8 (19.46 million), 9 (19.49 million) only saw minor upticks year to year in viewership.<br /><br />Season 11 is ABOVE seasons 7-9 in terms of viewership. Only season 10 stood out as the highest rated season since the series began in 2003-2004. Obviously the cast and crew are doing something right.<br /><br />Being odd and quirky myself, and having my own \"style\" of working, I liked Emily Wickersham's \"Ellie Bishop\" right off. Since she was introduced in episode nine (9), fifteen episodes didn't really give the writers time to smooth things over. After all, it took some of us several years to appreciate other characters as well. I agree Bishop needs some fine-tuning, so I am interested to see how she develops in season 12.<br /><br />With regard to the packaging, same as the last eleven (11) seasons - slim line, light, paperboard package, with slim line plastic cases housing two (2) DVDs per case.<br /><br />Normally I don't watch special features, but there is a great tribute to Ralph Waite, how they went about casting for Ellie Bishop, how they changed directions to begin production on time, plus some great tidbits about the new soundtrack. This is \"jam-packed\" with behind the scenes videos.<br /><br />Given the numbers, this particular season stands out among the highest rated, preceded ONLY by season 10. I'm definitely giving this season - five stars.\nReview Title: Best Season of the Series!!

This Region 0/Non-region specific DVD set is riddled with problems. And, I don\u2019t know where to begin as some may find the \u201cissues\u201d I\u2019ve listed in a different order of importance.<br /><br />To note: I do like Baywatch. I enjoyed the NBC (1989-1990) season (the one shown on this page) much more (actually loved that season), and hung around for Season 2 on Fox (1991-1992). I didn\u2019t watch past season three (3) though. So I\u2019m not Baywatch bashing. This review isn\u2019t based on the series, but the quality of the DVD set (this product).<br /><br />I will say this \u2013 first off \u2026 no closed captioning for the deaf/hard of hearing or other language subtitles. Those who are deaf/hard of hearing will not be able to watch or enjoy this (unless they have other equipment to caption it).<br /><br />As I only speak/understand English the lack of language selection wasn\u2019t a problem for me, however others needing French or Spanish (which seem to be the most popular for DVDs) subtitles will not be able to enjoy this set.<br /><br />If those are a problem \u2026 sadly, you will want to avoid this set. That loses a star for me.<br /><br />** Second problem? Loss of another star \u2026<br /><br />Lack of an episode listing guide. Most DVD sets have a guide as to what is on the DVD (and in what order), even if it is on the INSIDE of the liner. This doesn\u2019t. No episode listing on the discs either. There was no separate booklet or outside box issued \u2013 just the plastic case wrapped in plastic wrap. There are two discs which have some episodes out of order, at least when comparing it to IMDB (which has it listed by air date, as does Wikipedia). However, the pilot \u2013 \u201cPanic at Malibu Pier\u201d \u2013 is included on disc one.<br /><br />** Third problem?<br /><br />The DVD case. The middle disc holder is a problem. There are seven (7) pretty wide slits that allow dirt and or fingerprints to contaminate the discs. Not a smart move. Also it is a bit rough to get the discs out. If you watch them frequently you might have a huge problem with removal.<br /><br />Moving on \u2026 let\u2019s go with playback. This is where it loses another \u201ccollective\u201d star for me with the following \u2026<br /><br />These are REGION 0/NO REGION discs, and as I am based in the USA, they did register and seemingly play in my DVD player. My laptop recognized DISC #1, but read DISC #2 as BLANK on the first try, on the second it did better. That was a bit concerning. So, if you play DVDs on your computer \u2013 be cautious.<br /><br />Menu Options \u2013 the menu options don\u2019t exist in the way of selecting languages or closed captioning (subtitles). The disc has the individual episodes or a play all function.<br /><br />Extras \u2013 NONE \u2013 there are ZERO extras. Don\u2019t expect any \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d information, interviews, or commentary. As one who enjoys the commentary but it isn\u2019t a deal breaker, it wasn\u2019t a huge deal not to have it. Others who want those things will be disappointed.<br /><br />Quality \u2013 There was NO effort to restore quality in the pilot episode/movie. While I understand the pilot is from April 1989, it looks like it was copied from a VHS tape. The quality for the rest of the episodes isn\u2019t too bad given that the episodes are nearly 30 years old. However it is not as good as it could be though, as some older series have been restored. For a show that ran 10 years and was a \u201cGlobal\u201d hit, this DVD set\u2019s quality is surprising. Even the \u201cKnight Rider\u201d DVDs have more features than this and \u201cKnight Rider\u201d ran from 1982-1986.<br /><br />Sound \u2013 Given the fact this hasn\u2019t been re-mastered, the sound quality isn\u2019t that bad, then again I am not one who likes the \u201ctheater surround sound\u201d deal as I live in an apartment and can\u2019t fully appreciate the feature (nor do I like \u201cloud\u201d things). I didn\u2019t have to blast the sound my HDTV, so that is a good thing. However, sound preferences are different to each person. Something to keep in mind.<br /><br />MUSIC \u2013 To be honest, I don\u2019t remember the season one (1) theme (I\u2019ve read it was Peter Cetera\u2019s \u201cSave Me\u201d). I know that season two (2) was Jim Jamison\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m Always There\u201d (which is not on the season 2, mismarked 1 set that I have). The opening theme from this season is missing from this set. There is a song from \u201cShark Derby\u201d that remains in it at the end. That one I definitely remember.<br /><br />If you can ignore all of these problems and issues; and enjoy the series (particularly this season) \u2013 I\u2019d go ahead and get it. I thoroughly enjoyed re-living some of my childhood and watching these episodes which I remembered more about than I thought (especially since it has been 30 years since it premiered). If the issues/problems I\u2019ve noted are deal-breakers, you may want to steer clear \u2013 particularly on the closed captioning.\nReview Title: No Closed Captioning is Just the Beginning of Issues\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Airwolf - The Complete Series\nReview Date: 2019/09/25\nStore: Jan-Michael Vincent  (Actor),     Ernest Borgnine  (Actor),     Various  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Action & Adventure\nProduct Description: ['Jan-Michael Vincent stars as Stringfellow Hawke, a reclusive renegade pilot who\\'s assigned to top-secret missions for the CIA by the mysterious \"Archangel\" (Alex Cord).

The special effects were fake and embarrassing, the recycled scenes and images could get tiresome, dialogue could be cheesy, and the story-lines were simple if not comical.<br /><br />With that said \u2026<br /><br />I wasn\u2019t really an Airwolf fan. It had an interesting premise. Some of the main actors and guest stars were great in their roles, but this wasn\u2019t my cup of tea. So, I understand someone who may not like the same TV shows I do.<br /><br />Anyway \u2026<br /><br />This review has FAR more to do with the packaging and presentation than a complete critique of the series, scripts, or actors. I got this as a gift for my mom who really liked the series (and since it was in her acceptable price range), I got it.<br /><br />This contains all \u201cfour\u201d seasons. If you\u2019re wondering about why the fourth is different \u2013 please research it via IMDB or Wikipedia.<br /><br />CBS seasons 1 (mid-season replacement), 2, 3:<br /><br />Jan-Michael Vincent (1944-2019) as Stringfellow Hawke<br />Ernest Borgnine (1917-2012) as Dominic \u201cDom\u201d Santini<br />Jean Bruce Scott [seasons 2 & 3] as Caitlin O\u2019Shannessy<br />Alex Cord as Michael Coldsmith Briggs III (Archangel \u2013 The Firm)<br /><br />REALLY bad USA season 4:<br /><br />Barry Van Dyke as St. John Hawke<br />Geraint Wyn Davies as Major. Mike Rivers<br />Michelle Scarabelli as Joanna \u201cJo\u201d Santini<br />Anthony Sherwood as Jason Locke (The Company)<br /><br />The scripts for season 4 were already done when the actors were cast thus no time for character development (this was according to one of the cast members). However, they did a decent job with what they were given. Some stood out more than others. I don\u2019t blame the actors for the BAD season 4 \u2013 I blame the bad special effects, filming style, and scripts.<br /><br />Moving on to the product \u2026<br /><br />The packaging \u2013 awful. Really awful for the amount of CDs in it \u2013 14 total discs. If not carefully packaged, this could arrive crushed from transport. Judging from some photos, it looks like I was blessed to receive this as intact as it is. It \u201cunloads\u201d from the bottom so it is easy to drop them as you open the package, move it, or even by picking it up.<br /><br />The DVDs \u2013<br /><br />They\u2019re two discs to a sleeve and roughly 5-6 episodes per disc. No \u201cepisode information\u201d; and the episodes have no closed captioning at all. There is no language selection \u2013 English only. No special features at all. The menu is basic with two options \u2013 play all or episode selection. That\u2019s it.<br /><br />Sound quality is pretty bad for seasons 1-3, worse on season 4. On my HDTV I had to have it up on 17/18 when I usually listen on 6/7. I don\u2019t have perfect hearing, but I try to select the lowest possible, with closed caption so as not to disturb my neighbors.<br /><br />Picture quality is standard for a 1980\u2019s TV show \u2013 for seasons 1, 2, and 3. Season four, due to how it was filmed has questionable quality. Some parts are quite clear, some are blurry, and some look a bit \u201cfake\u201d. Had I not gotten this directly from Amazon, sold by them, I\u2019d almost think it was bootleg quality.<br /><br />It is acceptable for those who don\u2019t care about special extras such as \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d, commentary, language selection, or closed captioning.<br /><br />If all you want is the series with no extras \u2013 this is it. No frills.<br /><br />For what I paid, which was about $20, it isn\u2019t too bad. In fact, that\u2019s all my mom would let me pay for it \ud83d\ude02 (lol)<br /><br />So, yes the 3-star rating is generous, but also fair.\nReview Title: Not Up To Specs\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n    Structure your response as:\n   \n    SUMMARY:\n    [Final synthesis of preferences and patterns]",

    "text": "Since TV series started coming to DVD, my mom and I have each had a list of stuff we\u2019ve loved over the years. Whether we saw it during its broadcast seasons, re-runs, or both; we have an extensive list.<br /><br />This was one of my mom\u2019s wish list items.<br /><br />I had gotten it back for her on her birthday in late July and she FINALLY got done watching it. Had to stretch it out since it was so good, I guess<br /><br />This is the full three (3) seasons of the series. The picture quality is what you\u2019d expect for a 1980\u2019s TV series on DVD. From what I saw, it isn\u2019t too bad, but isn\u2019t HD quality.<br /><br />Sadly there are no captions for the deaf or hearing impaired.<br /><br />The packaging isn\u2019t shabby. The slip case reveals a hard, snap-case. This can be tricky to open for those with dexterity issues.<br /><br />The DVDs are stored in a \u201cplastic/mesh\u201d CD holder.<br /><br />I say CD holder as this looks like the inside of one of my old CD carry cases. The entire thing is one piece, and holds all discs. This might be handy for those who might want to travel by plane with the DVD set \u2013 less packaging.<br /><br />The titles are listed on the DVDs, but there are no DVD guides to describe the episodes.<br /><br />Overall; for the price (which was for me less than $30), packaging, and the quality; this is a pretty decent value. My mom was pretty happy with it.",
