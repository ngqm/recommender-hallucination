Led by Emma Stone, Academy Award\u00ae-nominated Viola Davis (Best Supporting Actress, Doubt, 2008), Octavia Spencer and Bryce Dallas Howard, The Help is an inspirational, courageous and empowering story about very different, extraordinary women in the 1960s South who build an unlikely friendship around a secret writing project \u2014 one that breaks society\u2019s rules and puts them all at risk. Filled with poignancy, humor and hope \u2014 and complete with compelling, never-before-seen bonus features \u2014 The Help is a timeless, universal and triumphant story about the ability to create change.', 'Amazon.com', 'There are male viewers who will enjoy', 'The Help', \", but Mississippi native Tate Taylor aims his adaptation squarely at the female readers who made Kathryn Stockett's novel a bestseller. If the multi-character narrative revolves around race relations in the Kennedy-era South, the perspective belongs to the women. Veteran maid Aibileen (\", 'Doubt', \"'s Viola Davis in an Oscar-worthy performance) provides the heartfelt narration that brackets the story. A widow devastated by the death of her son, she takes pride in the 17 children she has helped to raise, but she's hardly fulfilled. That changes when Skeeter (\", 'Easy A', \"'s Emma Stone) returns home after college. Unlike her peers, Skeeter wants to work, so she gets a job as a newspaper columnist. But she really longs to write about Jackson's domestics, so she meets with Aibileen in secret--after much cajoling and the promise of anonymity. When Aibileen's smart-mouthed friend Minny (breakout star Octavia Spencer) breaches her uptight employer's protocol, Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard) gives her the boot, and she ends up in the employ of local outcast Celia (Jessica Chastain, hilarious and heartbreaking), who can't catch a break due to her dirt-poor origins. After the murder of Medgar Evers, even more maids, Minny among them, bring their stories to Skeeter, leading to a book that scandalizes the town--in a good way. Not since\", 'Steel Magnolias', \"has Hollywood produced a Southern woman's picture more likely to produce buckets of tears (and almost as many laughs).\", '--Kathleen C.

The buyer consistently rates products highly, demonstrating a preference for quality experiences as evidenced by numerous 5-star ratings. DVDs and Blu-rays primarily form their collection, suggesting a value placed on physical media over streaming options.\n\nCommon themes across the purchases include a focus on character-driven narratives, often highlighting female perspectives and strong performances by celebrated actors. This indicates a preference for stories that evoke emotional resonance and highlight social issues, particularly those pertaining to gender and race relations.\n\nThe buyer exhibits a reasonable price sensitivity, as they select established films with generally favorable reviews, ensuring a good balance between quality and cost. However, there is a notable exception when it comes to the recent purchase of \"Nanny McPhee,\" which reflects frustration over product quality rather than the movie itself. Overall, their affinity for multi-genre films ranging from drama to action suggests a well-rounded taste in entertainment, driven by high-quality narratives and impactful characters.",
