It does follow the text of Matthew's gospel essentially word for word, which is, at times, a useful tool.<br /><br />That said, the acting is mediocre. Bruce Marchiano as Jesus is a flop. He just doesn't pull it off convincingly. I often teach a class where I show people clips from different Jesus movies. Marchiano's poor acting often evokes laughter in the group.<br /><br />If you what the best Jesus movie ever done, nothing beats Zeffirelli's TV mini-series Jesus of Nazareth.<br /><br />The two other parts to this series, Acts and John, are done very well.\nReview Title: Good idea...poor acting.\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer\nReview Date: 2008/05/03\nStore: Jessica Alba  (Actor),     Ioan Gruffudd  (Actor),     Tim Story  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Studio Specials, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, Action, General\nProduct Description: ['Product Description', 'Catch a wave of \"terrific adventure\" and \"non-stop action\" (CBS-TV) in this fun and fantastically entertaining smash-hit! \"Invisible Woman: Sue Storm and \"Mr. Fantastic\" Dr. Reed Richards are about to be married when a mysterious alien... the Silver Surfer... crashes the proceedings and heralds Earth\\'s impending destruction.

Most of the readers do a good job. There are some sections where the reading is illustrated with art or video. but a lot of it is simply head shots of the readers. Some of the reading is done very well and is easy to understand. But a number of sections are done in a large church sanctuary and there is a major echo that makes understanding the reading a struggle. Simple sound engineering could have recorded these voices without the echo with a direct line.<br /><br />The disk is too boring to watch and the sound quality too uneven to listen to. The production value is very low. With a little more attention, this could have been very good.\nReview Title: Uneven\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Keith Emerson Band featuring Marc Bonilla- Moscow DVD\nReview Date: 2014/04/23\nStore: Keith Emerson  (Actor),     Marc Bonilla  (Actor)    Rated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Musicals\nProduct Description: ['Keith Emerson is hailed as a keyboard legend.

This is not simply dull retreads of the old stuff or poorly recorded old concerts.

Marc Bonilla seem to restrain his tendencies to sound like a lounge lizard and does  a good job of covering the lyrics.

Most of the readers do a good job. There are some sections where the reading is illustrated with art or video. but a lot of it is simply head shots of the readers. Some of the reading is done very well and is easy to understand. But a number of sections are done in a large church sanctuary and there is a major echo that makes understanding the reading a struggle. Simple sound engineering could have recorded these voices without the echo with a direct line.<br /><br />The disk is too boring to watch and the sound quality too uneven to listen to.

It does follow the text of Matthew's gospel essentially word for word, which is, at times, a useful tool.<br /><br />That said, the acting is mediocre. Bruce Marchiano as Jesus is a flop. He just doesn't pull it off convincingly. I often teach a class where I show people clips from different Jesus movies. Marchiano's poor acting often evokes laughter in the group.<br /><br />If you what the best Jesus movie ever done, nothing beats Zeffirelli's TV mini-series Jesus of Nazareth.<br /><br />The two other parts to this series, Acts and John, are done very well.\nReview Title: Good idea...poor acting.\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer\nReview Date: 2008/05/03\nStore: Jessica Alba  (Actor),     Ioan Gruffudd  (Actor),     Tim Story  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Studio Specials, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, Action, General\nProduct Description: ['Product Description', 'Catch a wave of \"terrific adventure\" and \"non-stop action\" (CBS-TV) in this fun and fantastically entertaining smash-hit! \"Invisible Woman: Sue Storm and \"Mr. Fantastic\" Dr. Reed Richards are about to be married when a mysterious alien... the Silver Surfer... crashes the proceedings and heralds Earth\\'s impending destruction.

Sorry, ladies, but Reed is right. The disturbances are caused by a surge of cosmic power from a mysterious being called the Silver Surfer (an all-CGI creation, modeled by Doug Jones and voiced by Laurence Fishburne), who not only zooms around the skies on his board, but also has enough power to fight the FF, sometimes by turning their own power against them, not only mixing up Sue and Reed, but also Johnny Storm, the Human Torch (Chris Evans), and Ben Grimm, the Thing (Michael Chiklis).

Despite their interest, they often express disappointment with the quality of both production and acting, regularly rating these films poorly when faced with subpar execution, particularly citing issues with acting and script quality.\n\nCommon themes across their selections indicate a taste for both educational and entertainment values. This shopper is drawn to genres such as drama and action, but expectations for quality are critical. They show a low tolerance for poor production value, frequently labeling items as a disappointment when they don't meet anticipated standards. Their feedback suggests a blend of value-seeking behavior, particularly for products reflecting their interests in biblical narratives or significant historical retellings.\n\nPrice sensitivity appears moderate: while they assess value based on production quality, they have shown willingness to purchase lower-budget options, albeit with expressed caution regarding their expectations of quality. Overall, their core preferences revolve around high-quality, meaningful content related to biblical themes, with a notable critique of execution in acting and overall production.",
