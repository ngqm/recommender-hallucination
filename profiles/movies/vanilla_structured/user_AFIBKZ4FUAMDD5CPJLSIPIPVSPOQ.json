This movie is no exception.  What could have been a series of very good movies was condensed into one movie that cannot possibly move forward into the sequels.  How can it when so much was changed in the first movie that there is no way to incorporate the other books?<br /><br />That being said, if you have not read the series you will probably enjoy this movie. On it's own, it really wasn't bad.  The acting was decent, although a bit cheesy in parts.  It moved along well and had a decent story line.  So, if you're just looking for a movie whose trailer looks interesting, I definitely wouldn't tell you to pass on this one.  If you're looking for a movie that reflects even 1/3 of the actual book series, choose another one.\nReview Title: Not like the book\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2014/04/10\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Steve McQueen'], 'Producers': ['Dede Gardner', 'Anthony Katagas', 'Jeremy Kleiner', 'Steve McQueen', 'Arnon Milchan', 'Brad Pitt', 'Bill Pohlad', 'John Ridley', 'Tessa Ross', 'Bianca Stigter'], 'Starring': ['Chiwetel Ejiofor', 'Michael Kenneth Williams', 'Michael Fassbender'], 'Studio': ['Fox']}\nReview Text: My son and I watched this movie and found ourselves alternately sickened and furious over what happened.

This movie was a complete waste of the $3.99 I paid to rent it through Amazon.  They tried to make up for terrible acting with action scenes that were in slow motion.  All that did was make it last longer, it didn't make it better.  Kellan Lutz should have been able to pull off Hercules, he certainly had the physique for it, but I just never connected with his character.  The love of his life was just silly.  Every line she said was supposed to be dramatic and instead it came out like some poorly written young adult novel.  Really, pass this one by.

My 20-year-old son and I watched it together and laughed at a bit and snarled at a bit and came away very satisfied with the outcome.  We both particularly liked that they told what happened to everyone at the end.\nReview Title: My 20-year-old son and I watched it together and laughed at a bit and snarled at a bit and came away very satisfied with the out\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Marvel Studios' Guardians of the Galaxy\nReview Date: 2016/05/05\nCategories: Science Fiction, Comedy, Coarse, Futuristic\nProduct Description: ['The Marvel comic comes to life!

I don't know if it's the story or the music or just that it's fun, but after a tough day, I like to kick back and throw this up once again.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:  \nThe purchase history reveals a clear preference for engaging and entertaining films, particularly within the superhero, drama, and comedic genres. The individual consistently rates movies highly (average rating consistently above 4.7), indicating a strong enjoyment of visual storytelling and emotional resonance. Sentiment in reviews suggests a favor for films that provide humor, relatability, and action, with a tendency to gravitate towards narratives that incorporate fun or laugh-out-loud moments.\n\nA common theme is the importance of a fulfilling emotional experience, whether through humor or memorable character arcs, especially in family-viewing contexts. Quality is paramount, as demonstrated by the dissatisfaction expressed towards poorly executed plots or acting, particularly when expectations are set high relative to source material.\n\nPrice sensitivity appears moderate; they are willing to rent movies even at $3.99, but impulsive spending seems limited to higher quality offerings, as indicated by lower ratings for films perceived as poor investments. \n\nOverall, the consumer favors cinema that combines entertainment value with emotional engagement, prefers well-crafted narratives over mere visual spectacles, and shows a proclivity for contemporary productions with strong character-driven stories. They value the shared experience of movie-watching with family, indicating an overarching appreciation for films that foster connections.",

    "text": "I was SO mad after watching Avengers Infinity War.  How could they do that to my Avengers?  They BETTER make it up in the second half!  Um, no.  All these back stories and flashbacks were a snoozefest.  Someone thought Thor was being funny - he was just pathetic.  My son took me to see this for my birthday and he actually left with half an hour left because he was so disgusted with it.  I would have left also but I kept hoping, praying that they would pull it out of the trash in that last bit.  Sadly, no.  Infinity War should have left me wanting more, wishing it would never end (like LOTR).  Instead, I was relieved to leave the theater.",
