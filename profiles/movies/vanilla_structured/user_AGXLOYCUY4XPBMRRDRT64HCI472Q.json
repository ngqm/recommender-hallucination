Hayao Miyazaki\\'s latest triumph, filled with astonishing animation and epic adventure, is a dazzling masterpiece for the ages. It\\'s a \"wonderfully welcoming work of art that\\'s as funny and entertaining as it is brilliant, beautiful, and deep\" (Joe Morgenstern, Wall Street Journal). SPIRITED AWAY is a wondrous fantasy about a young girl, Chihiro, trapped in a strange new world of spirits. When her parents undergo a mysterious transformation, she must call upon the courage she never knew she had to free herself and return her family to the outside world. An unforgettable story brimming with creativity, SPIRITED AWAY will take you on a journey beyond your imagination. \"To enter the world of Hayao Miyazaki is to experience a kind of lighthearted enchantment that is unique to the world of animation\" (Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times). It\\'s a fantastic tale the whole family will want to experience over and over again.~~(c) 2001 Nibariki -- GNDDTM', 'Set Contains:', 'The most interesting extra feature on the two-disc set is the Nippon Television Special on the making of', 'Spirited Away', ', not because it\\'s significantly different from American making-of programs, but because the camera crew was allowed to film Miyazaki at work. It\\'s fascinating to watch the visionary director explaining how individual movements should be animated, and even performing the little dance the frog-master does to welcome the No-Face to Yubaba\\'s bath house. (Old animators describe Walt Disney giving similar performances, but no comparable footage exists.) It\\'s also striking to see how intimate Studio Ghibli is, unencumbered by the tiers of management that burden American studios. The scene comparisons enable the viewer to study the storyboards for the film, which Miyazaki draws himself. These simple yet wonderfully vivid images capture the essence of a mood, a movement, an expression. \"Behind the Microphone\" offers a fairly standard behind-the-scenes look at the creation of the excellent English version of', 'Spirited Away', '.', '--Charles Solomon']\nAverage Rating: 4.9\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Fantasy', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Animated, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Hayao Miyazaki', 'Language': 'French (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround), Japanese (Dolby Digital 5.1), English (Dolby Digital 5.1), Unqualified', 'Runtime': '2 hours and 5 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.78:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG (Parental Guidance Suggested)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.57 x 5.3 x 7.52 inches; 4.32 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'UPC# 7869 3621 3843', 'Director': 'Hayao Miyazaki', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Animated, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Run time': '2 hours and 5 minutes', 'Release date': 'April 15, 2003', 'Studio': 'Walt Disney Home Entertainment Presents A Studio Ghibli Film', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: To try and describe this movie is kind of crazy.

It's never been re- broadcast that I could tell and I just figured for the price why not buy it.<br /><br />There was nothing on tv worth watching so we popped the film in and had a really enjoyable time watching it. In fact it is eons better than some of the garbage currently on.<br /><br />Great love story, top notch actors and a pretty decent story. For a couple of hours I escaped into a very pleasant movie.<br /><br />If anyone out there has any influence, please get some network to give this film some air time.

She was interested in yoga but didn't want to make a huge investment until she knew what it was all about.  Apparently she is very happy with the program and the instructions.

And although the clothes, characters, music and some of the dialogue is a little dated, the feelings are the same. Generational breakdown in communication pure & simple. Everyone has wanted to run away & join the circus at some point in their life.<br /><br />The acting is what actually sets this film apart from many of that period.  A very young Sally Fields, Jackie Cooper, Eleanor Parker, and a sadly under-used David Carradine (pre \"Kung Fu\") elevate this film.<br /><br />I think its worth watching & especially since Amazon offers it for free with your Prime membership.

It\\'s also striking to see how intimate Studio Ghibli is, unencumbered by the tiers of management that burden American studios.

A very young Sally Fields, Jackie Cooper, Eleanor Parker, and a sadly under-used David Carradine (pre \"Kung Fu\") elevate this film.<br /><br />I think its worth watching & especially since Amazon offers it for free with your Prime membership.

I mean there's this little girl in a world inhabited by strange and curious spirits who must rescue her parents from a frightening and terrible fate.

It's never been re- broadcast that I could tell and I just figured for the price why not buy it.<br /><br />There was nothing on tv worth watching so we popped the film in and had a really enjoyable time watching it. In fact it is eons better than some of the garbage currently on.<br /><br />Great love story, top notch actors and a pretty decent story. For a couple of hours I escaped into a very pleasant movie.<br /><br />If anyone out there has any influence, please get some network to give this film some air time.

And although the clothes, characters, music and some of the dialogue is a little dated, the feelings are the same. Generational breakdown in communication pure & simple. Everyone has wanted to run away & join the circus at some point in their life.<br /><br />The acting is what actually sets this film apart from many of that period.  A very young Sally Fields, Jackie Cooper, Eleanor Parker, and a sadly under-used David Carradine (pre \"Kung Fu\") elevate this film.<br /><br />I think its worth watching & especially since Amazon offers it for free with your Prime membership.
