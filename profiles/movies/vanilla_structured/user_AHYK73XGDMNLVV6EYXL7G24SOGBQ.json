  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:  \nThis individual's purchase history highlights a strong preference for high-quality animated films and well-crafted narratives across various genres, particularly science fiction and drama. Consistently high ratings, often at or near 5.0, indicate a tendency to enjoy visually stunning productions with deep storytelling, engaging character arcs, and themes of independence, complexity, and humor. Recurring mentions of rich worldbuilding and artistic excellence suggest an appreciation for creative storytelling, balancing humor with serious themes.\n\nThe buyer appears to favor movies from notable directors and franchises, reflecting a preference for established brands often associated with quality, which implies a moderate price sensitivity\u2014opting for higher-priced but well-reviewed options rather than low-cost alternatives. Additionally, the individual\u2019s enjoyment of diverse cultural elements and philosophical undertones illustrates an openness to varied perspectives and intricate plots. \n\nOverall, the core preferences manifest as a combination of valuing artistic merit, depth in narratives, and a penchant for emotional engagement through character-driven stories, with a keen eye for visually impactful and intellectually stimulating cinematic experiences.",

    "text": "This movie starts from an interesting premise, the commodification of the duration of one's life, with the wealthy being effectively immortal, and thus willing to do anything to protect their claim and the poor working day to day just to stay alive, literally.<br /><br />Whereas it's a pretty obvious condemnation of modern capitalism, the maintenance of artificial scarcities by the owning class and the subjugation of the working class, I actually think that on the whole it successfully avoids being overly moralistic or preachy... I mean a little, but bearable.<br /><br />A good starting point but the premise is rather shallowly explored and unrealistically executed, it suffers from YA like corny melodrama and some of the pitfalls and limitations of the visual medium, i.e. needing to be able to see the metaphor/action (such as containers of time) or else fall back on, sadly yes, expository narration/dialog.<br /><br />That said, it's an enjoyable way to spend the better part of 2 hours.",
