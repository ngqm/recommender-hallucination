The name itself is synonymous with legendary performances. Countless iconic musicians and comedians have been on that stage. To be a part of that history was something I\u2019ll never forget. As much as I was trying to keep my head together before the show, I couldn\u2019t help but feel like a tourist or just some random dude who won a contest. LET IT GO represents the culmination of material I developed on the road from 2008-2009. As always thanks to everyone who came out to my shows, laughed at the funny stuff and stared during the bombing. I hope you enjoy it. \u2013 Bill Burr']\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Comedy/Stand-Up', 'Format': 'AC-3, Multiple Formats, Color, Widescreen, Dolby, NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Bill Burr, Shannon Hartman', 'Language': 'Unqualified (DTS ES 6.1)', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 5 minutes', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 2.72 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'unknown', 'Director': 'Shannon Hartman', 'Media Format': 'AC-3, Multiple Formats, Color, Widescreen, Dolby, NTSC', 'Run time': '1 hour and 5 minutes', 'Release date': 'October 4, 2010', 'Actors': 'Bill Burr', 'Studio': 'Image Entertainment', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: very funny\nReview Title: Five Stars\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Harry and the Hendersons\nReview Date: 2017/04/06\nStore: Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Studio Specials, Universal Studios Home Entertainment, All Universal Studios Titles\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '7.1 x 5.42 x 0.58 inches; 2.93 Ounces', 'Item model number': '025192365744', 'Media Format': 'NTSC', 'Release date': 'August 8, 2016', 'Studio': 'Universal Studios', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: great movie for kids and adults.\nReview Title: Five Stars\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: The 'Burbs\nReview Date: 2017/04/06\nStore: Tom Hanks  (Actor),     Carrie Fisher  (Actor),     Joe Dante  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Comedy\nProduct Description: ['Product Description', \"Tom Hanks portrays suburbanite Ray Peterson, whose plans for a peaceful vacation are disturbed by a creepy new family on the block, in this outrageous suspense-comedy directed by Joe Dante. To the disappointment of his wife Carol (Carrie Fisher), Ray decides to spend a relaxing week at home, and soon gets into trouble with his neighbors\u2014a hefty busybody (Rick Ducommun), a freaked-out ex-soldier (Bruce Dern), and a spacey teenager (Corey Feldman)\u2014as they observe the strange happenings next door at the Klopek's bizarre residence.When a neighboorhood grouch suddenly disappears, the men are convinced the ramshackle house hides some hideous clues. Armed with assault rifles, high-powered binoculars and a shovel, they decide to see for themselves exactly what is going on in the Klopek place. Set in an average neighborhood that is anything but average, The 'Burbs blends slapstick comedy and spine-thrilling mystery with the type of humor that has made Tom Hanks one of today's most popular stars.\", 'Bonus Content:', 'Alternate Ending', 'Alternate Ending', 'Production Notes', 'Production Notes', 'Cast and Filmmakers', 'Cast and Filmmakers', 'Theatrical Trailer', 'Theatrical Trailer', ']]>', 'Amazon.com', \"Ray Peterson (Tom Hanks) would like nothing better than to spend a quiet week's vacation in his suburban home, drinking beer and watching TV. But, spurred on by his two friends' spinning of boyish paranoid fantasies about their reclusive neighbors, the Klopeks, the usually down-to-earth Ray begins to suspect his idyllic neighborhood has been invaded by an evil force, to the point where he and his friends become psychotically nosey. You see where this is going, and you see it from a mile off. Only the general surface-thin plot is somewhat offset by director Joe Dante's fine sense of the absurd, and a host of engagingly played neighbor-types, namely Rick Ducommun as Ray's best friend who's always proposing bad ideas, and Bruce Dern as a sometimes wild-eyed ex-vet who'd love some action. Dante and crew seem to have a knack for keeping these broad characterizations light enough that you don't mind their superficiality. But the best jokes in this unprepossessing film come from composer Jerry Goldsmith's score; Bruce Dern's presence, for instance, is announced by the theme from\", 'Patton', \", and the boys' first approach to the Klopeks' for a meet-and-greet is buttressed by classic strains from Sergio Leone spaghetti Westerns. Kudos to the Klopeks, for their evil ways are ably embodied by Henry Gibson, Courtney Gains, and Brother Theodore. In particular, any suburb that finds it's inhabited by the likes of Brother Theodore is in dire need of new zoning laws. But Carrie Fisher's role as Ray's amiably long-suffering wife is thankless, and she deserves better.\", '--Jim Gay']\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Aspect Ratio': '1.85:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG (Parental Guidance Suggested)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.38 x 0.6 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': '1020528', 'Director': 'Joe Dante', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Run time': '1 hour and 42 minutes', 'Release date': 'June 3, 2003', 'Actors': 'Tom Hanks, Carrie Fisher, Bruce Dern, Corey Feldman, Rick Ducommun', 'Dubbed': 'French', 'Subtitles': 'English', 'Producers': 'Michael Finnell, Larry Brezner', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1), Unqualified, French (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround)', 'Studio': 'Universal Pictures Home Entertainment', 'Writers': 'Dana Olsen', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: One of my family's favorites\nReview Title: Five Stars\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (RPKG/DVD)\nReview Date: 2017/04/06\nStore: Various  (Actor, Director)    Rated:    PG    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, MGM Home Entertainment, All MGM Titles\nProduct Description: ['Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (RPKG/DVD)', ']]>']\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Comedy', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen, Dubbed', 'Contributor': 'Various', 'Language': 'French (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo), Spanish (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo), English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo), Unqualified', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 50 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.85:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG (Parental Guidance Suggested)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.6 x 5.4 x 7.5 inches; 0.32 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'FOXS1002729DVD', 'Director': 'Various', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen, Dubbed', 'Run time': '1 hour and 50 minutes', 'Release date': 'July 6, 2020', 'Actors': 'Various', 'Dubbed': 'Spanish', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish, French, Portuguese', 'Studio': 'WarnerBrothers', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: classic movie, a favorite\nReview Title: Five Stars\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Osdvd-Kingsman;The Secret Serv\nReview Date: 2017/04/06\nStore: Colin Firth  (Actor),     Jack Davenport  (Actor),     Matthew Vaughn  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Action & Adventure\nProduct Description: [\"A Super-Secret Organization recruits an unrefined but promising street kid into the agency's ultra-competitive training program just as a dire global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius.

Vanderpool aligns a range of interviews, from William Friedkin (director of', 'The Exorcist', ') to supernatural \"experts\" to, most convincingly, one of the priests that actually took part in the exorcism. (Their views are countered only by one doubting psychologist, so the documentary is hardly objective.) Unfortunately, Vanderpool also felt the need to use cheesy re-creations of the events, thereby lessening the film\\'s dramatic grip.
