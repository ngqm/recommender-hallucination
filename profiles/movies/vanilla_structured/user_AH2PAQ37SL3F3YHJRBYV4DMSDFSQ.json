But the idea of this movie is so original, I like the idea of our guys stealing one of our own nukes to threaten the Russians who stole some of our nuclear fuel to make a bomb and put it in the Saudi oil fields in an attempt to get the Israeli's off the west bank. It feels like a class B movie, but it is enjoyable all the same. This movie would make a great remake if done today, and considering some of the garbage that has been released lately, this one would be a big hit.\nReview Title: Great concept for storyline\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: High Road to China\nReview Date: 2016/11/13\nStore: Tom Selleck  (Actor),     Bess Armstrong  (Actor),     Brian G.

But the idea of this movie is so original, I like the idea of our guys stealing one of our own nukes to threaten the Russians who stole some of our nuclear fuel to make a bomb and put it in the Saudi oil fields in an attempt to get the Israeli's off the west bank.

But the idea of this movie is so original, I like the idea of our guys stealing one of our own nukes to threaten the Russians who stole some of our nuclear fuel to make a bomb and put it in the Saudi oil fields in an attempt to get the Israeli's off the west bank. It feels like a class B movie, but it is enjoyable all the same. This movie would make a great remake if done today, and considering some of the garbage that has been released lately, this one would be a big hit.\nReview Title: Great concept for storyline\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: High Road to China\nReview Date: 2016/11/13\nStore: Tom Selleck  (Actor),     Bess Armstrong  (Actor),     Brian G.

The one I received (you will say Big Deal, you got a freebie) is a double feature movie, it also has the movie &#34;Student Body&#34;  with it, so the cover jacket looks totally different, plus, since I like to keep an active list on a spread sheet of all my movies, AND use that list to put my collection in alphabetical order, how do you suppose I do this since there are 2 different titles on 1 Blu-Ray. Hey, if you all want to toss me a freebie movie, feel free, just don't add it on the same disc. Totally not happy, my OCD is kicking in and I really don't know what to do with this movie.\nReview Title: since I like to keep an active list on a spread sheet ...\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n    Structure your response as:\n   \n    SUMMARY:\n    [Final synthesis of preferences and patterns]",

      "McCall (Denzel Washington) has put his mysterious past behind him and is dedicated to living a new, quiet life. But when he meets Teri (Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz), a young girl under the control of ultra-violent Russian gangsters, he can\u2019t stand idly by. Armed with hidden skills that allow him to serve vengeance against anyone who would brutalize the helpless, McCall comes out of his self-imposed retirement and finds his desire for justice reawakened. If someone has a problem, if the odds are stacked against them, if they have nowhere else to turn, McCall will help. He is The Equalizer."
