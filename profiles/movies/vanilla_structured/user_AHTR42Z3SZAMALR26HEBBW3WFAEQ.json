The story begins as two soldiers, a war-weathered Bosnian and a rookie-soldier Serb, become stranded in a trench in &quot;no man's land&quot; together. The Serb's friend and fellow soldier is also in the trench, lying on top of a bouncing mine, which will detonante if he moves. The film shows the efforts of the the soldiers to elicit rescue by UNPROFOR peacekeepers. There tension and hostility between the soldiers in the trench alternate with moments of kindness, even tenderness, and genuine teamwork in their effort for rescue, until they remember that they hate each other. The French peacekeepers are ordered not to take action by their British commander, because it is too dangerous. A cunning French peacekeeper works behind the scenes, in conjunction with a BBC journalist, to pressure UNPROFOR to permit them to attempt an evacuation of the stranded soldiers. In the end, the rescue effort is to no avail and none of the three stranded soldiers are rescued alive. The movie is very real, from the Bosnian soldier's high-top basketball sneakers, the French UNPROFOR peacekeeper snoozing on duty, the Bosnian commander's lew flirting with the BBC journalist. This is a great picture, one of those movies that will come back to haunt you days after you've seen it.\nReview Title: a must-see for anyone who has spent time in the Balkans\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: The Harmonists [DVD]\nReview Date: 2003/02/01\nStore: Ben Becker  (Actor),     Heino Ferch  (Actor),     Joseph Vilsmaier  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Musicals & Performing Arts, Musicals\nProduct Description: ['Filled with topflight performances and unforgettable music, this entertaining and critically acclaimed story was cheered by audiences everywhere!

The story line is so gripping, it almost seems too contrived to be true.  And, given the immense talent and popularity of the group (in its heydey), I was surprised that I had never heard of them.  The story is about a group of six musicians, three of whom are Jewish, who rise to fame in Germany in 1930s.  Tension grows within the group as the Nazis become increasingly powerful in Germany.  After the group performs aboard the USS Saratoga in New York harbor, there is some question about whether they will return to Nazi Germany or stay in the US.  The group plays its final concert to a sold-out crowd shortly after the New York trip.  The movie will leave you wanting to know much more about its members, particularly Mr. Frommerman, and its music.  As an added bonus, the five-part harmonies are FANTASTIC.  This is one of the most gripping shows I've seen in several months, it came as a complete surprise.\nReview Title: Brilliant, gripping, and based on a true story!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Windtalkers\nReview Date: 2003/02/15\nStore: Nicolas Cage  (Actor),     Adam Beach  (Actor),     John Woo  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Action & Adventure\nProduct Description: ['During WWII, two U.S. Marines are assigned to protect two Navajo Marines code talkers.

That's about the extent of what I learned about the Navajo codetalkers in this film.  This was a gory, shoot-em-up war film, with plenty of Japs (conveniently identifiable by the twigs in their helmets) tumbling to the ground under American fire, lots of arms & legs being blown off, even a decapitation.  The rumble of gunfire serves as background noise at all times.  The Nicholas Cage character is meant to be an enigma -- he is neither particularly interesting nor particularly likeable,and his transformation (from skepticism of his Navajo assignee to respect for the Navajo) seems a bit too sudden.  There are some breathtaking shots of Navajo country at the end of the film, but it's not worth sitting through the rest of the film to see.  If you want a war movie, you won't necessarily be disappointed.  If you want a history lesson, don't spend your money on this.\nReview Title: this IS NOT about the Najavo codetalkers; it's a war film\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Tadpole\nReview Date: 2003/02/16\nStore: Sigourney Weaver  (Actor),     John Ritter  (Actor),     Gary Winick  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Studio Specials, Miramax Home Entertainment, All Titles\nProduct Description: [\"Sigourney Weaver (HEARTBREAKERS, GALAXY QUEST), John Ritter (SLING BLADE), and Bebe Neuwirth (LIBERTY HEIGHTS, THE FACULTY, TV's CHEERS) lead an outstanding cast of stars in a seductively irreverent coming-of-age comedy that critics absolutely adored.

Oscar, a precocious fifteen year old prep school student who quotes Voltaire and speaks French, is far, far too sophisticated to be bothered by the girls his age. Rather, his heart is focused on his step-mother, played by Sigourney Weaver.  He is a charmer, but completely unable to see the naivete of his youth.  His efforts to be adult -- gluing on fake sideburns and spouting philosophy to any willing audience are right on.  He seems to think that there is no reason he cannot be a serious contender for his step-mother's affections, and he courts her (his true intentions unbeknownst to her) by bringing her lunch at work, calling the terminology of her work (cardiological research) poetry, and playing tennis with her.  John Ritter plays the clueless history-professor-Dad to a tee.  I really liked this film -- from the title screen (where letters flitter across the screen in the shape of a tadpole) to the end, where Oscar is finally able to see the attractiveness of a girl his own age.

The story centers around Andie MacDowell's character's search for her Pulitzer-award-winning photographer husband, who was reportedly killed when a building collapses in the war. Sarah Lloyd (Andie) is convinced that her husband is still alive, so she leaves behind her two young children & her job at Newsweek to venture to Serb-held Vukovar to find him. Her journey is fraught with violence -- shortly after she crosses into Yugoslavia, she encounters a Serb roadblock, where her hitchhiker/passenger/guide, a charming Croatian student in Paris returning to find his wife & baby, is needlessly executed, the rented Audi is crushed by a tank, and Sarah barely escapes rape. She is \"rescued\" by fellow journalists, and undaunted, continues her seeming suicide mission to find her husband in Vukovar. The violence in this film rivals anything you'll find on screen (think two hours of the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan) and you'll hear the ... word at least once a minute -- but it is well worth seeing. It will foster an appreciation of what photojournalists go through to document history, putting themselves at risk certainly as much as the soldiers, without the support & protection of an Army being them (albeit voluntarily). My only concern is that the film may oversimplify the issues underlying the conflict -- it depicts Serbs as evil and Croats as - - well, not evil, providing a relatively safe haven for the journalists. However, the film is not so much about the conflict itself as it is about the sacrifices of the journalists covering the conflict.\nReview Title: tribute to journalists who died covering the Balkan conflict\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Little Voice [DVD]\nReview Date: 2003/04/11\nStore: Brenda Blethyn  (Actor),     Jane Horrocks  (Actor),     Mark Herman  (Director, Writer)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Studio Specials, Miramax Home Entertainment, All Titles\nProduct Description: ['Product Description', 'World-class stars Michael Caine (HANNAH AND HER SISTERS), Brenda Blethyn (SECRETS AND LIES), and Ewan McGregor (STAR WARS: EPISODE I, BLACK HAWK DOWN) deliver acclaimed performances in an inspirational story about a painfully shy young woman and how the power of music leads her to an amazing transformation!

LV is her mother's opposite -- a plain-jane, retiring type, silent, expressing herself only through the voices and words of the divas on her treasured record albums, finding solace in the framed portrait of her deceased father.

There are also some great clips of other wonderful performers -- A young, unpolished Alison Krauss, a young overly-polished George Jones in his crewcut days, singing \"White Lightning\", a young Porter Waggoner.  In addition, there is commentary by two rail-thin farmers, wearing overalls & fedoras & leaning on hoes in a field, talking about the backdrop against which bluegrass music gained and lost popularity, discussing the struggles of the depression and that crazy hip-swinging Elvis who had people \"throwing their babies at him\" and everything.

She and her gay executive husband are perceived as the perfect \"Mr. & Mrs. Magnatech\" leading the perfect suburban life.  Her dresses and hats and heels always match perfectly.  Her children address her as \"Mother\"; her maid addresses her as \"Mrs. Whitaker\", she refers to her husband as \"Mr. Whitaker\", and her children are scolded for using such words as \"geez\" -- because that language is not used in the Whitaker household.  The other reviews do a fine job of summarizing the plot and commenting on the acting.  I kept hoping that Moore would run off with her gardener in the end -- his character was the perfect gentleman, the perfect friend, the perfect single father.  He could tell when Moore was in need and reached out accordingly.  He had more heart, soul and courage than any other character in the film.  I found myself falling in love with the gardener in this film; the character was delicious and the acting was superb.\nReview Title: No happy endings in this film\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Johnny Cash - The Man, His World, His Music\nReview Date: 2003/10/03\nStore: Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Music Artists, Cash, Johnny\nProduct Description: ['Product Description', \"This 90 minute program contains many rare clips, including the Man in Black singing classic duets with his wife June Carter, Carl Perkins, and Bob Dylan This fascinating fly o n the wall documentary shot mainly on tour in the late '6 0's includes 21 song performances in many different setting s, plus unique footage of Cash relaxing and visiting with f riends and family.

It really is like one long home movie, scratchy, not at all slickly produced or well-edited, with footage of Johnny going about his daily routine, at home with his parents, walking through his now-vacant childhood home, on a farm with his children, visiting the gas station owner &amp; other folks in his home town, interspersed with footage of Johnny (and others, including June Carter &amp; her sisters) performing.  The performances are powerful, of course, but the real treat is seeing Johnny in his element, with his family &amp; old neighbors.  The only odd aspect of the film is that it devotes significant time to other aspiring performers who want to play for Johnny -- It's interesting, but what it shows about Johnny (his reaction to these aspiring writers &amp; performers) seems to be limited in comparison to the time given to others performing entire songs.  If you're looking for a slick musical production of Cash performing, you'll be disappointed.

There are places where Moore's biases come through loud & clear, but at most points in the film, Moore creates questions rather than prescribes cures.  I was expecting a film-length pitch for gun control, but the film delivered something very different.  I'm not sure what Moore's thesis is -- but the question posed is why does the United States have such horrific statistics on shooting homicides?  The statistics are alarming -- our statistics are orders of magnitude greater than those of other developed countries.  According to the film, Canada, England, & Germany have virtually no gun homicides, while the US has over 11000 a year (and in Canada, about 70% of homes have a gun).  Moore doesn't give pat answers -- violence on TV, our propensity towward military intervention abroad, heightened coverage of violence in news media that creates a culture of fear, exposure to guns at a young age, the proximity of missile-producing Lockheed Martin to Columbine, poverty -- who knows why American society is so violent??  Apparently, the Columbine shooters were enrolled in a Bowling phys ed class & went bowling on the morning of the shootings -- Moore sarcastically questions why bowling isn't blamed as a cause of the shootings.  Moore even explores a situation in which a six-year old boy shot & killed a classmate at his elementary school in Michigan, leading him to interview bus passengers on the bus ridden by the young shooter's mother, leading in turn to a pointed criticism of Michigan's welfare to work program.<br />Much about this film is disturbing --  footage of the shootings at Columbine, footage of executions in US-sanctioned military and police actions throughout history made me squirm.  And I was very uncomfortable during Moore's confrontations with K-Mart (who sold the ammunication used at Columbine), Charlton Heston (for his visit to Denver with the NRA shortly after the Columbine shootings), and Dick Clark (whom moore attempted to interview because the six-year-old shooter's mother was employed at a Dick Clark's Bandstand restaurant under Michigan's welfare-to-work program -- seems to stray a little off point). Moore comes off looking slightly annoying, but the film is a real eye-opener and well worth seeing, regardless of your position on Moore, the Second Amendment, and gun ownership.\nReview Title: meandering but thought-provoking look at gun violence in US\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: L'Auberge Espagnole (The Spanish Apartment)\nReview Date: 2004/01/11\nStore: Romain Duris  (Actor),     Judith Godrche  (Actor),     Cdric Klapisch  (Director, Writer)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Comedy\nProduct Description: ['Seven sexy co-eds.

I found it to be perfectly delightful, and the funniest film (in a laugh-out-loud way) I've seen in a long time.  Xavier, the lead character, is a French student who is advised to learn Spanish in order for his father's friend to place him in a plum economics job in Paris.  So, gullible &amp; a little happless, Xavier grabs his backpack &amp; dons his Levis, and marches off to Barcelona to study abroad in the Erasmus program.  The first scenes in which Xavier is trying to navigate his way around Barcelona, struggling under the load of his luggage and his inability to speak Spanish, reminded me of the challenges of being a stranger in a strange land.  Xavier eventually finds himself being interviewed for a space in a chaotic apartment shared by a Brit, an Italian, a Dane, a German and a Spaniard.  More than anything, he wants to be accepted into this apartment, and ultimately, he is.  During the course of the year, he takes seduction lessons from a lesbian woman in one of his courses, seduces a French physician's wife, seemingly forgets about his girlfriend Martine back home (Audrey Tautou), and then tries to reclaim her after she's broken up with him.  The year abroad is so full of promise, excitement, learning (and he does, in fact, learn Spanish).  After Xavier returns home to Paris from his year abroad, the film shows him eating a steak dinner with his hippie mother at their kitchen table -- underscoring the fact that the vacation is over.  No more twelve different bottles of beer &amp; various international sauces and a million different langage being shouted across the crowded table in the Spanish apartment -- this is back to real, DULL life.  It perfectly depicted the let down one feels (or at least I feel) after a fascinating trip abroad.<br /><br />I disagree with the reviewer who found the lead character despicable, and found his change of heart at the end of the film (abandoning his high-finance job) inexplicable.  This is a coming of age film that perfectly explains the decision, and when the protagonist runs away from bureaucracy in the end to pursue his goals of being a writer, I found myself cheering.  Had Xavier accepted the suit job analyzing markets, with the only excitement idle gossip with fellow suits over the water cooler, I don't think the viewer would think that Xavier learned anything from his time abroad.  The film capitalizes on stereotypess of Europeans (the German is very organized, the Italian carefree, the Brit responsible . . . ) in an entertaining way.  The filmmaking is also very interesting and well-done.  This movie is one to buy and share; it's not merely a renter.\nReview Title: captures the thrill of travel abroad\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Chinese for Kids: Learn Chinese Beginning Level 1 Volume 1\nReview Date: 2007/01/14\nStore: Chinese for Kids-Beginner Level 1  (Actor),     Donovan Miller  (Director)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Independently Distributed, Kids & Family\nProduct Description: ['Product Description', 'CHINESE FOR KIDS vol. 1 bring fun and excitement to language learning.

It is about identical twin boys who have an idyllic early childhood in Montana, recognize their homosexuality, grow apart, become rebellious drug abusers as teenagers, attempt a joint suicide, are shipped off to separate boarding schools and denied contact with one another, and later reunite.  As young adults, one of the twins identifies as transgendered, which the other twin reads as a personal rejection, but later comes to understand and support.  The film culminates with Clare's surgery and emergence as a more confident woman, and shows Clare's acceptance as a woman by both her twin and by her parents.  Meanwhile, Mark struggles with finding a positive romantic relationship and preserving that relationship, once found.<br /><br />Okay, that's a lot to pack into one movie, but it never seems over the top, preachy, or overdone.  The characters are all very real -- revealing their frustrations, anger, and vulnerability, as well as their tender sides.  In the beginning, Clare comes across as whiny and self-pitying.  Her twin, Mark, comes across as resentful and a tad self-centered.  Their mother comes across as frustrated and not-wholly-accepting of her son & daughter.  As the characters reveal more of themselves, they all become much more likeable and real.  Clare, in particular, is much more attractive as a person once she settles into her womanhood and Mark is much more likeable once he has accepted Clare as she is.<br /><br />Clare and Mark must be very bright and very talented and somewhat well-off, as they don't appear to face financial struggles (Clare goes to Sarah Lawrence and takes a cab to school each day.  Mark is in art school.)<br /><br />The film is very \"real\" and very \"intimate\" for lack of a better description.  It doesn't appear to be contrived or staged, and much of the camera work is done by Mark & Clare.  It gives you a behind the scenes look at their relationship, their struggles with family and parents and friends, and their personal struggles.  By the end of the film, I found both of the main characters to be intriguing and likeable, and the film leaves me wanting to know more about them and hoping that they find success and happiness in life.\nReview Title: absolutely fascinating and thought-provoking\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Beginning Gymnastics for Girls Skills and Drills from Coach Steve Nunno\nReview Date: 2009/02/28\nStore: Steve Nunno  (Actor),     Bill Richardson  (Director)    Rated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Independently Distributed, Kids & Family\nProduct Description: ['Product Description', \"Learn basic gymnastics skills and drills from one of the world's top coaches.

He is so pleasant, encouraging, soft-spoken -- and he knows exactly how to talk to and instruct the most inexperienced beginners in the most basic of skills -- it is difficult to imagine that he also coaches the world's finest gymnasts.

His emphasis is on keeping it fun and helping kids overcome the fear factor.<br /><br />This video is no-frills and no-nonsense.  It shows several young women gymnasts demonstrating skills using what Nunno refers to as \"progressions\" -- building on skills one step at a time to learn how to perform increasingly difficult skills.  Nunno provides clear instruction on proper body position, alignment, and technique.<br /><br />The focus is on beginning skills.  The video covers biomechanics, stretches, and basic floor skills -- forward and backward rolls, cartwheels and roundoffs, and back walkover on floor.  On the balance beam, the most challenging stunt is the roundoff dismount.  The sections on vault and uneven bars are excellent in showing how to get started on the apparatus, working up to more challenging skills.<br /><br />There's plenty in here that you could do at home -- and the instructions are so clear and the moves so basic that most kids could follow along on their own.

The vignettes are well-acted, and they are at times laugh--out-loud funny and at other times on the verge of offensive (I found the last vignette featuring Zoe Saldana very difficult to enjoy, even though I was well-aware that it was satire).  The most laughs, by far, came in the vignette depicting a gay couple's experience adopting a child, which in itself is worth the price of the film, although even that vignette was not without its disturbing points.<br /><br />This film is not for the faint of heart.  Each of the five segments stands alone, so there is no need to take them all in in a single setting.  I found that I enjoyed the film more watching just one or two vignettes at a time, as they are pretty twisted.\nReview Title: five twisted tales, not for the easily offended\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Father of Invention\nReview Date: 2011/11/20\nStore: Kevin Spacey  (Actor, Producer),     Camilla Belle  (Actor),     Trent Cooper  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Comedy\nProduct Description: [\"Millionaire infomercial guru, Robert Axle (Kevin Spacey) loses everything when one of his inventions has a design flaw that accidentally chops off the fingers of thousands of customers.

If you don't try to believe the story -- it's pretty unbelievable and highly unlikely -- and just take it for what it is, it's not a bad movie.  Not a great movie, but I still enjoyed it.  The acting is very good; the story isn't particularly compelling.  It starts with Robert Axle (Spacey) leaving prison after completing his sentence for -- selling a dangerous  product, the Ab Clicker, a combination ab roller / TV remote controller).  The fact that he would face criminal liability for designing an exercise/novelty product that injured folks doesn't make a lot of sense to me -- nor does the Spacey character in general.  He doesn't come across as an evil person who needs to be redeemed, but the movie is largely about his redemption, as a father and a friend.  Parts of the film really make no sense to me --the odd relantionship between Axle and his daughter's angryy lesbian (?) gym-teacher roommate.  Not sure how that advanced the film.

The story begins as two soldiers, a war-weathered Bosnian and a rookie-soldier Serb, become stranded in a trench in &quot;no man's land&quot; together. The Serb's friend and fellow soldier is also in the trench, lying on top of a bouncing mine, which will detonante if he moves. The film shows the efforts of the the soldiers to elicit rescue by UNPROFOR peacekeepers. There tension and hostility between the soldiers in the trench alternate with moments of kindness, even tenderness, and genuine teamwork in their effort for rescue, until they remember that they hate each other. The French peacekeepers are ordered not to take action by their British commander, because it is too dangerous. A cunning French peacekeeper works behind the scenes, in conjunction with a BBC journalist, to pressure UNPROFOR to permit them to attempt an evacuation of the stranded soldiers. In the end, the rescue effort is to no avail and none of the three stranded soldiers are rescued alive. The movie is very real, from the Bosnian soldier's high-top basketball sneakers, the French UNPROFOR peacekeeper snoozing on duty, the Bosnian commander's lew flirting with the BBC journalist. This is a great picture, one of those movies that will come back to haunt you days after you've seen it.\na must-see for anyone who has spent time in the Balkans\nThe Harmonists [DVD]\nBen Becker  (Actor),     Heino Ferch  (Actor),     Joseph Vilsmaier  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Musicals & Performing Arts, Musicals\n['Filled with topflight performances and unforgettable music, this entertaining and critically acclaimed story was cheered by audiences everywhere!

The story line is so gripping, it almost seems too contrived to be true.  And, given the immense talent and popularity of the group (in its heydey), I was surprised that I had never heard of them.  The story is about a group of six musicians, three of whom are Jewish, who rise to fame in Germany in 1930s.  Tension grows within the group as the Nazis become increasingly powerful in Germany.  After the group performs aboard the USS Saratoga in New York harbor, there is some question about whether they will return to Nazi Germany or stay in the US.  The group plays its final concert to a sold-out crowd shortly after the New York trip.  The movie will leave you wanting to know much more about its members, particularly Mr. Frommerman, and its music.  As an added bonus, the five-part harmonies are FANTASTIC.

That's about the extent of what I learned about the Navajo codetalkers in this film.  This was a gory, shoot-em-up war film, with plenty of Japs (conveniently identifiable by the twigs in their helmets) tumbling to the ground under American fire, lots of arms & legs being blown off, even a decapitation.  The rumble of gunfire serves as background noise at all times.  The Nicholas Cage character is meant to be an enigma -- he is neither particularly interesting nor particularly likeable,and his transformation (from skepticism of his Navajo assignee to respect for the Navajo) seems a bit too sudden.  There are some breathtaking shots of Navajo country at the end of the film, but it's not worth sitting through the rest of the film to see.

Oscar, a precocious fifteen year old prep school student who quotes Voltaire and speaks French, is far, far too sophisticated to be bothered by the girls his age. Rather, his heart is focused on his step-mother, played by Sigourney Weaver.  He is a charmer, but completely unable to see the naivete of his youth.  His efforts to be adult -- gluing on fake sideburns and spouting philosophy to any willing audience are right on.  He seems to think that there is no reason he cannot be a serious contender for his step-mother's affections, and he courts her (his true intentions unbeknownst to her) by bringing her lunch at work, calling the terminology of her work (cardiological research) poetry, and playing tennis with her.  John Ritter plays the clueless history-professor-Dad to a tee.

The story centers around Andie MacDowell's character's search for her Pulitzer-award-winning photographer husband, who was reportedly killed when a building collapses in the war. Sarah Lloyd (Andie) is convinced that her husband is still alive, so she leaves behind her two young children & her job at Newsweek to venture to Serb-held Vukovar to find him. Her journey is fraught with violence -- shortly after she crosses into Yugoslavia, she encounters a Serb roadblock, where her hitchhiker/passenger/guide, a charming Croatian student in Paris returning to find his wife & baby, is needlessly executed, the rented Audi is crushed by a tank, and Sarah barely escapes rape. She is \"rescued\" by fellow journalists, and undaunted, continues her seeming suicide mission to find her husband in Vukovar. The violence in this film rivals anything you'll find on screen (think two hours of the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan) and you'll hear the ... word at least once a minute -- but it is well worth seeing. It will foster an appreciation of what photojournalists go through to document history, putting themselves at risk certainly as much as the soldiers, without the support & protection of an Army being them (albeit voluntarily). My only concern is that the film may oversimplify the issues underlying the conflict -- it depicts Serbs as evil and Croats as - - well, not evil, providing a relatively safe haven for the journalists. However, the film is not so much about the conflict itself as it is about the sacrifices of the journalists covering the conflict.\ntribute to journalists who died covering the Balkan conflict\nLittle Voice [DVD]\nBrenda Blethyn  (Actor),     Jane Horrocks  (Actor),     Mark Herman  (Director, Writer)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Studio Specials, Miramax Home Entertainment, All Titles\n['Product Description', 'World-class stars Michael Caine (HANNAH AND HER SISTERS), Brenda Blethyn (SECRETS AND LIES), and Ewan McGregor (STAR WARS: EPISODE I, BLACK HAWK DOWN) deliver acclaimed performances in an inspirational story about a painfully shy young woman and how the power of music leads her to an amazing transformation!

Michael Caine is wonderful, but I thought that LV's mother & her tagalong friend, silent Sadie, stole the show.  LV's mother is a loud, middle-aged floozy who wears pushup bras, micromini skirts, towering heels & lace tightsn and prattles on nonstop in a barely decipherable accent and odd syntax (I kept the subtitles on during the entire film -- a big help.)  Her best friend Sadie is a chubby, funny-faced follower who never speaks -- the mother babbles nonstop & no one else has a chance to get a word in edgewise.  LV is her mother's opposite -- a plain-jane, retiring type, silent, expressing herself only through the voices and words of the divas on her treasured record albums, finding solace in the framed portrait of her deceased father.  The plot keeps you on edge, but all is resolved positively in the end.  As an added bonus, Jane Horrocks (LV) is, in fact, an incredible performer, able to mimic everyone from Judy Garland in Wizard Oz to Marilyn Monroe singing \"Happy Birthday.\"\npart comedy, part tragedy, part horror film\nHigh Lonesome - The Story of Bluegrass Music\nLester Flatt  (Actor),     Jimmy Martin  (Actor),     Rachel Liebling  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Music Videos & Concerts\n['Product Description', 'This 95 minute DVD feature film traces the evolution, from folk roots in the Kentucky hills through innovations which shaped modern forms.

There are also some great clips of other wonderful performers -- A young, unpolished Alison Krauss, a young overly-polished George Jones in his crewcut days, singing \"White Lightning\", a young Porter Waggoner.  In addition, there is commentary by two rail-thin farmers, wearing overalls & fedoras & leaning on hoes in a field, talking about the backdrop against which bluegrass music gained and lost popularity, discussing the struggles of the depression and that crazy hip-swinging Elvis who had people \"throwing their babies at him\" and everything.  This is such a great DVD -- I know that I'll watch this again and again, and share it with several of my friends and family (and I'm half tempted to run out & buy myself a banjo and spend the next few years trying to learn to play like Earl Scruggs.)\na must if you love traditional bluegrass\nFar from Heaven\nJulianne Moore  (Actor),     Dennis Quaid  (Actor),     Todd Haynes  (Director, Writer)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Studio Specials, Focus Features, All Titles\n['Julianne Moore (Hannibal, Boogie Nights) and Dennis Quaid (The Rookie, Frequency) star in this seductive story of a seemingly perfect family, and the forbidden desires that threaten to tear them apart.

She and her gay executive husband are perceived as the perfect \"Mr. & Mrs. Magnatech\" leading the perfect suburban life.  Her dresses and hats and heels always match perfectly.  Her children address her as \"Mother\"; her maid addresses her as \"Mrs. Whitaker\", she refers to her husband as \"Mr. Whitaker\", and her children are scolded for using such words as \"geez\" -- because that language is not used in the Whitaker household.  The other reviews do a fine job of summarizing the plot and commenting on the acting.  I kept hoping that Moore would run off with her gardener in the end -- his character was the perfect gentleman, the perfect friend, the perfect single father.  He could tell when Moore was in need and reached out accordingly.  He had more heart, soul and courage than any other character in the film.

The performances are powerful, of course, but the real treat is seeing Johnny in his element, with his family &amp; old neighbors.  The only odd aspect of the film is that it devotes significant time to other aspiring performers who want to play for Johnny -- It's interesting, but what it shows about Johnny (his reaction to these aspiring writers &amp; performers) seems to be limited in comparison to the time given to others performing entire songs.  If you're looking for a slick musical production of Cash performing, you'll be disappointed.

There are places where Moore's biases come through loud & clear, but at most points in the film, Moore creates questions rather than prescribes cures.  I was expecting a film-length pitch for gun control, but the film delivered something very different.  I'm not sure what Moore's thesis is -- but the question posed is why does the United States have such horrific statistics on shooting homicides?  The statistics are alarming -- our statistics are orders of magnitude greater than those of other developed countries.  According to the film, Canada, England, & Germany have virtually no gun homicides, while the US has over 11000 a year (and in Canada, about 70% of homes have a gun).  Moore doesn't give pat answers -- violence on TV, our propensity towward military intervention abroad, heightened coverage of violence in news media that creates a culture of fear, exposure to guns at a young age, the proximity of missile-producing Lockheed Martin to Columbine, poverty -- who knows why American society is so violent??  Apparently, the Columbine shooters were enrolled in a Bowling phys ed class & went bowling on the morning of the shootings -- Moore sarcastically questions why bowling isn't blamed as a cause of the shootings.  Moore even explores a situation in which a six-year old boy shot & killed a classmate at his elementary school in Michigan, leading him to interview bus passengers on the bus ridden by the young shooter's mother, leading in turn to a pointed criticism of Michigan's welfare to work program.<br />Much about this film is disturbing --  footage of the shootings at Columbine, footage of executions in US-sanctioned military and police actions throughout history made me squirm.  And I was very uncomfortable during Moore's confrontations with K-Mart (who sold the ammunication used at Columbine), Charlton Heston (for his visit to Denver with the NRA shortly after the Columbine shootings), and Dick Clark (whom moore attempted to interview because the six-year-old shooter's mother was employed at a Dick Clark's Bandstand restaurant under Michigan's welfare-to-work program -- seems to stray a little off point). Moore comes off looking slightly annoying, but the film is a real eye-opener and well worth seeing, regardless of your position on Moore, the Second Amendment, and gun ownership.\nmeandering but thought-provoking look at gun violence in US\nL'Auberge Espagnole (The Spanish Apartment)\nRomain Duris  (Actor),     Judith Godrche  (Actor),     Cdric Klapisch  (Director, Writer)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Comedy\n['Seven sexy co-eds.

I found it to be perfectly delightful, and the funniest film (in a laugh-out-loud way) I've seen in a long time.  Xavier, the lead character, is a French student who is advised to learn Spanish in order for his father's friend to place him in a plum economics job in Paris.  So, gullible &amp; a little happless, Xavier grabs his backpack &amp; dons his Levis, and marches off to Barcelona to study abroad in the Erasmus program.  The first scenes in which Xavier is trying to navigate his way around Barcelona, struggling under the load of his luggage and his inability to speak Spanish, reminded me of the challenges of being a stranger in a strange land.  Xavier eventually finds himself being interviewed for a space in a chaotic apartment shared by a Brit, an Italian, a Dane, a German and a Spaniard.  More than anything, he wants to be accepted into this apartment, and ultimately, he is.  During the course of the year, he takes seduction lessons from a lesbian woman in one of his courses, seduces a French physician's wife, seemingly forgets about his girlfriend Martine back home (Audrey Tautou), and then tries to reclaim her after she's broken up with him.  The year abroad is so full of promise, excitement, learning (and he does, in fact, learn Spanish).  After Xavier returns home to Paris from his year abroad, the film shows him eating a steak dinner with his hippie mother at their kitchen table -- underscoring the fact that the vacation is over.  No more twelve different bottles of beer &amp; various international sauces and a million different langage being shouted across the crowded table in the Spanish apartment -- this is back to real, DULL life.  It perfectly depicted the let down one feels (or at least I feel) after a fascinating trip abroad.<br /><br />I disagree with the reviewer who found the lead character despicable, and found his change of heart at the end of the film (abandoning his high-finance job) inexplicable.  This is a coming of age film that perfectly explains the decision, and when the protagonist runs away from bureaucracy in the end to pursue his goals of being a writer, I found myself cheering.  Had Xavier accepted the suit job analyzing markets, with the only excitement idle gossip with fellow suits over the water cooler, I don't think the viewer would think that Xavier learned anything from his time abroad.  The film capitalizes on stereotypess of Europeans (the German is very organized, the Italian carefree, the Brit responsible . . . ) in an entertaining way.  The filmmaking is also very interesting and well-done.  This movie is one to buy and share; it's not merely a renter.\ncaptures the thrill of travel abroad\nChinese for Kids: Learn Chinese Beginning Level 1 Volume 1\nChinese for Kids-Beginner Level 1  (Actor),     Donovan Miller  (Director)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Independently Distributed, Kids & Family\n['Product Description', 'CHINESE FOR KIDS vol. 1 bring fun and excitement to language learning.

It is about identical twin boys who have an idyllic early childhood in Montana, recognize their homosexuality, grow apart, become rebellious drug abusers as teenagers, attempt a joint suicide, are shipped off to separate boarding schools and denied contact with one another, and later reunite.  As young adults, one of the twins identifies as transgendered, which the other twin reads as a personal rejection, but later comes to understand and support.  The film culminates with Clare's surgery and emergence as a more confident woman, and shows Clare's acceptance as a woman by both her twin and by her parents.  Meanwhile, Mark struggles with finding a positive romantic relationship and preserving that relationship, once found.<br /><br />Okay, that's a lot to pack into one movie, but it never seems over the top, preachy, or overdone.  The characters are all very real -- revealing their frustrations, anger, and vulnerability, as well as their tender sides.  In the beginning, Clare comes across as whiny and self-pitying.  Her twin, Mark, comes across as resentful and a tad self-centered.  Their mother comes across as frustrated and not-wholly-accepting of her son & daughter.  As the characters reveal more of themselves, they all become much more likeable and real.  Clare, in particular, is much more attractive as a person once she settles into her womanhood and Mark is much more likeable once he has accepted Clare as she is.<br /><br />Clare and Mark must be very bright and very talented and somewhat well-off, as they don't appear to face financial struggles (Clare goes to Sarah Lawrence and takes a cab to school each day.

It's well worth the price for someone wishing to learn basic gymastics skills, learn about the various apparatus used in women's gymnastics, and learn the names of basic skills, stunts, and techniques.<br /><br />Steve Nunno, a two-time Olympics coach, U of Oklahoma coach, and coach to numerous elite athletes, narrates this instructive guide.  He is so pleasant, encouraging, soft-spoken -- and he knows exactly how to talk to and instruct the most inexperienced beginners in the most basic of skills -- it is difficult to imagine that he also coaches the world's finest gymnasts.  The only time he seemed anything other than laid back was when he was explaining just how much fun vaulting can be if you understand how to do it.  His emphasis is on keeping it fun and helping kids overcome the fear factor.<br /><br />This video is no-frills and no-nonsense.  It shows several young women gymnasts demonstrating skills using what Nunno refers to as \"progressions\" -- building on skills one step at a time to learn how to perform increasingly difficult skills.  Nunno provides clear instruction on proper body position, alignment, and technique.<br /><br />The focus is on beginning skills.  The video covers biomechanics, stretches, and basic floor skills -- forward and backward rolls, cartwheels and roundoffs, and back walkover on floor.  On the balance beam, the most challenging stunt is the roundoff dismount.  The sections on vault and uneven bars are excellent in showing how to get started on the apparatus, working up to more challenging skills.<br /><br />There's plenty in here that you could do at home -- and the instructions are so clear and the moves so basic that most kids could follow along on their own. Great video for parents and kids alike.\nExcellent!

The story begins as two soldiers, a war-weathered Bosnian and a rookie-soldier Serb, become stranded in a trench in &quot;no man's land&quot; together. The Serb's friend and fellow soldier is also in the trench, lying on top of a bouncing mine, which will detonante if he moves. The film shows the efforts of the the soldiers to elicit rescue by UNPROFOR peacekeepers. There tension and hostility between the soldiers in the trench alternate with moments of kindness, even tenderness, and genuine teamwork in their effort for rescue, until they remember that they hate each other. The French peacekeepers are ordered not to take action by their British commander, because it is too dangerous. A cunning French peacekeeper works behind the scenes, in conjunction with a BBC journalist, to pressure UNPROFOR to permit them to attempt an evacuation of the stranded soldiers. In the end, the rescue effort is to no avail and none of the three stranded soldiers are rescued alive. The movie is very real, from the Bosnian soldier's high-top basketball sneakers, the French UNPROFOR peacekeeper snoozing on duty, the Bosnian commander's lew flirting with the BBC journalist. This is a great picture, one of those movies that will come back to haunt you days after you've seen it.\nReview Title: a must-see for anyone who has spent time in the Balkans\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: The Harmonists [DVD]\nReview Date: 2003/02/01\nStore: Ben Becker  (Actor),     Heino Ferch  (Actor),     Joseph Vilsmaier  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Musicals & Performing Arts, Musicals\nProduct Description: ['Filled with topflight performances and unforgettable music, this entertaining and critically acclaimed story was cheered by audiences everywhere!

The story line is so gripping, it almost seems too contrived to be true.  And, given the immense talent and popularity of the group (in its heydey), I was surprised that I had never heard of them.  The story is about a group of six musicians, three of whom are Jewish, who rise to fame in Germany in 1930s.  Tension grows within the group as the Nazis become increasingly powerful in Germany.  After the group performs aboard the USS Saratoga in New York harbor, there is some question about whether they will return to Nazi Germany or stay in the US.  The group plays its final concert to a sold-out crowd shortly after the New York trip.  The movie will leave you wanting to know much more about its members, particularly Mr. Frommerman, and its music.  As an added bonus, the five-part harmonies are FANTASTIC.

That's about the extent of what I learned about the Navajo codetalkers in this film.  This was a gory, shoot-em-up war film, with plenty of Japs (conveniently identifiable by the twigs in their helmets) tumbling to the ground under American fire, lots of arms & legs being blown off, even a decapitation.  The rumble of gunfire serves as background noise at all times.  The Nicholas Cage character is meant to be an enigma -- he is neither particularly interesting nor particularly likeable,and his transformation (from skepticism of his Navajo assignee to respect for the Navajo) seems a bit too sudden.  There are some breathtaking shots of Navajo country at the end of the film, but it's not worth sitting through the rest of the film to see.  If you want a war movie, you won't necessarily be disappointed.

Oscar, a precocious fifteen year old prep school student who quotes Voltaire and speaks French, is far, far too sophisticated to be bothered by the girls his age. Rather, his heart is focused on his step-mother, played by Sigourney Weaver.  He is a charmer, but completely unable to see the naivete of his youth.  His efforts to be adult -- gluing on fake sideburns and spouting philosophy to any willing audience are right on.  He seems to think that there is no reason he cannot be a serious contender for his step-mother's affections, and he courts her (his true intentions unbeknownst to her) by bringing her lunch at work, calling the terminology of her work (cardiological research) poetry, and playing tennis with her.  John Ritter plays the clueless history-professor-Dad to a tee.  I really liked this film -- from the title screen (where letters flitter across the screen in the shape of a tadpole) to the end, where Oscar is finally able to see the attractiveness of a girl his own age.

Though MacDowell isn't a great actress, all the performances are solid, and Brody is outstanding.\", '--Bret Fetzer']\nAverage Rating: 4.6\nProduct Details: {'Aspect Ratio': '2.35:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Package Dimensions': '7.1 x 5.42 x 0.58 inches; 4.8 Ounces', 'Director': 'Elie Chouraqui', 'Media Format': 'Dolby, DTS Surround Sound, NTSC, Widescreen, Subtitled', 'Run time': '2 hours and 2 minutes', 'Release date': 'January 21, 2003', 'Actors': 'Andie MacDowell, Elias Koteas, Brendan Gleeson, Adrien Brody, David Strathairn', 'Subtitles': 'Spanish, French', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1), English (DTS 5.1)', 'Studio': 'Universal Studios Home Entertainment', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: Reviewer: A viewer from Kansas City, MO<br />This gripping film is a tribute to the 40+ journalists who died covering the war in the Balkans. The story centers around Andie MacDowell's character's search for her Pulitzer-award-winning photographer husband, who was reportedly killed when a building collapses in the war. Sarah Lloyd (Andie) is convinced that her husband is still alive, so she leaves behind her two young children & her job at Newsweek to venture to Serb-held Vukovar to find him. Her journey is fraught with violence -- shortly after she crosses into Yugoslavia, she encounters a Serb roadblock, where her hitchhiker/passenger/guide, a charming Croatian student in Paris returning to find his wife & baby, is needlessly executed, the rented Audi is crushed by a tank, and Sarah barely escapes rape. She is \"rescued\" by fellow journalists, and undaunted, continues her seeming suicide mission to find her husband in Vukovar. The violence in this film rivals anything you'll find on screen (think two hours of the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan) and you'll hear the ... word at least once a minute -- but it is well worth seeing. It will foster an appreciation of what photojournalists go through to document history, putting themselves at risk certainly as much as the soldiers, without the support & protection of an Army being them (albeit voluntarily). My only concern is that the film may oversimplify the issues underlying the conflict -- it depicts Serbs as evil and Croats as - - well, not evil, providing a relatively safe haven for the journalists. However, the film is not so much about the conflict itself as it is about the sacrifices of the journalists covering the conflict.\nReview Title: tribute to journalists who died covering the Balkan conflict\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Little Voice [DVD]\nReview Date: 2003/04/11\nStore: Brenda Blethyn  (Actor),     Jane Horrocks  (Actor),     Mark Herman  (Director, Writer)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Studio Specials, Miramax Home Entertainment, All Titles\nProduct Description: ['Product Description', 'World-class stars Michael Caine (HANNAH AND HER SISTERS), Brenda Blethyn (SECRETS AND LIES), and Ewan McGregor (STAR WARS: EPISODE I, BLACK HAWK DOWN) deliver acclaimed performances in an inspirational story about a painfully shy young woman and how the power of music leads her to an amazing transformation!

Michael Caine is wonderful, but I thought that LV's mother & her tagalong friend, silent Sadie, stole the show.  LV's mother is a loud, middle-aged floozy who wears pushup bras, micromini skirts, towering heels & lace tightsn and prattles on nonstop in a barely decipherable accent and odd syntax (I kept the subtitles on during the entire film -- a big help.)  Her best friend Sadie is a chubby, funny-faced follower who never speaks -- the mother babbles nonstop & no one else has a chance to get a word in edgewise.  LV is her mother's opposite -- a plain-jane, retiring type, silent, expressing herself only through the voices and words of the divas on her treasured record albums, finding solace in the framed portrait of her deceased father.  The plot keeps you on edge, but all is resolved positively in the end.  As an added bonus, Jane Horrocks (LV) is, in fact, an incredible performer, able to mimic everyone from Judy Garland in Wizard Oz to Marilyn Monroe singing \"Happy Birthday.\"\nReview Title: part comedy, part tragedy, part horror film\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: High Lonesome - The Story of Bluegrass Music\nReview Date: 2003/04/13\nStore: Lester Flatt  (Actor),     Jimmy Martin  (Actor),     Rachel Liebling  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Music Videos & Concerts\nProduct Description: ['Product Description', 'This 95 minute DVD feature film traces the evolution, from folk roots in the Kentucky hills through innovations which shaped modern forms.

There are also some great clips of other wonderful performers -- A young, unpolished Alison Krauss, a young overly-polished George Jones in his crewcut days, singing \"White Lightning\", a young Porter Waggoner.  In addition, there is commentary by two rail-thin farmers, wearing overalls & fedoras & leaning on hoes in a field, talking about the backdrop against which bluegrass music gained and lost popularity, discussing the struggles of the depression and that crazy hip-swinging Elvis who had people \"throwing their babies at him\" and everything.  This is such a great DVD -- I know that I'll watch this again and again, and share it with several of my friends and family (and I'm half tempted to run out & buy myself a banjo and spend the next few years trying to learn to play like Earl Scruggs.)\nReview Title: a must if you love traditional bluegrass\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Far from Heaven\nReview Date: 2003/04/16\nStore: Julianne Moore  (Actor),     Dennis Quaid  (Actor),     Todd Haynes  (Director, Writer)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Studio Specials, Focus Features, All Titles\nProduct Description: ['Julianne Moore (Hannibal, Boogie Nights) and Dennis Quaid (The Rookie, Frequency) star in this seductive story of a seemingly perfect family, and the forbidden desires that threaten to tear them apart.

She and her gay executive husband are perceived as the perfect \"Mr. & Mrs. Magnatech\" leading the perfect suburban life.  Her dresses and hats and heels always match perfectly.  Her children address her as \"Mother\"; her maid addresses her as \"Mrs. Whitaker\", she refers to her husband as \"Mr. Whitaker\", and her children are scolded for using such words as \"geez\" -- because that language is not used in the Whitaker household.  The other reviews do a fine job of summarizing the plot and commenting on the acting.  I kept hoping that Moore would run off with her gardener in the end -- his character was the perfect gentleman, the perfect friend, the perfect single father.  He could tell when Moore was in need and reached out accordingly.  He had more heart, soul and courage than any other character in the film.

The performances are powerful, of course, but the real treat is seeing Johnny in his element, with his family &amp; old neighbors.  The only odd aspect of the film is that it devotes significant time to other aspiring performers who want to play for Johnny -- It's interesting, but what it shows about Johnny (his reaction to these aspiring writers &amp; performers) seems to be limited in comparison to the time given to others performing entire songs.

There are places where Moore's biases come through loud & clear, but at most points in the film, Moore creates questions rather than prescribes cures.  I was expecting a film-length pitch for gun control, but the film delivered something very different.  I'm not sure what Moore's thesis is -- but the question posed is why does the United States have such horrific statistics on shooting homicides?  The statistics are alarming -- our statistics are orders of magnitude greater than those of other developed countries.  According to the film, Canada, England, & Germany have virtually no gun homicides, while the US has over 11000 a year (and in Canada, about 70% of homes have a gun).  Moore doesn't give pat answers -- violence on TV, our propensity towward military intervention abroad, heightened coverage of violence in news media that creates a culture of fear, exposure to guns at a young age, the proximity of missile-producing Lockheed Martin to Columbine, poverty -- who knows why American society is so violent??  Apparently, the Columbine shooters were enrolled in a Bowling phys ed class & went bowling on the morning of the shootings -- Moore sarcastically questions why bowling isn't blamed as a cause of the shootings.  Moore even explores a situation in which a six-year old boy shot & killed a classmate at his elementary school in Michigan, leading him to interview bus passengers on the bus ridden by the young shooter's mother, leading in turn to a pointed criticism of Michigan's welfare to work program.<br />Much about this film is disturbing --  footage of the shootings at Columbine, footage of executions in US-sanctioned military and police actions throughout history made me squirm.  And I was very uncomfortable during Moore's confrontations with K-Mart (who sold the ammunication used at Columbine), Charlton Heston (for his visit to Denver with the NRA shortly after the Columbine shootings), and Dick Clark (whom moore attempted to interview because the six-year-old shooter's mother was employed at a Dick Clark's Bandstand restaurant under Michigan's welfare-to-work program -- seems to stray a little off point). Moore comes off looking slightly annoying, but the film is a real eye-opener and well worth seeing, regardless of your position on Moore, the Second Amendment, and gun ownership.\nReview Title: meandering but thought-provoking look at gun violence in US\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: L'Auberge Espagnole (The Spanish Apartment)\nReview Date: 2004/01/11\nStore: Romain Duris  (Actor),     Judith Godrche  (Actor),     Cdric Klapisch  (Director, Writer)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Comedy\nProduct Description: ['Seven sexy co-eds.

I found it to be perfectly delightful, and the funniest film (in a laugh-out-loud way) I've seen in a long time.  Xavier, the lead character, is a French student who is advised to learn Spanish in order for his father's friend to place him in a plum economics job in Paris.  So, gullible &amp; a little happless, Xavier grabs his backpack &amp; dons his Levis, and marches off to Barcelona to study abroad in the Erasmus program.  The first scenes in which Xavier is trying to navigate his way around Barcelona, struggling under the load of his luggage and his inability to speak Spanish, reminded me of the challenges of being a stranger in a strange land.  Xavier eventually finds himself being interviewed for a space in a chaotic apartment shared by a Brit, an Italian, a Dane, a German and a Spaniard.  More than anything, he wants to be accepted into this apartment, and ultimately, he is.  During the course of the year, he takes seduction lessons from a lesbian woman in one of his courses, seduces a French physician's wife, seemingly forgets about his girlfriend Martine back home (Audrey Tautou), and then tries to reclaim her after she's broken up with him.  The year abroad is so full of promise, excitement, learning (and he does, in fact, learn Spanish).  After Xavier returns home to Paris from his year abroad, the film shows him eating a steak dinner with his hippie mother at their kitchen table -- underscoring the fact that the vacation is over.  No more twelve different bottles of beer &amp; various international sauces and a million different langage being shouted across the crowded table in the Spanish apartment -- this is back to real, DULL life.  It perfectly depicted the let down one feels (or at least I feel) after a fascinating trip abroad.<br /><br />I disagree with the reviewer who found the lead character despicable, and found his change of heart at the end of the film (abandoning his high-finance job) inexplicable.  This is a coming of age film that perfectly explains the decision, and when the protagonist runs away from bureaucracy in the end to pursue his goals of being a writer, I found myself cheering.  Had Xavier accepted the suit job analyzing markets, with the only excitement idle gossip with fellow suits over the water cooler, I don't think the viewer would think that Xavier learned anything from his time abroad.  The film capitalizes on stereotypess of Europeans (the German is very organized, the Italian carefree, the Brit responsible . . . ) in an entertaining way.  The filmmaking is also very interesting and well-done.  This movie is one to buy and share; it's not merely a renter.\nReview Title: captures the thrill of travel abroad\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Chinese for Kids: Learn Chinese Beginning Level 1 Volume 1\nReview Date: 2007/01/14\nStore: Chinese for Kids-Beginner Level 1  (Actor),     Donovan Miller  (Director)    Rated:    NR    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Independently Distributed, Kids & Family\nProduct Description: ['Product Description', 'CHINESE FOR KIDS vol. 1 bring fun and excitement to language learning.

The tones that are characteristic of the Mandarin dialect are taught with pictures and sounds that any young child can grasp. One word, spelled exactly the same, has four different meanings, depending on where the inflection is placed and the tonal quality in which it is spoken. This is a quality product, recommended for anyone wanting to connect with the Chinese culture. --Review Board, Dove Foundation\"]\nAverage Rating: 3.5\nProduct Details: {'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.25 x 0.75 inches; 4.16 Ounces', 'Item model number': '976344432', 'Director': 'Donovan Miller', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, NTSC', 'Run time': '35 minutes', 'Release date': 'January 10, 2006', 'Actors': 'Chinese for Kids-Beginner Level 1', 'Subtitles': 'English', 'Studio': 'Language Tree', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: We have quite a few \"learn Chinese\" DVDs and for some reason (that I clearly don't understand) this one is my three-year old's favorite.  It features Billy (a boy who has a birthday) and Benbo (a dog that sings).  One odd feature is the inconsistent sound volume.  I find myself having to adjust the sound throughout the program.  I give it four stars because it is the one my daughter wants to watch again and again.<br /><br />Frankly, I think the \"mei-mei\" tapes are much better.  My daughter LOVED Sing & Dance with Mei Mei, but I haven't found it in DVD yet.  We have a Mei Mei DVD about school, but it's a little over my daughter's head at this point and she doesn't really like it.\nReview Title: my daughter's favorite\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Red Without Blue\nReview Date: 2009/01/06\nStore: Clair Farley  (Actor),     Jennie Farley  (Actor),     Brooke Sebold  (Director),     Todd Sills  (Director)    &                   1                  more   Rated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Special Interests\nProduct Description: ['\"Although the Farleys\\' trials have the makings of a soap opera envisioned by David Cronenberg, there\\'s a quiet emotional hush to \"Red Without Blue\" that keeps tabloid prurience at bay and finds mystery and painful beauty in the unshakeable bonds of family.\"--', 'Robert Abele, LA Times', \"RED WITHOUT BLUE is an artistic and groundbreaking portrayal of gender,identity, and the unswerving bond of twinship despite transformation. An honest portrayal of a family in turmoil, RWB follows a pair of identical twins as one transitions from male to female. Captured over a period of three years, the film documents the twins and their parents, examining the Farley's struggle to redefine their family. The twins' early lives were quintessentially all-American: picture-perfect holidays, supportive parents who cheered them on every step of the way. By the time they were 14, their parents had divorced, they had come out as gay, and a joint suicide attempt precipitated a forced separation of Mark and Alex for two and half years. Through candid and extensive interviews with the twins and their family, RED WITHOUT BLUE recounts these troubled times, interweaving the twins' difficult past with their efforts to find themselves in the present. The film follows the painful steps of Clair's transition, including electrolysis and the difficult decision to proceed with bottom surgery. Through its portrayal of these articulate and independent twins, each haunted by the painful experiences of their adolescence, the film questions normative standards of gender and identity as Mark and Clair reassert their indescribable bond as identical twins. Through the power of the Farleys' voices, we hear the story of a family's redemption from a dark past, and ultimately, its revival to the present.\"]\nAverage Rating: 3.8\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Drama', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Brooke Sebold, Todd Sills, Benita Sills, Clair Farley, Mark Oliver Farley, Scott Farley, Jennie Farley, Jennifer Jordan, David L.

It is about identical twin boys who have an idyllic early childhood in Montana, recognize their homosexuality, grow apart, become rebellious drug abusers as teenagers, attempt a joint suicide, are shipped off to separate boarding schools and denied contact with one another, and later reunite.  As young adults, one of the twins identifies as transgendered, which the other twin reads as a personal rejection, but later comes to understand and support.  The film culminates with Clare's surgery and emergence as a more confident woman, and shows Clare's acceptance as a woman by both her twin and by her parents.  Meanwhile, Mark struggles with finding a positive romantic relationship and preserving that relationship, once found.<br /><br />Okay, that's a lot to pack into one movie, but it never seems over the top, preachy, or overdone.  The characters are all very real -- revealing their frustrations, anger, and vulnerability, as well as their tender sides.  In the beginning, Clare comes across as whiny and self-pitying.  Her twin, Mark, comes across as resentful and a tad self-centered.  Their mother comes across as frustrated and not-wholly-accepting of her son & daughter.  As the characters reveal more of themselves, they all become much more likeable and real.  Clare, in particular, is much more attractive as a person once she settles into her womanhood and Mark is much more likeable once he has accepted Clare as she is.<br /><br />Clare and Mark must be very bright and very talented and somewhat well-off, as they don't appear to face financial struggles (Clare goes to Sarah Lawrence and takes a cab to school each day.  Mark is in art school.)<br /><br />The film is very \"real\" and very \"intimate\" for lack of a better description.  It doesn't appear to be contrived or staged, and much of the camera work is done by Mark & Clare.  It gives you a behind the scenes look at their relationship, their struggles with family and parents and friends, and their personal struggles.  By the end of the film, I found both of the main characters to be intriguing and likeable, and the film leaves me wanting to know more about them and hoping that they find success and happiness in life.\nReview Title: absolutely fascinating and thought-provoking\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Beginning Gymnastics for Girls Skills and Drills from Coach Steve Nunno\nReview Date: 2009/02/28\nStore: Steve Nunno  (Actor),     Bill Richardson  (Director)    Rated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Independently Distributed, Kids & Family\nProduct Description: ['Product Description', \"Learn basic gymnastics skills and drills from one of the world's top coaches.

It's well worth the price for someone wishing to learn basic gymastics skills, learn about the various apparatus used in women's gymnastics, and learn the names of basic skills, stunts, and techniques.<br /><br />Steve Nunno, a two-time Olympics coach, U of Oklahoma coach, and coach to numerous elite athletes, narrates this instructive guide.  He is so pleasant, encouraging, soft-spoken -- and he knows exactly how to talk to and instruct the most inexperienced beginners in the most basic of skills -- it is difficult to imagine that he also coaches the world's finest gymnasts.  The only time he seemed anything other than laid back was when he was explaining just how much fun vaulting can be if you understand how to do it.  His emphasis is on keeping it fun and helping kids overcome the fear factor.<br /><br />This video is no-frills and no-nonsense.  It shows several young women gymnasts demonstrating skills using what Nunno refers to as \"progressions\" -- building on skills one step at a time to learn how to perform increasingly difficult skills.  Nunno provides clear instruction on proper body position, alignment, and technique.<br /><br />The focus is on beginning skills.  The video covers biomechanics, stretches, and basic floor skills -- forward and backward rolls, cartwheels and roundoffs, and back walkover on floor.  On the balance beam, the most challenging stunt is the roundoff dismount.  The sections on vault and uneven bars are excellent in showing how to get started on the apparatus, working up to more challenging skills.<br /><br />There's plenty in here that you could do at home -- and the instructions are so clear and the moves so basic that most kids could follow along on their own. Great video for parents and kids alike.\nReview Title: Excellent!

The vignettes are well-acted, and they are at times laugh--out-loud funny and at other times on the verge of offensive (I found the last vignette featuring Zoe Saldana very difficult to enjoy, even though I was well-aware that it was satire).  The most laughs, by far, came in the vignette depicting a gay couple's experience adopting a child, which in itself is worth the price of the film, although even that vignette was not without its disturbing points.<br /><br />This film is not for the faint of heart.  Each of the five segments stands alone, so there is no need to take them all in in a single setting.  I found that I enjoyed the film more watching just one or two vignettes at a time, as they are pretty twisted.\nReview Title: five twisted tales, not for the easily offended\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Father of Invention\nReview Date: 2011/11/20\nStore: Kevin Spacey  (Actor, Producer),     Camilla Belle  (Actor),     Trent Cooper  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Comedy\nProduct Description: [\"Millionaire infomercial guru, Robert Axle (Kevin Spacey) loses everything when one of his inventions has a design flaw that accidentally chops off the fingers of thousands of customers.

If you don't try to believe the story -- it's pretty unbelievable and highly unlikely -- and just take it for what it is, it's not a bad movie.  Not a great movie, but I still enjoyed it.  The acting is very good; the story isn't particularly compelling.  It starts with Robert Axle (Spacey) leaving prison after completing his sentence for -- selling a dangerous  product, the Ab Clicker, a combination ab roller / TV remote controller).  The fact that he would face criminal liability for designing an exercise/novelty product that injured folks doesn't make a lot of sense to me -- nor does the Spacey character in general.  He doesn't come across as an evil person who needs to be redeemed, but the movie is largely about his redemption, as a father and a friend.  Parts of the film really make no sense to me --the odd relantionship between Axle and his daughter's angryy lesbian (?) gym-teacher roommate.  Not sure how that advanced the film.
