    "text": "I love this movie!  I saw it 4 times in the theater.  The first time I was with my mom and a theater of women young and old who all probably grew up reading the beloved novel, and 30 minutes into the movie I was already beaming and tearing up because I was just thinking, \"FINALLY!  They're really doing it!  They're making the charm of the book come to life!\"  By the end of the movie, the theater was in tears of both sadness and joy, and we all left with our hearts warmed.<br /><br />I've seen just about every Little Women adaptation of the last 30 years, and to me none of them have done true justice to the playfulness, the familial love, the deep friendships, the girls' worries, the girls' joys, the romantic love stories of this book.  This movie did it in such a fresh way.  I was so so pleased!  READ THE BOOK FIRST and fall in love with it, then see the characters come to life.<br /><br />Sidenote:  I could harp on a few things that weren't accurate from the book to screen like the age and nationality of Professor Bhaer, or the age of Amy for that matter.  But these things are easy to let slide when the true CHARM and WHIMSY of the story and the NATURE of the characters is captured so well.  The movie is nearly perfect.",

      "Writer-director Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird) has crafted a Little Women that draws on both the classic novel and the writings of Louisa May Alcott, and unfolds as the author\u2019s alter ego, Jo March, reflects back and forth on her fictional life. In Gerwig\u2019s take, the beloved story of the March sisters \u2013 four young women each determined to live life on their own terms \u2013 is both timeless and timely. Portraying Jo, Meg, Amy, and Beth March, the film stars Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh, Eliza Scanlen, with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as their neighbor Laurie, Laura Dern as Marmee, and Meryl Streep as Aunt March."
