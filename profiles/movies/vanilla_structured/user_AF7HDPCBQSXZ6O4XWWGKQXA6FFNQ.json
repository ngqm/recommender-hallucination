  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:  \nThis individual demonstrates a preference for engaging narratives with strong character development, as evidenced by their high rating for a series that effectively ties in with a game. They present a keen interest in action-oriented content, but their enthusiasm wanes significantly for productions with poor dialogue and execution, as shown by low ratings for movies criticized for unrealistic scripting and pacing issues. Consistent dissatisfaction with quality indicators such as script quality and character authenticity suggest a strong value placed on immersive storytelling. The presence of heavy themes, including critiques of societal issues, resonates positively when conveyed effectively, as highlighted by a balanced review of a thought-provoking horror film. Price sensitivity isn't explicitly evident, but the ratings reflect a discerning taste for quality over quantity, prioritizing well-crafted experiences over low-budget productions. Overall, their core preferences lean towards serious, well-constructed narratives that engage critically with themes, coupled with a high expectation for dialogue and pacing.",

    "text": "If you don't like slow burners, don't watch this. It's not a horror/edge of your seat film.<br /><br />(spoiler)<br /><br />The portrayal of the parents, parents' friends and of course the sister push you to try to care about the Juliet, but it's very hard to when she is being selfish throughout the movie. It's also somewhat true to life, when you have situations like this where parents and teachers put a ton of undue stress on students. Unfortunately, we didn't really get to watch Juliet grow as a 'good' person, just more toward getting what she wants, but that's what happens when you make deals with the devil.<br /><br />I appreciated the way they implied that the protagonist slowly gives herself over to the devil and kills her former self. It's a pretty interesting ending.<br /><br />It reminded me of the 9th Gate movie, which is a good thing.",
