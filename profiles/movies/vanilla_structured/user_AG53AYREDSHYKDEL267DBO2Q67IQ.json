Shirley, Amanda and Ann Jewel had amazing chemistry. I loved how they interacted with each other, its like they were really speaking to each other instead of reading lines. When Shirley and Amanda cuddled up like a mother and daughter would, totally teared me up. It was a beautiful moment. Personally, I thought it was ablibbed, but if it wasn't, wow oh wow! My biggest problem was hearing a child of 8 or 9 years old  constantly saying the F word ; F bomb word; B*** word, etc. I can understand she had an attitude, most neglected or abandoned kids do no matter what the families economics status is, so totally understood that, but really to hear that kind of language coming out of child and the adults accepting it as the reality and even encouraging her, well that hit a very hard chord with me. Amanda has a child, I can't imagine her letting her child speak that way. My father always said only an ignorant and lazy person uses cuss words to prove their point because they can't think of a word to use in its place.

Just enjoy a bit of fun - in this day and time when everyone is being politically and culturally correct, etc. it was nice to be able to have levity. Any movie can be picked apart, but come on, this was just a tongue in cheek movie. Of course, there was a bit of profanity which I never think is necessary to use  - please directors - find out words to replace the unnecessary cuss words. Just get some popcorn, sit back and enjoy!\nReview Title: Fun Movie To Watch - Do Not Dissect\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2021/10/02\nAverage Rating: 3.6\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Randy Mack'], 'Producers': ['Randy Mack', 'Stanley B.

Not necessary to have every other word be a cuss word! Too many movies use way too much cussing thinking that is what makes a funny movie! I stopped watching it after the first 10 minutes, knew what kind of movie it was going to be and checked out.\nReview Title: Too Much Profanity\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n    Structure your response as:\n   \n    SUMMARY:\n    [Final synthesis of preferences and patterns]",
  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe individual demonstrates a strong preference for engaging emotional narratives, exhibiting excitement for films that evoke feelings of joy or intensity. Consistently high ratings accompany interactions with films that feature strong character dynamics and relatable themes, such as family and connection. A recurring sentiment across reviews indicates a notable aversion to excessive profanity and violence, suggesting a preference for content that maintains a level of decorum, as shown by their praise for films with less cursing.\n\nAdditionally, the reviewer values straightforward storytelling over complicated plots, favoring entertainment that allows for multitasking, such as cross-stitching while watching. Price sensitivity is not explicitly addressed in the reviews, but the inclination towards fun, enjoyable films implies a desire for value in terms of entertainment. Overall, the core preferences center around emotional engagement, character-driven narratives, and a strong disfavor for gratuitous language and violence.",

    "text": "I am not a prude by any means, but I was not raised with profanity and don't use it at all, and if anyone in my family uses it, it is out of my earshot. Jiminy cricket is a serious cuss word for me if you get my drift. I enjoy sci-fi of any kind and I am enjoying this movie since it keeps me wondering what is going to happen.  I don't know how much longer I am going to watch the rest of the episodes even though I have been watching it on mute and have it on close captioned because I can't stand all the gratuitous profanity being spouted. Profanity is not necessary to have an impact on the storytelling. It seems that every movie being made right now is interjecting unnecessary profanity.",
