Using the medieval legend of Charlemagne\\'s son, Pippin, heir apparent to the Holy roman Empire, the musical pageant called \"Pippin\" is a parable about a young man\\'s search for meaning and truth. With the show\\'s masterful master of ceremonies, Ben Vereen, jumping the time barrier from the 1980\\'s to the Middle Ages and back again, while the music and costumes go through similar time and space warps, young \"Pippin\" embarks on an odyssey to discovery whether there really is \"something worthwhile I can do with my life.\" William Katt plays-sings-and-dances the title role with a freshness and exuberance rarely seen in today\\'s entertainment on stage or screen. Broadway\\'s virtuoso baritone, Ben Rayson, is as regal as they come as Charlemagne. The sheer intensity of Vereen\\'s many-faceted talents steals the show again and again, but he never upstages his co-stars. Martha Raye brings her boisterous energy to the role of Berthe, Pippin\\'s 67 year old grandmother, while Chita Rivera ignites sparks every time she prances into a scene as Pippin\\'s stepmother. The success of \"Pippin,\" wining five Tony Awards and playing to sellout houses for six years is also what brought recognition to it\\'s star, Ben Vereen, long before his acclaimed portrayal of \"Chicken George\" in \"Roots\". with all of it\\'s distinctions, \"Pippin\" has never existed anywhere but Live, on stage, until this videotape production, supervised by Mr. Fosse, and produced and directed for television by David Sheehan.

Director Bob Fosse broke new cinematic ground with this freewheeling, visually stunning story of a lovelorn New York dance hall hostess, Charity Hope Valentine, who dreams of old-fashioned romance but gives her heart to one undeserving man after another. MacLaine joins all-star cast members Chita Rivera, Sammy Davis Jr., Ricardo Montalban and Stubby Kaye in belting out thirteen vibrant Cy Coleman-Dorothy Fields' numbers including Big Spender, Rhythm of Life, There's Gotta Be Something Better Than This and the show-stopping If My Friends Could See Me Now. It's an unforgettable production of an all-time classic.\", 'Bonus Content:', 'Alternate Ending', 'Alternate Ending', 'Sweet Charity: From the Stage to the Screen', 'Sweet Charity: From the Stage to the Screen', \"Edith Head's Costume Design: The Art of Exaggeration\", \"Edith Head's Costume Design: The Art of Exaggeration\", 'Theatrical Trailer', 'Theatrical Trailer', 'Recommendations', 'Recommendations', ']]>']\nAverage Rating: 4.6\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Musicals & Performing Arts/Musicals, Drama', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Color, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Contributor': 'Paula Kelly, Bob Fosse, Sammy Davis Jr., John McMartin, Dante DiPaolo, Shirley MacLaine, Suzanne Charney, John Wheeler, Bud Vest, Chita Rivera, Lee Roy Reams, Alan Hewitt, Ricardo Montalban, Barbara Bouchet, Stubby Kaye, Walter Stratton, Victoria Scruton, Ted Monson, Leon Bing, Al Lanti, Ben VereenPaula Kelly, Bob Fosse, Sammy Davis Jr., John McMartin, Dante DiPaolo, Shirley MacLaine, Suzanne Charney, John Wheeler, Bud Vest, Chita Rivera, Lee Roy Reams, Alan Hewitt, Ricardo Montalban, Barbara Bouchet, Stubby Kaye, Walter Stratton, Victoria Scruton, Ted Monson,\u2026   See more', 'Language': 'Unqualified, English (Dolby Digital 4.0)', 'Number Of Discs': '1', 'Aspect Ratio': '2.35:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'G (General Audience)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 2.05 Ounces', 'Item model number': '1022616', 'Director': 'Bob Fosse', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Color, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Run time': '2 hours and 33 minutes', 'Release date': 'March 4, 2003', 'Actors': 'Shirley MacLaine, John McMartin, Chita Rivera, Paula Kelly, Stubby Kaye', 'Subtitles': 'Spanish, French', 'Studio': 'Universal Pictures Home Entertainment', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: Fosse\nReview Title: Expect fosse\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n    Structure your response as:\n   \n    SUMMARY:\n    [Final synthesis of preferences and patterns]",
