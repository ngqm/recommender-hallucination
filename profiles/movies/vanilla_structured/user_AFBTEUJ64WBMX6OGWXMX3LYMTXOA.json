I recently saw it with my 11 year old son, and he just loved it; this boy normally won't watch westerns.  It's that good.<br /><br />John Wayne, Dean Martin, Walter Brennan all do a great job.  Even Rick Nelson, not someone you'd expect to see in a western, does a solid job.  Angie Dickinson is very likable.

Damien recruits the help of a criminal named Leito - whose only goal is to save his sister from the clutches of the same gang.

A group of corrupt cops and elected officials conspire to cash in on the redevelopment of the district by proposing it's destruction under the nuclear air strike.

(I'm trying not to draw broad conclusions from this.)  To me that's just a kind of porn, I don't see how it adds entertainment value to a crime drama.<br /><br />Anyway, the acting and real-world feel of this series is just excellent.  Kelly Reilly does a great job of being the bright young constable who isn't always sure of herself, and the other principal characters are very believable.  However, the plots are relatively weak (maybe that's why the gore is needed, to heighten the drama?), and the finish doesn't quite live up to the promise.<br /><br />Just not compelling enough for my tastes, but again, the actors make it worth watching if you have nothing better to do.\nReview Title: meh (not wonderful, but not terrible, either)\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2014/08/04\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Wolfgang Petersen'], 'Producers': ['Dieter Geissler', 'Bernd Eichinger'], 'Starring': ['Alan Oppenheimer', 'Noah Hathaway', 'Barret Oliver']}\nReview Text: Dumb story, poorly directed and acted, there was really nothing to redeem this horror.

(Unless you're a big fan of the fashionably lefty entertainment crowd's view of the world with the US and Israel as evil partners; I'm not.)  If you want a good Brit-style spy thriller, it would be much better to watch Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (either version).

So I watched it again with eager anticipation.  Sadly, I was very disappointed.  The story is dumb, really really dumb, even for the period.  The lead couple (Stewart & Day) behave irrationally, and so does everyone else -- the police, the bad guys, the bystanders -- it's just hard to take.  I also thought there was a whiff of &#34;Ugly American&#34; in the behavior of the McKennas, but there's no point belaboring that point in an old movie.

I should have known, its directed by Terry Gilliam, who could take Hamlet and and destroy it completely.  (Why anyone hired or funded that man despite his track record of failure is a question that now torments me.)<br /><br />No, really, it is abysmal, and a colossal waste of great acting talent.

There were a sufficient number of hair-raising thrill rides and narrow escapes to delight all but the most jaded.  The whitewater scene isn't believable to anyone who's actually fallen in a raging river (I have), but if you don't think about that it's really quite a good sequence.<br /><br />And of course I'm an Alicia Vikander fan.  I don't know what it is about her, but I find her a delight to watch on the screen in almost anything she's done: here she's competent, likeable, and fairly believable as a tough young woman who's also a loving daughter of a rather oddly neglectful father.<br /><br />I can't compare it to the previous Lara Croft movie, because I avoided it.\nReview Title: A decently made movie, and Vikander is quite enjoyable\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Even Rick Nelson, not someone you'd expect to see in a western, does a solid job.  Angie Dickinson is very likable.  It all hangs together, and doesn't work too hard at it; just goes down nice and easy.  (Ok, I mixed my metaphors, but you get the drift.)<br /><br />What can I say, I love this movie!

An isolation wall surrounds the ghetto cities of District B13. Within these walls, without effective law enforcement, gang rule is absolute. Damien is a member of an elite police squadron, highly trained in martial arts. He goes undercover to infiltrate a gang in order to defuse a neutron bomb and save District B13 from annihilation. Damien recruits the help of a criminal named Leito - whose only goal is to save his sister from the clutches of the same gang. District 13: Ultimatum Two years have passed since elite police officer Damien Tomasso (Cyril Raffaelli) teamed up with reformed vigilante Leito (David Belle) to save the notorious District 13, a racially charged ghetto populated by violent drug dealing gangs and vicious killers. Despite government promises to maintain order, the state of the district has deteriorated and is causing civil unrest. A group of corrupt cops and elected officials conspire to cash in on the redevelopment of the district by proposing it's destruction under the nuclear air strike. Damien and Leito must join forces again, using their martial arts and unique physical skills, to bring peace to the neighborhood by any means necessary.\"]\nAverage Rating: 4.6\nProduct Details: {'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 6.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'MGNO10299BR', 'Director': 'Patrick Alessandrin, Pierre Morel', 'Media Format': 'Blu-ray', 'Run time': '3 hours and 5 minutes', 'Release date': 'April 27, 2010', 'Actors': 'Cyril Raffaelli, David Belle, Philippe Torreton, Daniel Duval, Elodie Yung', 'Dubbed': 'English', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish', 'Studio': 'Magnolia Home Ent', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '2'}\nReview Text: Yes, I do mean that: these are among the best action movies ever made -- but I'll qualify by adding \"which involve humans doing athletic things\", such as martial arts movies.  (I like the other kinds too, BTW.)<br /><br />But if you enjoy watching incredibly gifted athletes doing great stunts done in a very believable way, and don't mind preposterous plots, then these movies might tickle your fancy.  Just being able to watch David Belle (said to be the founder of parkour/parcour) is worth the price in my opinion.<br /><br />So remember, don't expect any Profound Commentary on the Human Condition (thank goodness).

I've enjoyed some of them:  I'm not a big fan of the Basil Rathbone versions, and I quite disliked the Guy Ritchie/Robert Downey versions.
