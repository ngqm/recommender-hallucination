  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThis individual demonstrates a strong preference for high-quality content, consistently rating films at 4.2 or higher. They gravitate towards historical drama and complex narratives, often showing a particular affinity for period pieces, as seen in their enjoyment of a specific acclaimed series. The repeated mention of elements like cast familiarity indicates a preference for established actors and recognizable talent. \n\nA recurring theme across their reviews involves sensitivity to explicit content, as they express annoyance towards films with excessive foul language while remaining open to some mature themes. This shows a selective tolerance for content advisories, suggesting they prefer dramatic depth without overwhelming crudeness. \n\nPrice sensitivity is less evident, with no clear indications of concern regarding costs; their enjoyment seems more focused on value and entertainment rather than budget constraints. Overall, the individual favors engaging storylines with thoughtful direction and production quality, often seeking out works that provide immersive experiences. Their preferences align with a discerning taste, prioritizing narrative and character depth in their viewing choices.",

    "text": "How to begin?<br />I don't know of any homes with stairs leading down to a true basement area in Florida, unless you build your home above the ground and \"create\" a basement space. How big was that house? The crawl space (which really wasn't a crawl space because they were able to stand up) went on for days with nooks and crannies. The slime and mud under that house was revolting.<br /><br />The size of that drainage ditch pipe which was under the house, WHAT?!!<br /><br />Seeing those open bricks I would've used that shovel to bust them open.<br /><br />The daughter and the dad sure recovered from those gator chomps to vital arms and legs. All I could think about was the bacteria going into those wounds. That gator death roll was too slow.<br /><br />Who can carry an ATM into a flatbed boat?<br /><br />And the dad tells his daughter she can outswim a gator?!!<br /><br />I was wishing that house was on the beach, so that the sharks could end up washing ashore and floating down the waterways towards that house to show a fight between sharks and gators.<br /><br />The helicopter would not be out with hurricane winds.<br /><br />Why didn't the gators walk up the stairs into the house? Why couldn't the gator smash the shower door to bits? The daughter sure as strong to slide that shower door closed in all of that water.<br /><br />Sooooo many unanswered questions. I am sure who ever made this movie did not live in Florida.",
