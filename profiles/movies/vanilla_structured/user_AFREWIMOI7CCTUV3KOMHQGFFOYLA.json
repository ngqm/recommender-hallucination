His voice, magnificent.  The movie is a  tender love story filled with great music from opera to pop. Why the cd of the soundtrack does not contain the delightful &quot;Cosi&quot; trio is a mystery. Mario's supporting player are all first rate.  How Mario must have revelled in playing a difficult opera singer. This film contain some of his best singing.

All I can say is after viewing it all I can say is that this was 98 min of my life that I will never get back.  Bernstein's great score is almost entirely discarded in favor of what can't even be called mediocrity; Comden and Green have matched the insipid music with equally insipid lyrics for the new songs.  I can only guess that they must have had guns pointed to their heads and forced to work. The cast does what it can with the poor material but even their valiant efforts can't make this rise above the level of drivel.  I know this was the `40's and Broadway was way ahead of Hollywood  in handling  anything with even the hint of being risqu\u00e9, but  the whitewashed plot leaves this picture with nothing but another run of the mill story.  Hollywood has almost always had a very hard time translating Broadway hits into movies, for me the most successful outcomes being \"The Music Man\" and \"1776\"  but if you wrote a book on how not to do it , \"On The Town\" would be your example.  The Movie is I feel  also lacking all the energy and joy of the Broadway version.  Add to that the insult that the Blu-ray transfer looks like it was done without any attempt at restoration or care. Images aren't particularly sharp and the fine details you see when care is taken in doing the transfer like in \"Singing in the Rain\" are missing.  The best you can say is that it looks better than the old dvd version.  If you want to see Sinatra and Kelly as sailors then watch the superior, despite its also lack luster transfer to Blu-ray, \"Anchors Aweigh\" with its wonderful score by Jule Styne /Sammy Cahn  and the added pleasure of seeing the great pianist, Jose Iturbi  (who I meet years ago and was one of the nicest and most endearing people I have ever met)and watching (with no offense to the incomparable Ann Miller) the dancing of Kelly with Jerry the Mouse.

His voice, magnificent.  The movie is a  tender love story filled with great music from opera to pop. Why the cd of the soundtrack does not contain the delightful &quot;Cosi&quot; trio is a mystery. Mario's supporting player are all first rate.  How Mario must have revelled in playing a difficult opera singer. This film contain some of his best singing. What might we have had if he had only lived, or been better treated by  the studio system. An all around treat not to be missed.\nReview Title: Bittersweet Swansong\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol\nReview Date: 2001/11/19\nStore: Rated:    Unrated    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Holidays & Seasonal, Christmas\nProduct Description: ['Product description', 'This 1962 special marked the last hurrah of Mr. Magoo, who starred in 43 cartoon shorts, including two Oscar winners, from the UPA Studio between 1949 and 1959.

How often do you get a great composer like Jule Styne and great lyric writer like Bob Merrill to write a fantastic score for a children's cartoon. They took a little time off from what was their then current project &quot;Funny Girl&quot; to write the unforgettable songs. The vocal talents of the cast are great. Jim<br />Backus' Mr Magoo is always in character as Scrooge. Jack Cassidy<br />June Foray and the rest of the cast are equally fantastic.<br />The DVD itself is fine - The colors are well represented and the image itself is sharp - not as sharp as a film made today but remember this is from 1962!! and though it has been put through a<br />Dolby noise reduction the sound track has some tape hiss which is to be expected for a mono track from this time. The disc has some<br />nice extras. Over all it a great disc and it's a must for family holiday viewing .

Updated to the 1960's and staged in what can only be discribed as a giant comic book like setting, it brings a new freshness and twist to the  classic story. From the machanical Barbi Doll and Robot gifts that are brought by Drosselmeyer, to the G.I. Joes fighting the mice, to the Yule log on the TV screen its a lot of fun add to that Morris' clever and original choreography it is a great way to spend an evening. I don't think this has been shown since its first airing on PBS many years ago, and I'm glad to finally have it on DVD as my tape was almost worn out.

An unexplained seismic event causes a glacier to shift, trapping Gloria and all the other emperor penguins: Mumble, Erik, and two other chicks must rescue them before they starve.

All I can say is after viewing it all I can say is that this was 98 min of my life that I will never get back.  Bernstein's great score is almost entirely discarded in favor of what can't even be called mediocrity; Comden and Green have matched the insipid music with equally insipid lyrics for the new songs.  I can only guess that they must have had guns pointed to their heads and forced to work. The cast does what it can with the poor material but even their valiant efforts can't make this rise above the level of drivel.  I know this was the `40's and Broadway was way ahead of Hollywood  in handling  anything with even the hint of being risqu\u00e9, but  the whitewashed plot leaves this picture with nothing but another run of the mill story.  Hollywood has almost always had a very hard time translating Broadway hits into movies, for me the most successful outcomes being \"The Music Man\" and \"1776\"  but if you wrote a book on how not to do it , \"On The Town\" would be your example.  The Movie is I feel  also lacking all the energy and joy of the Broadway version.  Add to that the insult that the Blu-ray transfer looks like it was done without any attempt at restoration or care. Images aren't particularly sharp and the fine details you see when care is taken in doing the transfer like in \"Singing in the Rain\" are missing.  The best you can say is that it looks better than the old dvd version.  If you want to see Sinatra and Kelly as sailors then watch the superior, despite its also lack luster transfer to Blu-ray, \"Anchors Aweigh\" with its wonderful score by Jule Styne /Sammy Cahn  and the added pleasure of seeing the great pianist, Jose Iturbi  (who I meet years ago and was one of the nicest and most endearing people I have ever met)and watching (with no offense to the incomparable Ann Miller) the dancing of Kelly with Jerry the Mouse. It will be a better spending of you movie time.\nReview Title: Be thankful for a good cast.\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n    Structure your response as:\n   \n    SUMMARY:\n    [Final synthesis of preferences and patterns]",
