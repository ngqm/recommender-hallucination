The brilliantly written script is brought to life by a truly amazing cast.  Extraordinary performances by Katherine Hepburn and Peter O'Toole as the main leads - and they are supported by a phenomenal supporting cast  It is hard to believe that this is considered Anthony Hopkins film debut.  He brings Richard to vivid life, with all his failings and strengths.  There isn't a weak performance in the bunch.  This is a film that can be watched again and again, since each showing brings even more to discover.  Watching Hepburn and O'Toole go &#34;toe to toe&#34; is an extra special treat.  This is the first and only time they are in a film together and they make the most of every moment.  I promise you, you will not be disappointed in this film.\nReview Title: One of the very best\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Downton Abbey: Season 4\nReview Date: 2014/02/01\nStore: Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Boxed Sets, Drama\nProduct Description: ['Product Description', 'The sweeping Downton Abbey saga continues with a fourth season of drama, romance, and family intrigue.

During Larry's watch, extraordinary things begin to occur: Mayans, Roman Gladiators, and cowboys emerge from their diorama to wage epic battles; in his quest for fire, a Neanderthal burns down his own display; Attila the Hun pillages his neighboring exhibits, and a T-Rex reminds everyone why he's history's fiercest predator.

The brilliantly written script is brought to life by a truly amazing cast.  Extraordinary performances by Katherine Hepburn and Peter O'Toole as the main leads - and they are supported by a phenomenal supporting cast  It is hard to believe that this is considered Anthony Hopkins film debut.  He brings Richard to vivid life, with all his failings and strengths.  There isn't a weak performance in the bunch.  This is a film that can be watched again and again, since each showing brings even more to discover.  Watching Hepburn and O'Toole go &#34;toe to toe&#34; is an extra special treat.  This is the first and only time they are in a film together and they make the most of every moment.  I promise you, you will not be disappointed in this film.\nReview Title: One of the very best\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Downton Abbey: Season 4\nReview Date: 2014/02/01\nStore: Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Boxed Sets, Drama\nProduct Description: ['Product Description', 'The sweeping Downton Abbey saga continues with a fourth season of drama, romance, and family intrigue.

But even he could never have imagined how big, when he accepts what appears to be a menial job as a graveyard-shift security guard at a museum of natural history. During Larry's watch, extraordinary things begin to occur: Mayans, Roman Gladiators, and cowboys emerge from their diorama to wage epic battles; in his quest for fire, a Neanderthal burns down his own display; Attila the Hun pillages his neighboring exhibits, and a T-Rex reminds everyone why he's history's fiercest predator. Amidst the chaos, the only person Larry can turn to for advice is a wax figure of President Teddy Roosevelt, who helps our hero harness the bedlam, stop a nefarious plot, and save the museum.\", 'Amazon.com', \"An irresistible concept meets computer-generated wonders in Night at the Museum, inspired by a 1993 children's book by Milan Trenc.

Larry's son needs some stability, so the well-meaning ne'er-do-well takes a job as night watchman at New York City's Museum of Natural History. What the soon-to-retire guards (Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney, Bill Cobbs) don't tell him is that an ancient pharaoh's tablet in the museum causes everything on display to come to life at night. Thus, Larry meets representations of Teddy Roosevelt, Attila the Hun, fire-worshipping cavemen, and Roman Empire soldiers, and learns to cope with an excitable T-Rex and man-eating, ancient animals.
