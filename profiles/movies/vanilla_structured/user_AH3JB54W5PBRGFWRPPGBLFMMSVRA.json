  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:  \nThe individual demonstrates a strong preference for high-quality cinematic experiences, often gravitating towards faith-based and family-friendly films, as indicated by consistently high ratings (average 4.8) for such genres. They value well-crafted storytelling and strong performances, especially appreciating actors known for their roles in Christian films, suggesting a preference for meaningful content over blockbuster productions. Language and content sensitivity is evident; the person dislikes excessive foul language and sexual content, influencing their ratings significantly, as seen with low ratings for movies that fail to align with their moral standards. Price sensitivity appears minimal since the individual invests in a range of films without evident budget constraints, opting for content that delivers emotional depth and spiritual resonance. They typically engage with titles that offer subtitles in multiple languages, indicating inclusivity in viewing experiences. Overall, their core preferences center around impactful narratives with ethical themes and robust acting, while avoiding films with overtly graphic or offensive material.",
