  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe individual demonstrates a strong preference for high-quality, emotionally engaging narratives, particularly within the drama genre. Their purchase history reveals a consistent appreciation for complex storytelling that interweaves elements of romance, loss, and redemption, often with unexpected plot twists. The sentiment expressed in reviews is overwhelmingly positive, with multiple instances of perfect ratings indicating a deep attachment to the content.\n\nIn terms of thematic preferences, the person favors international productions featuring nuanced performances, evidenced by a willingness to watch films in different languages with subtitles, enhancing the authenticity of the experience. They exhibit an enthusiasm for visually stunning presentations, emphasizing intricate details in set and costume design, which suggests a preference for immersive storytelling.\n\nQuality ratings hover around 4.4 to 4.7, suggesting a standard for excellence, while their repeated use of terms like \"riveting,\" \"beautifully filmed,\" and \"epic\" highlights a desire for both aesthetic and narrative quality. Price sensitivity appears moderate; they are likely willing to invest time and possibly money into long-form series if highly rated, as suggested by extensive engagement with multiple episodes.\n\nOverall, core preferences center on high-quality, impactful storytelling that transcends cultural boundaries, rich visual artistry, and a fondness for compelling character development within their chosen genres.",

    "text": "Captivating from beginning to end and a marvelous history lesson of the Liao Dynasty in general. The weaving of what may have been fictional romance into the lives of people that actually existed make you hope that this is the way it really happened.  No hero is perfect, no villain is without a redeeming quality. Power that is so often corrupting in hands of the weak is wielded with wisdom and temperance until force is the only option. The acting is simply FANTASTIC!<br /><br />Unless you are a very fast reader you are likely going to have to hit pause quite a bit to read the subtitles. They are great with getting the point across but several Asian spoken words simply don't have equivalent English adaptations so more modern words that those in use at the time have been substituted.",
