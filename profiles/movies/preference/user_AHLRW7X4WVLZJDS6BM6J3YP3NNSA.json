I've also installed 'pool noodles,' strung together with cotton clothsline cord and held at just the right height for Wiggles' shoulder by 'plant stakes' (may be procured at most 'big box' stores like KMart, WalMart, and also gardening stores, generally green-coated metal), through which the long string of pool noodles is 'threaded,' and located around the home and/or flower bed's perimeter. During the growing months, daylily foliage covers the pool noodles, but it is amazing how appreciative your blind pet will be of your efforts to help him/her maneuver safely in your yard!<br /><br />Also, the video did not cover the very real dangers of water, holes, etc., that your blind friend cannot see. This includes indoor dangers like sunken tubs and the many objects that become hazards to one no longer able to see them.<br /><br />The video did stress the importance of not moving furniture, and very patiently (sometimes almost too patiently, for suggestions were repeated several times) made sure the viewer was shown the few techniques more than once.<br /><br />A good start to this topic, but it is hoped there will be more to come, as this is a very important subject to those who are blessed with these special friends and companions and to be their 'seeing eye people.'<br /><br />We want to do our best to make their lives happy, and this is not difficult for the devoted pet owner.<br /><br />Music played softly can be soothing, but the voices of two or more people can be confusing to the blind one. At times of frustration and confusion, the calming support and 'I'm here for you and love you very much' message is vital to keeping your special friend secure and content with his/her new chapter in life.<br /><br />Please, love your blind dog as he/she would love you if you lost one of your senses: it's far from the end, but a new and blessed beginning to have such a role as seeing eye person. We are both just fine with our lives now and still enjoy playtime, walks, and normal life.<br /><br />Don't let this minor hurdle stop you from loving and living a wonderful life with your blind pet. You'll come to learn the blessings of a profoundly special relationship -- you won't be sorry!\nReview Title: Not bad\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Tammy and The Bachelor [VHS]\nReview Date: 2007/01/02\nStore: Debbie Reynolds  (Actor),     Walter Brennan  (Actor),     Joseph Pevney  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    NR    Format: VHS Tape\nCategories: Movies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Comedy\nProduct Description: ['Tammy and The Bachelor']\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.32 x 4.19 x 1.12 inches; 6.13 Ounces', 'Director': 'Joseph Pevney', 'Run time': '1 hour and 29 minutes', 'Release date': 'January 20, 1993', 'Date First Available': 'December 14, 2006', 'Actors': 'Debbie Reynolds, Walter Brennan, Leslie Nielsen, Mala Powers, Sidney Blackmer', 'Studio': 'Universal Studios Home Entertainment', 'Producers': 'Ross Hunter', 'Writers': 'Cid Ricketts Sumner, Oscar Brodney'}\nReview Text: This is my all-time favorite movie and one that I've enjoyed on a regular basis for years.

This TV movie, clearly intended as a pilot for a possible series, stars Denver as former FBI agent Jim Clayton, who goes to Alaska when the incompetence of his superiors at the bureau becomes unbearable.

But Rick soon turns up dead and it's up to Jim to clear his friend's name of bootlegging charges and bring peace to Rick's wife and son. Along the way, of course, there's an occasion for Denver to pull out his guitar and exercise his soaring tenor. The plot and overall quality is standard television fare of the 1980s: The bad guys are obviously bad, a young boy needs to regain his faith in humanity, and solving the case doesn't involve detective work so much as looking earnest and getting into awkwardly choreographed fist fights.

I've also installed 'pool noodles,' strung together with cotton clothsline cord and held at just the right height for Wiggles' shoulder by 'plant stakes' (may be procured at most 'big box' stores like KMart, WalMart, and also gardening stores, generally green-coated metal), through which the long string of pool noodles is 'threaded,' and located around the home and/or flower bed's perimeter. During the growing months, daylily foliage covers the pool noodles, but it is amazing how appreciative your blind pet will be of your efforts to help him/her maneuver safely in your yard!<br /><br />Also, the video did not cover the very real dangers of water, holes, etc., that your blind friend cannot see. This includes indoor dangers like sunken tubs and the many objects that become hazards to one no longer able to see them.<br /><br />The video did stress the importance of not moving furniture, and very patiently (sometimes almost too patiently, for suggestions were repeated several times) made sure the viewer was shown the few techniques more than once.<br /><br />A good start to this topic, but it is hoped there will be more to come, as this is a very important subject to those who are blessed with these special friends and companions and to be their 'seeing eye people.'<br /><br />We want to do our best to make their lives happy, and this is not difficult for the devoted pet owner.<br /><br />Music played softly can be soothing, but the voices of two or more people can be confusing to the blind one. At times of frustration and confusion, the calming support and 'I'm here for you and love you very much' message is vital to keeping your special friend secure and content with his/her new chapter in life.<br /><br />Please, love your blind dog as he/she would love you if you lost one of your senses: it's far from the end, but a new and blessed beginning to have such a role as seeing eye person. We are both just fine with our lives now and still enjoy playtime, walks, and normal life.<br /><br />Don't let this minor hurdle stop you from loving and living a wonderful life with your blind pet.

Williams plays Dr. Malcolm Sayer, a shy research physician who uses an experimental drug to \"awaken\" the catatonic victims of a rare disease. De Niro co-stars as Leonard, the first patient to receive the controversial treatment.

I've also installed 'pool noodles,' strung together with cotton clothsline cord and held at just the right height for Wiggles' shoulder by 'plant stakes' (may be procured at most 'big box' stores like KMart, WalMart, and also gardening stores, generally green-coated metal), through which the long string of pool noodles is 'threaded,' and located around the home and/or flower bed's perimeter. During the growing months, daylily foliage covers the pool noodles, but it is amazing how appreciative your blind pet will be of your efforts to help him/her maneuver safely in your yard!<br /><br />Also, the video did not cover the very real dangers of water, holes, etc., that your blind friend cannot see. This includes indoor dangers like sunken tubs and the many objects that become hazards to one no longer able to see them.<br /><br />The video did stress the importance of not moving furniture, and very patiently (sometimes almost too patiently, for suggestions were repeated several times) made sure the viewer was shown the few techniques more than once.<br /><br />A good start to this topic, but it is hoped there will be more to come, as this is a very important subject to those who are blessed with these special friends and companions and to be their 'seeing eye people.'<br /><br />We want to do our best to make their lives happy, and this is not difficult for the devoted pet owner.<br /><br />Music played softly can be soothing, but the voices of two or more people can be confusing to the blind one. At times of frustration and confusion, the calming support and 'I'm here for you and love you very much' message is vital to keeping your special friend secure and content with his/her new chapter in life.<br /><br />Please, love your blind dog as he/she would love you if you lost one of your senses: it's far from the end, but a new and blessed beginning to have such a role as seeing eye person. We are both just fine with our lives now and still enjoy playtime, walks, and normal life.<br /><br />Don't let this minor hurdle stop you from loving and living a wonderful life with your blind pet. You'll come to learn the blessings of a profoundly special relationship -- you won't be sorry!\nReview Title: Not bad\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Tammy and The Bachelor [VHS]\nReview Date: 2007/01/02\nStore: Debbie Reynolds  (Actor),     Walter Brennan  (Actor),     Joseph Pevney  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    NR    Format: VHS Tape\nCategories: Movies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Comedy\nProduct Description: ['Tammy and The Bachelor']\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.32 x 4.19 x 1.12 inches; 6.13 Ounces', 'Director': 'Joseph Pevney', 'Run time': '1 hour and 29 minutes', 'Release date': 'January 20, 1993', 'Date First Available': 'December 14, 2006', 'Actors': 'Debbie Reynolds, Walter Brennan, Leslie Nielsen, Mala Powers, Sidney Blackmer', 'Studio': 'Universal Studios Home Entertainment', 'Producers': 'Ross Hunter', 'Writers': 'Cid Ricketts Sumner, Oscar Brodney'}\nReview Text: This is my all-time favorite movie and one that I've enjoyed on a regular basis for years.

This TV movie, clearly intended as a pilot for a possible series, stars Denver as former FBI agent Jim Clayton, who goes to Alaska when the incompetence of his superiors at the bureau becomes unbearable. In the vast wilderness, he teams up with an old friend named Rick, who has an air freight business. But Rick soon turns up dead and it's up to Jim to clear his friend's name of bootlegging charges and bring peace to Rick's wife and son. Along the way, of course, there's an occasion for Denver to pull out his guitar and exercise his soaring tenor.

    "text": "I've always leaned toward G-rated children's and family movies and this is the cream of the crop! Even after thirty years, it rings as true as the first time I watched it and never gets old. There is deep sorrow for the struggling widower and his children living on a hardscrabble apple farm in Michigan during a typical cold Wolverine State winter. Even though the departed mother is shown only in one photo, her strong personality, deep faith and abiding love flow throughout. Please get your own copy of this movie and made a place for it each year at Christmas. You won't regret it!",
