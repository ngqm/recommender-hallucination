Set in Ontario, Canada, the story centers on Victoria and Patrick McChesney, whose decision to adopt an orphaned Catholic girl ignites controversy in their Protestant community. Patrick is accused of using the adoption to appeal to Catholic voeters and advance his political career. Victoria contends with self-righteous whispers about the child's out-of-wedlock birth. And an event in the child's past leads to a fear-mongering change that she is a pyromaniac. Passions and accusations rage.
