      "All is not well for brilliant but boorish Dr. Martin Ellingham (Martin Clunes, Manhunt) as the hit British dramedy returns. To Martin\u2019s utter disgust, his medical practice remains under official scrutiny because of his pre-existing blood phobia, and he is forced to attend refresher courses starting with phlebotomy. His wife, Louisa (Caroline Catz, DCI Banks) and aunt Ruth (Emmy winner Eileen Atkins, Cranford) urge him to take this risk to his career seriously, but events conspire against him.  While Louisa focuses on her own job change and studies child psychology, she worries that their son, James, is becoming too much like his father, and decides James needs a sibling. As the other residents of picturesque Portwenn contend with love and life changes, Martin remains stuck in his ways. Can he appease the medical board or will his days as the village GP soon be at an end?"
