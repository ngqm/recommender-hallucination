Michael Westen (Jeffrey Donovan) is in the middle of a top-secret mission when he discovers he\\'s been \"burned\"--basically, fired without warning. After barely extricating himself from danger, he wakes up in Miami, where the government has abandoned him and locked him out of his own bank account. To make ends meet, he takes on private detective jobs (helping an old lady who\\'s fallen victim to a con artist; rescuing a young girl who\\'s being tricked into white slavery; helping a mother whose son has been kidnapped by the boy\\'s father... only it turns out the father is the rightful parent and the \"mom\" is an assassin sent to kill him--a nice guest star appearance by Lucy Lawless,', 'Xena: Warrior Princess', '), while trying to figure out who burned him and why.

A small handful of strangers that have survived the night (Hayden Christensen, Thandie Newton, John Leguizamo and newcomer Jacob Latimore) each find their way to a rundown bar, whose gasoline powered generator and stockpile of food and drink make it the last refuge in a deserted city.

Anthony Jaswinski's script drops tantalizing references to religious prophecies, human-made catastrophes, and real-life phenomena (including the still unexplained 16th-century disappearance of the entire Roanoke Colony), but never really seems to fix on the specifics of its particular spooky situation, leaving the audience to fill in an increasing number of blanks. That the film ultimately works as well as it does is due to director Brad Anderson, a filmmaker whose previous work (including\", 'The Machinist', 'and the wonderfully upsetting', 'Session 9', \") has displayed a firm grasp of place. Here, he outdoes himself, creating a barren, unstable metropolis with barely glimpsed slitherings in virtually every corner.

Anthony Jaswinski's script drops tantalizing references to religious prophecies, human-made catastrophes, and real-life phenomena (including the still unexplained 16th-century disappearance of the entire Roanoke Colony), but never really seems to fix on the specifics of its particular spooky situation, leaving the audience to fill in an increasing number of blanks. That the film ultimately works as well as it does is due to director Brad Anderson, a filmmaker whose previous work (including\", 'The Machinist', 'and the wonderfully upsetting', 'Session 9', \") has displayed a firm grasp of place. Here, he outdoes himself, creating a barren, unstable metropolis with barely glimpsed slitherings in virtually every corner.

I believed it was Well Written & the Cast quite Enjoyable to Watch Interact as their Characters. It's Too Bad about the cancellation since last episode's leave you hanging Like most shows do now-a-days; I do believe the story did not end w/the 13th episode. And the death of  Michael Clarke Duncan is so Tragic..  I don't believe they could have found his replacement but perhaps they could have made his death part of the show???
