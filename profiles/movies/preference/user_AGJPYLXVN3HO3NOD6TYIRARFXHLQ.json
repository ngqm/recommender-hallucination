Really disappointed.\nReview Title: Bad DVD quality.\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2017/02/10\nAverage Rating: 4.0\nProduct Details: {'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Lisa Azuelos'], 'Producers': ['Lisa Azuelos'], 'Starring': ['Sophie Marceau']}\nReview Text: This movie had me intoxicated flying as a kite. Wish I had a some wine while watching it. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Though, the final scene brought me crashing down to earth... I would've stayed floating up in the clouds...\nReview Title: Le Magnifique!\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2017/02/11\nAverage Rating: 4.0\nProduct Details: {'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['None available'], 'Directors': ['Didier Le P\u00eacheur'], 'Producers': ['Clementine Dabadie'], 'Starring': ['Mathilde Seigner'], 'Studio': ['Under The Milky Way']}\nReview Text: I did not read nor I was aware of the book the movie is based on.  However, this movie works great taking you with its charm and quirkiness, wondering how it will develop. As soon as you feel invested in the story and its characters, it becomes a real downer of a movie.\nReview Title: Not what it seems...\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2017/03/01\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['Davvis\u00e1megiella'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Hannes Holm'], 'Producers': ['Annica Bellander', 'Nicklas Wikstr\u00f6m Nicastro'], 'Starring': ['Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd', 'Bahar Pars', 'Zozan Akg\u00fcn'], 'Studio': ['Music Box Films']}\nReview Text: Great story.  What an awesome treat.  You'll ponder, laugh, cry, and smile.  As far as subtitles, Ove would've been very disappointed people cannot figure out to just turn their subtitles on, on the settings!  C'mon people!  It's 2017!  I suppose some just expect for them to automatically be on, but it is a preference, specially with some films having more than one language to choose from for subtitles.  Anyway, very unfair to rate the movie with 1 star just because they couldn't figure it out.  It was nominated for an Oscar for a reason.  It is also the highest-grossing foreign-language film of 2016.  You won't be disappointed!\nReview Title: Bra!

I do wonder if Galifianakis was miscast for his role, but that's just nitpicking on my part.  Watched more than twice to catch all the brilliant nuances.  The score really should've been considered for the Oscar!",
