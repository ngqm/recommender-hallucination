What follows is a wild and woolly ride, crammed with all the pleasures one expects from a revenge fantasy written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. Plot-wise, some things happen a little too easily (for example, Django instantly becomes a master gunslinger), but the moral perspective is not glib. For all its lurid violence and jazzy dialogue, this is a still-rare movie that paints slavery for what it was: a brutal, dehumanizing practice that allowed a privileged few to profit from the suffering of many, a practice guaranteed by the gun and the whip. Think of it as the antidote to\", 'Gone with the Wind', '. Tarantino is more heartfelt in', 'Django Unchained', 'than in any of his previous movies--without sacrificing any of the pell-mell action, tension, and delicious language that made', 'Reservoir Dogs', ',', 'Kill Bill', ', and', 'Pulp Fiction', 'so very enjoyable.', '--Bret Fetzer']\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Western', 'Format': 'NTSC', 'Contributor': 'Jamie Foxx, Pilar Savone, Stacey Sher, Don Johnson, Kerry Washington, Franco Nero, Walton Goggins, James Remar, Leonardo DiCaprio, Michael Parks, Brown 26 Productions, LLC, Dennis Christopher, Reginald Hudlin, Christoph Waltz, Quentin Tarantino, Samuel JacksonJamie Foxx, Pilar Savone, Stacey Sher, Don Johnson, Kerry Washington, Franco Nero, Walton Goggins, James Remar, Leonardo DiCaprio, Michael Parks, Brown 26 Productions, LLC, Dennis Christopher, Reginald Hudlin, Christoph Waltz, Quentin Tarantino, Samuel Jackson  See more', 'Language': 'Unqualified (Dolby Digital 5.1)', 'Runtime': '2 hours and 46 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '2.40:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 1.6 Ounces', 'Item model number': '13132597256', 'Director': 'Quentin Tarantino', 'Media Format': 'NTSC', 'Run time': '2 hours and 46 minutes', 'Release date': 'April 16, 2013', 'Actors': 'Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kerry Washington, Samuel Jackson', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish', 'Producers': 'Reginald Hudlin, Pilar Savone, Stacey Sher', 'Studio': 'Lionsgate', 'Number of discs': '2'}\nReview Text: Garbage\nReview Title: Garbage\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2022/05/25\nAverage Rating: 4.3\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Akiva Schaffer'], 'Producers': ['Blondel Aidoo', 'Dan Levine', 'Monica Levinson', 'Shawn Levy', 'Tom McNulty', 'Billy Rosenberg'], 'Starring': ['Ben Stiller', 'Vince Vaughn', 'Jonah Hill']}\nReview Text: A lot of the humor was warped.\nReview Title: Perverse and moronic\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2022/07/13\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Chris Eyre', 'Sanford Bookstaver'], 'Producers': ['Jason Ballantyne', 'Vince Calandra', 'Kathleen DeRose', 'J.
