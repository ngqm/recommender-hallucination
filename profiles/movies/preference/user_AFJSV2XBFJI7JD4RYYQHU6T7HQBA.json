But when Babe Ruth's prized bat is stolen during the 1932 World Series, Yankee steps up to the plate to help retrieve it for his beloved idol. He embarks on a wild cross-country journey that teaches him the stuff real heroes are made of, and along the way, Yankee learns the importance of perseverance and the true meaning of friendship.\", 'Amazon.com', 'A talking baseball and a talking bat might not be the most likely characters to inspire a personal revelation about perseverance and self-esteem, but in', \"Everyone's Hero\", 'it\\'s just those two things that help young Yankee Irving (Jake T.

A ten-year old spurned by the neighborhood kids because of his repeated strike-outs at bat, Yankee is at a point of personal crisis. A chance encounter with a talking foul ball named Screwie (Rob Reiner) and some time spent with his father (Mandy Patinkin), who\\'s a janitor for the New York Yankees, gives Yankee cause for some serious reflection. When Babe Ruth\\'s famous bat \"Darlin\\'\" (Whoopi Goldberg) is stolen by opposing teammate Lefty Maginnis (William H.
