Unfortunately, we got 11 minutes into the film and decided to abandon it. The cinematography and editing were poor to the point of distraction, and I felt as if I'd been tricked into watching home movies of a stranger's vacation. What a shame. It could have been so much more.\nReview Title: Disappointing\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Donkey X (Includes Digital Copy)\nReview Date: 2017/08/19\nStore: Jose Pozo  (Director)    Rated:    PG    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Studio Specials, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, All Sony Pictures Titles\nProduct Description: ['Follow Rucio, the most adventurous, brave, and mischievous donkey of Castile as he tells the true story of the legendary Don Quixote.

Animated woman grabbing and flaunting her breasts, a 666 reference, and so much more. I am stunned that this trash is what passes for children's entertainment. It should be PG-13 at the very least...and I'm not sure I'd be comfortable with that. I'd burn it, except the fumes might be as noxious as the movie itself.
