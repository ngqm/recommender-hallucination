This one is by far the most deeply engaging one I have ever seen. It's a very dark portrayal of the Dark Night. It's also very 'realistic' in the sense that Batman doesn't have a thousand super futuristic gadgets, monstrous car, motorcycle and plane at his disposal. Bruce Wayne has some serious issues. The villains aren't ultra-rich megalomaniacs. Just common thugs. Catwoman is a pretty regular girl. But, the things that make Batman who he is still stand out. He's a detective. He doesn't use guns. He operates covertly. He has one ally in Gotham PD, Mr. Gordon, who becomes the Commissioner during the movie. The Penguin is there. As is the Riddler.<br /><br />The entire movie is dark, oppressive and sinister. But, Batman is very human and a great Samaritan.

I was a little lost, at first. Because I missed one or two of the movies leading up to this one. (How the hell did Thor lose his eye?) The cliffhanger at the end was both shocking and awesome.

I like the Madea movies. Of all the Tyler Perry movies, the comedies are the best. His dramas all fall flat on their face. His scripts are too predictable, characters too flat, story lines are like ruts on a muddy road. They follow a path, unwavering, till they get stuck... and.... die. Tiffany Haddish is great in this role. As are the other actors. They all make the movie tolerable. Some movies are larger than the actors in them. These actors are MUCH better than the movie they're in.\nReview Title: It's still a Tyler Perry movie.\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Rear Window\nReview Date: 2020/01/15\nCategories: Suspense, Atmospheric, Compelling, Harrowing\nProduct Description: ['A bored, injured photojournalist confined to his apartment has no choice but to busy himself with observing his neighbors.

Somehow, someone hacked my Prime account and rented it. I'm sure it was just a test, to see if they could. I have since changed my password. However, I CAN tell you that, if you haven't seen this movie before, it's one worth watching. It's one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films. And, Jimmy Stewart was perfect in the leading role. I've seen it a few times over the years and really enjoyed it. In fact, there was a remake about ten years ago.

Almost like a take off of Olympus has fallen. But, with enough comedic quality to make it just campy enough to enjoy, without going overboard like 'Airplane'. All of the acting was well done. The special effects were great. The movie kind of reminded me of Independence Day. But, a little funnier in parts. Worth watching.\nReview Title: Kind of like Olympus has fallen.

And, I don't think he did it just for this movie. I think that his weight gain may be the reason why he was selected for this role, though.<br /><br />This movie really will keep you on the edge of your seat. Some scenes are pretty shocking.

This one is by far the most deeply engaging one I have ever seen. It's a very dark portrayal of the Dark Night. It's also very 'realistic' in the sense that Batman doesn't have a thousand super futuristic gadgets, monstrous car, motorcycle and plane at his disposal. Bruce Wayne has some serious issues. The villains aren't ultra-rich megalomaniacs. Just common thugs. Catwoman is a pretty regular girl. But, the things that make Batman who he is still stand out. He's a detective. He doesn't use guns. He operates covertly. He has one ally in Gotham PD, Mr. Gordon, who becomes the Commissioner during the movie. The Penguin is there. As is the Riddler.<br /><br />The entire movie is dark, oppressive and sinister. But, Batman is very human and a great Samaritan.  I love this movie and am going to watch it again, and again and again.\nReview Title: The most engaging Batman movie, EVER!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2022/07/17\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium', 'Espa\u00f1ol'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', 'Espa\u00f1ol'], 'Directors': ['Martin Campbell'], 'Producers': ['Cathy Schulman', 'Moshe Diamant', 'Rupert Maconick', 'Michael Heimler', 'Arthur Sarkissian'], 'Starring': ['Liam Neeson', 'Guy Pearce', 'Monica Bellucci']}\nReview Text: Liam is an outstanding character actor.

You can watch the same movie several times and still not get all of the little gems of rib ticklers. All of the other movies in this series followed the plot line, having a good climactic encounter with the good and bad guys and a happy conclusion.<br /><br />None of the key elements of a great movie are in this one. The story line gets fuzzy about halfway through. The plot weakens. The ending is actually anti-climatic.<br /><br />All of the humor is there. Even enough double entendre for us grownups. Plenty of visual gags. However, this is the first of the series that in my opinion 'bombed' and will not watch it again.
