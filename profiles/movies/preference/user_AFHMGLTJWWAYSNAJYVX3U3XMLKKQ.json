The pleasures this series affords are anything but guilty. Each intriguing episode begins with the preview of a murder, a roundup of the suspects (Was it the jealous wife? The dictatorial director?), and an irresistible challenge to viewers to \"match wits with Ellery Queen and see if you can guess whodunit.\" Before revealing the killer, Ellery breaks the fourth wall to ask if we amateur sleuths at home have the mystery figured out, offering last-minute clues such as, \"Once you figure out how, you\\'ll know who.\" As with', \"Burke's Law\", ', each episode of', 'Ellery Queen', 'is packed with enough Hollywood legends, venerable character actors, and TV faves to fill', 'The Love Boat', '. \"The Adventure of Veronica\\'s Veils\" features George Burns as the victim (\"I didn\\'t die of natural causes,\" he announces via a filmed presentation following his demise), William Demarest, Don Porter, comedian Jack Carter, Hayden Rorke (Dr. Bellows on', 'I Dream of Jeannie', '), and John Hillerman in his recurring role as radio detective Simon Brimmer, forever trying to one-up Queen. Queen himself makes it a point \"to be observant and pay attention to details,\" particularly for that \"dying clue which makes absolutely no sense.\" You\\'d be advised to do the same. The intricately plotted stories turn on the most arcane of clues and circumstances, as in the pilot episode \"Too Many Suspects,\" in which solving a fashion designer\\'s murder hinges on the reenactment of a TV news broadcast (maybe that explains the one-season run).
