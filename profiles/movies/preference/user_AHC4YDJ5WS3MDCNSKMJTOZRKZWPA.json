She\u2019s pregnant for the second time by her absent father; at home, she must wait hand and foot on her mother, a poisonously angry woman who abuses her emotionally and physically. School is a place of chaos, and Precious has reached the ninth grade with good marks and an awful secret: she can neither read nor write. Precious may sometimes be down, but she is never out. Beneath her impassive expression is a watchful, curious young woman with an inchoate but unshakeable sense that other possibilities exist for her. Threatened with expulsion, Precious is offered the chance to transfer to an alternative school, Each One/Teach One.

What's particularly notable about the film's success and acclaim is that in the beginning, at least, it presents one of the grimmest scenarios imaginable. The scene is Harlem, New York, in 1987. Teenager Clarisse Precious Jones (played by newcomer Gabourey Sibide in an absolutely fearless performance) is dirt poor, morbidly obese, semiliterate, and pregnant for the second time--both courtesy of her own father (the first baby was born with Down syndrome). Her home life is several levels below Hell, as her bitter, vengeful welfare mother, Mary (Mo'Nique, in a role that has generated legitimate Oscar\u00ae buzz), abuses her both physically and otherwise (telling Precious she should have aborted her is only the worst of a relentless flood of insults and vitriol). Yet somehow, the young woman still has hopes and dreams (depicted in a series of delightful fantasy sequences). She enrolls in an alternative school, where a young teacher (Paula Patton) takes her under her wing and even into her home, and visits a social worker (an excellent Mariah Carey; fellow pop star Lenny Kravitz is also effective as a male nurse) who further helps bring Precious out of the darkness. Incredibly, Precious's circumstances deteriorate even more before showing the slightest sign of improvement, and a climactic confrontation with her mother is one of the more wrenching scenes in recent memory. But against all odds, director Lee Daniels, screenwriter Geoffrey Fletcher (working from Sapphire's novel), and especially the wondrously affecting Sibide have managed to make\", 'Precious', 'a film that will lift the viewer far higher up that one might ever have thought possible.', '--Sam Graham']\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Drama', 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Contributor': \"Lee Daniels, Mo'Nique, Gabourey Sidibe\", 'Language': 'English', 'Runtime': '1 hour and 49 minutes', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 2.72 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'LGT27239DVD', 'Director': 'Lee Daniels', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Run time': '1 hour and 49 minutes', 'Release date': 'March 9, 2010', 'Actors': \"Gabourey Sidibe, Mo'Nique\", 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish', 'Studio': 'Lionsgate', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: A new perspective, thought-provoking!\nReview Title: Five Stars\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Definitely, Maybe (Widescreen)\nReview Date: 2015/03/11\nStore: Ryan Reynolds  (Actor),     Kevin Kline  (Actor),     Adam Brooks  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Comedy\nProduct Description: ['Product Description', \"From the makers of Notting Hill and Love Actually comes the charming and irresistibly funny romantic comedy Definitely, Maybe.

Hoewel deze muzikanten vrijwel altijd net buiten de spotlights blijven staan, zijn het juist hun stemmen die ontelbare nummers legendarisch hebben gemaakt. TWENTY FEET FROM STARDOM belicht het enigszins verborgen bestaan van de achtergrondzangeressen van wereldsterren als Bruce Springsteen, Stevie Wonder en Mick Jagger. Ze vertellen waarom ze gekozen hebben voor het leven in de schaduw van een wereldster en of de droom om ooit naar de voorgrond te treden ooit heeft bestaan.', 'Review', 'While the lead singers in rock, pop, and R&B are the ones who get the glory, knowledgeable music fans will tell you the backing vocalists often add the touches that make a performance truly memorable, and though many backup singers have the respect of their peers in the music business, they\\'re all but unknown to the average listener. Twenty Feet From Stardom pays homage to some of these unsung heroes, including Darlene Love (the un-credited lead voice on some of Phil Spector\\'s most memorable productions of the 1960s), Merry Clayton (who contributed a striking vocal cameo on the Rolling Stones\\' \"Gimme Shelter\", Lisa Fischer (who has appeared on albums by Sting, Tina Turner, and Aretha Franklin, as well as touring with the Rolling Stones), and the Waters Family (they sang with Michael Jackson on the album Thriller and lent their voices to the films The Lion King and Avatar).']\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 2.72 Ounces', 'Audio Description': 'English', 'Item model number': '28928250', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, NTSC, Widescreen', 'Run time': '1 hour and 31 minutes', 'Release date': 'January 14, 2014', 'Actors': 'Darlene Love, Merry Clayton, Lisa Fischer, Judith Hill', 'Studio': 'Lionsgate', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: Great!\nReview Title: Great!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Capote\nReview Date: 2015/10/15\nStore: Philip Seymour Hoffman  (Actor),     Catherine Keener  (Actor),     Bennett Miller  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Studio Specials, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, Sony Pictures Classics, Biography\nProduct Description: ['In November, 1959, the shocking murder of a smalltown Kansas family captures the imagination of Truman Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman), famed author of \"Breakfast at Tiffany\\'s.\" With his childhood friend Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), writer of the soon-to-be published \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" Capote sets out to investigate, winning over the locals despite his flamboyant appearance and style.
