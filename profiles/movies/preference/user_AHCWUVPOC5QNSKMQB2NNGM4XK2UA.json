I had no idea what was even out there or what I would like to watch!<br />I had a plane trip coming up and wanted to get some for the trip as well as to have with me to view so I didn't want anything that would be offensive to anyone near me on the plane.<br /><br />Yes, it's sad, but so are lots of things in life but this is a different kind of sadness. It's a sadness that also comes with great joy because it reached its full cycle and you felt that fulfillment. You also felt its purpose, and the love.<br /><br />I think for some to comment that it was 'predictable' miss the point. Much in life is predictable. For me, I don't care that some things are predictable; or simplified, or maybe not even 'realistic'. I can get reality in the day to day. To watch a movie is to become involved deeply with so many levels of the movie and to glean from it whatever message you are receiving at that time.<br /><br />I enjoyed Morgan's wife in the movie and the relationship he had with her. Of course she is going to get mad at him; be frustrated, concerned and then absolutely shocked and bewildered when he announced his plans. But, she also showed great trust, and love and knew that whatever he was needing to do, it's what he needed to do and let it go. Let him go. I enjoyed those intimate scenes. People need to see great strength and trust between two people.<br /><br />I also found myself hanging on the edge of my seat when Morgan was at the bar and the beautiful lady came up and sat next to him. I found myself thinking that if MORGAN (the actor - not even the character!) 'gave in', then I would change how I felt about him (however irrational since it was his character, not him). I held my breath in anticipation...<br />Now, whether Morgan had any say so on the outcome of that scene or whether that was how the script was written anyway, it made a world of difference to me. And if Morgan did have a say so, well, all the more reason why I esteem him so highly.<br /><br />I thought it was a wonderful movie and am so glad I got to see it.\nReview Title: Two of my favorites together for an unforgettable movie\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Gran Torino\nReview Date: 2009/12/21\nStore: Clint Eastwood  (Actor, Director),     Brian Haley  (Actor)    Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Studio Specials, Warner Home Video, All Titles\nProduct Description: [\"A disgruntled Korean War vet, Walt Kowalski (Eastwood), sets out to reform his neighbor, a young Hmong teenager, who tried to steal Kowalski's prized possession: his 1972 Gran Torino.\"]\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Aspect Ratio': '1.33:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.25 x 0.5 inches; 3.2 Ounces', 'Director': 'Clint Eastwood', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, Full Screen, NTSC', 'Run time': '1 hour and 56 minutes', 'Release date': 'June 9, 2009', 'Actors': 'Clint Eastwood, Brian Haley, Christopher Carley, Geraldine Hughes', 'Studio': 'Warner Home Video', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: I hadn't seen in a movie in..drum roll please..six years.

I had no idea what was even out there or what I would like to watch!<br />I had a plane trip coming up and wanted to get some for the trip.<br />When I went to Amazon's DVD page, Gran Torino was showing and of course, since I'm a huge Clint Eastwood fan, it was my choice.<br />I'm stunned as to what to say and I can't really add anything that other reviewers have not already said. BTW, I concur completely with Robert Crawford's absolutely beautiful review as that says it all so well.<br /><br />The unfolding of the layers to this crotchety, bitter man is what is so special and yet at the same time so sad that this is what his sons will never know, never experience is one that hit the 'closest to home' for me and much of the sadness that I did feel in this movie. The loss. The waste.<br /><br />I also want to comment on how much I enjoyed the actress who played Sue - the girl next door. She was a fabulous actress and you adored her instantly. Conversely, I had a bit more of a difficult time 'believing' the character of the boy until much more into the movie.<br /><br />Clint is still so very handsome - one scene where he puts on a nice jacket and has a close shave and no matter his age, he's still 'got it'.<br /><br />Yes, the old man thought long and hard and came up with the winning solution to a very real and very gruesome problem. And along with that, he buried the demons haunting his heart and mind for all those years.<br /><br />The movie is sad? Yes, but the saddest part of all is that it's a reality that is a part of so many peoples' lives all the time.\nReview Title: left me feeling utterly distraught\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: August Rush\nReview Date: 2009/12/27\nStore: Kirsten Sheridan  (Director),     Freddie Highmore  (Actor),     Keri Russell  (Actor)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Musicals & Performing Arts, Musicals\nProduct Description: ['Product Description', 'August Rush (WS/FS/DVD)', 'Separated by events they could not control but bound by love and by music, three people search for what they lost and what will make their lives complete ... each other.

Having shared one extraordinary night, classical cellist Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell) and Irish singer and songwriter Louis Connelly (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) were a union meant to be that was torn apart by circumstances and a protective father (William Sadler). After eleven years, both Lyla and Louis have given up performing only to find that they are unhappy and searching for a sense of fulfillment that will ultimately lead both artists back to music and performing. Evan (Freddie Highmore) is an 11-year old orphan who\\'s grown up hearing music in everything around him and is convinced that his real parents want him and will find him with the help of music. Driven by his innate musical genius and a powerful compulsion to perform before the world, Evan runs away from the orphanage and is initially taken in by a street man known as Wizard (Robin Williams) who encourages his musical talent and renames him August Rush and, later, by a local priest who arranges for August to receive a Julliard education. August is a child prodigy who excels beyond even the wildest expectations and earns the opportunity of a lifetime--a chance to perform in front of an enormous audience in New York\\'s Central Park. The question is; can his performance possibly reach the audience August really craves? While elements of this film are completely unbelievable (take August\\'s instant prowess on the guitar or his immediate and sophisticated grasp of musical notation and musical theory), the message of the universality of music and the notion that \"the music is all around us, all you have to do is listen\" is both compelling and powerful.', '--Tami Horiuchi']\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Musicals & Performing Arts/Musicals, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Kids & Family, Drama, Action & AdventureMusicals & Performing Arts/Musicals, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Kids & Family, Drama, Action & Adventure  See more', 'Format': 'AC-3, Closed-captioned, Multiple Formats, Color, Dubbed, Full Screen, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, WidescreenAC-3, Closed-captioned, Multiple Formats, Color, Dubbed, Full Screen, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen  See more', 'Contributor': \"Mykelti Williamson, Alex O'Loughlin, Terrence Howard, Kirsten Sheridan, William Sadler, Lionel Wigram, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Richard Barton Lewis, Marian Seldes, Leon Thomas III, Miky Lee, Paul Castro, Robin Williams, Ralph Kamp, James V.

What began as just needing something to watch (and for free streaming) ended up as an absolute obsession.<br />In the beginning of Season 1, it took a few episodes before deciding if it was worth my time. Was David Giuntoli just another pretty face or did this show have any possibility?<br />First, let me tell you that as Season 1 wrapped up and I got wrapped up in Season 2, not only did the star, Nick, played by David Giuntoli prove to be a terrific actor - but the actors together do a superb job. I really like Hank, played by Russell Hornsby all the more once he was &#34;in the loop&#34; as to the real goings-on; and the development of the Captain's character was a nice turn of events. The character, Monroe, played by Silas W. Mitchell is the real maker of the show, because without him, it would be missing the element of humor and charm. And I love the addition of Rosalee! She's superb. The only character that's flawed is Juliette, who I found not only annoying, but her acting is sub-par and took away from the show. Everyone else made up for it though.<br />The writing, storyline, acting, makeup, special effects and scenery make this Season 2 of Grimm the best. I stayed up late last night to watch three in a row if that tells you anything!<br />(I do not recommend for children - let it be for adults only, in my opinion)\nReview Title: What started as just needing something (free) to watch grew into an obsession and one of my all-time faves!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2015/02/21\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Kristi Jacobson', 'Lori Silverbush'], 'Producers': ['Julie Goldman', 'Ryan Harrington', 'Kristi Jacobson', 'Lori Silverbush'], 'Starring': ['Jeff Bridges', 'Tom Colicchio'], 'Studio': ['Magnolia Pictures']}\nReview Text: Completely missed the mark - didn't show the real problems nor the real solutions and threw in enough truth to grab your emotions while enough political bulls*t to be a complete turnoff.<br />I would love to have a one-on-one conversation with Jeff Bridges to show him the real problems and some real solutions. The Government is not the answer, nor should it be. I agree that the Government is certainly a part of the PROBLEM - no doubt.<br />Becoming more self reliant and sustainable and returning to more the 'natural' human is where the answer lies. Read Michael Bunker's book, &#34;Surviving Off Off-Grid&#34; for starters.<br />I myself have taught a 2 hr class on sprouting - for ULTIMATE NUTRITION for only pennies a day, which can be done in any living situation. Victoria Boutenko (see her books here on Amazon), as an individual, has traveled the world over, to some of the most 3rd world countries where  people truly ARE starving, and where they have no resources and showed them how to grow the most NUTRITIOUS foods on the planet for very little cost and effort and to provide enough for their village - not just to survive and get by, but to THRIVE in good health and to be enough for them ALL.<br /><br />This movie missed the mark. While I do recommend that people see it to understand some things - though NOT the things mentioned in the movie - but to basically see the MISCONCEPTIONS and how things are being skewed, I do recommend that people know just how many people in this country are facing these issues.

I stumbled across this one time when I was laid up with a back injury and really loved it. Basically, it's very simplistic. As far as movies, sets, props, acting and all that goes, it would probably classify as very B or even C rated. But if you look past that, and pretend you were watching a play in a theatre, instead perhaps, and just simply listened to the message, you will soon see how masterfully BRILLIANT each of these films are!<br />I love how they present the questions and answers just as we all would wonder or ask; or have at some time or another. And it is great to have those questions - but the ANSWERS are what are so powerful.<br />If you have questions yourself; or maybe you know someone who does, this is really a helpful tool. These make great gifts again and again. Good to send your child off to college with; good to have family time with; great to donate to a Teen Group or your favorite church ministry. Look for their special pricing and grab them when on special.<br />I love this set. Problem is, I never end up keeping a set for myself - I always give them away.

It is just too personal; too subjective; too changeable; and depends on your own perspective at the very time of your viewing it. I've even watched a movie at one time and felt one way and then a few years later, watched it again and got way more from it then.<br />Therefore, although I rated it five stars, and did really love it, I can't say that I think others are completely wrong to rate it only two stars as I understand that's how they felt about it as that's their own experience.<br />I, on the other hand, was so gripped, and felt the intensity of it so much that I watched three episodes the first night, and then three more the second night, and finished it two days later. I HAD to know what happened next!!<br />I thought the cast was an all star cast and each one did an excellent job of acting their character. Although this movie has definitely scared me from ever wanting to go to Belize, the scenery was incredible! It was so beautiful! I thought this film was outstanding in the story; the twists and turns of events; the acting; the cinematography and in how it remained intense enough  to the very end!<br />Just what is a person's real character and how does it present itself in the most dire of circumstances? What of loyaty, or honor? Only one truly was a shmuck and remained a shmuck, no matter what came his way, even after just praying for &#34;a second chance&#34;.

I did enjoy it. I thought the writers did a good job; it had a lot of twists and turns; and was pretty exciting. AND I can't wait to see if there will be a Season 3.<br />The only thing I have to say, since I cannot select a 4.5 stars rating, is that there was something lacking. I can't put my finger on it, but there was an 'energy' that was missing. I also felt the acting was just slightly missing the mark in some of the characters and, as if, it didn't quite mesh well with other characters' acting - as if one was over the top, while the other a bit bland. I can't explain..<br />I enjoy Titus Welliver as an actor, and I do very much like this series, but, after a while, the way he walks, and stands seems to be as if he is either physically very uncomfortable (he walks and stands awkwardly); or he is not comfortable with himself and is self-conscious. On top of that, it was starting to annoy me that he often didn't look one in the eye when talking, but his head and eyes are darting all over the place.<br />Anyway, all that aside, I thought it was a great season and I really enjoyed it and can't wait for Season 3.\nReview Title: Watched the whole Season in 3 days\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Million Dollar Baby (DVD)\nReview Date: 2016/07/08\nStore: Clint Eastwood  (Actor, Director, Producer),     Hilary Swank  (Actor)    Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Today's Deals, Spotlight Deals, Mother's Day Gift Ideas in Movies & TV\nProduct Description: ['\"I DON\\'T TRAIN GIRLS\", trainer Frankie Dunn growls.

How is that fair when you are are reviewing something as it would likely appeal to the masses? When you are rating story line, acting, directing, etc, etc.?<br />So, I will say this - I was stunned with the ending and didn't like how I felt. But since this movie wasn't about 'me' or how I would feel, I wanted to appreciate all aspects of the movie and mention them.<br />I thought the message was good; and clear; and ones we all can (or should) relate to - which is basically seeing that people are human; and that sometimes there is a real struggle just to find their way in life. There were so many messages to be found here that discovering them is also part of the individual's own message as to what they can glean from it. It can be not only learning who you are..but also who you aren't, as Maggie did the one moment she realized that her family was definitely not her family.<br />I didn't like the way the movie ended and wished it had ended differently..but there was no promise of that to begin with - no 'rose garden';<br /><br />Now for some critiquing: I felt like I had seen both Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman in those same types of character roles before that it seemed too redundant or 'deja vu'. I think the director wanted to leave some things up to the viewer's imagination, and yet, for me anyway, it left too many questions such as what happened between Clint Eastwood and his daughter and why did it pain him so much? What was the envelope he found on the floor and why was that significant? Also, I was confused as to how Clint Eastwood felt about Hillary (Maggie). There were times when I felt he loved her like a daughter, and then other times where I wondered if it were more? Or was that up to our own interpretation as well?<br />I thought the boxing scenes were awesome - and this from a person who despises boxing! They did an awesome job with all the boxing.<br /><br />This movie came with two DVD's and I watched the second one later. This really helped me understand the movie from behind the scenes, as well as clarify for me what the mysterious envelope was! I appreciated all the training Hillary did for her part; and how well she succeeded.<br />Others had a problem with the narration (done by Morgan Freeman). I actually loved it - but then who doesn't love his voice? Also, the very last sentence of the narrative tied the movie all together, so it was well worth it to have the narration, in my opinion.<br /><br />That we were left hanging, wondering what happened to Clint Eastwood, was supposed to be speculative. I don't know that I liked that. I wanted to at least have an idea. Nonetheless, I made up my own answer.<br />Maybe that's the whole idea..\nReview Title: .How to objectively review a movie?\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2016/11/17\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Mel Gibson'], 'Producers': ['Bill Mechanic', 'David Permut', 'Terry Benedict', 'Paul Currie', 'Bruce Davey', 'Brian Oliver'], 'Starring': ['Andrew Garfield', 'Richard Pyros', 'Jacob Warner']}\nReview Text: i rarely ever see a movie in the theater, but it just so happened, for the first time in many years, I had the opportunity to go and &quot;Hacksaw Ridge&quot; was the movie of choice.

I was accompanied by two others, and they knew even less of the movie.<br />All three of us were absolutely blown away, and days later, we are still talking about it, and how much it touched, and impacted us. That is the sign of an excellent movie - when you are still so very much aware of what it meant to you several days later. When the scenes play in your mind over and over again, and you recapture their meaning. When new insights form and take on even deeper meaning and revelation.<br />AND THIS MOVIE WILL DO JUST THAT.<br />Mel Gibson is one very fine director. I still cannot get over how those war scenes were done - so realstically - as I've never seen before. Depicting the horror, the terror..the absolute fear.<br />I've read the other reviews here, and so far, many of them disappoint me. I don't care to hear anything about Mel Gibson's past. Irrelevant.

It's a sadness that also comes with great joy because it reached its full cycle and you felt that fulfillment. You also felt its purpose, and the love.<br /><br />I think for some to comment that it was 'predictable' miss the point. Much in life is predictable. For me, I don't care that some things are predictable; or simplified, or maybe not even 'realistic'. I can get reality in the day to day. To watch a movie is to become involved deeply with so many levels of the movie and to glean from it whatever message you are receiving at that time.<br /><br />I enjoyed Morgan's wife in the movie and the relationship he had with her. Of course she is going to get mad at him; be frustrated, concerned and then absolutely shocked and bewildered when he announced his plans. But, she also showed great trust, and love and knew that whatever he was needing to do, it's what he needed to do and let it go. Let him go. I enjoyed those intimate scenes. People need to see great strength and trust between two people.<br /><br />I also found myself hanging on the edge of my seat when Morgan was at the bar and the beautiful lady came up and sat next to him. I found myself thinking that if MORGAN (the actor - not even the character!) 'gave in', then I would change how I felt about him (however irrational since it was his character, not him). I held my breath in anticipation...<br />Now, whether Morgan had any say so on the outcome of that scene or whether that was how the script was written anyway, it made a world of difference to me. And if Morgan did have a say so, well, all the more reason why I esteem him so highly.<br /><br />I thought it was a wonderful movie and am so glad I got to see it.\nTwo of my favorites together for an unforgettable movie\nGran Torino\nClint Eastwood  (Actor, Director),     Brian Haley  (Actor)    Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Studio Specials, Warner Home Video, All Titles\n[\"A disgruntled Korean War vet, Walt Kowalski (Eastwood), sets out to reform his neighbor, a young Hmong teenager, who tried to steal Kowalski's prized possession: his 1972 Gran Torino.\"]\n{'Aspect Ratio': '1.33:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.25 x 0.5 inches; 3.2 Ounces', 'Director': 'Clint Eastwood', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, Full Screen, NTSC', 'Run time': '1 hour and 56 minutes', 'Release date': 'June 9, 2009', 'Actors': 'Clint Eastwood, Brian Haley, Christopher Carley, Geraldine Hughes', 'Studio': 'Warner Home Video', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nI hadn't seen in a movie in..drum roll please..six years.

BTW, I concur completely with Robert Crawford's absolutely beautiful review as that says it all so well.<br /><br />The unfolding of the layers to this crotchety, bitter man is what is so special and yet at the same time so sad that this is what his sons will never know, never experience is one that hit the 'closest to home' for me and much of the sadness that I did feel in this movie. The loss. The waste.<br /><br />I also want to comment on how much I enjoyed the actress who played Sue - the girl next door. She was a fabulous actress and you adored her instantly. Conversely, I had a bit more of a difficult time 'believing' the character of the boy until much more into the movie.<br /><br />Clint is still so very handsome - one scene where he puts on a nice jacket and has a close shave and no matter his age, he's still 'got it'.<br /><br />Yes, the old man thought long and hard and came up with the winning solution to a very real and very gruesome problem. And along with that, he buried the demons haunting his heart and mind for all those years.<br /><br />The movie is sad?

What began as just needing something to watch (and for free streaming) ended up as an absolute obsession.<br />In the beginning of Season 1, it took a few episodes before deciding if it was worth my time. Was David Giuntoli just another pretty face or did this show have any possibility?<br />First, let me tell you that as Season 1 wrapped up and I got wrapped up in Season 2, not only did the star, Nick, played by David Giuntoli prove to be a terrific actor - but the actors together do a superb job. I really like Hank, played by Russell Hornsby all the more once he was &#34;in the loop&#34; as to the real goings-on; and the development of the Captain's character was a nice turn of events. The character, Monroe, played by Silas W. Mitchell is the real maker of the show, because without him, it would be missing the element of humor and charm. And I love the addition of Rosalee! She's superb. The only character that's flawed is Juliette, who I found not only annoying, but her acting is sub-par and took away from the show. Everyone else made up for it though.<br />The writing, storyline, acting, makeup, special effects and scenery make this Season 2 of Grimm the best.

Victoria Boutenko (see her books here on Amazon), as an individual, has traveled the world over, to some of the most 3rd world countries where  people truly ARE starving, and where they have no resources and showed them how to grow the most NUTRITIOUS foods on the planet for very little cost and effort and to provide enough for their village - not just to survive and get by, but to THRIVE in good health and to be enough for them ALL.<br /><br />This movie missed the mark. While I do recommend that people see it to understand some things - though NOT the things mentioned in the movie - but to basically see the MISCONCEPTIONS and how things are being skewed, I do recommend that people know just how many people in this country are facing these issues. I simply see the issues as being completely different than what is presented in this film\nI would love to have a one-on-one conversation with Jeff Bridges to ...\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium', 'Espa\u00f1ol', 'Deutsch'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', 'Deutsch', 'Espa\u00f1ol'], 'Directors': ['Alex Zakrzewski', 'Ernest R.

I stumbled across this one time when I was laid up with a back injury and really loved it. Basically, it's very simplistic. As far as movies, sets, props, acting and all that goes, it would probably classify as very B or even C rated. But if you look past that, and pretend you were watching a play in a theatre, instead perhaps, and just simply listened to the message, you will soon see how masterfully BRILLIANT each of these films are!<br />I love how they present the questions and answers just as we all would wonder or ask; or have at some time or another. And it is great to have those questions - but the ANSWERS are what are so powerful.<br />If you have questions yourself; or maybe you know someone who does, this is really a helpful tool.

It is just too personal; too subjective; too changeable; and depends on your own perspective at the very time of your viewing it. I've even watched a movie at one time and felt one way and then a few years later, watched it again and got way more from it then.<br />Therefore, although I rated it five stars, and did really love it, I can't say that I think others are completely wrong to rate it only two stars as I understand that's how they felt about it as that's their own experience.<br />I, on the other hand, was so gripped, and felt the intensity of it so much that I watched three episodes the first night, and then three more the second night, and finished it two days later. I HAD to know what happened next!!<br />I thought the cast was an all star cast and each one did an excellent job of acting their character. Although this movie has definitely scared me from ever wanting to go to Belize, the scenery was incredible! It was so beautiful! I thought this film was outstanding in the story; the twists and turns of events; the acting; the cinematography and in how it remained intense enough  to the very end!<br />Just what is a person's real character and how does it present itself in the most dire of circumstances? What of loyaty, or honor? Only one truly was a shmuck and remained a shmuck, no matter what came his way, even after just praying for &#34;a second chance&#34;. I guess, then, even he remained true to his real character - once a shmuck, always a shmuck.<br />I don't know about you, but I have a few questions, but let's just say this..I think I would've left the duffle bag on the boat and not have had anything to do with it right from the start.<br />Yes, entertaining movie!\nI loved it and watched three the first night!\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium', 'Espa\u00f1ol', 'Deutsch'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', 'Deutsch', 'Espa\u00f1ol'], 'Directors': ['Alex Zakrzewski', 'Ernest R.

I did enjoy it. I thought the writers did a good job; it had a lot of twists and turns; and was pretty exciting. AND I can't wait to see if there will be a Season 3.<br />The only thing I have to say, since I cannot select a 4.5 stars rating, is that there was something lacking. I can't put my finger on it, but there was an 'energy' that was missing. I also felt the acting was just slightly missing the mark in some of the characters and, as if, it didn't quite mesh well with other characters' acting - as if one was over the top, while the other a bit bland. I can't explain..<br />I enjoy Titus Welliver as an actor, and I do very much like this series, but, after a while, the way he walks, and stands seems to be as if he is either physically very uncomfortable (he walks and stands awkwardly); or he is not comfortable with himself and is self-conscious. On top of that, it was starting to annoy me that he often didn't look one in the eye when talking, but his head and eyes are darting all over the place.<br />Anyway, all that aside, I thought it was a great season and I really enjoyed it and can't wait for Season 3.\nWatched the whole Season in 3 days\nMillion Dollar Baby (DVD)\nClint Eastwood  (Actor, Director, Producer),     Hilary Swank  (Actor)    Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD\nMovies & TV, Today's Deals, Spotlight Deals, Mother's Day Gift Ideas in Movies & TV\n['\"I DON\\'T TRAIN GIRLS\", trainer Frankie Dunn growls.

How is that fair when you are are reviewing something as it would likely appeal to the masses? When you are rating story line, acting, directing, etc, etc.?<br />So, I will say this - I was stunned with the ending and didn't like how I felt. But since this movie wasn't about 'me' or how I would feel, I wanted to appreciate all aspects of the movie and mention them.<br />I thought the message was good; and clear; and ones we all can (or should) relate to - which is basically seeing that people are human; and that sometimes there is a real struggle just to find their way in life. There were so many messages to be found here that discovering them is also part of the individual's own message as to what they can glean from it. It can be not only learning who you are..but also who you aren't, as Maggie did the one moment she realized that her family was definitely not her family.<br />I didn't like the way the movie ended and wished it had ended differently..but there was no promise of that to begin with - no 'rose garden';<br /><br />Now for some critiquing: I felt like I had seen both Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman in those same types of character roles before that it seemed too redundant or 'deja vu'. I think the director wanted to leave some things up to the viewer's imagination, and yet, for me anyway, it left too many questions such as what happened between Clint Eastwood and his daughter and why did it pain him so much? What was the envelope he found on the floor and why was that significant? Also, I was confused as to how Clint Eastwood felt about Hillary (Maggie). There were times when I felt he loved her like a daughter, and then other times where I wondered if it were more? Or was that up to our own interpretation as well?<br />I thought the boxing scenes were awesome - and this from a person who despises boxing! They did an awesome job with all the boxing.<br /><br />This movie came with two DVD's and I watched the second one later. This really helped me understand the movie from behind the scenes, as well as clarify for me what the mysterious envelope was! I appreciated all the training Hillary did for her part; and how well she succeeded.<br />Others had a problem with the narration (done by Morgan Freeman). I actually loved it - but then who doesn't love his voice? Also, the very last sentence of the narrative tied the movie all together, so it was well worth it to have the narration, in my opinion.<br /><br />That we were left hanging, wondering what happened to Clint Eastwood, was supposed to be speculative. I don't know that I liked that. I wanted to at least have an idea. Nonetheless, I made up my own answer.<br />Maybe that's the whole idea..\n.How to objectively review a movie?\n{'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Mel Gibson'], 'Producers': ['Bill Mechanic', 'David Permut', 'Terry Benedict', 'Paul Currie', 'Bruce Davey', 'Brian Oliver'], 'Starring': ['Andrew Garfield', 'Richard Pyros', 'Jacob Warner']}\ni rarely ever see a movie in the theater, but it just so happened, for the first time in many years, I had the opportunity to go and &quot;Hacksaw Ridge&quot; was the movie of choice. I knew very little about it, other than it came highly recommended. I was accompanied by two others, and they knew even less of the movie.<br />All three of us were absolutely blown away, and days later, we are still talking about it, and how much it touched, and impacted us. That is the sign of an excellent movie - when you are still so very much aware of what it meant to you several days later. When the scenes play in your mind over and over again, and you recapture their meaning. When new insights form and take on even deeper meaning and revelation.<br />AND THIS MOVIE WILL DO JUST THAT.<br />Mel Gibson is one very fine director. I still cannot get over how those war scenes were done - so realstically - as I've never seen before. Depicting the horror, the terror..the absolute fear.<br />I've read the other reviews here, and so far, many of them disappoint me. I don't care to hear anything about Mel Gibson's past. Irrelevant.

It's a sadness that also comes with great joy because it reached its full cycle and you felt that fulfillment. You also felt its purpose, and the love.<br /><br />I think for some to comment that it was 'predictable' miss the point. Much in life is predictable. For me, I don't care that some things are predictable; or simplified, or maybe not even 'realistic'. I can get reality in the day to day. To watch a movie is to become involved deeply with so many levels of the movie and to glean from it whatever message you are receiving at that time.<br /><br />I enjoyed Morgan's wife in the movie and the relationship he had with her. Of course she is going to get mad at him; be frustrated, concerned and then absolutely shocked and bewildered when he announced his plans. But, she also showed great trust, and love and knew that whatever he was needing to do, it's what he needed to do and let it go. Let him go. I enjoyed those intimate scenes. People need to see great strength and trust between two people.<br /><br />I also found myself hanging on the edge of my seat when Morgan was at the bar and the beautiful lady came up and sat next to him. I found myself thinking that if MORGAN (the actor - not even the character!) 'gave in', then I would change how I felt about him (however irrational since it was his character, not him). I held my breath in anticipation...<br />Now, whether Morgan had any say so on the outcome of that scene or whether that was how the script was written anyway, it made a world of difference to me. And if Morgan did have a say so, well, all the more reason why I esteem him so highly.<br /><br />I thought it was a wonderful movie and am so glad I got to see it.\nReview Title: Two of my favorites together for an unforgettable movie\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Gran Torino\nReview Date: 2009/12/21\nStore: Clint Eastwood  (Actor, Director),     Brian Haley  (Actor)    Rated:    R    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Studio Specials, Warner Home Video, All Titles\nProduct Description: [\"A disgruntled Korean War vet, Walt Kowalski (Eastwood), sets out to reform his neighbor, a young Hmong teenager, who tried to steal Kowalski's prized possession: his 1972 Gran Torino.\"]\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Aspect Ratio': '1.33:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.25 x 0.5 inches; 3.2 Ounces', 'Director': 'Clint Eastwood', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, Full Screen, NTSC', 'Run time': '1 hour and 56 minutes', 'Release date': 'June 9, 2009', 'Actors': 'Clint Eastwood, Brian Haley, Christopher Carley, Geraldine Hughes', 'Studio': 'Warner Home Video', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: I hadn't seen in a movie in..drum roll please..six years.

The loss. The waste.<br /><br />I also want to comment on how much I enjoyed the actress who played Sue - the girl next door. She was a fabulous actress and you adored her instantly. Conversely, I had a bit more of a difficult time 'believing' the character of the boy until much more into the movie.<br /><br />Clint is still so very handsome - one scene where he puts on a nice jacket and has a close shave and no matter his age, he's still 'got it'.<br /><br />Yes, the old man thought long and hard and came up with the winning solution to a very real and very gruesome problem.

Yes, but the saddest part of all is that it's a reality that is a part of so many peoples' lives all the time.\nReview Title: left me feeling utterly distraught\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: August Rush\nReview Date: 2009/12/27\nStore: Kirsten Sheridan  (Director),     Freddie Highmore  (Actor),     Keri Russell  (Actor)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Musicals & Performing Arts, Musicals\nProduct Description: ['Product Description', 'August Rush (WS/FS/DVD)', 'Separated by events they could not control but bound by love and by music, three people search for what they lost and what will make their lives complete ... each other.

Having shared one extraordinary night, classical cellist Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell) and Irish singer and songwriter Louis Connelly (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) were a union meant to be that was torn apart by circumstances and a protective father (William Sadler). After eleven years, both Lyla and Louis have given up performing only to find that they are unhappy and searching for a sense of fulfillment that will ultimately lead both artists back to music and performing. Evan (Freddie Highmore) is an 11-year old orphan who\\'s grown up hearing music in everything around him and is convinced that his real parents want him and will find him with the help of music. Driven by his innate musical genius and a powerful compulsion to perform before the world, Evan runs away from the orphanage and is initially taken in by a street man known as Wizard (Robin Williams) who encourages his musical talent and renames him August Rush and, later, by a local priest who arranges for August to receive a Julliard education. August is a child prodigy who excels beyond even the wildest expectations and earns the opportunity of a lifetime--a chance to perform in front of an enormous audience in New York\\'s Central Park. The question is; can his performance possibly reach the audience August really craves? While elements of this film are completely unbelievable (take August\\'s instant prowess on the guitar or his immediate and sophisticated grasp of musical notation and musical theory), the message of the universality of music and the notion that \"the music is all around us, all you have to do is listen\" is both compelling and powerful.', '--Tami Horiuchi']\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Musicals & Performing Arts/Musicals, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Kids & Family, Drama, Action & AdventureMusicals & Performing Arts/Musicals, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Kids & Family, Drama, Action & Adventure  See more', 'Format': 'AC-3, Closed-captioned, Multiple Formats, Color, Dubbed, Full Screen, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, WidescreenAC-3, Closed-captioned, Multiple Formats, Color, Dubbed, Full Screen, Dolby, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen  See more', 'Contributor': \"Mykelti Williamson, Alex O'Loughlin, Terrence Howard, Kirsten Sheridan, William Sadler, Lionel Wigram, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Richard Barton Lewis, Marian Seldes, Leon Thomas III, Miky Lee, Paul Castro, Robin Williams, Ralph Kamp, James V.

What began as just needing something to watch (and for free streaming) ended up as an absolute obsession.<br />In the beginning of Season 1, it took a few episodes before deciding if it was worth my time. Was David Giuntoli just another pretty face or did this show have any possibility?<br />First, let me tell you that as Season 1 wrapped up and I got wrapped up in Season 2, not only did the star, Nick, played by David Giuntoli prove to be a terrific actor - but the actors together do a superb job. I really like Hank, played by Russell Hornsby all the more once he was &#34;in the loop&#34; as to the real goings-on; and the development of the Captain's character was a nice turn of events. The character, Monroe, played by Silas W. Mitchell is the real maker of the show, because without him, it would be missing the element of humor and charm. And I love the addition of Rosalee! She's superb. The only character that's flawed is Juliette, who I found not only annoying, but her acting is sub-par and took away from the show. Everyone else made up for it though.<br />The writing, storyline, acting, makeup, special effects and scenery make this Season 2 of Grimm the best. I stayed up late last night to watch three in a row if that tells you anything!<br />(I do not recommend for children - let it be for adults only, in my opinion)\nReview Title: What started as just needing something (free) to watch grew into an obsession and one of my all-time faves!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2015/02/21\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Kristi Jacobson', 'Lori Silverbush'], 'Producers': ['Julie Goldman', 'Ryan Harrington', 'Kristi Jacobson', 'Lori Silverbush'], 'Starring': ['Jeff Bridges', 'Tom Colicchio'], 'Studio': ['Magnolia Pictures']}\nReview Text: Completely missed the mark - didn't show the real problems nor the real solutions and threw in enough truth to grab your emotions while enough political bulls*t to be a complete turnoff.<br />I would love to have a one-on-one conversation with Jeff Bridges to show him the real problems and some real solutions.

I stumbled across this one time when I was laid up with a back injury and really loved it. Basically, it's very simplistic. As far as movies, sets, props, acting and all that goes, it would probably classify as very B or even C rated. But if you look past that, and pretend you were watching a play in a theatre, instead perhaps, and just simply listened to the message, you will soon see how masterfully BRILLIANT each of these films are!<br />I love how they present the questions and answers just as we all would wonder or ask; or have at some time or another. And it is great to have those questions - but the ANSWERS are what are so powerful.<br />If you have questions yourself; or maybe you know someone who does, this is really a helpful tool. These make great gifts again and again. Good to send your child off to college with; good to have family time with; great to donate to a Teen Group or your favorite church ministry. Look for their special pricing and grab them when on special.<br />I love this set. Problem is, I never end up keeping a set for myself - I always give them away.

It is just too personal; too subjective; too changeable; and depends on your own perspective at the very time of your viewing it. I've even watched a movie at one time and felt one way and then a few years later, watched it again and got way more from it then.<br />Therefore, although I rated it five stars, and did really love it, I can't say that I think others are completely wrong to rate it only two stars as I understand that's how they felt about it as that's their own experience.<br />I, on the other hand, was so gripped, and felt the intensity of it so much that I watched three episodes the first night, and then three more the second night, and finished it two days later.

I did enjoy it. I thought the writers did a good job; it had a lot of twists and turns; and was pretty exciting. AND I can't wait to see if there will be a Season 3.<br />The only thing I have to say, since I cannot select a 4.5 stars rating, is that there was something lacking. I can't put my finger on it, but there was an 'energy' that was missing. I also felt the acting was just slightly missing the mark in some of the characters and, as if, it didn't quite mesh well with other characters' acting - as if one was over the top, while the other a bit bland. I can't explain..<br />I enjoy Titus Welliver as an actor, and I do very much like this series, but, after a while, the way he walks, and stands seems to be as if he is either physically very uncomfortable (he walks and stands awkwardly); or he is not comfortable with himself and is self-conscious. On top of that, it was starting to annoy me that he often didn't look one in the eye when talking, but his head and eyes are darting all over the place.<br />Anyway, all that aside, I thought it was a great season and I really enjoyed it and can't wait for Season 3.\nReview Title: Watched the whole Season in 3 days\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Million Dollar Baby (DVD)\nReview Date: 2016/07/08\nStore: Clint Eastwood  (Actor, Director, Producer),     Hilary Swank  (Actor)    Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Today's Deals, Spotlight Deals, Mother's Day Gift Ideas in Movies & TV\nProduct Description: ['\"I DON\\'T TRAIN GIRLS\", trainer Frankie Dunn growls.

How is that fair when you are are reviewing something as it would likely appeal to the masses? When you are rating story line, acting, directing, etc, etc.?<br />So, I will say this - I was stunned with the ending and didn't like how I felt. But since this movie wasn't about 'me' or how I would feel, I wanted to appreciate all aspects of the movie and mention them.<br />I thought the message was good; and clear; and ones we all can (or should) relate to - which is basically seeing that people are human; and that sometimes there is a real struggle just to find their way in life. There were so many messages to be found here that discovering them is also part of the individual's own message as to what they can glean from it. It can be not only learning who you are..but also who you aren't, as Maggie did the one moment she realized that her family was definitely not her family.<br />I didn't like the way the movie ended and wished it had ended differently..but there was no promise of that to begin with - no 'rose garden';<br /><br />Now for some critiquing: I felt like I had seen both Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman in those same types of character roles before that it seemed too redundant or 'deja vu'. I think the director wanted to leave some things up to the viewer's imagination, and yet, for me anyway, it left too many questions such as what happened between Clint Eastwood and his daughter and why did it pain him so much? What was the envelope he found on the floor and why was that significant? Also, I was confused as to how Clint Eastwood felt about Hillary (Maggie). There were times when I felt he loved her like a daughter, and then other times where I wondered if it were more? Or was that up to our own interpretation as well?<br />I thought the boxing scenes were awesome - and this from a person who despises boxing! They did an awesome job with all the boxing.<br /><br />This movie came with two DVD's and I watched the second one later. This really helped me understand the movie from behind the scenes, as well as clarify for me what the mysterious envelope was! I appreciated all the training Hillary did for her part; and how well she succeeded.<br />Others had a problem with the narration (done by Morgan Freeman). I actually loved it - but then who doesn't love his voice? Also, the very last sentence of the narrative tied the movie all together, so it was well worth it to have the narration, in my opinion.<br /><br />That we were left hanging, wondering what happened to Clint Eastwood, was supposed to be speculative. I don't know that I liked that. I wanted to at least have an idea. Nonetheless, I made up my own answer.<br />Maybe that's the whole idea..\nReview Title: .How to objectively review a movie?\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2016/11/17\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Mel Gibson'], 'Producers': ['Bill Mechanic', 'David Permut', 'Terry Benedict', 'Paul Currie', 'Bruce Davey', 'Brian Oliver'], 'Starring': ['Andrew Garfield', 'Richard Pyros', 'Jacob Warner']}\nReview Text: i rarely ever see a movie in the theater, but it just so happened, for the first time in many years, I had the opportunity to go and &quot;Hacksaw Ridge&quot; was the movie of choice.

I loved the wisdom of Christy, the eldest daughter, who was wise way beyond her years. I loved how the innocence of children broke through the walls and barriers of fear and pain in both the neighbor, and their father.<br />Good movie!\nReview Title: A very nice surprise.

First, I didn't even recognize Nicole Kidman. Did she create a different nose; or did she later have a nose job? Anyway, irrelevant.<br />Not knowing what the movie was about whatsoever, it was hard to try and piece it together to figure it out. I kept waiting to understand their focal point - their message. Was it about depression? Was it about happiness? Was it about mental illness? Was it about homosexuality? One reviewer wrote that Richard had AIDS. Where in the movie did they indicate that?<br />Very depressing movie, and at the end, I wished I could have &#34;the hours&#34; back I spent watching it.\nReview Title: Depressing\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n        Format your response exactly as follows:\n        POSITIVE SUMMARY:\n        [Your positive summary here]\n\n        NEGATIVE SUMMARY:\n        [Your negative summary here]\n\n        OVERALL SUMMARY:\n        [Your overall summary here]",

    "text": "I find it very difficult to give reviews on movies, books, and cookbooks. Movies can be all over the map and so relative, with so many variables (as with books), that it is sometimes just not truly 'fair' to give a review. A person can watch the same movie 20 times over their lifetime and glean many different things from the same exact movie depending on where they are at 'at the moment'.<br />I just wanted a movie with an interesting story that would keep me entertained and on my toes that would satisfy, and this one did it - for today. It might not have worked for me at any other time. Who lknows?<br />Funny, I'm not a fan of Ray Liotta, but I actually liked him in this. I think I was more focused on what a nightmare this was for him and truly empathizing for what he was going through in this ordeal than I was at poking holes in the story; or in some of my societal pet peeves and concerns. There are plenty of opportunities and occasions for me to 'air' those.<br />For me - today - it foot the bill.",
