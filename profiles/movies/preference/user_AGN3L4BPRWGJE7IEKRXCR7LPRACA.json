It\\'s not just that the two discs are packed with watchable extras that hardly reiterate the same information; it\\'s how they are handled--funny, inventive, with a light touch--unlike many PR-driven discs. A good place to start is the filmmakers\\' jolly commentary track, which branches off into 31 minutes of behind-the-scene stuff, deleted scenes, and curious anecdotes (they can also be watched separately). Pixar\\'s first making-of documentary is a most concise and interesting 25-minute examination that also sheds light on how the company works. With a digital-to-digital transfer, the film looks great and is available in widescreen or reformatted to full screen. The \"Family Fun\" disc includes another Pixar made-for-the-DVD gem, the 7-minute \"Exploring the Reef\" with Jean-Michel Cousteau (Jacques\\'s son) being upstaged by Dori and Marlin; it\\'s a hoot and teaches a fact or two you will remember about reefs. Both discs feature lovely menus that can be turned into virtual aquariums for your TV (by removing the text) featuring the knockout colors of the film\\'s settings.

A good place to start is the filmmakers\\' jolly commentary track, which branches off into 31 minutes of behind-the-scene stuff, deleted scenes, and curious anecdotes (they can also be watched separately). Pixar\\'s first making-of documentary is a most concise and interesting 25-minute examination that also sheds light on how the company works. With a digital-to-digital transfer, the film looks great and is available in widescreen or reformatted to full screen. The \"Family Fun\" disc includes another Pixar made-for-the-DVD gem, the 7-minute \"Exploring the Reef\" with Jean-Michel Cousteau (Jacques\\'s son) being upstaged by Dori and Marlin; it\\'s a hoot and teaches a fact or two you will remember about reefs.

(2001, Best Animated Short Film, FOR THE BIRDS), it\\'s FINDING NEMO, a hilarious adventure where you\\'ll meet colorful characters that take you into the breathtaking underwater world of Australia\\'s Great Barrier Reef. Nemo, an adventurous young clownfish, is unexpectedly taken to a dentist\\'s office aquarium. It\\'s up to Marlin (Albert Brooks), his worrisome father, and Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a friendly but forgetful regal blue tang fish, to make the epic journey to bring Nemo home. Their adventure brings them face-to-face with vegetarian sharks, surfer dude turtles, hypnotic jellyfish, hungry seagulls, and more. Marlin discovers a bravery he never knew, but will he be able to find his son? FINDING NEMO\\'s breakthrough computer animation takes you into a whole new world with this undersea adventure about family, courage, and challenges. Take the plunge into FINDING NEMO, a \"spectacularly beautiful animated adventure for everyone\" -- David Sheehan, CBS-TV', 'Review', '\"Dizzy, dazzling hilarity \\x96 a DVD to cherish and enjoy over and over again.\" --', 'Gene Shalit, Today Show', '\"This DVD will reel you in, hook, line and sinker.\" --', 'Bruce Kluger, PARENTING MAGAZINE', 'Set Contains:', 'It\\'s not that the folks at Pixar are geniuses when it comes to DVDs... well, come to think of it, their fifth DVD set shows these folks are wizards. It\\'s not just that the two discs are packed with watchable extras that hardly reiterate the same information; it\\'s how they are handled--funny, inventive, with a light touch--unlike many PR-driven discs. A good place to start is the filmmakers\\' jolly commentary track, which branches off into 31 minutes of behind-the-scene stuff, deleted scenes, and curious anecdotes (they can also be watched separately). Pixar\\'s first making-of documentary is a most concise and interesting 25-minute examination that also sheds light on how the company works. With a digital-to-digital transfer, the film looks great and is available in widescreen or reformatted to full screen. The \"Family Fun\" disc includes another Pixar made-for-the-DVD gem, the 7-minute \"Exploring the Reef\" with Jean-Michel Cousteau (Jacques\\'s son) being upstaged by Dori and Marlin; it\\'s a hoot and teaches a fact or two you will remember about reefs. Both discs feature lovely menus that can be turned into virtual aquariums for your TV (by removing the text) featuring the knockout colors of the film\\'s settings. Watch long enough for some shenanigans from the film\\'s characters and vocal talent.
