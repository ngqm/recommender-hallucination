Trivia said that it took five years to make. After five years, the reptilian aliens should have looked a little more advanced, and as an advanced race they should have been more technologically more advanced than they were shown. Though they were more advanced than the humans. Same stereotypical accents with the Russian character, and the gay guy. The main actress performed well and it was comical which I though was a bit off for a space adventure sci-fi story. Probably why I didn't like Space Balls. Also, at the end of the movie, they showed Mars in darkness. I would have liked to have seen Mars under sun, but that wouldn't have fit the otherwise darkened setting of space and the other side of the moon scenery.\nReview Title: Great Musical Sountrack\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2022/12/10\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Alcohol use', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', '\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629', '\u010ce\u0161tina', 'Dansk', 'Deutsch', '\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a)', 'Suomi', 'Filipino', 'Fran\u00e7ais', '\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea', '\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940', 'Magyar', 'Indonesia', 'Italiano', '\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e', '\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4', 'Bahasa Melayu', 'Norsk Bokm\u00e5l', 'Nederlands', 'Polski', 'Portugu\u00eas (Brasil)', 'Portugu\u00eas (Portugal)', 'Rom\u00e2n\u0103', '\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439', 'Svenska', '\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bcd', '\u0c24\u0c46\u0c32\u0c41\u0c17\u0c41', '\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22', 'T\u00fcrk\u00e7e', '\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430', 'Ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t', '\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7b80\u4f53\uff09', '\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7e41\u9ad4\uff09'], 'Directors': ['Ryan White'], 'Producers': ['Ryan White', 'Jessica Hargrave', 'Darryl Frank', 'Justin Falvey', 'Brandon Carroll', 'Matt Goldberg', 'Stephen Neely', 'Ryan Schiavo', 'Max Wagner']}\nReview Text: Well done.

Now while I was expecting aliens from outer space to impact the character's lives...apparently I knew nothing about it other than the preview and my imagination ran away filling in the blanks. It was a haunting story and exceeded my expectations even without the aliens since there weren't any. It was one of the best coming of age stories in an apocalyptic world that I have ever seen. The actors and actresses did a wonderful job securing the hopelessness and futility of nuclear war in a developed country.\nReview Title: A Haunting Film\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2019/06/12\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Audio languages': ['English'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Sam Miller'], 'Producers': ['Will Packer', 'Lee Clay'], 'Starring': ['Idris Elba', 'Taraji P.

Trivia said that it took five years to make. After five years, the reptilian aliens should have looked a little more advanced, and as an advanced race they should have been more technologically more advanced than they were shown. Though they were more advanced than the humans. Same stereotypical accents with the Russian character, and the gay guy. The main actress performed well and it was comical which I though was a bit off for a space adventure sci-fi story. Probably why I didn't like Space Balls. Also, at the end of the movie, they showed Mars in darkness. I would have liked to have seen Mars under sun, but that wouldn't have fit the otherwise darkened setting of space and the other side of the moon scenery.\nReview Title: Great Musical Sountrack\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2022/12/10\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Alcohol use', 'foul language'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', '\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629', '\u010ce\u0161tina', 'Dansk', 'Deutsch', '\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a)', 'Suomi', 'Filipino', 'Fran\u00e7ais', '\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea', '\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940', 'Magyar', 'Indonesia', 'Italiano', '\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e', '\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4', 'Bahasa Melayu', 'Norsk Bokm\u00e5l', 'Nederlands', 'Polski', 'Portugu\u00eas (Brasil)', 'Portugu\u00eas (Portugal)', 'Rom\u00e2n\u0103', '\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439', 'Svenska', '\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bcd', '\u0c24\u0c46\u0c32\u0c41\u0c17\u0c41', '\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22', 'T\u00fcrk\u00e7e', '\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430', 'Ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t', '\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7b80\u4f53\uff09', '\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7e41\u9ad4\uff09'], 'Directors': ['Ryan White'], 'Producers': ['Ryan White', 'Jessica Hargrave', 'Darryl Frank', 'Justin Falvey', 'Brandon Carroll', 'Matt Goldberg', 'Stephen Neely', 'Ryan Schiavo', 'Max Wagner']}\nReview Text: Well done.

I don't think the World Authority saw humans as a threat by this time since they already knew about the humans Darwin had found. I think the World Authority was a computer manned by humans. I didn't notice it was low budget. The people on the outside lived simple non-gadetry lives, but they also lived in fear of being discovered by the drone police, so they too were not entirely free either, but freerer than the people living in the pods. I was hoping Darwin's mother had escaped the pods as she bounced away leaving him in his pod.

    "title": "The Worst Acted Movie I have Seen",
    "text": "First of all the description was wrong, \"Sibling astronomers discover Martians are threatening to attack Earth, but no one believes them-until Martians land and nearly destroy all of New York City.\" The only other people the siblings besides the family of the sister was the military and military always thinks everything is a threat especially if it is coming from off the planet.<br /><br />Second this was the worst acted movie I have seen in a long, long time, not as bad as SpaceBalls. The lead actress, the lead actor were so melodramatic. I couldn't stand the way her mouth dropped open and her eyes got wide when she was scared, it was just so annoying, that her range of acting ability consisted of that.<br /><br />Third, the main two military men, the General and his assistant, talked to so fast that it reminded of Dragnet. Toward the end, they became melodramatic and moved about as fast they talked.<br /><br />Fourth, the aliens were not spider like creatures with elongated heads and rows of teeth. These were sky high and wore giant hats with octopus arms. Though I think this was more their armor than what they truly looked like.<br /><br />Fifth, the best actress was the mother in the nursing home.<br /><br />Sixth, I was really waiting for them to use the photos captured by Opportunity 2nd of the Martians flying up into the sky from the abyss of where they were located. Although the actress did say Opportunity, there was not acute reaction from the lead actress and I figured that NASA just hadn't gotten the photo yet from Opportunity 2nd. That was a part of the movie that while it directed to another movie, could have been used better. I thought they wasted subsequent nonexistent scenes with absolutely no alerting from NASA about Martians being captured on photos flying into the sky from Opportunity 2. That would have been the first warning that maybe earth was about to be attacked.<br /><br />Final conclusion, this is why we have mediocrity in science fiction, each new science fiction show uses the science that killed an alien in one show to become a more specific method for the next science fiction movie. All science fiction is not good science fiction. That is what I found out when I finally subscribed to cable many years ago and watched all the science fiction movies from sun-up to sun-down and then I was done. This movie falls into that category of not good science fiction. Though I did like the science part of the movie, the bad acting detracted from the movie. I would give it two stars, except I didn't hate the movie, unlike Spaceballs which probably got one star. So, three stars for effort because since it was made in 2021 and not pre-2000 it should have been a better sci-fi movie.",
