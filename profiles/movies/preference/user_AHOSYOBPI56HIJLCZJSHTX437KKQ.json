Frodo and Sam, led by Gollum, continue their dangerous mission toward the fires of Mount Doom in order to destroy the One Ring.', 'Amazon.com', 'As the triumphant start of a trilogy,', 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring', \"leaves you begging for more. By necessity, Peter Jackson's ambitious epic compresses J.R.R. Tolkien's classic\", 'The Lord of the Rings', \", but this robust adaptation maintains reverent allegiance to Tolkien's creation, instantly qualifying as one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. At 178 minutes, it's long enough to establish the myriad inhabitants of Middle-earth, the legendary Rings of Power, and the fellowship of hobbits, elves, dwarves, and humans--led by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the brave hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood)--who must battle terrifying forces of evil on their perilous journey to destroy the One Ring in the land of Mordor. Superbly paced, the film is both epic and intimate, offering astonishing special effects and production design while emphasizing the emotional intensity of Frodo's adventure, and ends on a perfect note of heroic loyalty and rich anticipation.\", 'After the breaking of the Fellowship, Frodo and Sam journey to Mordor with the creature Gollum as their guide in', 'The Two Towers', \". Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) join in the defense of the people of Rohan, who are the first target in the eradication of the race of Men by the renegade wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee) and the dark lord Sauron. Fantastic creatures, astounding visual effects, and a climactic battle at the fortress of Helm's Deep make\", 'The Two Towers', 'a worthy successor to', 'The Fellowship of the Ring', \", grander in scale but retaining the story's emotional intimacy.\", 'With', 'The Return of the King', \", the greatest fantasy epic in film history draws to a grand and glorious conclusion. The trilogy could never fully satisfy those who remain exclusively loyal to Tolkien's expansive literature, but as a showcase for physical and technical craftsmanship it is unsurpassed in pure scale and ambition, setting milestone after cinematic milestone as Frodo and Sam continue their mission to Mordor to destroy the soul-corrupting One Ring. While the heir to the kingdom of Men, Aragorn, endures the massive battle at Minas Tirith with the allegiance of Legolas, Gimli, and Gandalf, Frodo and Sam must survive the schizoid deceptions of Gollum, who remains utterly convincing as a hybrid of performance (by Andy Serkis) and subtly nuanced computer animation. Jackson and cowriters Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens have much ground to cover; that they do so with intense pacing and epic sweep is impressive enough, but by investing greater depth and consequence in the actions of fellow hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), they ensure that\", 'The Return of the King', \"maintains the trilogy's emphasis on intimate fellowship and remains faithful to Tolkien's overall vision. By ending the\", 'LOTR', 'trilogy with noble integrity and faith in the power of imaginative storytelling,', 'The Return of the King', ', like its predecessors, will stand as an adventure for the ages.', '--Jeff Shannon and David Horiuchi', 'Our Review of the Extended Edition on DVD (Dec. 14, 2004)', ':', \"The extended editions of Peter Jackson's\", 'The Lord of the Rings', \"present the greatest trilogy in film history in the most ambitious sets in DVD history. In bringing J.R.R. Tolkien's nearly unfilmable work to the screen, Jackson benefited from extraordinary special effects, evocative New Zealand locales, and an exceptionally well-chosen cast, but most of all from his own adaptation with co-writers Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, preserving Tolkien's vision and often his very words, but also making logical changes to accommodate the medium of film. While purists complained about these changes and about characters and scenes left out of the films, the almost two additional hours of material in the extended editions (about 11 hours total) help appease them by delving more deeply into Tolkien's music, the characters, and loose ends that enrich the story, such as an explanation of the Faramir-Denethor relationship, and the appearance of the Mouth of Sauron at the gates of Mordor. In addition, the extended editions offer more bridge material between the films, further confirming that the trilogy is really one long film presented in three pieces (which is why it's the greatest trilogy ever--there's no weak link). The scene of Galadriel's gifts to the Fellowship added to the first film proves significant over the course of the story, while the new Faramir scene at the end of the second film helps set up the third and the new Saruman scene at the beginning of the third film helps conclude the plot of the second.\", 'To top it all off, the extended editions offer four discs per film: two for the longer movie, plus four commentary tracks and stupendous DTS 6.1 ES sound; and two for the bonus material, which covers just about everything from script creation to special effects. The argument was that fans would need both versions because the bonus material is completely different, but the features on the theatrical releases are so vastly inferior that the only reason a fan would need them would be if they wanted to watch the shorter versions they saw in theaters (the last of which,', 'The Return of the King', ', merely won 11 Oscars).

But her Aunt Polly (Jane Wyman) is too concerned with appearances, propriety, and local politics to appreciate her effervescent niece. It isn\\'t until the town almost loses their \"Glad Girl\" that Aunt Polly realizes the power of love and lightheartedness. Featuring an impressive all-star cast and a story filled with fun, laughter, and tears, POLLYANNA will inspire your entire family and prove that the art of positive thinking is just as delightful today as it was at the turn of the century!|This was Hayley Mills\\' first film for Disney, and she immediately became the Studio\\'s newest star. She won an Academy Award(R) for the most outstanding juvenile performance of 1960.|The film was based on the 1913 book by Eleanor H. Porter. With a then lavish $2.5 million budget, director David Swift gathered a crew and cast unlike any other Disney live-action feature. Disney set decorator Emile Kuri was on hand but outsiders Walter Plunkett (costumes), Russell Harlan (cinematographers), and art directors Carroll Clark and Robert Clatworthy came from established careers at other studios.|To find a house to use as the residence of Aunt Polly, Walt Disney had to go far from his studio in Burbank. An ideal house was found in Santa Rosa, near Napa Valley. It occupied a full block in the center of town and was surrounded by spacious lawns and gardens.

Only Aunt Polly has trouble welcoming her young niece into her heart. In a clash between the townspeople and Aunt Polly over local politics, it's Pollyanna's influence that helps individual townspeople find the inner strength to stand up for their own beliefs.

At 178 minutes, it's long enough to establish the myriad inhabitants of Middle-earth, the legendary Rings of Power, and the fellowship of hobbits, elves, dwarves, and humans--led by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the brave hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood)--who must battle terrifying forces of evil on their perilous journey to destroy the One Ring in the land of Mordor.

The trilogy could never fully satisfy those who remain exclusively loyal to Tolkien's expansive literature, but as a showcase for physical and technical craftsmanship it is unsurpassed in pure scale and ambition, setting milestone after cinematic milestone as Frodo and Sam continue their mission to Mordor to destroy the soul-corrupting One Ring. While the heir to the kingdom of Men, Aragorn, endures the massive battle at Minas Tirith with the allegiance of Legolas, Gimli, and Gandalf, Frodo and Sam must survive the schizoid deceptions of Gollum, who remains utterly convincing as a hybrid of performance (by Andy Serkis) and subtly nuanced computer animation. Jackson and cowriters Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens have much ground to cover; that they do so with intense pacing and epic sweep is impressive enough, but by investing greater depth and consequence in the actions of fellow hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), they ensure that\", 'The Return of the King', \"maintains the trilogy's emphasis on intimate fellowship and remains faithful to Tolkien's overall vision. By ending the\", 'LOTR', 'trilogy with noble integrity and faith in the power of imaginative storytelling,', 'The Return of the King', ', like its predecessors, will stand as an adventure for the ages.', '--Jeff Shannon and David Horiuchi', 'Our Review of the Extended Edition on DVD (Dec. 14, 2004)', ':', \"The extended editions of Peter Jackson's\", 'The Lord of the Rings', \"present the greatest trilogy in film history in the most ambitious sets in DVD history. In bringing J.R.R. Tolkien's nearly unfilmable work to the screen, Jackson benefited from extraordinary special effects, evocative New Zealand locales, and an exceptionally well-chosen cast, but most of all from his own adaptation with co-writers Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, preserving Tolkien's vision and often his very words, but also making logical changes to accommodate the medium of film. While purists complained about these changes and about characters and scenes left out of the films, the almost two additional hours of material in the extended editions (about 11 hours total) help appease them by delving more deeply into Tolkien's music, the characters, and loose ends that enrich the story, such as an explanation of the Faramir-Denethor relationship, and the appearance of the Mouth of Sauron at the gates of Mordor. In addition, the extended editions offer more bridge material between the films, further confirming that the trilogy is really one long film presented in three pieces (which is why it's the greatest trilogy ever--there's no weak link). The scene of Galadriel's gifts to the Fellowship added to the first film proves significant over the course of the story, while the new Faramir scene at the end of the second film helps set up the third and the new Saruman scene at the beginning of the third film helps conclude the plot of the second.\", 'To top it all off, the extended editions offer four discs per film: two for the longer movie, plus four commentary tracks and stupendous DTS 6.1 ES sound; and two for the bonus material, which covers just about everything from script creation to special effects. The argument was that fans would need both versions because the bonus material is completely different, but the features on the theatrical releases are so vastly inferior that the only reason a fan would need them would be if they wanted to watch the shorter versions they saw in theaters (the last of which,', 'The Return of the King', ', merely won 11 Oscars).

An ideal house was found in Santa Rosa, near Napa Valley. It occupied a full block in the center of town and was surrounded by spacious lawns and gardens.

Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) join in the defense of the people of Rohan, who are the first target in the eradication of the race of Men by the renegade wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee) and the dark lord Sauron. Fantastic creatures, astounding visual effects, and a climactic battle at the fortress of Helm's Deep make\", 'The Two Towers', 'a worthy successor to', 'The Fellowship of the Ring', \", grander in scale but retaining the story's emotional intimacy.\", 'With', 'The Return of the King', \", the greatest fantasy epic in film history draws to a grand and glorious conclusion. The trilogy could never fully satisfy those who remain exclusively loyal to Tolkien's expansive literature, but as a showcase for physical and technical craftsmanship it is unsurpassed in pure scale and ambition, setting milestone after cinematic milestone as Frodo and Sam continue their mission to Mordor to destroy the soul-corrupting One Ring. While the heir to the kingdom of Men, Aragorn, endures the massive battle at Minas Tirith with the allegiance of Legolas, Gimli, and Gandalf, Frodo and Sam must survive the schizoid deceptions of Gollum, who remains utterly convincing as a hybrid of performance (by Andy Serkis) and subtly nuanced computer animation. Jackson and cowriters Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens have much ground to cover; that they do so with intense pacing and epic sweep is impressive enough, but by investing greater depth and consequence in the actions of fellow hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), they ensure that\", 'The Return of the King', \"maintains the trilogy's emphasis on intimate fellowship and remains faithful to Tolkien's overall vision. By ending the\", 'LOTR', 'trilogy with noble integrity and faith in the power of imaginative storytelling,', 'The Return of the King', ', like its predecessors, will stand as an adventure for the ages.', '--Jeff Shannon and David Horiuchi', 'Our Review of the Extended Edition on DVD (Dec. 14, 2004)', ':', \"The extended editions of Peter Jackson's\", 'The Lord of the Rings', \"present the greatest trilogy in film history in the most ambitious sets in DVD history. In bringing J.R.R. Tolkien's nearly unfilmable work to the screen, Jackson benefited from extraordinary special effects, evocative New Zealand locales, and an exceptionally well-chosen cast, but most of all from his own adaptation with co-writers Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, preserving Tolkien's vision and often his very words, but also making logical changes to accommodate the medium of film. While purists complained about these changes and about characters and scenes left out of the films, the almost two additional hours of material in the extended editions (about 11 hours total) help appease them by delving more deeply into Tolkien's music, the characters, and loose ends that enrich the story, such as an explanation of the Faramir-Denethor relationship, and the appearance of the Mouth of Sauron at the gates of Mordor. In addition, the extended editions offer more bridge material between the films, further confirming that the trilogy is really one long film presented in three pieces (which is why it's the greatest trilogy ever--there's no weak link). The scene of Galadriel's gifts to the Fellowship added to the first film proves significant over the course of the story, while the new Faramir scene at the end of the second film helps set up the third and the new Saruman scene at the beginning of the third film helps conclude the plot of the second.\", 'To top it all off, the extended editions offer four discs per film: two for the longer movie, plus four commentary tracks and stupendous DTS 6.1 ES sound; and two for the bonus material, which covers just about everything from script creation to special effects. The argument was that fans would need both versions because the bonus material is completely different, but the features on the theatrical releases are so vastly inferior that the only reason a fan would need them would be if they wanted to watch the shorter versions they saw in theaters (the last of which,', 'The Return of the King', ', merely won 11 Oscars). The', 'LOTR', \"extended editions without exception have set the DVD standard by providing a richer film experience that pulls the three films together and further embraces Tolkien's world, a reference-quality home theater experience, and generous, intelligent, and engrossing bonus features.\", '--David Horiuchi', 'Versions of', 'Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy', 'on Blu-ray and DVD', 'Original Theatrical Edition', 'Platinum Series Special Extended Edition', 'Original Theatrical and Extended Limited Edition', 'Original Theatrical Edition [Blu-ray]', 'Extended Edition [Blu-ray]', 'Release Date', 'May 25, 2004 Dec. 14, 2004 Aug. 29, 2006 Apr. 16, 2010 TBA', 'Format/Disc #', 'Three DVDs 12 DVDs Six DVDs Three Blu-ray Discs, Three DVDs, Three Digital Copies 15 Discs Total: Films are on Blu-ray, with Special Features on DVDs', 'Digital Copies', 'No No No Yes, on three discs (expired Apr. 4, 2011) Yes, online (expires Jun. 26, 2012)', 'Extra footage', 'None 30 minutes added to', 'Return of the King', '; 43 minutes added to', 'The Two Towers', '; 50 minutes added to', 'Return of the King', 'For all three films: Both the theatrical and extended edition on one disc None Same as extended-edition DVD', 'Commentaries', 'None Commentary by Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens; Commentary by the design team; Commentary by the production/post-production team; Commentary by the cast, including Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Sean Astin, Andy Serkis, John Rhys-Davies, Orlando Bloom, Christopher Lee, and Miranda Otto None None Same commentaries as extended-edition DVD', 'Documentaries', 'Fellowship of the Ring', ': \"Welcome to Middle-earth,\" \"The Quest for the Ring,\" \"A Passage to Middle-earth\";', 'The Two Towers', ': \"On the Set: The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\"; \"Return to Middle- earth\"', 'Return of the King', ': Three documentaries: \"The Quest Fulfilled: A Director\\'s Vision,\" \"A Filmmaker\\'s Journey: Making The Return of The King,\" \"National Geographic Special: Beyond the Movie\" \"From Book to Vision,\" \"From Vision to Reality,\" \"The Journey Continues...,\" Documentaries on J.R.R.

An ideal house was found in Santa Rosa, near Napa Valley. It occupied a full block in the center of town and was surrounded by spacious lawns and gardens.
