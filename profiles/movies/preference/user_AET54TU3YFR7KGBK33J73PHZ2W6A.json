(Speaking of the Replicators, these bad boys are so formidable a threat to the entire known universe that even the Wraith--the cat-eyed, white-haired, weird-skinned, vampire-like Johnny Winter lookalikes who feed on humans--fear them, resulting in a rather fraught, on-again-off-again alliance with the Stargaters.

In STARGATE: ATLANTIS, an international crew of scientists and soldiers finds yet another Stargate... one which leads to the Lost City of Atlantis. This Stargate, though, isn't on Earth but in the far-away Pegasus Galaxy, and the secret city holds a formidable new enemy-the Wraith. With this fourth season of the hit sci-fi series, things take a turn in a bleak new direction, with team leader Dr. Weir injured and captured by the evil Asurans as the damaged city of Atlantis drifts through space.

(Speaking of the Replicators, these bad boys are so formidable a threat to the entire known universe that even the Wraith--the cat-eyed, white-haired, weird-skinned, vampire-like Johnny Winter lookalikes who feed on humans--fear them, resulting in a rather fraught, on-again-off-again alliance with the Stargaters.

In STARGATE: ATLANTIS, an international crew of scientists and soldiers finds yet another Stargate... one which leads to the Lost City of Atlantis. This Stargate, though, isn't on Earth but in the far-away Pegasus Galaxy, and the secret city holds a formidable new enemy-the Wraith. With this fourth season of the hit sci-fi series, things take a turn in a bleak new direction, with team leader Dr. Weir injured and captured by the evil Asurans as the damaged city of Atlantis drifts through space.

There are a number of new developments in the course of this 20-episode run. The first is the departure of leader Dr. Elizabeth Weir (Torri Higginson), who\u2019s gone from the team by the third episode, replaced by Col. Samantha Carter (Amanda Tapping, who will be familiar to', 'Stargate SG-1', 'fans after her long stint on that now-defunct series); seems Weir\u2019s body contains \u201cnanites,\u201d the elements that make up the \u201csentient machines\u201d known as the Replicators, which leads to her making a supreme sacrifice on behalf of her fellow humans. (Speaking of the Replicators, these bad boys are so formidable a threat to the entire known universe that even the Wraith--the cat-eyed, white-haired, weird-skinned, vampire-like Johnny Winter lookalikes who feed on humans--fear them, resulting in a rather fraught, on-again-off-again alliance with the Stargaters.
