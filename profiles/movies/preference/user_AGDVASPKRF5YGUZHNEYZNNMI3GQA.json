Wazowski\\'s childhood dream was to become a professional scarer, and his acceptance into Monsters University was a dream come true--until an unfortunate encounter with \"Jimmy\" Sullivan ignited a rivalry that threatened both monsters\\' chances of success. True opposites, Wazowski is studious, uptight, and completely intent on learning the history and theory behind scaring, but lacks any semblance of actual scare factor, while the boisterous Sulley relies on natural scaring ability and his family\\'s reputation, but devotes virtually no time or attention to his studies. When an argument between the two classmates gets out of hand, they are expelled from the scare program, and the fraternity-sponsored Scare Games offers them one last-chance opportunity to get back into the program. Wazowski and Sulley reluctantly join forces with one another and a hodge-podge of other misfits out of sheer necessity, but they are a team in name only, with each of the two monsters vowing to pull the \"team\" to victory through his individual efforts and sheer willpower. What the pair discovers is that only by working together and taking advantage of each member\\'s individual differences do they have a chance of winning the contest.

The pair\\'s out of control competitive spirit gets them both kicked out of the University\\'s elite Scare Program. With their dreams temporarily dashed, they realize they will have to work together, along with an odd bunch of misfit monsters, if they ever hope to make things right.

Somebody at Pixar did, and it turns out that the seemingly made-for-each-other partnership had an unexpectedly rocky beginning. Wazowski\\'s childhood dream was to become a professional scarer, and his acceptance into Monsters University was a dream come true--until an unfortunate encounter with \"Jimmy\" Sullivan ignited a rivalry that threatened both monsters\\' chances of success. True opposites, Wazowski is studious, uptight, and completely intent on learning the history and theory behind scaring, but lacks any semblance of actual scare factor, while the boisterous Sulley relies on natural scaring ability and his family\\'s reputation, but devotes virtually no time or attention to his studies. When an argument between the two classmates gets out of hand, they are expelled from the scare program, and the fraternity-sponsored Scare Games offers them one last-chance opportunity to get back into the program. Wazowski and Sulley reluctantly join forces with one another and a hodge-podge of other misfits out of sheer necessity, but they are a team in name only, with each of the two monsters vowing to pull the \"team\" to victory through his individual efforts and sheer willpower. What the pair discovers is that only by working together and taking advantage of each member\\'s individual differences do they have a chance of winning the contest.

Refreshingly, the movie's characters aren't celebrity-reliant, with the most recognizable voice coming from Peter O'Toole's snide food critic. (This fellow provides the film's sole sour note--an oddly pointed slap at critics, those craven souls who have done nothing but rave about Pixar's movies over the years.) Brad Bird's style is more quick-hit and less resonant than the approach of Pixar honcho John Lasseter, but it's hard to complain about a movie that cooks up such bountiful pleasure. --\", 'Robert Horton', 'Beyond', 'Ratatouille', 'on DVD', 'Ratatouille', 'on Blu-ray', 'Ratatouille', 'Toys & More', 'Other Classic Pixar Hits', 'Stills from', 'Ratatouille', '(Click for larger image)']\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Aspect Ratio': '2.40:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'G (General Audience)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.5 x 0.5 inches; 4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'WD05371400DVD', 'Director': 'Brad Bird, Jan Pinkava', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Dolby, NTSC, Widescreen, Digital Sound', 'Run time': '1 hour and 51 minutes', 'Release date': 'November 6, 2007', 'Actors': 'Brad Garrett, Lou Romano, Patton Oswalt', 'Dubbed': 'English', 'Subtitles': 'English', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround), English (Dolby Digital 5.1), Unqualified (DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1)', 'Studio': 'DISNEY/PIXAR', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: Kids loved It\nReview Title: Five Stars\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Planes\nReview Date: 2015/08/04\nStore: Dane Cook  (Actor),     Stacy Keach  (Actor)    Rated:    PG    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Featured Categories, DVD, Kids & Family\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {}\nReview Text: grandkids loved it\nReview Title: Five Stars\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Cars 2\nReview Date: 2015/08/04\nStore: Larry the Cable Guy  (Actor),     Owen Wilson  (Actor),     Brad Lewis  (Director),     John Lasseter  (Director)    &                   1                  more   Rated:    G    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment, All Disney Titles\nProduct Description: ['Product Description', 'From the creators of CARS and TOY STORY 3 comes a new, laugh-out-loud, heartwarming adventure geared for the entire family.

After a successful season on the track, Lightning is looking forward to some rest at home, but Mater gets him involved in an elaborate three-part international race sponsored by Sir Miles Axlerod (Eddie Izzard) to promote his new synthetic auto fuel. While serving on Lightning's pit crew, Mater inadvertently gets mixed up with two British secret agent cars, Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) and Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer), who are investigating a plot to sabotage the race.

Ever since college-bound Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) was a little monster, he dreamed of becoming a Scarer - and he knows better than anyone that the best Scarers come from Monsters University (MU). But during his first semester at MU, Mike\\'s plans are derailed when he crosses paths with hotshot, James P. Sullivan, \"Sulley\" (John Goodman), a natural-born Scarer. The pair\\'s out of control competitive spirit gets them both kicked out of the University\\'s elite Scare Program. With their dreams temporarily dashed, they realize they will have to work together, along with an odd bunch of misfit monsters, if they ever hope to make things right. Pull an all-nighter with hours of exclusive bonus extras, including an inside look at the world of monsters and the animated theatrical short film The Blue Umbrella. Monsters University opens the door to huge laughs on Disney Blu-ray.', 'Amazon.com', 'Ever wonder how Mike Wazowski and James P. Sullivan paired up to become the top scaring team at Monsters, Inc.? Somebody at Pixar did, and it turns out that the seemingly made-for-each-other partnership had an unexpectedly rocky beginning. Wazowski\\'s childhood dream was to become a professional scarer, and his acceptance into Monsters University was a dream come true--until an unfortunate encounter with \"Jimmy\" Sullivan ignited a rivalry that threatened both monsters\\' chances of success. True opposites, Wazowski is studious, uptight, and completely intent on learning the history and theory behind scaring, but lacks any semblance of actual scare factor, while the boisterous Sulley relies on natural scaring ability and his family\\'s reputation, but devotes virtually no time or attention to his studies. When an argument between the two classmates gets out of hand, they are expelled from the scare program, and the fraternity-sponsored Scare Games offers them one last-chance opportunity to get back into the program. Wazowski and Sulley reluctantly join forces with one another and a hodge-podge of other misfits out of sheer necessity, but they are a team in name only, with each of the two monsters vowing to pull the \"team\" to victory through his individual efforts and sheer willpower. What the pair discovers is that only by working together and taking advantage of each member\\'s individual differences do they have a chance of winning the contest.
