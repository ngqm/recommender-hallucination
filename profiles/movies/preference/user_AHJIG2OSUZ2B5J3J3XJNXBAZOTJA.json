To Martin\u2019s utter disgust, his medical practice remains under official scrutiny because of his pre-existing blood phobia, and he is forced to attend refresher courses starting with phlebotomy. His wife, Louisa (Caroline Catz, DCI Banks) and aunt Ruth (Emmy winner Eileen Atkins, Cranford) urge him to take this risk to his career seriously, but events conspire against him.  While Louisa focuses on her own job change and studies child psychology, she worries that their son, James, is becoming too much like his father, and decides James needs a sibling. As the other residents of picturesque Portwenn contend with love and life changes, Martin remains stuck in his ways. Can he appease the medical board or will his days as the village GP soon be at an end?']\nAverage Rating: 4.9\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Comedy/Television, Television/British Television', 'Format': 'NTSC, Widescreen, Subtitled', 'Contributor': 'Ian McNeice, Martin Clunes, Caroline Catz, Eileen Atkins, Charlie Palmer, Nigel Cole', 'Number Of Discs': '3', 'Runtime': '6 hours and 2 minutes', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 4 Ounces', 'Director': 'Nigel Cole, Charlie Palmer', 'Media Format': 'NTSC, Widescreen, Subtitled', 'Run time': '6 hours and 2 minutes', 'Release date': 'December 10, 2019', 'Actors': 'Martin Clunes, Caroline Catz, Ian McNeice, Eileen Atkins', 'Studio': 'ACORN MEDIA', 'Number of discs': '3'}\nReview Text: Doc Martin is totally enjoyable,  the story and acting are wonderful, and the landscape is like a travelogue/like being there!\nReview Title: Arrived in perfect condition and wonderful story\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n        Format your response exactly as follows:\n        POSITIVE SUMMARY:\n        [Your positive summary here]\n\n        NEGATIVE SUMMARY:\n        [Your negative summary here]\n\n        OVERALL SUMMARY:\n        [Your overall summary here]",
