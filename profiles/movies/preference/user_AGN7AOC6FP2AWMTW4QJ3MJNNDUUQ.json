      "Young dinosaur friends Little Foot, Cera, Spike, Ducky, and Petrie are content with their lives in the Great Valley, but things keep changing and sometimes the friends just feel like they don't quite fit in. As Petrie struggles to perfect his flying for the very important Day of the Flyers, he realizes how different he is from his brothers and sisters and, while he and his friends value his uniqueness, it's causing big problems in the family's flight formations. Meanwhile, Cera is struggling with the arrival of a new baby sister and the resulting lack of attention from her father and Tria. When an odd creature named Guido shows up in the valley, Petrie befriends him and learns an important lesson about how to maintain his individuality while still contributing to his family's collaborative flight. A courageous act by Guido saves Cera's sister from peril, helping Cera realize how much she really cares about her new sister, and sparking a personal revelation that gives Guido a much better sense of his own place in the world. This is an entertaining animated show with a wholesome message about the importance of friendship, adaptability, and uniqueness. (Ages 3 to 7)",
