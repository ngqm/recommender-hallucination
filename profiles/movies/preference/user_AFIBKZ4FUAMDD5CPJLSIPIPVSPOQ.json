This movie is no exception.  What could have been a series of very good movies was condensed into one movie that cannot possibly move forward into the sequels.  How can it when so much was changed in the first movie that there is no way to incorporate the other books?<br /><br />That being said, if you have not read the series you will probably enjoy this movie. On it's own, it really wasn't bad.  The acting was decent, although a bit cheesy in parts.  It moved along well and had a decent story line.  So, if you're just looking for a movie whose trailer looks interesting, I definitely wouldn't tell you to pass on this one.  If you're looking for a movie that reflects even 1/3 of the actual book series, choose another one.\nReview Title: Not like the book\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2014/04/10\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'alcohol use', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English Dialogue Boost: High', 'English', 'English [Audio Description]', 'English Dialogue Boost: Medium'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]'], 'Directors': ['Steve McQueen'], 'Producers': ['Dede Gardner', 'Anthony Katagas', 'Jeremy Kleiner', 'Steve McQueen', 'Arnon Milchan', 'Brad Pitt', 'Bill Pohlad', 'John Ridley', 'Tessa Ross', 'Bianca Stigter'], 'Starring': ['Chiwetel Ejiofor', 'Michael Kenneth Williams', 'Michael Fassbender'], 'Studio': ['Fox']}\nReview Text: My son and I watched this movie and found ourselves alternately sickened and furious over what happened.

This movie was a complete waste of the $3.99 I paid to rent it through Amazon.  They tried to make up for terrible acting with action scenes that were in slow motion.  All that did was make it last longer, it didn't make it better.  Kellan Lutz should have been able to pull off Hercules, he certainly had the physique for it, but I just never connected with his character.  The love of his life was just silly.  Every line she said was supposed to be dramatic and instead it came out like some poorly written young adult novel.  Really, pass this one by.

    "text": "I was SO mad after watching Avengers Infinity War.  How could they do that to my Avengers?  They BETTER make it up in the second half!  Um, no.  All these back stories and flashbacks were a snoozefest.  Someone thought Thor was being funny - he was just pathetic.  My son took me to see this for my birthday and he actually left with half an hour left because he was so disgusted with it.  I would have left also but I kept hoping, praying that they would pull it out of the trash in that last bit.  Sadly, no.  Infinity War should have left me wanting more, wishing it would never end (like LOTR).  Instead, I was relieved to leave the theater.",
