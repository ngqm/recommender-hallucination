In 1997 it surpassed \"A Chorus Line\" as the longest running show in Broadway history. On September 10, 2000, after 7,485 shows and a run of nearly 18 years, the show closed - a Broadway record. For the first time ever, an Andrew Lloyd Webber show has been specially filmed and made available on video. With a star cast including Elaine Paige and Sir John Mills, and its stunning production values, Cats will no doubt set a new standard for the filming of all future musicals. Andrew Lloyd Webber\\'s Cats, the most famous musical of all time, first exploded onto the West End stage in 1981. \\'Memory\\', one of its many classic songs, became an instant worldwide hit. Since then Cats has smashed records and conquered the world. Using the latest technology, all the excitement, thrill, romance and intimacy of this theatrical legend has been captured on screen. Breathtaking visuals and full digital sound (that has been completely re-recorded with a seventy piece orchestra) will lead you deep into the mysterious world of Cats. Cats - as you\\'ll never see it again - more intoxicating and magical than you could possibly imagine.', 'Set Contains:', 'The 30-minute documentary \"What\\'s a Jellicle Cat? The Making of', 'Cats', 'the Video\" provides a backstage look at the video version of the longest-running show in Broadway history. After a brief discussion of the original show\\'s start in 1981, the bulk of the time is spent on the creation of the video and the advantages it had over a stage production--a larger orchestra, clearer lyrics, and close-ups for better story-telling. There\\'s plenty of rehearsal footage, plus comments by Lloyd Webber, director-choreographer Gillian Lynne, Elaine Paige (Grizabella), and other cast members. Of course \"Memory\" is discussed, and an excerpt of it played by the orchestra without vocals is positively gorgeous.', '--David Horiuchi']\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Genre': \"Cats: The Musical, Musicals & Performing Arts, Cats, DVD Movie, Blu-ray Movie, Broadway, Andrew Lloyd Webber's Cats, Musical, Cats 1999, Universal Blu-rayCats: The Musical, Musicals & Performing Arts, Cats, DVD Movie, Blu-ray Movie, Broadway, Andrew Lloyd Webber's Cats, Musical, Cats 1999, Universal Blu-ray  See more\", 'Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Special Edition, Widescreen, Letterboxed', 'Contributor': 'Ken Page, David Mallet, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Elaine Paige, John Mills', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1)', 'Runtime': '2 hours and 1 minute', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.78:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5.5 x 0.75 inches; 2.08 Ounces', 'Item model number': '1021116', 'Director': 'David Mallet', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, Color, Dolby, NTSC, Special Edition, Widescreen, Letterboxed', 'Run time': '2 hours and 1 minute', 'Release date': 'July 5, 2005', 'Actors': 'Elaine Paige, John Mills, Ken Page', 'Subtitles': 'English', 'Producers': 'Andrew Lloyd Webber', 'Studio': 'Universal Pictures Home Entertainment', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: I love the costumes and the songs.\nReview Title: Here Kitty\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (DVD)\nReview Date: 2019/01/15\nStore: Eddie Redmayne  (Actor),     Katherine Waterston  (Actor),     David Yates  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD\nCategories: Movies & TV, Genre for Featured Categories, Action & Adventure\nProduct Description: ['Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (DVD)', '\u201cFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\u201d opens in 1926 as Newt Scamander has just completed a global excursion to find and document an extraordinary array of magical creatures.

I was delighted to see it on dvd.  It came in very excellent delivery time.  I was disappointed when I opened the box (the dvd protective box that comes with it) to find the disk rattling around inside the box instead of being secured on the spindle.  As a result, the disk has many marks on the surface of the dvd.  I haven't played it completely through yet but played the first few minutes and spot checked it and even with the marks it seems to be playing correctly.  I had to change boxes for it, because the disk does not seem to fit on the spindle in the box that it was made for.  The dvd hole is too small for the spindle and I didn't want to push it in case it broke the dvd.

I was delighted to see it on dvd.  It came in very excellent delivery time.  I was disappointed when I opened the box (the dvd protective box that comes with it) to find the disk rattling around inside the box instead of being secured on the spindle.  As a result, the disk has many marks on the surface of the dvd.  I haven't played it completely through yet but played the first few minutes and spot checked it and even with the marks it seems to be playing correctly.  I had to change boxes for it, because the disk does not seem to fit on the spindle in the box that it was made for.  The dvd hole is too small for the spindle and I didn't want to push it in case it broke the dvd.
