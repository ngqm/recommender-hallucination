This special 34-disc DVD collection contains every hilarious episode of every classic season of I Love Lucy - from the Lost Pilot to the The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour shows.

If you are not completely satisfied, we'll refund or replace your purchase.\", 'Amazon.com', 'Season Two', 'Season 2 of', 'I Love Lucy', 'includes two of the most famous half-hours in television history. \"Job Switching,\" originally broadcast mid-September of 1952, is the crazy, battle-of-the-sexes episode in which husbands Ricky Ricardo (Desi Arnaz) and Fred Mertz (William Frawley) trade roles with wives Lucy (Lucille Ball) and Ethel (Vivian Vance), culminating in the men making a shambles of domestic chores while Lucy and Ethel take disastrous work at a chocolate factory. That\\'s right: This is the show where the ladies have a Chaplinesque experience with a too-fast factory conveyor belt, forcing them to hide candies in their mouths, in their hats, and down their blouses lest a tough forewoman fire them for incompetence. A half-century later, the scene is still so fresh and funny it would grace any current sitcom. \"Lucy Goes to the Hospital,\" which received an amazing 71.7 rating on January 19, 1953, is the historic episode featuring the birth of Little Ricky and a load of wonderful slapstick. Other television series (', 'The Dick Van Dyke Show', ') and movies (', 'Nine Months', ') have tried to top', 'Lucy', \"'s time-to-go-to-the-hospital shenanigans, but there's nothing like the sight of Ricky and Fred falling all over themselves or Ricky showing up at the maternity ward (direct from a voodoo-themed show at the Tropicana) in witch doctor makeup.\", 'The other 31 episodes included in', 'I Love Lucy: The Compete Second Season', 'have choice moments, too. \"Lucy Becomes a Sculptress\" finds the ever-ambitious redhead falling for empty flattery at an art-supply store and commencing an ill-advised career working in clay. Ricky agrees to bless this new endeavor if an art critic says she has talent, but Lucy tries to increase her chances by posing as a bust of herself--resulting in mayhem, of course. The usual running themes in', 'I Love Lucy', \"--Lucy's misguided desire to be a part of Ricky's musical career, and her penchant for disguising herself to investigate something--are all over\", 'The Complete Second Season', '. \"Ricky Loses His Voice\" is a delightful piece in which Ricky\\'s laryngitis inspires Lucy, the Mertzes, and an aging chorus line to put on a Tropicana spectacle, and \"Ricky Has Labor Pains\" finds Lucy and Ethel going undercover as male reporters to find out what happens at a stag party. Lots to enjoy here, and the special features include bloopers, information about the guest cast, and snippets from Ball\\'s radio show.', '--Tom Keogh', 'Season Five', 'I Love Lucy: The Complete Fifth Season', 'finds Lucy Ricardo (Lucille Ball) making an international mess out of husband Ricky\\'s globe-trotting tour as an entertainer. Beginning with \"Lucy Visits Grauman\\'s\" and \"Lucy and John Wayne,\" the impulsive redhead risks Ricky\\'s sanity in Hollywood by stealing a cement slab, from the famous entrance to Grauman\\'s Chinese Theater, that contains the imprint of John Wayne\\'s footprints and signature. In the tradition of superstars playing themselves on', 'I Love Lucy', \", an exasperated (and very funny) Wayne gets into the act over and over and over again, making new imprints on multiple slabs because Lucy keeps messing up the results. After more shenanigans in Los Angeles (Lucy attends a ritzy party with a dummy substituting for her unavailable husband) and a disastrous train ride home, it's time to jeopardize Ricky's success during an interview show that ends disastrously.\", 'Lucy', \"'s fifth season travel theme continues when Ricky and his band are booked on a European tour that does not include his wife or the Mertzes. Of course, that doesn't stop the determined Lucy (or Ethel), who schemes her way into Ricky's plans, only to have a number of snafus arise as she tries to leave the country. In the\", 'I Love Lucy', 'tradition, entire episodes are written around such simple matters as trying to get a passport, or helping with Fred\\'s fear of getting seasick while traveling. All this show\\'s stars really need is a ridiculous, open-ended situation to exploit, and the comedy flows from there. \"Bon Voyage\" is a particularly funny episode in which Lucy gets left behind by the European-bound ship carrying Ricky and the others, and she has to find a way to get back aboard. The hilarious \"Lucy and the Queen\" finds her angling in London for a way to meet the Royal Family after Ricky is invited to say hello at the Palladium. From there, Lucy creates chaos in Scotland (this episode includes a memorable dream sequence in which Ricky appears as Scotty MacTavish MacDougal MacCardo), Paris (where she and Ethel plot to meet guest star and good sport Charles Boyer at an outdoor caf\u00e9), Rome (the outstanding \"Lucy\\'s Italian Movie\" finds her dispatched to a vineyard, where she has to crush grapes--brilliantly--with her feet). Lots of special features, including a behind-the-scenes peek and bloopers.', '--Tom Keogh', 'Season Six', 'The sixth and final season of', 'I Love Lucy', 'finds new laughs in some old formulas while also expanding the hugely popular show\u2019s horizons with a change of scene. Things get off to a familiar start when Lucy Ricardo (Lucille Ball) gets in the middle of husband Ricky\u2019s business--in this case, disguising herself as a hot dog salesman at Yankee Stadium in order to get near Bob Hope. Hope, she believes, has ignored Ricky\u2019s offer to be the first act at his new nightclub. But, in fact, Hope had already agreed; Ricky was just sitting on the information to keep Lucy from getting typically ditzy in front of one of his celebrity pals. Not surprisingly, mayhem follows when poor Hope finds his hand slathered with condiments and his noggin bonked by a foul ball. Other celebrity sightings include Orson Welles, who copes with Lucy\u2019s aspirations as a Shakespearean actress, and George Reeves, television\u2019s Superman, who shows up unexpectedly, in costume, at Little Ricky\u2019s birthday party. Meanwhile, Lucy--who didn\u2019t want to disappoint the tyke--stands in a makeshift Man of Steel outfit on a window ledge, in the rain.', 'A number of episodes concern Little Ricky (Keith Thibodeaux) now that he\u2019s old enough to be a functioning character on the show. In \"Little Ricky Learns to Play the Drums,\" the lad takes after his musician father and starts playing percussion, leading to some frayed nerves. A couple of episodes later, young Ricardo gets a bad case of stage fright at school, and Lucy suggests Ricky let him play the drums at the nightclub. (But then, of course, she has to figure out how to talk her son into performing.) A big change comes to', 'I Love Lucy', 'in the season\u2019s second half, when the Ricardos decide it\u2019s time to become homeowners and pull up stakes at their old Manhattan apartment. Moving to a nice, new house in Connecticut, they\u2019re soon joined by Fred (William Frawley) and Ethel (Vivian Vance), and the season\u2019s storylines take on a distinctly suburban flavor, with country clubs, barbecues, and gardens figuring into the comedy. With those developments,', 'I Love Lucy', 'came to a close after making television history as a much-beloved sitcom. Lots of special features, including multiple audio commentaries, flubs, lost scenes, and five episodes of', 'My Favorite Husband', ', Ball\u2019s radio show.', '--Tom Keogh', 'Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show', 'From Lucy-tormented Hollywood A-listers and bongo-propelled production numbers to archival goodies such as long-lost footage, there is much to love in this collection of all 13 episodes from', 'The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show', '(also known as', 'The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour', '). Following', \"I Love Lucy's\", 'sixth and final season, these monthly (give or take) specials reunited America with Ricky and Lucy (and Keith Thibodeaux\\'s adorable Little Ricky, still living the country life in Connecticut. The expanded, hour-long format allowed for celebrity guest stars and excursions to far-flung locales, such as Japan and Mexico. Not matter where they go, Lucy can always be counted on to act, in Desi\\'s words, \"a little crazy in the head,\" which is how she winds up masquerading as Ernie Kovacs\\' chauffeur in \"Lucy Meets the Moustache\" (an episode making its home-video debut), dangling Milton Berle from a construction crane in \"Milton Berle Hides Out at the Ricardos,\" or sparking a uranium uproar in Las Vegas in \"Lucy Hunts Uranium.\"', 'A highlight of this set is the first-ever home video release of the uncut version of \"Lucy Takes a Cruise to Havana,\" a flashback episode in which Lucy meets Ricky on a \"maiden voyage\" to Cuba. She also meets future best friend Ethel (Vivian Vance) and her new husband Fred (a toupeed William Frawley), and goes overboard for her first celebrity sighting, Rudy Vallee. Because these episodes do not play as often in syndication, they seem fresher than their endlessly re-run counterparts. They are full of delights for movie, TV, and', 'Lucy', 'buffs, among them, Fred MacMurray getting \"Uranium\" fever, Maurice Chevalier singing \"Yankee Doodle Boy\" in the \"Mexico\" episode, prolific character actor Sid Melton as a bellboy in the \"Alaska\" episode, and a va-voom Vance decked out as maid and a dance hall girl, respectively, in the \"The Celebrity Next Door\" and \"Milton Berle\" episodes. Among this set\\'s prodigious bonus features include 1951 color footage that an audience member surreptitiously filmed, rediscovered scenes that were cut from the original broadcasts, and a filmed presentation to Westinghouse, which sponsored the series. If you don\\'t add this to your library, you have some \\'splainin\\' to do.', '--Donald Liebenson']\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Comedy/Television', 'Format': 'Dolby, Box set, Full Screen, NTSC, Black & White', 'Contributor': 'Vivian Vance, Desi Arnaz, William Frawley, I Love Lucy, Lucille Ball', 'Language': 'Unqualified', 'Number Of Discs': '34', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.33:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '11.1 x 8.4 x 2.4 inches; 2.85 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'PARD123434D', 'Media Format': 'Dolby, Box set, Full Screen, NTSC, Black & White', 'Run time': '89 hours and 54 minutes', 'Release date': 'October 23, 2007', 'Actors': 'I Love Lucy, Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz, William Frawley, Vivian Vance', 'Studio': 'Paramount', 'Number of discs': '34'}\nReview Text: Great.

Don Adams stars as Maxwell Smart--a.k.a. Agent 86--a hilariously inept and maladroit operative working for CONTROL, a top secret counterintelligence agency. Armed with an array of catchphrases (\"Would you believe...?,\" \"I asked you not to tell me that,\" \"And loving it!,\" \"Missed it by that much!\u201d), along with his trusty shoe-phone and other ridiculous gadgets, Smart was able to foil the nefarious, though equally incompetent, espionage organization KAOS, aided immeasurably by his much smarter partner, sultry Agent 99, deliciously played by Barbara Feldon. Edward Platt co-stars as \\'Chief,\\' the head of CONTROL, and the series features notable guest appearances from Carol Burnett, Johnny Carson, Don Rickles and many others.', ']]>', 'Review', 'The feature film may have missed it by that much, but', 'Get Smart', ', the TV series, still hits the target with deadly funny accuracy. The right show at the right time,', 'Get Smart', 'brilliantly spoofed the spy genre that was all the rage in 1965, with James Bond on the big screen, and such series as', 'Danger Man, The Avengers, The Saint, The Man from U.N.C.L.E.', ', and', 'I Spy', 'more or less playing it straight on the small screen.', 'Get Smart', \", on the other hand, had a license to kill\u2026with laughter. Mel Brooks and Buck Henry created one of TV's all-time greatest characters, Maxwell Smart, Agent 86 of CONTROL, the super-secret agency vigilantly on alert against the forces of KAOS. Smart (Don Adams in his iconic, Emmy-winning role), an American Clouseau, was not stupid. Though all evidence to the contrary, he was, in his own mind, a suave and sophisticated spy, albeit one who would inadvertently lean against a freshly painted wall while shadowing an enemy agent.\", 'Get Smart', 'hilariously deglamorized the business of espionage. Agents punch a time clock and dispute vacation time. Cool spy gadgets, such as the infamous Cone of Silence, are prone to malfunction. One running joke throughout the first season finds Agent 44 (Victor French) perched in a variety of unlikely and uncomfortable hiding places, among them a grandfather clock. Although the series would only get smarter and funnier in subsequent seasons (Bernie Kopell\\'s KAOS mastermind Siegfried would be introduced in season two), the first season contains several essential episodes, including the Emmy-winning two-parter, \"Ship of Spies,\" \"Aboard the Orient Express,\" featuring a cameo by Johnny Carson as an unflappable conductor, \"Diplomat\\'s Daughter\" with the arch --and decidedly non-PC-- villain, the Craw, and \"Back to the Drawing Board,\" featuring Dick Gautier as Hymie the robot. From \"Sorry about that\" to \"Would you believe,\" no show before Get Smart introduced so many catchphrases into the national language, while Smart and his partner, Agent 99 (the ravishing Barbara Feldon), were perhaps TV\\'s first \"will they or won\\'t they\" couple. Brooks and Henry contribute separate commentaries for the black and white pilot episode, while Feldon provides commentary for another, and purrs introductions to each episode (beware plot spoilers). With', 'Get Smart,', \"you will be witness to some of TV's funniest moments, sharpest writing, and expertly-executed physical comedy.

It proved to be a perfect match between the new television network and the young rising icon. Early on, Michael saw MTV\u2019s potential as a force of its own and understood that it offered him the chance to pioneer a whole new visual style through which people could see music, not just listen to it. For the first time, artists had the opportunity to truly shape a vision of a story around their songs. For Michael, this meant treating the song as a \u201cscript\u201d and creating a stand-alone film to tell that story. In fact, Michael referred to each of these productions as a \"short film\" and not a \u201cmusic video.\u201d  No other artist contributed more to the development of this art form than Michael Jackson. Just look at the impact of', 'Thriller', ', which was recently named the first (and only) music video ever to be inducted by the Library of Congress into the National Film Registry - an elite collection of only a few hundred films. In addition to this, Michael\u2019s vision had immense cultural impact . The enormous popularity of his short films proved to MTV Executives that they were wrong about what their audience wanted; it was Michael who broke through that initial barrier and created opportunity for future African American artists.  Here, for the first time, is the complete collection of all 35 of the short films produced by Michael during his career as a solo artist - 10 of which are appearing on DVD for the first time. All of the short films have been meticulously restored and remastered for the ultimate audio and visual experience and a bonus DVD includes 7 additional videos including \u201cEnjoy Yourself\u201d with The Jacksons, \u201cSay Say Say\u201d with Paul McCartney and the Previously Unreleased video for \u201cOne More Chance\u201d.

In\", 'Eclipse', ', the vampiric Cullen clan and the werewolves--their sworn enemies--unite against an army of \"newborn\" vampires, whose remnants of human blood in their veins makes them stronger and more uncontrollable, causing a string of murders in the Seattle area. They\\'ve been created by the vengeful vampire Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard, taking over for Rachelle Lefevre), still keen on destroying human Bella (Kristen Stewart). Thus, Bella is under careful watch, and her undead love Edward (Robert Pattinson) and werewolf best friend Jacob (Taylor Lautner) spend a lot of time arguing over who is the better man for her. (In one hilarious scene where Bella\\'s freezing and only Jacob has the lupine body heat to warm her, he looks over at Edward and cracks, \"I', 'am', 'hotter than you.\" Go Team Jacob!) But there\\'s more at the heart of the triangle than love: Bella, against Edward\\'s warnings, doesn\\'t want to grow older than him and would willingly give up contact with her parents, the chance to grow old with children, and more to be turned into a bloodthirsty vampire. (Jacob\\'s trump card is that Bella wouldn\\'t have to give up her mortality to be with him.) But the unfolding of this love triangle is even clumsier than it was on the page; you\\'re never really convinced Bella has romantic feelings for Jacob, even during their climactic kiss on top of the mountain. This is likely to confuse non-readers of the book series, as Stewart emotes nothing that intones there\\'s a real competition here (clearly, she\\'s Team Edward).', \"Pattinson, on the other hand, appears to have overcome his awkwardness to become a much cooler Edward; Howard, while missing Lefevre's mischief as Victoria, brings her own touch of soft-spoken manipulation; and Billy Burke, as Bella's father Charlie, continues to steal every scene he's in. The other Cullens also get far more play here, notably Rosalie (Nikki Reed), whose revealing back story is touching and tragic, and Jasper (Jackson Rathbone), who trains everyone in combat and who, halfway through the movie, adopts a sudden Southern accent that he didn't have before, once it's revealed he was a Confederate soldier (on a side note, it's mentioned in the books that Jasper can calm the emotions of others, but that trait isn't used in the movie). The climactic fight scene is well staged by director David Slade (\", '30 Days of Night', ',', 'Hard Candy', \"); the violence, while not bloody, is still more abundant and disturbing than in the previous films; and the sex, while not actually happening between anyone (yet), is certainly on everyone's mind (but Edward wants to get married first). It seems the characters, and the series, are growing up. --\", 'Ellen A.

If you are not completely satisfied, we'll refund or replace your purchase.\", 'Amazon.com', 'Season Two', 'Season 2 of', 'I Love Lucy', 'includes two of the most famous half-hours in television history. \"Job Switching,\" originally broadcast mid-September of 1952, is the crazy, battle-of-the-sexes episode in which husbands Ricky Ricardo (Desi Arnaz) and Fred Mertz (William Frawley) trade roles with wives Lucy (Lucille Ball) and Ethel (Vivian Vance), culminating in the men making a shambles of domestic chores while Lucy and Ethel take disastrous work at a chocolate factory. That\\'s right: This is the show where the ladies have a Chaplinesque experience with a too-fast factory conveyor belt, forcing them to hide candies in their mouths, in their hats, and down their blouses lest a tough forewoman fire them for incompetence. A half-century later, the scene is still so fresh and funny it would grace any current sitcom. \"Lucy Goes to the Hospital,\" which received an amazing 71.7 rating on January 19, 1953, is the historic episode featuring the birth of Little Ricky and a load of wonderful slapstick. Other television series (', 'The Dick Van Dyke Show', ') and movies (', 'Nine Months', ') have tried to top', 'Lucy', \"'s time-to-go-to-the-hospital shenanigans, but there's nothing like the sight of Ricky and Fred falling all over themselves or Ricky showing up at the maternity ward (direct from a voodoo-themed show at the Tropicana) in witch doctor makeup.\", 'The other 31 episodes included in', 'I Love Lucy: The Compete Second Season', 'have choice moments, too. \"Lucy Becomes a Sculptress\" finds the ever-ambitious redhead falling for empty flattery at an art-supply store and commencing an ill-advised career working in clay. Ricky agrees to bless this new endeavor if an art critic says she has talent, but Lucy tries to increase her chances by posing as a bust of herself--resulting in mayhem, of course. The usual running themes in', 'I Love Lucy', \"--Lucy's misguided desire to be a part of Ricky's musical career, and her penchant for disguising herself to investigate something--are all over\", 'The Complete Second Season', '. \"Ricky Loses His Voice\" is a delightful piece in which Ricky\\'s laryngitis inspires Lucy, the Mertzes, and an aging chorus line to put on a Tropicana spectacle, and \"Ricky Has Labor Pains\" finds Lucy and Ethel going undercover as male reporters to find out what happens at a stag party. Lots to enjoy here, and the special features include bloopers, information about the guest cast, and snippets from Ball\\'s radio show.', '--Tom Keogh', 'Season Five', 'I Love Lucy: The Complete Fifth Season', 'finds Lucy Ricardo (Lucille Ball) making an international mess out of husband Ricky\\'s globe-trotting tour as an entertainer. Beginning with \"Lucy Visits Grauman\\'s\" and \"Lucy and John Wayne,\" the impulsive redhead risks Ricky\\'s sanity in Hollywood by stealing a cement slab, from the famous entrance to Grauman\\'s Chinese Theater, that contains the imprint of John Wayne\\'s footprints and signature. In the tradition of superstars playing themselves on', 'I Love Lucy', \", an exasperated (and very funny) Wayne gets into the act over and over and over again, making new imprints on multiple slabs because Lucy keeps messing up the results. After more shenanigans in Los Angeles (Lucy attends a ritzy party with a dummy substituting for her unavailable husband) and a disastrous train ride home, it's time to jeopardize Ricky's success during an interview show that ends disastrously.\", 'Lucy', \"'s fifth season travel theme continues when Ricky and his band are booked on a European tour that does not include his wife or the Mertzes. Of course, that doesn't stop the determined Lucy (or Ethel), who schemes her way into Ricky's plans, only to have a number of snafus arise as she tries to leave the country. In the\", 'I Love Lucy', 'tradition, entire episodes are written around such simple matters as trying to get a passport, or helping with Fred\\'s fear of getting seasick while traveling. All this show\\'s stars really need is a ridiculous, open-ended situation to exploit, and the comedy flows from there. \"Bon Voyage\" is a particularly funny episode in which Lucy gets left behind by the European-bound ship carrying Ricky and the others, and she has to find a way to get back aboard. The hilarious \"Lucy and the Queen\" finds her angling in London for a way to meet the Royal Family after Ricky is invited to say hello at the Palladium. From there, Lucy creates chaos in Scotland (this episode includes a memorable dream sequence in which Ricky appears as Scotty MacTavish MacDougal MacCardo), Paris (where she and Ethel plot to meet guest star and good sport Charles Boyer at an outdoor caf\u00e9), Rome (the outstanding \"Lucy\\'s Italian Movie\" finds her dispatched to a vineyard, where she has to crush grapes--brilliantly--with her feet). Lots of special features, including a behind-the-scenes peek and bloopers.', '--Tom Keogh', 'Season Six', 'The sixth and final season of', 'I Love Lucy', 'finds new laughs in some old formulas while also expanding the hugely popular show\u2019s horizons with a change of scene. Things get off to a familiar start when Lucy Ricardo (Lucille Ball) gets in the middle of husband Ricky\u2019s business--in this case, disguising herself as a hot dog salesman at Yankee Stadium in order to get near Bob Hope. Hope, she believes, has ignored Ricky\u2019s offer to be the first act at his new nightclub. But, in fact, Hope had already agreed; Ricky was just sitting on the information to keep Lucy from getting typically ditzy in front of one of his celebrity pals. Not surprisingly, mayhem follows when poor Hope finds his hand slathered with condiments and his noggin bonked by a foul ball. Other celebrity sightings include Orson Welles, who copes with Lucy\u2019s aspirations as a Shakespearean actress, and George Reeves, television\u2019s Superman, who shows up unexpectedly, in costume, at Little Ricky\u2019s birthday party. Meanwhile, Lucy--who didn\u2019t want to disappoint the tyke--stands in a makeshift Man of Steel outfit on a window ledge, in the rain.', 'A number of episodes concern Little Ricky (Keith Thibodeaux) now that he\u2019s old enough to be a functioning character on the show. In \"Little Ricky Learns to Play the Drums,\" the lad takes after his musician father and starts playing percussion, leading to some frayed nerves. A couple of episodes later, young Ricardo gets a bad case of stage fright at school, and Lucy suggests Ricky let him play the drums at the nightclub. (But then, of course, she has to figure out how to talk her son into performing.) A big change comes to', 'I Love Lucy', 'in the season\u2019s second half, when the Ricardos decide it\u2019s time to become homeowners and pull up stakes at their old Manhattan apartment. Moving to a nice, new house in Connecticut, they\u2019re soon joined by Fred (William Frawley) and Ethel (Vivian Vance), and the season\u2019s storylines take on a distinctly suburban flavor, with country clubs, barbecues, and gardens figuring into the comedy. With those developments,', 'I Love Lucy', 'came to a close after making television history as a much-beloved sitcom. Lots of special features, including multiple audio commentaries, flubs, lost scenes, and five episodes of', 'My Favorite Husband', ', Ball\u2019s radio show.', '--Tom Keogh', 'Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show', 'From Lucy-tormented Hollywood A-listers and bongo-propelled production numbers to archival goodies such as long-lost footage, there is much to love in this collection of all 13 episodes from', 'The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show', '(also known as', 'The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour', '). Following', \"I Love Lucy's\", 'sixth and final season, these monthly (give or take) specials reunited America with Ricky and Lucy (and Keith Thibodeaux\\'s adorable Little Ricky, still living the country life in Connecticut. The expanded, hour-long format allowed for celebrity guest stars and excursions to far-flung locales, such as Japan and Mexico. Not matter where they go, Lucy can always be counted on to act, in Desi\\'s words, \"a little crazy in the head,\" which is how she winds up masquerading as Ernie Kovacs\\' chauffeur in \"Lucy Meets the Moustache\" (an episode making its home-video debut), dangling Milton Berle from a construction crane in \"Milton Berle Hides Out at the Ricardos,\" or sparking a uranium uproar in Las Vegas in \"Lucy Hunts Uranium.\"', 'A highlight of this set is the first-ever home video release of the uncut version of \"Lucy Takes a Cruise to Havana,\" a flashback episode in which Lucy meets Ricky on a \"maiden voyage\" to Cuba. She also meets future best friend Ethel (Vivian Vance) and her new husband Fred (a toupeed William Frawley), and goes overboard for her first celebrity sighting, Rudy Vallee. Because these episodes do not play as often in syndication, they seem fresher than their endlessly re-run counterparts. They are full of delights for movie, TV, and', 'Lucy', 'buffs, among them, Fred MacMurray getting \"Uranium\" fever, Maurice Chevalier singing \"Yankee Doodle Boy\" in the \"Mexico\" episode, prolific character actor Sid Melton as a bellboy in the \"Alaska\" episode, and a va-voom Vance decked out as maid and a dance hall girl, respectively, in the \"The Celebrity Next Door\" and \"Milton Berle\" episodes. Among this set\\'s prodigious bonus features include 1951 color footage that an audience member surreptitiously filmed, rediscovered scenes that were cut from the original broadcasts, and a filmed presentation to Westinghouse, which sponsored the series.

Don Adams stars as Maxwell Smart--a.k.a. Agent 86--a hilariously inept and maladroit operative working for CONTROL, a top secret counterintelligence agency. Armed with an array of catchphrases (\"Would you believe...?,\" \"I asked you not to tell me that,\" \"And loving it!,\" \"Missed it by that much!\u201d), along with his trusty shoe-phone and other ridiculous gadgets, Smart was able to foil the nefarious, though equally incompetent, espionage organization KAOS, aided immeasurably by his much smarter partner, sultry Agent 99, deliciously played by Barbara Feldon. Edward Platt co-stars as \\'Chief,\\' the head of CONTROL, and the series features notable guest appearances from Carol Burnett, Johnny Carson, Don Rickles and many others.', ']]>', 'Review', 'The feature film may have missed it by that much, but', 'Get Smart', ', the TV series, still hits the target with deadly funny accuracy. The right show at the right time,', 'Get Smart', 'brilliantly spoofed the spy genre that was all the rage in 1965, with James Bond on the big screen, and such series as', 'Danger Man, The Avengers, The Saint, The Man from U.N.C.L.E.', ', and', 'I Spy', 'more or less playing it straight on the small screen.', 'Get Smart', \", on the other hand, had a license to kill\u2026with laughter. Mel Brooks and Buck Henry created one of TV's all-time greatest characters, Maxwell Smart, Agent 86 of CONTROL, the super-secret agency vigilantly on alert against the forces of KAOS. Smart (Don Adams in his iconic, Emmy-winning role), an American Clouseau, was not stupid. Though all evidence to the contrary, he was, in his own mind, a suave and sophisticated spy, albeit one who would inadvertently lean against a freshly painted wall while shadowing an enemy agent.\", 'Get Smart', 'hilariously deglamorized the business of espionage. Agents punch a time clock and dispute vacation time. Cool spy gadgets, such as the infamous Cone of Silence, are prone to malfunction. One running joke throughout the first season finds Agent 44 (Victor French) perched in a variety of unlikely and uncomfortable hiding places, among them a grandfather clock. Although the series would only get smarter and funnier in subsequent seasons (Bernie Kopell\\'s KAOS mastermind Siegfried would be introduced in season two), the first season contains several essential episodes, including the Emmy-winning two-parter, \"Ship of Spies,\" \"Aboard the Orient Express,\" featuring a cameo by Johnny Carson as an unflappable conductor, \"Diplomat\\'s Daughter\" with the arch --and decidedly non-PC-- villain, the Craw, and \"Back to the Drawing Board,\" featuring Dick Gautier as Hymie the robot. From \"Sorry about that\" to \"Would you believe,\" no show before Get Smart introduced so many catchphrases into the national language, while Smart and his partner, Agent 99 (the ravishing Barbara Feldon), were perhaps TV\\'s first \"will they or won\\'t they\" couple. Brooks and Henry contribute separate commentaries for the black and white pilot episode, while Feldon provides commentary for another, and purrs introductions to each episode (beware plot spoilers). With', 'Get Smart,', \"you will be witness to some of TV's funniest moments, sharpest writing, and expertly-executed physical comedy.

It proved to be a perfect match between the new television network and the young rising icon. Early on, Michael saw MTV\u2019s potential as a force of its own and understood that it offered him the chance to pioneer a whole new visual style through which people could see music, not just listen to it. For the first time, artists had the opportunity to truly shape a vision of a story around their songs. For Michael, this meant treating the song as a \u201cscript\u201d and creating a stand-alone film to tell that story. In fact, Michael referred to each of these productions as a \"short film\" and not a \u201cmusic video.\u201d  No other artist contributed more to the development of this art form than Michael Jackson. Just look at the impact of', 'Thriller', ', which was recently named the first (and only) music video ever to be inducted by the Library of Congress into the National Film Registry - an elite collection of only a few hundred films. In addition to this, Michael\u2019s vision had immense cultural impact . The enormous popularity of his short films proved to MTV Executives that they were wrong about what their audience wanted; it was Michael who broke through that initial barrier and created opportunity for future African American artists.  Here, for the first time, is the complete collection of all 35 of the short films produced by Michael during his career as a solo artist - 10 of which are appearing on DVD for the first time.

In the third chapter of Stephenie Meyer\u2019s phenomenal Twilight series, Bella Swan is surrounded by danger as Seattle is hit by a string of murders and an evil vampire continues her quest for revenge. In the midst of it all, Bella is forced to choose between her love, Edward Cullen, and her friend, Jacob Black\u2014knowing that her decision may ignite the ageless struggle between vampire and werewolf.', 'Amazon.com', \"The third installment of Stephenie Meyer's blockbuster vampire series is its most action packed, both in terms of fight scenes and human-vampire-werewolf lovin'. In\", 'Eclipse', ', the vampiric Cullen clan and the werewolves--their sworn enemies--unite against an army of \"newborn\" vampires, whose remnants of human blood in their veins makes them stronger and more uncontrollable, causing a string of murders in the Seattle area. They\\'ve been created by the vengeful vampire Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard, taking over for Rachelle Lefevre), still keen on destroying human Bella (Kristen Stewart). Thus, Bella is under careful watch, and her undead love Edward (Robert Pattinson) and werewolf best friend Jacob (Taylor Lautner) spend a lot of time arguing over who is the better man for her. (In one hilarious scene where Bella\\'s freezing and only Jacob has the lupine body heat to warm her, he looks over at Edward and cracks, \"I', 'am', 'hotter than you.\" Go Team Jacob!) But there\\'s more at the heart of the triangle than love: Bella, against Edward\\'s warnings, doesn\\'t want to grow older than him and would willingly give up contact with her parents, the chance to grow old with children, and more to be turned into a bloodthirsty vampire. (Jacob\\'s trump card is that Bella wouldn\\'t have to give up her mortality to be with him.) But the unfolding of this love triangle is even clumsier than it was on the page; you\\'re never really convinced Bella has romantic feelings for Jacob, even during their climactic kiss on top of the mountain. This is likely to confuse non-readers of the book series, as Stewart emotes nothing that intones there\\'s a real competition here (clearly, she\\'s Team Edward).', \"Pattinson, on the other hand, appears to have overcome his awkwardness to become a much cooler Edward; Howard, while missing Lefevre's mischief as Victoria, brings her own touch of soft-spoken manipulation; and Billy Burke, as Bella's father Charlie, continues to steal every scene he's in. The other Cullens also get far more play here, notably Rosalie (Nikki Reed), whose revealing back story is touching and tragic, and Jasper (Jackson Rathbone), who trains everyone in combat and who, halfway through the movie, adopts a sudden Southern accent that he didn't have before, once it's revealed he was a Confederate soldier (on a side note, it's mentioned in the books that Jasper can calm the emotions of others, but that trait isn't used in the movie). The climactic fight scene is well staged by director David Slade (\", '30 Days of Night', ',', 'Hard Candy', \"); the violence, while not bloody, is still more abundant and disturbing than in the previous films; and the sex, while not actually happening between anyone (yet), is certainly on everyone's mind (but Edward wants to get married first).

That\\'s right: This is the show where the ladies have a Chaplinesque experience with a too-fast factory conveyor belt, forcing them to hide candies in their mouths, in their hats, and down their blouses lest a tough forewoman fire them for incompetence. A half-century later, the scene is still so fresh and funny it would grace any current sitcom. \"Lucy Goes to the Hospital,\" which received an amazing 71.7 rating on January 19, 1953, is the historic episode featuring the birth of Little Ricky and a load of wonderful slapstick.

The hilarious \"Lucy and the Queen\" finds her angling in London for a way to meet the Royal Family after Ricky is invited to say hello at the Palladium.

Don Adams stars as Maxwell Smart--a.k.a. Agent 86--a hilariously inept and maladroit operative working for CONTROL, a top secret counterintelligence agency. Armed with an array of catchphrases (\"Would you believe...?,\" \"I asked you not to tell me that,\" \"And loving it!,\" \"Missed it by that much!\u201d), along with his trusty shoe-phone and other ridiculous gadgets, Smart was able to foil the nefarious, though equally incompetent, espionage organization KAOS, aided immeasurably by his much smarter partner, sultry Agent 99, deliciously played by Barbara Feldon.

Mel Brooks and Buck Henry created one of TV's all-time greatest characters, Maxwell Smart, Agent 86 of CONTROL, the super-secret agency vigilantly on alert against the forces of KAOS. Smart (Don Adams in his iconic, Emmy-winning role), an American Clouseau, was not stupid. Though all evidence to the contrary, he was, in his own mind, a suave and sophisticated spy, albeit one who would inadvertently lean against a freshly painted wall while shadowing an enemy agent.\", 'Get Smart', 'hilariously deglamorized the business of espionage. Agents punch a time clock and dispute vacation time. Cool spy gadgets, such as the infamous Cone of Silence, are prone to malfunction. One running joke throughout the first season finds Agent 44 (Victor French) perched in a variety of unlikely and uncomfortable hiding places, among them a grandfather clock. Although the series would only get smarter and funnier in subsequent seasons (Bernie Kopell\\'s KAOS mastermind Siegfried would be introduced in season two), the first season contains several essential episodes, including the Emmy-winning two-parter, \"Ship of Spies,\" \"Aboard the Orient Express,\" featuring a cameo by Johnny Carson as an unflappable conductor, \"Diplomat\\'s Daughter\" with the arch --and decidedly non-PC-- villain, the Craw, and \"Back to the Drawing Board,\" featuring Dick Gautier as Hymie the robot. From \"Sorry about that\" to \"Would you believe,\" no show before Get Smart introduced so many catchphrases into the national language, while Smart and his partner, Agent 99 (the ravishing Barbara Feldon), were perhaps TV\\'s first \"will they or won\\'t they\" couple.

It proved to be a perfect match between the new television network and the young rising icon. Early on, Michael saw MTV\u2019s potential as a force of its own and understood that it offered him the chance to pioneer a whole new visual style through which people could see music, not just listen to it. For the first time, artists had the opportunity to truly shape a vision of a story around their songs. For Michael, this meant treating the song as a \u201cscript\u201d and creating a stand-alone film to tell that story. In fact, Michael referred to each of these productions as a \"short film\" and not a \u201cmusic video.\u201d  No other artist contributed more to the development of this art form than Michael Jackson. Just look at the impact of', 'Thriller', ', which was recently named the first (and only) music video ever to be inducted by the Library of Congress into the National Film Registry - an elite collection of only a few hundred films. In addition to this, Michael\u2019s vision had immense cultural impact . The enormous popularity of his short films proved to MTV Executives that they were wrong about what their audience wanted; it was Michael who broke through that initial barrier and created opportunity for future African American artists.  Here, for the first time, is the complete collection of all 35 of the short films produced by Michael during his career as a solo artist - 10 of which are appearing on DVD for the first time. All of the short films have been meticulously restored and remastered for the ultimate audio and visual experience and a bonus DVD includes 7 additional videos including \u201cEnjoy Yourself\u201d with The Jacksons, \u201cSay Say Say\u201d with Paul McCartney and the Previously Unreleased video for \u201cOne More Chance\u201d.

In\", 'Eclipse', ', the vampiric Cullen clan and the werewolves--their sworn enemies--unite against an army of \"newborn\" vampires, whose remnants of human blood in their veins makes them stronger and more uncontrollable, causing a string of murders in the Seattle area. They\\'ve been created by the vengeful vampire Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard, taking over for Rachelle Lefevre), still keen on destroying human Bella (Kristen Stewart). Thus, Bella is under careful watch, and her undead love Edward (Robert Pattinson) and werewolf best friend Jacob (Taylor Lautner) spend a lot of time arguing over who is the better man for her. (In one hilarious scene where Bella\\'s freezing and only Jacob has the lupine body heat to warm her, he looks over at Edward and cracks, \"I', 'am', 'hotter than you.\" Go Team Jacob!) But there\\'s more at the heart of the triangle than love: Bella, against Edward\\'s warnings, doesn\\'t want to grow older than him and would willingly give up contact with her parents, the chance to grow old with children, and more to be turned into a bloodthirsty vampire. (Jacob\\'s trump card is that Bella wouldn\\'t have to give up her mortality to be with him.) But the unfolding of this love triangle is even clumsier than it was on the page; you\\'re never really convinced Bella has romantic feelings for Jacob, even during their climactic kiss on top of the mountain. This is likely to confuse non-readers of the book series, as Stewart emotes nothing that intones there\\'s a real competition here (clearly, she\\'s Team Edward).', \"Pattinson, on the other hand, appears to have overcome his awkwardness to become a much cooler Edward; Howard, while missing Lefevre's mischief as Victoria, brings her own touch of soft-spoken manipulation; and Billy Burke, as Bella's father Charlie, continues to steal every scene he's in. The other Cullens also get far more play here, notably Rosalie (Nikki Reed), whose revealing back story is touching and tragic, and Jasper (Jackson Rathbone), who trains everyone in combat and who, halfway through the movie, adopts a sudden Southern accent that he didn't have before, once it's revealed he was a Confederate soldier (on a side note, it's mentioned in the books that Jasper can calm the emotions of others, but that trait isn't used in the movie). The climactic fight scene is well staged by director David Slade (\", '30 Days of Night', ',', 'Hard Candy', \"); the violence, while not bloody, is still more abundant and disturbing than in the previous films; and the sex, while not actually happening between anyone (yet), is certainly on everyone's mind (but Edward wants to get married first).
