Very easy to follow with instructions that are visually reinforced. Even a guy with two left feet, like me, can learn to be the dance king.

One hint, though: Get this video early - don\\'t wait until the week before your wedding like I did. You need at least a month of practice for all of the steps to become easy.

It's nice to know how Ms. Rowling rose from the bottom to the top. It goes to show you that talent and skill could be hidden anywhere or where you least expect it. It also shows that even if you come from a &#34;good&#34; family that you can still hit rock bottom (well, almost, in her case). I liked how it showed that you can be courageous and also how you need to never give up on your dreams. I know I'm talking about the story/person and not the movie. Regarding the movie itself, I liked the movie a lot. It was an eye-opening to me.
