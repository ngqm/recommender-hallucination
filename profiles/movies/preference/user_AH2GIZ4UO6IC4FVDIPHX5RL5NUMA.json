To regain her crown and return to Equestria, Twilight had to learn how to fit into this strange, new world and defeat Sunset Shimmer in a competition to become crowned Princess of the Fall Formal at Canterlot High. My Little Pony Equestria Girls: Rainbow Rocks, released in 2014, found Canterlot High hosting a musical showcase, and Rainbow Dash, Applejack, Pinkie Pie, Rarity, and Fluttershy performing with their new band, The Rainbooms.

After a reformed Sunset Shimmer realized that The Dazzlings may not be ordinary girls and were after something far more sinister than just being named Best Band at Canterlot High, Princess Twilight was called upon to help win a battle that would determine the fate of the entire school. Now, in the new animated film My Little Pony Equestria Girls: Friendship Games, Canterlot High meets its rival school, Crystal Prep Academy, in a competition that\u2019s a long-standing tradition: The Friendship Games, a series of exciting events that includes archery, motocross, and rollerskating!
