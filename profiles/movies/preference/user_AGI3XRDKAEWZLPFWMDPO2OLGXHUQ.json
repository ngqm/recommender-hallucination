I was completely immersed in this story from the very beginning.  I both laughed and cried.  I was surprised more than once at the turns the story took.  I highly recommend it.  It is not a movie that would particularly interest my husband who prefers westerns and action movies.  I am a very conservative mother of 2 adult sons and would say that in retrospect I would have required them to be 12 to 14 years old before they watched it.
