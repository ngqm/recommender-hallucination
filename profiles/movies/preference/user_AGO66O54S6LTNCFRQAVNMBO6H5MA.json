Clumsy, overweight Po (Jack Black) dreams of becoming a kung fu master like China\\'s revered \"furious five,\" but instead seems destined to follow in the footsteps of his father and grandfather in the restaurant business. When great leader Oogway has a vision that the imprisoned kung fu warrior Tai Lung (Ian McShane) will soon escape, he declares it time to choose China\\'s dragon warrior--one kung fu master deemed worthy of possessing the dragon\\'s scroll and its secret to limitless power. Po and all the townspeople rush to the Jade Palace atop the highest mountain to witness the contest between Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogan), Crane (David Cross) and Viper (Lucy Liu), but Po is locked outside the palace. After a miracle of sorts, Po lands inside the palace gates, where he is chosen as the dragon warrior and placed under the tutelage of the decidedly non-plussed master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman). An unconventional student to say the least, hilarity reigns as Shifu tries desperately to make Po into some semblance of a kung fu warrior. Can Po possibly fulfill his destiny as dragon warrior, or was Oogway\\'s final decision a critical mistake? A film rich with hilarious moments, superior animation, and an important message about believing in oneself and the power that comes from within,', 'Kung Fu Panda', 'is great entertainment that will have the whole family laughing and begging for more.

Dragon Warrior Po (Jack Black) has matured and mastered many new challenges since learning the art of kung fu and defeating the snow leopard Tai Lung, but he hasn't lost his penchant for steamed buns, nor has he achieved what his teacher Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) describes as true inner peace. Before he can settle into the arduous task of self-discovery, word arrives that a nearby town of musicians has been attacked and their leader Master Thundering Rhino (Victor Garber) killed by a newly invented weapon that breathes fire and spits out metal--a weapon that is a harbinger of the end of kung fu and the domination of all of China by Lord Shen (Gary Oldman). Po and the Furious Five (Angelina Jolie, Seth Rogen, Jackie Chan, David Cross, and Lucy Liu) set out to destroy the mysterious weapon and save kung fu, encountering the imprisoned and very dispirited kung fu legends Master Oxen (Dennis Haysbert) and Master Croc (Jean-Claude Van Damme) along the way, but the group quickly discovers that their task is far from simple. Even as Soothsayer (Michelle Yeoh) adamantly foretells Lord Shen's defeat at the hands of a warrior of black and white, Po struggles with the realization that he must come to terms with his adoption in order to let go of the past and become who he chooses to be. Only then can he achieve the inner peace that will empower him to triumph over his personal insecurities and Lord Shen.\", 'Kung Fu Panda 2', 'offers excellent animation and 3-D effects, nice brisk pacing, great voice talent, life lessons that ring true, and a healthy dose of comedy that includes everything from wisecracks to a dragon that eats unsuspecting villagers and then poops them out, and a radish trained in the art of kung fu.

This 3-Disc Full Disclosure Edition includes Apocalypse Now and Apocalypse Now Redux in stunning new transfers supervised by Francis Ford Coppola - and presented for the first time in their original 2.35:1 theatrical aspect ratios. Also included is the feature-length making-of documentary Hearts of Darkness, presented in a new 1080p HD transfer. Additional features include a 48-page collectible booklet with never-before-seen archives from the set, over 9 hours of bonus features, plus a storyboard gallery, image galleries, marketing archives and an original script excerpt from John Milius featuring hand-written notes from Coppola.\", 'Amazon.com', 'Apocalypse Now / Apocalypse Now: Redux', 'In the tradition of such obsessively driven directors as Erich von Stroheim and Werner Herzog, Francis Ford Coppola approached the production of', 'Apocalypse Now', 'as if it were his own epic mission into the heart of darkness. On location in the storm-ravaged Philippines, he quite literally went mad as the project threatened to devour him in a vortex of creative despair, but from this insanity came one of the greatest films ever made. It began as a John Milius screenplay, transposing Joseph Conrad\\'s classic story \"Heart of Darkness\" into the horrors of the Vietnam War, following a battle-weary Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) on a secret upriver mission to find and execute the renegade Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has reverted to a state of murderous and mystical insanity. The journey is fraught with danger involving wartime action on epic and intimate scales. One measure of the film\\'s awesome visceral impact is the number of sequences, images, and lines of dialogue that have literally burned themselves into our cinematic consciousness, from the Wagnerian strike of helicopter gunships on a Vietnamese village to the brutal murder of stowaways on a peasant sampan and the unflinching fearlessness of the surfing warrior Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who speaks lovingly of \"the smell of napalm in the morning.\" Like Herzog\\'s Aguirre: The Wrath of God, this film is the product of genius cast into a pit of hell and emerging, phoenix-like, in triumph. Coppola\\'s obsession (effectively detailed in the riveting documentary', 'Hearts of Darkness', \", directed by Coppola's wife, Eleanor) informs every scene and every frame, and the result is a film for the ages. --\", 'Jeff Shannon', 'Hearts of Darkness', 'Hearts of Darkness', \"is an engrossing, unwavering look back at Francis Coppola's chaotic, catastrophe-plagued Vietnam production,\", 'Apocalypse Now', \". Filled with juicy gossip and a wonderful behind-the-scenes look at the stressful world of moviemaking, the documentary mixes on-location home movies shot in the Philippines by Eleanor Coppola, the director's wife, with revealing interviews with the cast and crew, shot 10 years later. Similar to Burden of Dreams, Les Blank's absorbing portrait of Werner Herzog's struggle to make Fitzcarraldo, the film chronicles Coppola's eventual decent into obsessive psychosis as everything that could go wrong does go wrong. Storms destroy sets, money evaporates, the Philippine government continually harasses the director, Coppola has romantic affairs, and he can't write the story's ending. Everything is captured on film. In the most disturbing scene, we watch Martin Sheen have a drunken nervous breakdown while his director goads him on (he eventually suffered a heart attack, but finished the film).  Other incredible footage is not visual, but aural as the film includes tapes Eleanor Coppola recorded without Francis's knowledge. In them, he truly sounds like a madman as he confesses his fears about making a bomb of a movie. But while Hearts of Darkness is an amazing, voyeuristic experience, its importance lies in the personal reflections offered by those involved. Sheen, Coppola, and Dennis Hopper speak frankly without embarrassment, offering us an essential piece of film history. --\", 'Dave McCoy']\nAverage Rating: 4.6\nProduct Details: {'Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Blu-ray, Closed-captioned, Dolby, DTS Surround Sound, NTSC, Special Edition, Subtitled, WidescreenMultiple Formats, AC-3, Blu-ray, Closed-captioned, Dolby, DTS Surround Sound, NTSC, Special Edition, Subtitled, Widescreen  See more', 'Contributor': 'Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando', 'Language': 'English', 'Runtime': '7 hours and 31 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '2.35:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 8.8 Ounces', 'Item model number': '031398126195', 'Director': 'Francis Ford Coppola', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Blu-ray, Closed-captioned, Dolby, DTS Surround Sound, NTSC, Special Edition, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Run time': '7 hours and 31 minutes', 'Release date': 'October 19, 2010', 'Actors': 'Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando', 'Subtitles': 'English, French, Spanish', 'Studio': 'Lionsgate', 'Number of discs': '3'}\nReview Text: A must have for fans of the film and for film lovers in general.

A black-mulleted showboat, Mitchell provides the perfect counterpoint to Wiebe\\'s mild-mannered family man, and the smaller fish around him are no less colorful. This is one of those movies you watch in delighted disbelief, marveling that such people exist--and that they gladly allowed themselves to be filmed. Director Seth Gordon does an important thing in presenting this world of eccentrics: he doesn\\'t mock them, or provide editorial nudging; he simply lets them be.

However it seems like the effects houses have gotten this figured out, both The Force Awakens and Mad Max Fury Road are excellent 3D titles and neither were shot in 3D.<br />I won't get into a movie review too much, but I thought Fury Road was a worth addition to the Mad Max story.  I was not wild about Tom Hardy's interpretation of Max (I really wish Mel Gibson hadn't gone nuts and could have done this film) but the new characters are engaging and the action is top notch.<br />Both the desolation of the open spaces and the closeness of the interior environments are improved by the 3D.  Apart from the absurd steering wheel that flies right at the screen the film is devoid of effects that draw attention to themselves.  In defense of the 3D version that steering wheel gag is just as distractingand annoying in 2D.<br />If you like the franchise you will like this movie.  If you like this movie you will enjoy the extra value of the 3D version.\nReview Title: The 3D is worth it!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Jackie Chan's PROJECT A & PROJECT A PART II (Eureka Classics) Limited Edition Blu-ray\nReview Date: 2019/08/16\nStore: Jackie Chan  (Actor)    Format: Blu-ray\nCategories: Movies & TV, Blu-ray, Movies\nProduct Description: [\"A pair of incredible action-adventure extravaganza's from the legendary\", 'Jackie Chan', ',', 'Project A', 'and', 'Project A Part II', 'make their long overdue debut on Blu-ray in the UK from brand new 2K restorations.

On location in the storm-ravaged Philippines, he quite literally went mad as the project threatened to devour him in a vortex of creative despair, but from this insanity came one of the greatest films ever made. It began as a John Milius screenplay, transposing Joseph Conrad\\'s classic story \"Heart of Darkness\" into the horrors of the Vietnam War, following a battle-weary Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) on a secret upriver mission to find and execute the renegade Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has reverted to a state of murderous and mystical insanity. The journey is fraught with danger involving wartime action on epic and intimate scales. One measure of the film\\'s awesome visceral impact is the number of sequences, images, and lines of dialogue that have literally burned themselves into our cinematic consciousness, from the Wagnerian strike of helicopter gunships on a Vietnamese village to the brutal murder of stowaways on a peasant sampan and the unflinching fearlessness of the surfing warrior Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who speaks lovingly of \"the smell of napalm in the morning.\" Like Herzog\\'s Aguirre: The Wrath of God, this film is the product of genius cast into a pit of hell and emerging, phoenix-like, in triumph. Coppola\\'s obsession (effectively detailed in the riveting documentary', 'Hearts of Darkness', \", directed by Coppola's wife, Eleanor) informs every scene and every frame, and the result is a film for the ages. --\", 'Jeff Shannon', 'Hearts of Darkness', 'Hearts of Darkness', \"is an engrossing, unwavering look back at Francis Coppola's chaotic, catastrophe-plagued Vietnam production,\", 'Apocalypse Now', \". Filled with juicy gossip and a wonderful behind-the-scenes look at the stressful world of moviemaking, the documentary mixes on-location home movies shot in the Philippines by Eleanor Coppola, the director's wife, with revealing interviews with the cast and crew, shot 10 years later. Similar to Burden of Dreams, Les Blank's absorbing portrait of Werner Herzog's struggle to make Fitzcarraldo, the film chronicles Coppola's eventual decent into obsessive psychosis as everything that could go wrong does go wrong. Storms destroy sets, money evaporates, the Philippine government continually harasses the director, Coppola has romantic affairs, and he can't write the story's ending. Everything is captured on film. In the most disturbing scene, we watch Martin Sheen have a drunken nervous breakdown while his director goads him on (he eventually suffered a heart attack, but finished the film).  Other incredible footage is not visual, but aural as the film includes tapes Eleanor Coppola recorded without Francis's knowledge. In them, he truly sounds like a madman as he confesses his fears about making a bomb of a movie. But while Hearts of Darkness is an amazing, voyeuristic experience, its importance lies in the personal reflections offered by those involved. Sheen, Coppola, and Dennis Hopper speak frankly without embarrassment, offering us an essential piece of film history. --\", 'Dave McCoy']\n{'Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Blu-ray, Closed-captioned, Dolby, DTS Surround Sound, NTSC, Special Edition, Subtitled, WidescreenMultiple Formats, AC-3, Blu-ray, Closed-captioned, Dolby, DTS Surround Sound, NTSC, Special Edition, Subtitled, Widescreen  See more', 'Contributor': 'Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando', 'Language': 'English', 'Runtime': '7 hours and 31 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '2.35:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 8.8 Ounces', 'Item model number': '031398126195', 'Director': 'Francis Ford Coppola', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Blu-ray, Closed-captioned, Dolby, DTS Surround Sound, NTSC, Special Edition, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Run time': '7 hours and 31 minutes', 'Release date': 'October 19, 2010', 'Actors': 'Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando', 'Subtitles': 'English, French, Spanish', 'Studio': 'Lionsgate', 'Number of discs': '3'}\nA must have for fans of the film and for film lovers in general.

However it seems like the effects houses have gotten this figured out, both The Force Awakens and Mad Max Fury Road are excellent 3D titles and neither were shot in 3D.<br />I won't get into a movie review too much, but I thought Fury Road was a worth addition to the Mad Max story.  I was not wild about Tom Hardy's interpretation of Max (I really wish Mel Gibson hadn't gone nuts and could have done this film) but the new characters are engaging and the action is top notch.<br />Both the desolation of the open spaces and the closeness of the interior environments are improved by the 3D.  Apart from the absurd steering wheel that flies right at the screen the film is devoid of effects that draw attention to themselves.  In defense of the 3D version that steering wheel gag is just as distractingand annoying in 2D.<br />If you like the franchise you will like this movie.

After a miracle of sorts, Po lands inside the palace gates, where he is chosen as the dragon warrior and placed under the tutelage of the decidedly non-plussed master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman). An unconventional student to say the least, hilarity reigns as Shifu tries desperately to make Po into some semblance of a kung fu warrior. Can Po possibly fulfill his destiny as dragon warrior, or was Oogway\\'s final decision a critical mistake? A film rich with hilarious moments, superior animation, and an important message about believing in oneself and the power that comes from within,', 'Kung Fu Panda', 'is great entertainment that will have the whole family laughing and begging for more. (Ages 3 and older)', '--Tami Horiuchi', 'Kung Fu Panda 2', 'Kung Fu Panda 2', \"is a sequel that definitely lives up to its predecessor, thanks to excellent animation and a great mix of action, comedy, and important life lessons. Dragon Warrior Po (Jack Black) has matured and mastered many new challenges since learning the art of kung fu and defeating the snow leopard Tai Lung, but he hasn't lost his penchant for steamed buns, nor has he achieved what his teacher Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) describes as true inner peace. Before he can settle into the arduous task of self-discovery, word arrives that a nearby town of musicians has been attacked and their leader Master Thundering Rhino (Victor Garber) killed by a newly invented weapon that breathes fire and spits out metal--a weapon that is a harbinger of the end of kung fu and the domination of all of China by Lord Shen (Gary Oldman). Po and the Furious Five (Angelina Jolie, Seth Rogen, Jackie Chan, David Cross, and Lucy Liu) set out to destroy the mysterious weapon and save kung fu, encountering the imprisoned and very dispirited kung fu legends Master Oxen (Dennis Haysbert) and Master Croc (Jean-Claude Van Damme) along the way, but the group quickly discovers that their task is far from simple. Even as Soothsayer (Michelle Yeoh) adamantly foretells Lord Shen's defeat at the hands of a warrior of black and white, Po struggles with the realization that he must come to terms with his adoption in order to let go of the past and become who he chooses to be. Only then can he achieve the inner peace that will empower him to triumph over his personal insecurities and Lord Shen.\", 'Kung Fu Panda 2', 'offers excellent animation and 3-D effects, nice brisk pacing, great voice talent, life lessons that ring true, and a healthy dose of comedy that includes everything from wisecracks to a dragon that eats unsuspecting villagers and then poops them out, and a radish trained in the art of kung fu.

On location in the storm-ravaged Philippines, he quite literally went mad as the project threatened to devour him in a vortex of creative despair, but from this insanity came one of the greatest films ever made. It began as a John Milius screenplay, transposing Joseph Conrad\\'s classic story \"Heart of Darkness\" into the horrors of the Vietnam War, following a battle-weary Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) on a secret upriver mission to find and execute the renegade Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has reverted to a state of murderous and mystical insanity. The journey is fraught with danger involving wartime action on epic and intimate scales. One measure of the film\\'s awesome visceral impact is the number of sequences, images, and lines of dialogue that have literally burned themselves into our cinematic consciousness, from the Wagnerian strike of helicopter gunships on a Vietnamese village to the brutal murder of stowaways on a peasant sampan and the unflinching fearlessness of the surfing warrior Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who speaks lovingly of \"the smell of napalm in the morning.\" Like Herzog\\'s Aguirre: The Wrath of God, this film is the product of genius cast into a pit of hell and emerging, phoenix-like, in triumph. Coppola\\'s obsession (effectively detailed in the riveting documentary', 'Hearts of Darkness', \", directed by Coppola's wife, Eleanor) informs every scene and every frame, and the result is a film for the ages. --\", 'Jeff Shannon', 'Hearts of Darkness', 'Hearts of Darkness', \"is an engrossing, unwavering look back at Francis Coppola's chaotic, catastrophe-plagued Vietnam production,\", 'Apocalypse Now', \". Filled with juicy gossip and a wonderful behind-the-scenes look at the stressful world of moviemaking, the documentary mixes on-location home movies shot in the Philippines by Eleanor Coppola, the director's wife, with revealing interviews with the cast and crew, shot 10 years later. Similar to Burden of Dreams, Les Blank's absorbing portrait of Werner Herzog's struggle to make Fitzcarraldo, the film chronicles Coppola's eventual decent into obsessive psychosis as everything that could go wrong does go wrong. Storms destroy sets, money evaporates, the Philippine government continually harasses the director, Coppola has romantic affairs, and he can't write the story's ending. Everything is captured on film. In the most disturbing scene, we watch Martin Sheen have a drunken nervous breakdown while his director goads him on (he eventually suffered a heart attack, but finished the film).  Other incredible footage is not visual, but aural as the film includes tapes Eleanor Coppola recorded without Francis's knowledge. In them, he truly sounds like a madman as he confesses his fears about making a bomb of a movie. But while Hearts of Darkness is an amazing, voyeuristic experience, its importance lies in the personal reflections offered by those involved. Sheen, Coppola, and Dennis Hopper speak frankly without embarrassment, offering us an essential piece of film history. --\", 'Dave McCoy']\nAverage Rating: 4.6\nProduct Details: {'Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Blu-ray, Closed-captioned, Dolby, DTS Surround Sound, NTSC, Special Edition, Subtitled, WidescreenMultiple Formats, AC-3, Blu-ray, Closed-captioned, Dolby, DTS Surround Sound, NTSC, Special Edition, Subtitled, Widescreen  See more', 'Contributor': 'Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando', 'Language': 'English', 'Runtime': '7 hours and 31 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '2.35:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'R (Restricted)', 'Product Dimensions': '0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 8.8 Ounces', 'Item model number': '031398126195', 'Director': 'Francis Ford Coppola', 'Media Format': 'Multiple Formats, AC-3, Blu-ray, Closed-captioned, Dolby, DTS Surround Sound, NTSC, Special Edition, Subtitled, Widescreen', 'Run time': '7 hours and 31 minutes', 'Release date': 'October 19, 2010', 'Actors': 'Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando', 'Subtitles': 'English, French, Spanish', 'Studio': 'Lionsgate', 'Number of discs': '3'}\nReview Text: A must have for fans of the film and for film lovers in general.

Steve and Billy engage in a cross-country duel to see who could set the high score and become the King of Kong! Along the way, both men learn valuable lessons about what it means to be a father, a husband, and a true champion - discovering that you don\\'t always need to win to be a winner. \"A hilarious and moving study of the obsessive competition between the all-time scoring leader on Donkey Kong, an odd Floridian, and a father of two who gets sucked into a world of mind-blowing passive-aggressiveness. \"Boston Globe\".', ']]>', 'Amazon.com', \"The stuff of gladiatorial battle is here: good versus evil, right versus wrong, nerd versus... super-nerd? At any rate, it's a more entertaining showdown than most fictional movies can muster.\", 'The King of Kong', 'is the saga of Steve Wiebe, a Redmond, Washington dweeb who sets a new record in the video game', 'Donkey Kong', ', only to see his accomplishment challenged by the grand poobahs of the gaming establishment. And if you don\\'t know how pernickety the grand poobahs of the gaming establishment can be, well, one of the pleasures of this movie is finding out about this collection of oddballs. It seems Wiebe has toppled a score that has stood since 1982, when eminent \"Gamer of the Century\" Billy Mitchell set it, and Mitchell isn\\'t too happy about being overthrown. A black-mulleted showboat, Mitchell provides the perfect counterpoint to Wiebe\\'s mild-mannered family man, and the smaller fish around him are no less colorful. This is one of those movies you watch in delighted disbelief, marveling that such people exist--and that they gladly allowed themselves to be filmed. Director Seth Gordon does an important thing in presenting this world of eccentrics: he doesn\\'t mock them, or provide editorial nudging; he simply lets them be. The result is an ingratiating classic.', '--Robert Horton']\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Documentary', 'Format': 'AC-3, Dolby, Subtitled, Anamorphic', 'Contributor': 'Billy Mitchell, Steve Wiebe, Seth Gordon', 'Initial release date': '2008-01-29', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1), Unqualified, English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround)', 'Aspect Ratio': '1.85:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned)', 'Product Dimensions': '7.75 x 5.75 x 0.5 inches; 0.32 Ounces', 'Item model number': '1000035229', 'Director': 'Seth Gordon', 'Media Format': 'AC-3, Dolby, Subtitled, Anamorphic', 'Run time': '1 hour and 19 minutes', 'Release date': 'January 29, 2008', 'Actors': 'Billy Mitchell, Steve Wiebe', 'Subtitles': 'English, Spanish', 'Studio': 'Studio Distribution Services', 'Number of discs': '1'}\nReview Text: I teach film production at a university and I bought this to show to my documentary filmmaking classes.  It is an excellent example of how a good doc can make you care about something that you never thought you'd care about.  I love seeing the young women in the class start out rolling their eyes but quickly get drawn into the story.  This doc is consitantly a class favorite.\nReview Title: Even if you don't like video games you should watch this!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Ted 2 [Blu-ray]\nReview Date: 2017/03/25\nStore: Mark Wahlberg  (Actor),     Amanda Seyfried  (Actor)    Rated:    NR    Format: Blu-ray\nCategories: Movies & TV, Featured Categories, Blu-ray, Comedy\nAverage Rating: 4.6\nProduct Details: {'Genre': 'Science Fiction & Fantasy, DVD Movie, Blu-ray Movie, Comedy', 'Format': 'Blu-ray, Ultraviolet, Color, Widescreen, Ultraviolet, Digital_copy', 'Contributor': 'Mark Wahlberg, Morgan Freeman, Amanda Seyfried, Barry Ratcliffe, Jessica Barth, Seth MacFarlane', 'Language': 'English (Dolby Digital 5.1), Spanish (Dolby Digital 5.1), English (DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1), French Canadian (Dolby Digital 5.1), French Canadian (DTS 5.1), Spanish (DTS 5.1)', 'Runtime': '8 hours and 6 minutes', 'Aspect Ratio': '2.40:1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'MPAA rating': 'NR (Not Rated)', 'Product Dimensions': '7 x 5.75 x 0.75 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': '35222385', 'Director': 'Seth MacFarlane', 'Media Format': 'Blu-ray, Ultraviolet, Color, Widescreen, Ultraviolet, Digital_copy', 'Run time': '8 hours and 6 minutes', 'Release date': 'December 15, 2015', 'Actors': 'Mark Wahlberg, Amanda Seyfried, Seth MacFarlane, Morgan Freeman, Jessica Barth', 'Subtitles': 'French, Spanish', 'Studio': 'Universal', 'Number of discs': '2'}\nReview Text: There is not a lot to say.

However it seems like the effects houses have gotten this figured out, both The Force Awakens and Mad Max Fury Road are excellent 3D titles and neither were shot in 3D.<br />I won't get into a movie review too much, but I thought Fury Road was a worth addition to the Mad Max story.  I was not wild about Tom Hardy's interpretation of Max (I really wish Mel Gibson hadn't gone nuts and could have done this film) but the new characters are engaging and the action is top notch.<br />Both the desolation of the open spaces and the closeness of the interior environments are improved by the 3D.  Apart from the absurd steering wheel that flies right at the screen the film is devoid of effects that draw attention to themselves.  In defense of the 3D version that steering wheel gag is just as distractingand annoying in 2D.<br />If you like the franchise you will like this movie.  If you like this movie you will enjoy the extra value of the 3D version.\nReview Title: The 3D is worth it!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Jackie Chan's PROJECT A & PROJECT A PART II (Eureka Classics) Limited Edition Blu-ray\nReview Date: 2019/08/16\nStore: Jackie Chan  (Actor)    Format: Blu-ray\nCategories: Movies & TV, Blu-ray, Movies\nProduct Description: [\"A pair of incredible action-adventure extravaganza's from the legendary\", 'Jackie Chan', ',', 'Project A', 'and', 'Project A Part II', 'make their long overdue debut on Blu-ray in the UK from brand new 2K restorations.

      "Opposites attract with magnetic force in this romantic road-trip delight from Frank Capra (IT'S a WONDERFUL LIFE), about a spoiled runaway socialite (THE PALM BEACH STORY's Claudette Colbert) and a roguish man-of-the-people reporter (GONE WITH THE WIND's Clark Gable) who is determined to get the scoop on her scandalous disappearance. The first film to accomplish the very rare feat of sweeping all five major Oscar categories (best picture, best actor, best actress, best director, and best screenplay), It Happened One Night is among the most gracefully constructed and edited films of the early sound era, packed with clever situations and gags that have entered the Hollywood comedy pantheon. Featuring two actors at the top of their game, sparking with a chemistry that has never been bettered, this is the birth of the screwball comedy."
