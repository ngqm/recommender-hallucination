Helped by a pretty pathologist (Gemini-winner Hilhne Joy, Durham County) and an eager protigi (Jonny Harris, Hatching, Matching & Dispatching), he tries to win over his skeptical boss (Thomas Craig, Where the Heart Is) to his radical methods. Clever plot twists, sly wit, and references to historical figures add to the fun.

A man of scientific progress as well as devout Catholicism, Murdoch (Yannick Bisson) approaches mysteries with such new, state-of-the-art techniques as fingerprinting, blood-testing, and trace evidence, collaborating closely with his department's pathologist, Dr. Julia Ogden (H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Joy). Working under the skeptical Inspector Brackenreid (Thomas Craig), an old-school copper who respects his lead investigator's results but has little patience for his complex methods, Murdoch often encounters new-fangled technology that, in time, will pave the way for such 20th-century staples as radio, television and the electronic grid. At the same time, the faith element in Murdoch's view of the world allows him to be something more than a complete rationalist. His occasional reliance on a medium (Maria del Mar) to help him discover clues, and his church-derived ethics are all part of Murdoch's approach to an increasingly complicated world.\", 'The first episode in', 'Murdoch Mysteries: Season One', 'is an excellent template for all 13 shows in this boxed set. \"Power\" finds Murdoch trying to discover how and why a woman was killed during a demonstration of the \"evils\" of alternating-current-derived electricity put on by a direct-current power company. Murdoch\\'s queries put him in touch with Nikola Tesla, the real-life father of the AC motor. \"The Glass Ceiling\" pits Murdoch\\'s scientific techniques against the more brutal approach of his boss, Brackenreid, who seems to be the target of a killer linked to an old case. \"Elementary, My Dear Murdoch\" somewhat inevitably pairs Murdoch in a murder investigation with one of his idols, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, whose faith in such spiritualist pursuits as seances complicates things. (Doyle returns in a later episode, \"Belly Speaker,\" again proving more of a meddler than a help in a case involving a mad ventriloquist.) \"Bad Medicine\" is a scary story about a hooded archer killing off the patients at a clinic for advanced brain study. (The aforementioned medium has unnerving visions of Murdoch becoming one of the murderer\\'s victims.)
