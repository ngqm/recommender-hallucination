The Zanpakuto is both the weapon of a Soul Reaper and the mirror of his personality and strength. The appearance of the Zanpakuto as independent warriors threw the Soul Society into chaos in the first half of the adventure, but a series of unexpected revelations throws new light on those events. Ichigo and the Soul Reaper Captains continue their battle against Muramasa, the leader of the revolt. Centuries ago, this eerie, serpentine manifestation was the Zanpakuto of Koga, an extraordinarily powerful member of the Kuchiki clan, the family Rukia and Byakuya belong to. But Koga fell prey to arrogance, and the punishment for his crimes has stretched over the ages to the present day, threatening Ichigo and his friends in both the Seireitei and Karakura Town. Although the unexpected shifts in the plot give an added frisson of excitement to the battles, many of these episodes feel padded.

Shown as a simple man with telekinesis using it as a petty tool rather than as a world shaking discovery. It makes sense when viewed metaphorically, though the film itself left a bit to be desired.

Picard and the Enterprise encounter a probe, the probe forces it's way into Picard's mind and sends him into \"the Matrix\", a 40 year simulation in his mind, while his crew can do nothing to help him without killing him. From within this \"matrix\" he is forced to live someone else's perspective and life for several decades. The species eventually goes extinct while forcing Picard to watch as the probes that r*pe him later are sent into space. He awakens on his own ship with a flute and a song...wow (like your r*pist giving you flowers and a mix-tape.) This is not a story of love or courage etc etc...it is a sad tale of why that species went extinct...because they were selfish and didn't care about others.<br /><br />Ask yourself, \"was the first time I cried emotionally because of my own life or was it because of a fictional character in a movie, book or TV?\"\nReview Title: The title and episode showing that time is relative...\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nReview Date: 2022/11/21\nAverage Rating: 4.6\nProduct Details: {'Content advisory': ['Nudity', 'violence', 'substance use', 'alcohol use', 'smoking', 'foul language', 'sexual content'], 'Audio languages': ['English', 'English [Audio Description]', '\u0c95\u0ca8\u0ccd\u0ca8\u0ca1', 'Italiano', 'Deutsch', '\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bcd', '\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea', 'Indonesia', 'Portugu\u00eas (Portugal)', 'Ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', '\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac', '\u0c24\u0c46\u0c32\u0c41\u0c17\u0c41', 'Fran\u00e7ais (France)', 'Bahasa Melayu', 'Fran\u00e7ais (Canada)', 'Filipino', '\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e', 'Portugu\u00eas (Brasil)', 'Nederlands', '\u0d2e\u0d32\u0d2f\u0d3e\u0d33\u0d02', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a)', '\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940', '\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629', 'Polski', '\u010ce\u0161tina', 'Magyar', 'T\u00fcrk\u00e7e', '\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22', 'Catal\u00e0', 'Rom\u00e2n\u0103'], 'Subtitles': ['English [CC]', '\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629', 'Catal\u00e0', '\u010ce\u0161tina', 'Dansk', 'Deutsch', '\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Latinoam\u00e9rica)', 'Espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a)', 'Euskara', 'Suomi', 'Filipino', 'Fran\u00e7ais (Canada)', 'Fran\u00e7ais (France)', 'Galego', '\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea', '\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940', 'Magyar', 'Indonesia', 'Italiano', '\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e', '\u0c95\u0ca8\u0ccd\u0ca8\u0ca1', '\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4', '\u0d2e\u0d32\u0d2f\u0d3e\u0d33\u0d02', 'Bahasa Melayu', 'Norsk Bokm\u00e5l', 'Nederlands', 'Polski', 'Portugu\u00eas (Brasil)', 'Portugu\u00eas (Portugal)', 'Rom\u00e2n\u0103', '\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439', 'Svenska', '\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bcd', '\u0c24\u0c46\u0c32\u0c41\u0c17\u0c41', '\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22', 'T\u00fcrk\u00e7e', '\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430', 'Ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t', '\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7b80\u4f53\uff09', '\u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7e41\u9ad4\uff09'], 'Directors': ['Vincenzo Natali', 'Alrick Riley'], 'Producers': ['Jonah Nolan', 'Lisa Joy', 'Athena Wickham'], 'Starring': ['Chloe Grace Moretz', 'Jack Reynor', 'Gary Carr']}\nReview Text: Nothing new here, just the same old stuff.
