      "Cool, tough and always classic, Clint Eastwood is a true American icon whose career has spanned more than seven decades. No decade impacted his growth more as an actor, director and legend than the pivotal years he spent at Universal Pictures between 1968 and 1975 when he made seven movies that laid the foundation for his superstardom. Clint Eastwood: The Universal Pictures 7-Movie Collection includes a selection of action-packed westerns (Two Mules for Sister Sara, Joe Kidd and High Plains Drifter) and edge-of-your-seat thrillers (Coogan's Bluff, The Beguiled, Play Misty For Me and The Eiger Sanction) that make up this important chapter of one of Hollywood's most unforgettable entertainers.Bonus Content:",
