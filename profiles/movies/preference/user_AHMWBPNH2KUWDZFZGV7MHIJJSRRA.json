As if dealing with the kids' first Christmas without their parents isn't hard enough, Jules loses her job, the nanny quits, her teenage nephew Milo steals a video game, and Milo and his 7-year-old sister Maddie are constantly bickering. A knock on the door brings an offer of a holiday abroad at Castlebury Hall, the mansion owned by the children's grandfather Duke Huntington. Jules hesitates because the Duke previously wanted nothing to do with her sister or his grandchildren, but eventually decides the threesome has little to lose. When they arrive, the Duke is not exactly bursting with goodwill and holiday spirit, and Jules's outspokenness combined with the children's wild ways threaten to make a bad situation even worse. But surprisingly, disrupting everyone's routines proves a powerful catalyst for positive change. The opulent mansion and breathtaking countryside provide a beautiful setting for the film, and Katie McGrath, Sam Heughan, and Roger Moore portray their characters well. While the family's difficult situation is fairly believable, the resolutions come far too easily. Nonetheless, the sentiment that the bonds of love and family can overcome even the strongest adversity resonates at any time of the year.
