One clue leads to a thousand thrills when Mary, her brother, and their fellow searchers must brave earthquakes, fire, flood, and even a giant condor on their perilous rescue mission. Maurice Chevalier, George Sanders, and Wilfrid Hyde-White also star in this spectacular fantasy-adventure based on celebrated novelist Jules Verne\\'s popular book. Brimming with special effects, this is your passport to surefire family fun!|The movie is based on the novel \"Captain Grant\\'s Children,\" by Jules Verne.|\"A Thousand Thrills And Hayley Mills\" served as the film\\'s ad slogan.', 'Amazon.com', 'In Search of the Castaways', \"was Hayley Mills's third feature for Disney, an agreeable adventure--loosely based on a Jules Verne story--with enough derring-do to make kids happy and with the right touch of self-conscious silliness to keep adults smiling. Mills plays Mary Grant, a missing freighter captain's daughter convinced her father is still alive somewhere in Earth's southern hemisphere. With the help of her brother (Keith Hamshire) and a veteran seaman (an extremely unlikely if charming Maurice Chevalier), Mary convinces a shipping magnate, Lord Glenarvan (Wilfrid Hyde-White), to set sail and find the missing Captain Grant. The team survives freezing weather, avalanches, a menacing condor, an active volcano, Maori captors, and a plot by a slick George Sanders to steal a ship. Meanwhile, Mary and Glenarvan's rakish son, John (Michael Anderson Jr.), engage in flirtatious feuding. The many memorable action sequences are wildly improbable (all the more so watching the nonchalant Chevalier have a go at Indiana Jones-like heroics) and liberally employ old-fashioned process shots, mattes, paintings, and other pre-digital special effects. The incomparable Hyde-White looks as if he's having fun alternately harrumphing and encouraging good old British resolve, while Sanders effortlessly portrays, for the umpteenth time, his brand of enchanting villainy.

Brimming with special effects, this is your passport to surefire family fun!|The movie is based on the novel \"Captain Grant\\'s Children,\" by Jules Verne.|\"A Thousand Thrills And Hayley Mills\" served as the film\\'s ad slogan.', 'Amazon.com', 'In Search of the Castaways', \"was Hayley Mills's third feature for Disney, an agreeable adventure--loosely based on a Jules Verne story--with enough derring-do to make kids happy and with the right touch of self-conscious silliness to keep adults smiling. Mills plays Mary Grant, a missing freighter captain's daughter convinced her father is still alive somewhere in Earth's southern hemisphere. With the help of her brother (Keith Hamshire) and a veteran seaman (an extremely unlikely if charming Maurice Chevalier), Mary convinces a shipping magnate, Lord Glenarvan (Wilfrid Hyde-White), to set sail and find the missing Captain Grant. The team survives freezing weather, avalanches, a menacing condor, an active volcano, Maori captors, and a plot by a slick George Sanders to steal a ship. Meanwhile, Mary and Glenarvan's rakish son, John (Michael Anderson Jr.), engage in flirtatious feuding. The many memorable action sequences are wildly improbable (all the more so watching the nonchalant Chevalier have a go at Indiana Jones-like heroics) and liberally employ old-fashioned process shots, mattes, paintings, and other pre-digital special effects. The incomparable Hyde-White looks as if he's having fun alternately harrumphing and encouraging good old British resolve, while Sanders effortlessly portrays, for the umpteenth time, his brand of enchanting villainy.

      "The fur flies when a smart Siamese cat goes undercover and Hayley Mills and Dean Jones team up for mystery, adventure, and wild comedy on Disney DVD. When the irrepressible and always hungry D.C. (Darn Cat) turns up with a wristwatch for a collar, it becomes a tip-off to an unsolved robbery and kidnapping. You don't know who's tailing who as nosy neighbors, jealous boyfriends, and a highly allergic FBI agent play a game of cat and mouse to crack the baffling case. Don't miss the spectacular supporting cast featuring Dorothy Provine, Roddy McDowall, Frank Gorshin, and Ed Wynn, plus 100 purr-cent feline family fun!|The film was a big Christmas release, grossing more than $9 million at the box office, due in part to a screenplay written by the original authors of the story \"Undercover Cat,\" Millie and Gordon Gordon, along with Bill Walsh, and a popular title tune written by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman, sung by Bobby Darrin.|One of the cats who placed D.C. was Tao from Disney's THE INCREDIBLE JOURNEY."
