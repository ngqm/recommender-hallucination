They attach easily to any loop, whether it be a purse, belt, or backpack.  I really like the fact that the tops are interchangeable.  Ive never seen that options b4.  I also really like the funnel it comes with.  It doesnt take up much room b/c it collapses into itself for easy storage.  It is a little difficult to fill the bottles, even with the provided funnel.  The bottoms of the bottles are rounded, so u cant place them on the counter to fill them.  It CAN be done with one hand, but it is much easier to do with a 2nd person helping.  I dont like that they are made out of hard plastic.  It doesnt matter if u are just using it as a sprayer, but if u need it to be a squeezable bottle, it is difficult to get every drop out.  When u fill the bottle to use with the mister, u need to pay attention to the included straw inside.  It has to wrap around the area where the carabiner fits in order to get every last drop out of the container.  needless to say, I like this product's versatility, and especially during covid they r a great idea for hand sanitizer.

I do like the packaging.  its nice and bright and easy to find at the bottom of ur purse.  I think the box it comes in is a waste of money on the company's end.  its a cube that measures about 3.75\" x 3.5\" x 4.25\".  it has 10 yes 10 prepackaged wipes inside.  they could have easily been compressed down to a smaller package, which would in turn made it more eco friendly.  so in conclusion, im a Prius owner who only cares about the price of gasoline, and these r just way to expensive for me to actually purchase... especially during a pandemic where people r loosing their jobs left and right.

It took a long time for the substance to melt into an oily mess.  I rubbed it on my legs at work around 3pm.  I got home at 9pm and sat on the couch with my boyfriend.  he started to rub my legs like he does every night and said, \"eh what's that?!?!\"  yup... 6 hours later, the \"body butter\" was still a greasy mess.  my sister buys body butter all the time so I asked her about her experiences with it... she said, \"nothing like what u r describing.\"  ok... so after all of this nonsense...im going with a hard NO on this purchase.  it wont be getting used up at my house.

I thought the button was just a press and release and the spikes would just keep popping up.  no... u press the button up and it holds it in place while the bristles disappear.  u then move ur finger over the button towards u and the button releases and the bristles pop out again.  I would say that the brush feels quite bulky in my larger girly hand.  my sister was concerned that the button would break over not that much time.  my vote is to use this specifically for a dog and buy a smaller brush with the same concept for a cat.

Biodegradable Hydrating Hand Wipes, With Collagen and Peptides to Smooth and Improve Elasticity, 15 Individually Wrapped Wipes (Refresh Line - Fresh Citrus)\nReview Date: 2020/11/06\nStore: BUSYCO\nAverage Rating: 3.5\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'BUSYCO', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '4.5 x 7.3 x 3.5 inches; 4.16 Ounces'}\nReview Text: 10 for $12 is... well lets face it... is pricey.  if u r looking to use this like a wet one at a restaurant or after touching money... u R NOT GOING TO BUY THIS PRODUCT.  if u r going to use it as intended... for \"freshening up\" u might purchase these overpriced wipes.  the package talks about eco friendly and being compostable, but really these things just mean more expensive for the consumer.  its like what the lady at Toyota said to me.  there r 2 types of people who the buy Prius.  ones who only want to save money on gas and the ones who dont care how much something costs as long as its for the environment.  thats how this wipe makes me feel.<br />the consistency of the wipe is soft and WAY thicker then a wet one, but size wise... its about the same.  its definitely not big enough to do ur whole body and it certainly isn't wet enough to even try.  u would have to pick and choose the places u would need it most.  it says that its unscented... but apparently unscented has a scent.  my friend and I wiped our hands last night and decided we hated the scent.  I do like the packaging.  its nice and bright and easy to find at the bottom of ur purse.  I think the box it comes in is a waste of money on the company's end.  its a cube that measures about 3.75\" x 3.5\" x 4.25\".  it has 10 yes 10 prepackaged wipes inside.  they could have easily been compressed down to a smaller package, which would in turn made it more eco friendly.  so in conclusion, im a Prius owner who only cares about the price of gasoline, and these r just way to expensive for me to actually purchase... especially during a pandemic where people r loosing their jobs left and right.

It took a long time for the substance to melt into an oily mess.  I rubbed it on my legs at work around 3pm.  I got home at 9pm and sat on the couch with my boyfriend.  he started to rub my legs like he does every night and said, \"eh what's that?!?!\"  yup... 6 hours later, the \"body butter\" was still a greasy mess.  my sister buys body butter all the time so I asked her about her experiences with it... she said, \"nothing like what u r describing.\"  ok... so after all of this nonsense...im going with a hard NO on this purchase.  it wont be getting used up at my house.  Im glad I didnt order this as a gift for my sister for xmas... I would have been embarrassed... oh and the scent wasnt wonderful either.

I entered a wrestling match the minute I stepped into my shower.  the stuff was very difficult to get out of the tube.  it has a hint of a suntan lotion smell, which was very nice.  it comes out in a tight, white string into ur hand... and it goes on and stays on like lotion!!!  where's the foam?  where's the bubbles?  I dont know but they didnt attend the party at my shower last night.  with all that being said about the misleading product name and page, the product works.  my face was very clean and not over dried at all.  it does mention that its an exfoliator, but it is a creamy substance with no sand or beads inside.  again, this product does a great job of cleansing ur skin, but dont be surprised when u dont get any bubbles or foam in ur hand.<br />UPDATE:<br />after using it all week I have noticed that there are a couple of tiny beads floating around in the lotion to make its claim as an exfoliator.  I wouldnt say there r a lot in it, but they r in the product.

I thought he was going to love these small travel sized soap that come 6 in a resealable bag, but they fell short of his expectations.  he hated the scent!  the clove smell was just to overpowering.  each bar fits nicely in ur hand b/c they r teardrop shaped and at 1 st they r a little gritty.  it has a cross stamped in it and it really feels more like a guest hand washing soap or something u would get for free at a hotel.  thats about the thickness of each bar.  its handmade here in the USA (which I love) in Ohio and it does leave ur skin feeling moisturized, even though it doesnt lather much.  we r going to move the rest of the bars of soap to our guest bathroom for hand washing only.

I had plenty left on my hands to do my neck and behind my ears after I completed my face.  the thing I LOVE most about black wolf products is that they remember that all eyes are not created equal... yes I said eyes... my 42 year old eyes can not see most directions on the bottles that come in.  these guys must know how I feel b/c they ALWAYS type them in a very large font, which is great b/c it saves me from having to call my boyfriend through Alexa to come in and read them to me!!!

I always feel nervous about using a wire brush on a cat b/c they are notorious for always trying to bite the brush or rub their face on it.  im always so concerned about poking them in the eye.  all that being said... she LOVED the self cleaning feature of this brush.  I thought the button was just a press and release and the spikes would just keep popping up.  no... u press the button up and it holds it in place while the bristles disappear.  u then move ur finger over the button towards u and the button releases and the bristles pop out again.  I would say that the brush feels quite bulky in my larger girly hand.  my sister was concerned that the button would break over not that much time.  my vote is to use this specifically for a dog and buy a smaller brush with the same concept for a cat.  I hope this was helpful.\nReview Title: its not really the right size for a cat\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

    "text": "I am in love with this lava product!  I love a great exfoliator!  when I leave my job at night, I am soooo greasy, oily, and floury that I just want to rip off the dirty day in the shower with a great cleanser.  I always felt that a scrub couldn't have enough exfoliating power for me, but I may have met my match with this 1.  its super gritty and its DEFINITELY NOT FOR PEOPLE WITH SENSITIVE SKIN!  at 1 point I thought that it might be to strong even for my iron face.  the product is black and very thick, so u only need a little bit.  I cleansed my face with it, and now my forehead feels baby soft.  the rest of my face also feels AMAZING, but my silky smooth forehead is what is really standing out for me.  I would be sure to be extra gentile when u r applying this to ur skin.  I will definitely be adding this product to my top 3 super take the day off products and I will be sure to reorder it when it eventually runs out.  I hope this was helpful.",
