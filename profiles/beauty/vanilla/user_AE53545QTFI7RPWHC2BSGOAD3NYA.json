I buy them all of the time. I have tried different  brands  from your dollar ones all the way to paying  $200 for one in a spa. So when  I  got  the  opportunity  to  review  this  product  for  free  in  exchange  for  an  honest  review  I was in. Let me say that  I liked the scent  which  is kind  of important  because  you  have  to  leave  this  mask on for at least 7 minutes. Next the color is dark  and the consistency  is lighter than what is typical. This means that a little  will go along way. It didn't  get too tight and was easy to remove. I used it both on my face and my cellulite  areas. It felt good  and I had no irritation. It definitely  made my face soft and bright. My makeup  also laid nicely. As far  as  the  cellulite  it didn't  melt  away. I am going  to continue  regulated use and see what  happens.\nReview Title: Dead Sea Delight\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Eyelash Serum 3.5ml\nReview Date: 2015/09/28\nAverage Rating: 3.4\nProduct Details: {'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4 x 1.7 x 1 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '646437061599'}\nReview Text: I have the shortest, thinnest  eyelashes  ever. I constantly  use gobs of mascara to make  them thicker and longer. So when  I was  offered  to  review  this  product  for a  discount  in  exchange  for  an  honest  review  I jumped on it. This serum comes packaged  nicely and the bottle  seemed on the small side. I opened and tested  it on the back of my knee. No irritation  at all. So before  I went to sleep  I put it on my eye lashes  and brows. When I woke  up I didn't  see a difference. I decided  to try it in the morning  under my makeup. It made my eyebrows  super defined and they laid perfectly  through the day. It also made  my mascara  lay well and my eye lashes  appeared longer. I will continue  to  use  it  and see what happens.\nReview Title: Decent  day time  solution\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Fungus Nail Treatment,Sky-shop Fungus Nail Repair Oil, Fungal Nail Eliminator for Fingernails and Toenails, Repairs & Protects from Discoloration, Brittle and Cracked Nails (35ml)\nReview Date: 2016/03/29\nStore: Pei Mei\nAverage Rating: 3.6\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Pei Mei', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Item Weight': '0.25 Pounds', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Unit Count': '1.0582 Ounce', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2 x 2 x 5 inches; 4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'Natural Nail Polish Remover', 'UPC': '646437736213'}\nReview Text: This nail polish  remover is a fascinating  product.

I take my showers in the morning  and find this scent  to invigorate  me. I was concerned  at first  because  the color of the scrub is bright  orange  and I didn't  know  if it would  tint my skin...it didn't. This scrub is medium sized in exfoliating crystal. It is a drier consistency  and is easy to apply. I just dumped  some in my hand and gently  massaged it into my skin. It leaves your skin hydrated  and soft.

As far as a body wash goes this one has a very light scent. While it definitely  cleans  the skin it is a low lather soap. You do not  get a lot of bubbles. There are three  different  types  of  oils  in this body wash  coconut, argan, and tea tree. They work  well in terms  of moisturization. One of my favorite  features  is the pump that is included  to dispense the soap. It is really  well  made. It doesn't  allow  for any drips and dispenses  accurately. I  received  a  discounted  sample  of  this  product  in  exchange  for  an  unbiased  and  honest  review.\nReview Title: Moisturizing\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
