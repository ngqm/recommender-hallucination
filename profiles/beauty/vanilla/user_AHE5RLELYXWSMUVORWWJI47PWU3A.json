I bought the pink back in Feb. 2015, still using it just got tired of the color, and this one seems slightly less opaque but maybe it's because that one is pink on pale skin but a second coat fixes the opacity, (only 1 coat in the pic). It may leave a few specks of the shimmer on your skin when you peel it off but they wipe away effortlessly.<br /><br />If you're new to nail art and want to use this for that, I do suggest you transfer some to an empty polish bottle (cleaned with acetone or brand new doesn't matter) using a syringe with some sort of tip, an eye dropper or even a straw, this will keep the large bottle from drying out.

I really like the fact that they're not etched like any other glass file. They do a great job at filing natural nails without all that ear splitting, teeth hurting, grinding noise other glass files make.<br /><br />As far as buffing/polishing goes, yes, they do make a naked, natural nail shiny.  But unless your nail is free of bumps, humps, divots, etc., it's going to take a long time to shine the nail evenly. What you end up doing is making thin/weak spots in the nail which will cause breaks or cracks as the nail grows out because these files take off a lot of nail. You can get shinier nails quicker with a base coat.\nReview Title: Great glass files\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

But unless your nail is free of bumps, humps, divots, etc., it's going to take a long time to shine the nail evenly. What you end up doing is making thin/weak spots in the nail which will cause breaks or cracks as the nail grows out because these files take off a lot of nail. You can get shinier nails quicker with a base coat.\nGreat glass files",

I don't own white stamping polish, I use Sinful Colors Snow Me White that has been open for 3 days, it works but it's still not proper stamping polish. The black I use is MdU, the absolute holy grail of stamping polishes. But I have to say that these are beyond good! This black is comparable to MdU black in every way, except the smell.

I bought the pink back in Feb. 2015, still using it just got tired of the color, and this one seems slightly less opaque but maybe it's because that one is pink on pale skin but a second coat fixes the opacity, (only 1 coat in the pic). It may leave a few specks of the shimmer on your skin when you peel it off but they wipe away effortlessly.<br /><br />If you're new to nail art and want to use this for that, I do suggest you transfer some to an empty polish bottle (cleaned with acetone or brand new doesn't matter) using a syringe with some sort of tip, an eye dropper or even a straw, this will keep the large bottle from drying out. This 4 oz bottle will last you a very long time, I still have about half the bottle I bought in Feb. 2015, and costs a fraction of the price as those other brands marketed specifically for nail art.\nReview Title: Good for Nail Art\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Nail Art Stamp Stamping Templates Stamping Tool Set 2.8cm Clear Silicone Stamper Scraper Stamping Plate Guide Template 6PCS\nReview Date: 2017/07/25\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.1 x 4.61 x 1.1 inches; 7.2 Ounces'}\nReview Text: &#34;Jeff's Wife&#34; - I got these when they were an Add-On Item for $3.99, definitely worth the price. The stamper works great, I didn't even wash it first (even though you should always wash new stampers before first use), and it's slightly (I do mean slightly) softer then other clear stampers I own.<br /><br />If you're new to stamping or not familiar with clear stampers, they are more delicate than opaque ones and tear easily, so be gentle with it. Wash it with dish soap & warm water, dry with a paper towel and clean it with a lint roller or tape. Never buff it or use acetone, you'll make it cloudy defeating the purpose of a clear stamper. When picking up, ROLL GENTLY over the image if you apply too much pressure it won't pick up. When applying the image to the nail press straight down (again, with GENTLE pressure) and rock side to side or roll from side to side. Don't push the tip of the nail into it, it will tear.<br /><br />All the plates stamp great, I didn't swatch every image, although plates 29 & 41 have shallow etching (in my experience this is normal for BP plates) so the thinner scraper is a nice addition. It's not as thin as the 0.5mm and not a thick as the 1mm ones I own, I'd say it's 0.75mm (I didn't get out the calipers). There are different size images, a little for every nail size. But I do wish the water marble designs were bigger, I'm not a Water Marble Witch yet. Plate 52 is great for lead lighting or Sharpie water coloring.<br /><br />The stamping guide works like it's supposed to, I've added a photo to show how it's used just in case it's confusing. I have a set of 4 templates from another brand already, there's not much difference in size or thickness of the metal but the designs are different. The edges aren't finished, like a plate with no backing, but I don't think it would cause anyone to slice their finger open unless you're being extremely careless.<br /><br />All in all a great set.\nReview Title: Nice set\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Pore Strips, Blackhead Remover Charcoal Nose Strips Deep Cleansing 24 Strips\nReview Date: 2018/10/02\nStore: CalMyotis\nProduct Description: ['Pore strips are tested under strict US regulations.
