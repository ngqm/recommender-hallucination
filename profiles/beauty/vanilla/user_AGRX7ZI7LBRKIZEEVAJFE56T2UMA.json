Lol, I got toothpaste everywhere and learned this the hard way. Functionally, the vibrations are powerful by default, so if you are sensitive like me, turn it down. I\u2019ve used it 4 times now and the first time it was strange, but now I am use to it. There are 5 different pulsating settings (see video). The plus and minus icons allow for easy and quick adjustment of how hard/soft - fast/slow the vibrating brush-head will pulsate. The bristles on the brush attachment is firm, but soft on gums; so there is some bend to the bristles and was comfortable for me. It sits on a charger to power it up via usb cord that plugs into standard charger plug. The case is beyond awesome. I travel for conferences and this stores the brush and charger with the brush head in a beautiful pink bottom and clear top hard case. Easy to pack and go. My teeth feels very clean after using this electronic toothbrush. For my set, I have 5 extra brush head attachments for exchanging after wearing out. This set looks exactly like advertised. I love the pink design. It is long and slender with sliver trim. My video will show the different settings and I hope you can hear the slight vibration changes because you could easily tell from the sound of the pulse by which setting it is on through a couple of uses. My favorite thing about it is that the charger is small and doesn\u2019t take up any room on the sink countertop. The travel case is sturdy. The quality of this brush is so great that I don\u2019t want to ever go back to a standard manual toothbrush. I highly recommend if you need a travel brush that is electronic!

It did stick to my upper lid when I moved my eyelids up as I waited for them to dry. Once dry, I used the tweezer to apply the magnet eyelash. Each eyelash has tiny magnetics that adhere to the liner. I was pleasantly surprised that it worked!! The tweezers was not helpful to me for applying, and the second lash I applied with my hands without a problem. Beautiful lashes!! Wore them all day yesterday and wasn\u2019t uncomfortable at all.

It is very shiny and staticky, but a sprinkle of powder will tone that shine. I did it fast and it definitely needs a bit more powder, but it did reduce shine for a more realistic hair wig. The cap construction is very nice, but there are NO combs or clips, which is common for a banged wig. I\u2019m a 21\u201d wig wearer and this fit me comfortably with my long/thick hair in a bun at the nape of my neck. Long! I\u2019m 5\u20192-ish and this hit me lower back. I brushed this wig several times and ran a dryer sheet over it for static. No loose hairs yet. Overall, this does look wiggy with shine and static, but for a cosplay wig, it lays very naturally and moves well.

A lot of hair so you feel the weight but I am use to that. Very long and lush. Nice hairline and part\u2026 not too very fake, but could use slight plucking. I use to feel weird wearing wigs out and thought people would tell\u2026 who cares if they do know? I have never encountered anyone saying I was wearing a wig\u2026 on the contrary- they compliment my hair. I do chose to tell them I have a wig on.

The cap construction is very nice, but there are NO combs or clips, which is common for a banged wig. I\u2019m a 21\u201d wig wearer and this fit me comfortably with my long/thick hair in a bun at the nape of my neck. Long! I\u2019m 5\u20192-ish and this hit me lower back. I brushed this wig several times and ran a dryer sheet over it for static. No loose hairs yet.

Lol, I got toothpaste everywhere and learned this the hard way. Functionally, the vibrations are powerful by default, so if you are sensitive like me, turn it down. I\u2019ve used it 4 times now and the first time it was strange, but now I am use to it. There are 5 different pulsating settings (see video). The plus and minus icons allow for easy and quick adjustment of how hard/soft - fast/slow the vibrating brush-head will pulsate. The bristles on the brush attachment is firm, but soft on gums; so there is some bend to the bristles and was comfortable for me. It sits on a charger to power it up via usb cord that plugs into standard charger plug. The case is beyond awesome. I travel for conferences and this stores the brush and charger with the brush head in a beautiful pink bottom and clear top hard case. Easy to pack and go. My teeth feels very clean after using this electronic toothbrush. For my set, I have 5 extra brush head attachments for exchanging after wearing out. This set looks exactly like advertised. I love the pink design. It is long and slender with sliver trim. My video will show the different settings and I hope you can hear the slight vibration changes because you could easily tell from the sound of the pulse by which setting it is on through a couple of uses. My favorite thing about it is that the charger is small and doesn\u2019t take up any room on the sink countertop. The travel case is sturdy. The quality of this brush is so great that I don\u2019t want to ever go back to a standard manual toothbrush. I highly recommend if you need a travel brush that is electronic! Update: A week later and I still love it! Everything works very well!!\nReview Title: Great travel toothbrush!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Persephone Ombre Blonde Lace Front Wig Wavy Soft Brown Roots Ash Blonde Ombre Wigs for Women Glueless Long Wavy Synthetic Wig with Middle Parting Heat Resistant 22 Inches\nReview Date: 2020/06/15\nStore: Persephone\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Color': 'Brown Roots Ash Blonde Ombre', 'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Special Feature': 'Glueless', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.7 x 6.2 x 2.3 inches; 14.39 Ounces', 'UPC': '708210345712'}\nReview Text: [[VIDEOID:e6486dec3002b28b72d65864eaf95d53]] Y\u2019all!!!

It\u2019s so much easier than applying glue, in my opinion. I did two thin layers of magnetic eyeliner and allowed to dry. It did stick to my upper lid when I moved my eyelids up as I waited for them to dry. Once dry, I used the tweezer to apply the magnet eyelash. Each eyelash has tiny magnetics that adhere to the liner. I was pleasantly surprised that it worked!! The tweezers was not helpful to me for applying, and the second lash I applied with my hands without a problem. Beautiful lashes!! Wore them all day yesterday and wasn\u2019t uncomfortable at all. Didn\u2019t come off in the wind going to dinner. I simply removed with my hands to replace on the storage palette and removed liner with coconut oil. Lashes are glamorous and reusable.
