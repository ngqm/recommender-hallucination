The comb itself is just over 3 inches, meaning it fits perfectly in any pocket, bag, glove compartment of a car, etc. If you are always on the run like I am, having a useful and reliable comb is key in making sure you look your best! I usually slick back my hair, and on especially hot days, it can come undone, leading to a rather homely look. Now the only thing I have to do is take the comb out of my pocket and I\u2019m good to go! Although my beard isn\u2019t anywhere near as long as I\u2019d like it, It also works well there.<br /><br />The comb itself features a nice sandalwood scent that is both refreshing and calming. The wood on the comb feels very sturdy, and the teeth on the comb feel as if they will not break easily, like plastic combs do. The comb also comes with a very nice carrying case.<br /><br />Overall, if you need a reliable, stylish, and VERY compact comb, I would absolutely recommend this comb by Calily.<br /><br />I was sent this product for free in order to evaluate and leave my honest feedback.\nReview Title: The perfect comb for anybody who is always on the go!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Webat Bath Bombs Gift Set, Spa Bomb Fizzies & Ultra Lush Essential Oil - Dry Skin Moisturize, Fit for Bubble & Spa Bath, Handmade Birthday Gift Ideal for Lady, Women, Girlfriend, Men\nReview Date: 2016/08/15\nStore: Webat\nProduct Description: [\"Product Specification: 1.

The packaging is very nice and it includes everything you could possibly need to get salon quality nails. It includes the polish itself, the nails, an Emory board and more. I like the look of natural, subtle colors so I was happy with the choices it came with. The gel itself goes on very smooth and once I applied the nails, they felt strong and held up well. It\u2019s definitely a game changer it\u2019s nice that My girlfriend won\u2019t be going back to the nail salon any time soon.\nReview Title: This kit has it all!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: YiJiaBa Under Eye Mask, Collagen Eye Mask, Eye Gel Pads, Green Tea Under Eye Patches, Firming Eye Mask, 30 Pairs Collagen Eye Patches for Eye Moisturizing, Dark Circles, Wrinkles, Fine Lines\nReview Date: 2021/03/07\nStore: YiJiaBa\nProduct Description: ['Imagine that when we saw a person, the first thing we saw was their eyes, which is why eyes are very important.

I've been wearing them daily in the morning and I've noticed such an improvement in my eyes and the puffiness around them. I usually leave them on for 45 minutes each morning and when I take them off my eyes feel moisturized and rejuvenated.<br /><br />They come packed nicely in the container and comes with a little spoon that you can use to get a pair of masks out since they are saturated in a liquid.<br /><br />As a bonus tip, try keeping these in your refrigerator. It feels SO much better on your eyes and the cooling effect helps a ton with puffiness.\nReview Title: A treat for your eyes\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Brazilian Body Wave Human Hair Lace Frontal Wigs 13x4x1 T Part Lace Front Wigs for Black Women Natural Hairline 18 inches\nReview Date: 2021/03/19\nStore: Aliglossy\nAverage Rating: 2.9\nProduct Details: {'Hair Type': 'Wavy', 'Special Feature': 'Tangle Free', 'Brand': 'Aliglossy', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Cartoon Character': 'Wavy', 'Package Dimensions': '9.09 x 7.2 x 2.6 inches; 9.52 Ounces', 'UPC': '791715548177'}\nReview Text: A really beautiful wavy wig for when you\u2019re wanting to go for a casual or more formal look. The wig itself came very nicely packaged in a box and didn\u2019t have any noticeable smells. In fact, mine smelled clean like shampoo. The hair feels very soft to the touch and looks very natural.<br /><br />The wig comes naturally with waves in it already and so far I haven\u2019t noticed much shedding. The lace comes pre-plucked which makes the hairline look very natural. You wouldn\u2019t know it\u2019s a wig unless someone told you.

To begin, the patches are super thin. This makes getting them out of the package difficult, as you will likely find yourself grabbing more than you need at once. Also, they have a very light fragrance, but something a little more aromatic would be nice, maybe a citrus scent to help wake you up in the morning. For the price, it's hard to complain, but these could easily be a much better product with a few changes.\nReview Title: Nice hydration, but some room for improvement.\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
