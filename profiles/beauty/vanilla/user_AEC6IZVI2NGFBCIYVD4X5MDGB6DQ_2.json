The brush works great for me.  The bristles are relatively soft and flexible so it doesn't feel like I'm trying to tear my scalp off. Comb is too stiff but I can see where someone else might like it.  Now the fun part.  I didn't know what that little metal-tined thing (photo 2) was for.  I figured it was a mustache comb and I have a mustache so I gave it a try.  Worked great!  The little tines penetrated the mustache hairs and felt great on the underlying skin.  Kinda like an exfoliater!  I loved it.  Couldn't find a description of it on the product's page so I reviewed a couple of similar products and discovered that it's actually for cleaning the brush.  Not for me - I'm using it on my mustache.  Nice product and seems to be high quality.

Hate to say it but nasal sprays have been the one and only thing that tends to relieve the congestion.  Usually once a day before bedtime.  Ordered this product to give it a shot.  I followed the instructions and added the product (actually two products) to a hot bath and hopped in.  Sat soaking for about 15 minutes with no relief.  Then I put a muslin washcloth over my face and started pouring hot bath water over it.  After about five minutes of deep breathing (in through the nose, out through the mouth) the nasal congestion started breaking up somewhat.  Didn't completely break up but got better.  Drained the tub (tons of sandy debris left) and took a hot shower to rinse the clay, etc, off.  That's when the congestion broke loose.  I was able to blow my nose and breath through my nose with very little to no congestion.  Unfortunately the relief didn't last all that long, probably about three hours.  At 36 bucks a pop, that's 12 dollars per hour for three hours relief.  Pass, I can buy a lot of nasal spray for $36.\nReview Title: Cleared-Up Nasal Congestion But Only Temporarily\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Rancco Dried Flower Buds Fragrant Petals Ball, 10 Kinds Natural Organic Flowers Ball, Premium Grade Dried Blooming Flower Tea Balls for Tea, Baking or Bath Bombs\nReview Date: 2021/01/06\nStore: Rancco\nAverage Rating: 3.1\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Rancco', 'Scent': 'Honey, Rose, Lily', 'Material Feature': 'Vegan', 'Unit Count': '10.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '10', 'Package Dimensions': '9.49 x 6.26 x 1.1 inches; 3.88 Ounces'}\nReview Text: The pictures of these \"petal balls\" on the web page are bigger than the actual balls.

I usually pay about $5 for a bag of Epsom salt that's good for 4-5 baths.  That's about $1 per soak.  The Pursoma Digital Detox Bath Soak did about as much to relax me and relief pain as the Epsom salt and with the Epsom salt I don't have to shower to remove the \"mud\" and rinse out the mud/dirt from the tub after using it.  I suspect more of the relaxation comes from the hot water and length of time a person soaks as it does from any additive put in the water.  With the Epsom salt baths I can also add in a bath bomb for a couple bucks more and enjoy the aroma and moisturizing effects of the bomb.  I'll stick with my routine.\nReview Title: Not at $34 a pop\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Purple Shampoo and Conditioner Set - No, Orange, Yellow or Brassy Tones - Best Toner Treatment for Brassiness - Blonde, Grey, Bleached or Silver Hair - Sulfate Free\nReview Date: 2021/05/18\nStore: PURE NATURE LUX SPA\nAverage Rating: 4.0\nProduct Details: {'Product Benefits': 'Nourishing,Clean,Gentle', 'Material Type Free': 'Sulfate Free', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Brand': 'PURE NATURE LUX SPA', 'Hair Type': 'Color', 'Package Dimensions': '7.68 x 6.06 x 3.19 inches; 2.68 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'PURE NATURE LUX SPA', 'UPC': '765066671143'}\nReview Text: I got this shampoo and conditioner for my wife--here is her review: I wanted this shampoo and conditioner because it said it worked really well for gray and white hair--as a senior I have plenty of both--and because it got good reviews re fragrance and how soft it left hair. When I was in the shower and squirted some shampoo into my hand, I was amazed to see that the shampoo really is a dark purple color. I asked myself if I could live with it if it actually turned my hair purple, decided I could, and lathered up. The shampoo did an excellent job of creating a strong lather, and my hair felt really clean when I rinsed it out. The shampoo has a soft floral fragrance that is very pleasant. I took a quick look in the mirror to see if my hair was purple, and it wasn't, so I then squirted out some conditioner into my hand. It was purple, too, although thicker and lighter in color than the shampoo. As I rubbed the conditioner into my hair, the wonderful floral scent of the conditioner filled my shower--what a delightful sensory treat! I checked my hair again when I got out of the shower and dried off--still no purple hair, thank goodness. However, when I squirted some shampoo into my hand to take a photo, there was a big purple stain on my hand when I washed the shampoo off. I squirted the conditioner in a different spot on my hand for that photo, and it did the same thing. I've washed my hands several times since then, and the purple stains are still there. So...even though the product information online says it works fine with gray and white hair, I look down at my purple stains on my hand and I have to wonder. Since I love the smell of this shampoo and conditioner and how incredibly soft it leaves my hair, I'm going to continue using it. If it turns my hair purple at some point in the future, I'll do an update and give everyone fair warning.\nReview Title: Not Just a Name, The Shampoo and Conditioner Really Are Purple\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Orange Peel Nature's Cleanse Facial Scrub - by Visage Pure - USDA Organic - Physician Formulated - Research Supported - Natural Exfoliating, Refreshing, Brightening, Skin Tightening Vitamin C Scrub.

Directions say to mix it in a bowl or just mix it in your hand prior to use.  Well, I went with \"hand\" option.  The first time I got a thick paste that was pretty gritty, which I like, but it left my skin dried out but with a feeling that there was still some residue on it despite having rinsed quite well.  Second attempt produced a thinner mixture which was again gritty enough but still left me with the same results.<br />The surprising:  Although I didn't care for this product as a \"facial scrub\" it did have an interesting side effect: it lightened an age spot that's on me cheekbone area.  After the first use I noticed it but didn't really attribute it to the scrub.  After the second use if was more pronounced and I can't attribute it to anything other than the scrub.  While some may consider the lightening of age spots a good thing, I don't.  If I wanted to lighten anything I'd buy a product that claimed that ability.  The fact that it had that effect kind of tells me I don't want to use the product anymore.  Between the hassle of having to mix the scrub and the effects it had I'll not be using it again.  Some products I order but don't end up liking I'll give to other family members but not this one.

In the attached photo you can see the grit contained in the scrub.  The directions say to use a amount equal to a penny and my experience says that's enough to do a good job of exfoliating facial skin.  The scent to me seemed like a burnt avocado, not particularly pleasant but I'm not using it for the scent and the scent rinses off.  I deducted one-star for the price which seems a bit steep to me.  My regular scrub costs significantly less and exfoliates as well if not a bit better.

The online product information says the facial bars typically last 2-3 months with daily use. This is such a tiny, tiny little bar, I can't even remotely imagine it lasting as long as they claim. This little bar measures 2 1/4'\" x 1 1/4\" x 1/2\". It weighs 1.3 oz. The soap comes with a facial sponge that is 2 5/16\" in diameter. The soap lathers nicely and cleans my face well. The scent is very pleasant. I do not see myself reordering this little bitty bar of soap, however, when I can buy a full size natural, handmade bar online for the same price from quite a number of different sellers.***Update. I discovered the way to make the soap last as long as claimed is to apply it using the face sponge provided. It only takes a tiny swipe of the soap with the facial sponge to have enough lather to wash my whole face. After using a number of other facial cleaning products after I initially wrote this review, I switched back to this facial bar and realized that, using it with the facial sponge, it leaves my face feeling incredibly smooth and blemish free. I am happily upgrading this little bar to a 5 star. It may be small, but it does an amazing job!\nReview Title: Smells Nice, Cleans Well, but Very Tiny Bar--Update\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Mirror Flower Nail Clippers Set 2Pcs, No Splash Nail Clippers for Fingernail and Toenail, Medical Grade Stainless Steel, Sharp Stainless Steel Flat/Oblique Nail Clipper, Trimmer Set for Men and Women\nReview Date: 2021/06/04\nStore: Mirror Flower\nAverage Rating: 3.9\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '5.39 x 3.74 x 0.67 inches; 2.89 Ounces', 'UPC': '742703082661'}\nReview Text: This pair of nail clippers definitely have some heft to them compared to regular store-bought clippers. They are solid stainless steel, and built to last. The same colorful design is on the back of each, but the curved blade clippers are a bit darker green than the diagonal blade clippers, making it easy to quickly grab the one I want out of the bathroom drawer or my shaving kit. Boy, are these clippers sharp! I usually use a curved blade for trimming both fingernails and toenails. Where the diagonal blade comes in handy for me is when I have to go after a hangnail. This blade allows me to remove the hangnail with surgical precision. Trying to do the same thing with other blades usually results in part of the hangnail still being left behind to cause me a great deal of pain and aggravation later. This is a fantastic set of fingernail clippers, and well worth the current price of $8.99.\nReview Title: Impressively Sharp, Sturdy and Well Made\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

When I was in the shower and squirted some shampoo into my hand, I was amazed to see that the shampoo really is a dark purple color. I asked myself if I could live with it if it actually turned my hair purple, decided I could, and lathered up. The shampoo did an excellent job of creating a strong lather, and my hair felt really clean when I rinsed it out. The shampoo has a soft floral fragrance that is very pleasant. I took a quick look in the mirror to see if my hair was purple, and it wasn't, so I then squirted out some conditioner into my hand. It was purple, too, although thicker and lighter in color than the shampoo. As I rubbed the conditioner into my hair, the wonderful floral scent of the conditioner filled my shower--what a delightful sensory treat! I checked my hair again when I got out of the shower and dried off--still no purple hair, thank goodness. However, when I squirted some shampoo into my hand to take a photo, there was a big purple stain on my hand when I washed the shampoo off. I squirted the conditioner in a different spot on my hand for that photo, and it did the same thing. I've washed my hands several times since then, and the purple stains are still there. So...even though the product information online says it works fine with gray and white hair, I look down at my purple stains on my hand and I have to wonder. Since I love the smell of this shampoo and conditioner and how incredibly soft it leaves my hair, I'm going to continue using it. If it turns my hair purple at some point in the future, I'll do an update and give everyone fair warning.\nNot Just a Name, The Shampoo and Conditioner Really Are Purple\nOrange Peel Nature's Cleanse Facial Scrub - by Visage Pure - USDA Organic - Physician Formulated - Research Supported - Natural Exfoliating, Refreshing, Brightening, Skin Tightening Vitamin C Scrub.

Directions say to mix it in a bowl or just mix it in your hand prior to use.  Well, I went with \"hand\" option.  The first time I got a thick paste that was pretty gritty, which I like, but it left my skin dried out but with a feeling that there was still some residue on it despite having rinsed quite well.  Second attempt produced a thinner mixture which was again gritty enough but still left me with the same results.<br />The surprising:  Although I didn't care for this product as a \"facial scrub\" it did have an interesting side effect: it lightened an age spot that's on me cheekbone area.  After the first use I noticed it but didn't really attribute it to the scrub.  After the second use if was more pronounced and I can't attribute it to anything other than the scrub.  While some may consider the lightening of age spots a good thing, I don't.  If I wanted to lighten anything I'd buy a product that claimed that ability.  The fact that it had that effect kind of tells me I don't want to use the product anymore.  Between the hassle of having to mix the scrub and the effects it had I'll not be using it again.

The online product information says the facial bars typically last 2-3 months with daily use. This is such a tiny, tiny little bar, I can't even remotely imagine it lasting as long as they claim. This little bar measures 2 1/4'\" x 1 1/4\" x 1/2\". It weighs 1.3 oz. The soap comes with a facial sponge that is 2 5/16\" in diameter. The soap lathers nicely and cleans my face well. The scent is very pleasant. I do not see myself reordering this little bitty bar of soap, however, when I can buy a full size natural, handmade bar online for the same price from quite a number of different sellers.***Update. I discovered the way to make the soap last as long as claimed is to apply it using the face sponge provided. It only takes a tiny swipe of the soap with the facial sponge to have enough lather to wash my whole face. After using a number of other facial cleaning products after I initially wrote this review, I switched back to this facial bar and realized that, using it with the facial sponge, it leaves my face feeling incredibly smooth and blemish free. I am happily upgrading this little bar to a 5 star. It may be small, but it does an amazing job!\nSmells Nice, Cleans Well, but Very Tiny Bar--Update\nMirror Flower Nail Clippers Set 2Pcs, No Splash Nail Clippers for Fingernail and Toenail, Medical Grade Stainless Steel, Sharp Stainless Steel Flat/Oblique Nail Clipper, Trimmer Set for Men and Women\nMirror Flower\n{'Package Dimensions': '5.39 x 3.74 x 0.67 inches; 2.89 Ounces', 'UPC': '742703082661'}\nThis pair of nail clippers definitely have some heft to them compared to regular store-bought clippers. They are solid stainless steel, and built to last. The same colorful design is on the back of each, but the curved blade clippers are a bit darker green than the diagonal blade clippers, making it easy to quickly grab the one I want out of the bathroom drawer or my shaving kit. Boy, are these clippers sharp! I usually use a curved blade for trimming both fingernails and toenails. Where the diagonal blade comes in handy for me is when I have to go after a hangnail. This blade allows me to remove the hangnail with surgical precision. Trying to do the same thing with other blades usually results in part of the hangnail still being left behind to cause me a great deal of pain and aggravation later. This is a fantastic set of fingernail clippers, and well worth the current price of $8.99.\nImpressively Sharp, Sturdy and Well Made",

The brush works great for me.  The bristles are relatively soft and flexible so it doesn't feel like I'm trying to tear my scalp off. Comb is too stiff but I can see where someone else might like it.  Now the fun part.  I didn't know what that little metal-tined thing (photo 2) was for.  I figured it was a mustache comb and I have a mustache so I gave it a try.  Worked great!  The little tines penetrated the mustache hairs and felt great on the underlying skin.  Kinda like an exfoliater!  I loved it.  Couldn't find a description of it on the product's page so I reviewed a couple of similar products and discovered that it's actually for cleaning the brush.  Not for me - I'm using it on my mustache.  Nice product and seems to be high quality.

The ones I've used so far colored the bath water.  Not a problem as it didn't cause any \"rings\" on the tub and I came out with skin the same color as when I went in, minus some dirt.

The case looks good and is secured by a snap connector.  There are individual slide-in holders for each pair of tweezers and the scissors.  There isn't a slot for the brush but I just put it in with one of the tweezers.  The quality of the tweezers is outstanding.  They appear to be very well machined and they passed my \"grab a hair\" test.  What I do is try to grad a single fine hair off of my arm.  If the tweezers get it in one try and can hold on to it to pull it out, they pass.  Each pair of tweezers passed the test.  Another thing I like is that this set doesn't have a bunch of needless junk in it that just takes up room.  This set can fit in my shaving kit without taking up extra space.

Hate to say it but nasal sprays have been the one and only thing that tends to relieve the congestion.  Usually once a day before bedtime.  Ordered this product to give it a shot.  I followed the instructions and added the product (actually two products) to a hot bath and hopped in.  Sat soaking for about 15 minutes with no relief.  Then I put a muslin washcloth over my face and started pouring hot bath water over it.  After about five minutes of deep breathing (in through the nose, out through the mouth) the nasal congestion started breaking up somewhat.  Didn't completely break up but got better.  Drained the tub (tons of sandy debris left) and took a hot shower to rinse the clay, etc, off.  That's when the congestion broke loose.  I was able to blow my nose and breath through my nose with very little to no congestion.  Unfortunately the relief didn't last all that long, probably about three hours.  At 36 bucks a pop, that's 12 dollars per hour for three hours relief.  Pass, I can buy a lot of nasal spray for $36.\nReview Title: Cleared-Up Nasal Congestion But Only Temporarily\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Rancco Dried Flower Buds Fragrant Petals Ball, 10 Kinds Natural Organic Flowers Ball, Premium Grade Dried Blooming Flower Tea Balls for Tea, Baking or Bath Bombs\nReview Date: 2021/01/06\nStore: Rancco\nAverage Rating: 3.1\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Rancco', 'Scent': 'Honey, Rose, Lily', 'Material Feature': 'Vegan', 'Unit Count': '10.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '10', 'Package Dimensions': '9.49 x 6.26 x 1.1 inches; 3.88 Ounces'}\nReview Text: The pictures of these \"petal balls\" on the web page are bigger than the actual balls.

It was kind of fun to watch it re-hydrate but that was about the end of the enjoyment.  The \"fragrance\" given off by these petal balls was akin to a weak tea although I surely wouldn't drink it.  As for putting one in a tub, I suspect the \"bloom\" would clog up the drain and just create a mess.  Plus I don't want to take a bath in a pot of tea.

    "text": "I never in my life would have thought I'd consider an air freshener as a giftable item, except perhaps as a gag gift to one of my brothers. This Florona Hibiscus Air Freshener, however, is in a class all by itself. Even the box it comes in is beautiful, with soft sweeping white and beige brush strokes in the background and beautiful flowers embossed in gold. The pattern wraps all the way around the box, with each side being different. The inside of the box is a vivid lime green. The spray bottle for the air freshener looks more like a perfume bottle, light and dark pink with more of the gold embossing, this time with leaves instead of flowers. The key ingredients of this air freshener are water, hibiscus oil, and hydrogenated castor oil. The bottle contains 3.38 fl oz (100 ml). The directions say to wash linens and clothes before spraying this linen mist on them. It says this spray can be used on sheets, furniture fabric, drapes, pillows, and directly in the room as an air freshener. It also says to shake the bottle well before using it. When sprayed, the hibiscus scent is very subtle and faint, but definitely there. My wife had me spray some on the blouse she was wearing so that she could enjoy the hibiscus scent all day long, and she plans to spray her pillow before she goes to sleep. For a soft, gentle hibiscus aroma that stays pleasantly in the background without overwhelming my senses, this Florona Hibiscus Air Freshener works well.",
