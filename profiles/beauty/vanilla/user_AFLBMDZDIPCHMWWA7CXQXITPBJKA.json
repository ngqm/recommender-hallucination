This one is a medium weight oil that initially smells very lightly scented. It's a very \"cologne\" type scent which I really don't care for. I am more into the woodsy, tea tree, sandalwood type scents. At first smell, this beard oil had a very light scent however once applied, this scent lasts a very long time. This is where I had a hard time with it. I like to put my beard oil on in the morning and night after brushing my teeth and I was still able to smell this beard oil into the next morning, which might have been a good thing had I enjoyed the scent. The beard oil itself as I said earlier, is a medium weight, and has a decent hold and is actually a nice overall beard oil but I ended up giving it to my son, as I personally didn't like the scent at all.\nReview Title: Nice quality but the cologne scent is not my favorite.\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Boar Bristle Hair Brush with Nylon Pins for Thick Curly Long Wet Hair - Anti Static Brush Oval - Wooden Paddle\nReview Date: 2020/02/19\nStore: Willkem accessories\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Willkem accessories', 'Shape': 'Oval', 'Handle Material': 'Wood', 'Special Feature': 'Ionic', 'Product Benefits': 'Detangle', 'Product Dimensions': '8.86 x 2.36 x 1.46 inches; 2.82 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Willkem'}\nReview Text: I ordered a \u2018Boar Bristle Hair Brush with Nylon Pins for Thick Curly Long Wet Hair - Anti Static Brush Oval - Wooden Paddle\u2019 for review.

When she brushed through her hair, she felt it reduced the static and made her hair feel softer.  So much so that my wife never got the chance to use as my daughter claimed it as hers.  The brush handle is made with a thick, durable feeling wood.  The bristles are much more durable and pull through the hair better than those with plastic or silicone bristles.
