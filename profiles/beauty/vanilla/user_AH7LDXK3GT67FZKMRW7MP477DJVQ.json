I\u2019m comparing it to others I have owned. The last one I had did not last long- this appears to be better made and it just looks nicer overall. The water well holds a fair amount of water however I would like it to hold a bit more. It has many levels of power for the water to spray out. The low is very weak and the high is pretty darn strong and could be painful if you aren\u2019t careful. There are plenty of adjustments in between so you will find one that suits your mouth just right. It also has a \u201cmassage \u201c button which basically cuts down the strength of the jet and makes it pulse to massage your gums. I find it a bit too soft of my gums , even on the highest level.  This product does a great job in cleaning between your teeth and below gum line. I hate to floss so this is a great option to keep my teeth clean and well cared for. If your house is Not new and only has one plug in your bathroom, you will appreciate the long cords- both the electrical and the water hose. One thing I like about this water flosser  is that it does NOT leak like my other one did. This keeps my counter neat. This is a good product to add to your daily dental hygiene regimen . It is easy and does a great job cleaning .<br />* If you found this review helpful please click the button below to let Amazon know.

I would have liked the kit to come with more heads,  it comes with two, one to use and one replacement . I really like the aloe strip that surrounds the 5 blades , most of my other razors it\u2019s just on one side. The razor cuts close and is comfortable to use.

I\u2019m comparing it to others I have owned. The last one I had did not last long- this appears to be better made and it just looks nicer overall. The water well holds a fair amount of water however I would like it to hold a bit more. It has many levels of power for the water to spray out. The low is very weak and the high is pretty darn strong and could be painful if you aren\u2019t careful. There are plenty of adjustments in between so you will find one that suits your mouth just right. It also has a \u201cmassage \u201c button which basically cuts down the strength of the jet and makes it pulse to massage your gums. I find it a bit too soft of my gums , even on the highest level.  This product does a great job in cleaning between your teeth and below gum line. I hate to floss so this is a great option to keep my teeth clean and well cared for. If your house is Not new and only has one plug in your bathroom, you will appreciate the long cords- both the electrical and the water hose. One thing I like about this water flosser  is that it does NOT leak like my other one did. This keeps my counter neat. This is a good product to add to your daily dental hygiene regimen . It is easy and does a great job cleaning .<br />* If you found this review helpful please click the button below to let Amazon know.
