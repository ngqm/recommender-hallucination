Baking soda, coconut oil, shea butter, and vitamin E are included along with some natural essential oils that add a pleasant aroma. This company offers different scent options - this one is rather flowery, with scents like ylang ylang and gardenia. This is certainly somewhat expensive for a deodorant but it is worth paying extra to get something natural with organic ingredients that won't irritate your skin or harm your health. Unlike some products that just spray on scents this item uses baking soda to help absorb odors too.

The brushes have points with silicone tips so you can safely stimulate your scalp as you wash your head and hair. They feel OK, though not as good as manually massaging your scalp since the brush doesn't have the dexterity of fingers. These are nice to have although I don't expect to rely on them too much. For what is included in this package it seems reasonably priced.\nReview Title: Silicone tipped scalp massage brushes along with shower hair cap\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: AUGNORYE 13 Pcs Hair Cutting Scissors Kit, Professional Hair Barber Scissors Kit with Thinning Shears, Home Hair Shears for Women, Men, Kids\nReview Date: 2020/08/15\nStore: AUGNORYE\nAverage Rating: 3.9\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'AUGNORYE', 'Included Components': 'Scissors', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Blade Material': 'Stainless Steel'}\nReview Text: This barber kit includes scissors, combs, and other items used by barbers. This all fits in a carry bag and would be fine for any amateur or professional hair stylist.

The bottles are wrapped with bubble wrap so they don't crack during transit. The labels are a black color suitable for writing on with liquid chalk markers - so you would need that type of marker, which isn't included with the labels here. These bottles function as intended and are useful if you wish to avoid plastic.\nReview Title: Amber glass bottles with spray tops and labels\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Pretty Frank Natural Deodorant Jar- No Aluminum Deodorant for Women, Men, Teens, & Kids \u2013 Paraben Sulfate Free Cream Deodorant with Shea Butter, Coconut Oil, Vitamin E & Baking Soda (Jasmine)\nReview Date: 2020/09/01\nStore: PRETTY FRANK\nAverage Rating: 4.3\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'PRETTY FRANK', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Scent': 'Jasmine, Coconut', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '3.42 x 2.79 x 2.59 inches; 5.61 Ounces'}\nReview Text: This deodorant comes in a glass jar and is made with simple, natural ingredients that are good for your skin and provide pleasant aromas. Baking soda, coconut oil, shea butter, and vitamin E are included along with some natural essential oils that add a pleasant aroma. This company offers different scent options - this one is rather flowery, with scents like ylang ylang and gardenia. This is certainly somewhat expensive for a deodorant but it is worth paying extra to get something natural with organic ingredients that won't irritate your skin or harm your health. Unlike some products that just spray on scents this item uses baking soda to help absorb odors too. This is something I would definitely suggest if you want a natural deodorant and don't mind applying something that is in a jar rather than a roll-on or spray container.\nReview Title: Great natural deodorant with baking soda and essential oils\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Glass spray bottle-16 ounce empty bottle ounce refillable container 2 packs, suitable for essential oils, cleaning products, aromatherapy, water mist plants with mist and air flow settings\nReview Date: 2020/09/17\nStore: DS DOODLE SABBATH\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'DS DOODLE SABBATH', 'Capacity': '16 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '2.76 x 2.76 x 8.27 inches', 'Special Feature': 'Adjustable Nozzle', 'Product Dimensions': '2.76 x 2.76 x 8.27 inches; 1.4 Pounds', 'UPC': '619011520959'}\nReview Text: This box comes with 2 blue glass spray bottles that hold 16 fluid ounces each. The spray tops have an option to adjust the type of spray and you can also use a regular bottle top on these. This includes label stickers and plastic funnels so you can pour in what you wish to and label the contents with a liquid chalk marker.

This is just like a jade roller set but with obsidian stones. Obsidian is a stone that is good for grounding, protection, and enhancing circulation, and it functions well for facial massage. This comes in an attractive dark colored gift box and is reasonably priced for this type of set.\nReview Title: Cool obsidian stone facial massage roller with gua sha stone\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Argan Magic 100% Pure Argan Oil \u2013 Moisturizing Oil that Infuses Skin with Enriched Hydration | Leaves Skin Restored & Refreshed | Non-Greasy | Rich in Vitamin E | Made in USA | Cruelty Free (2 oz)\nReview Date: 2020/09/29\nStore: Argan Magic\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Argan Magic', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Active Ingredients': 'Vitamin e', 'Unit Count': '2 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.2 x 1.1 x 1.1 inches; 2 Ounces', 'UPC': '605923474046'}\nReview Text: This is a 2 ounce bottle of argan oil that is commonly used for body care, either by itself or in combination with other ingredients. The bottle top is OK for dispensing the oil though it would have been better to have a special dropper top.
