    "text": "Overall, I would definitely not recommend this product until major changes have been made. There's definitely a market segment where there is a dire need for a product that can clean pet feet after a wet and dirty walk outside. I have two dogs and live in an area that is muddy and rainy all the time which results in super dirty patios and walkways when we get in the house. When I first saw this product i was actually very interested in first but upon using I was disappointed. The spin speed is in no way strong enough to get rid of dirt and gunk buildup between the dogs feet and just using the dog paw washer is incredibly messy with water spilling out all over the place. Honestly, after trying my best to use this product a few times i'd rather just carry my dogs into the bath tub and cleaning their paws myself.",
