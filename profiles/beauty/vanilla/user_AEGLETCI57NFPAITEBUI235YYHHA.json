For one, like others have said, it is larger than it appears. It is kind of hard to get into my mouth and biting it is not really ergonomic. I followed the directions in the description and boiled it so that when I bit down, the clear bits became an impression of my teeth. However, I did not find that to be much help later on. I used this a couple of times and while I did find my jaw feeling sore afterwards, I do not feel comfortable using it for the long term. My jaw is not in good alignment (something I need surgery for but can't afford) so I got this with hopes that it could help support my jaw and keep it from getting worse. I also have a hard time with jaw discomfort from teeth grinding and my dentist said that exercises can help alleviate that issue. Due to the large size and ill-fit, I fear that it could do more damage to my jaw and bite than help. I think overall this is a lost cause for me but maybe someone else will have better luck.\nReview Title: Not really a fan\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

    "text": "I have oily/combo skin and I am always on the hunt for some good powders. This powder is super finely milled, very soft, and great at setting my face makeup without making it more cakey. Bonus, there is no fragrance whatsoever (you would be surprised how many powders I have come across with a scent). However, this does not extend the longevity of my makeup wear. It did not hold back my oily complexion and it while it did make my skin look soft at the beginning of the day, by the end my skin looked a little more textured than it already does. So, I think for me, this powder is a no-go but someone else may have better luck with it.",
