The elastics are sturdy. The elastic stayed put in his hair for 24 hours through work and sleep.<br />This product comes with a lot of hair bands! It comes with a convenient and cute little pouch to store the bands in. The pouch has a bird on a floaty and says \u201cI can\u2019t swim\u201d\nReview Title: Nice sturdy elastics in fun colors\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: LAPCOS Good Morning Fresh Quick Masks (30 Count) Daily Sheet Masks for Beauty & Skin Care - Hydrating and Moisturizing Korean Face Mask with Witch Hazel, Aloe Vera & Cucumber\nReview Date: 2020/07/31\nStore: LAPCOS\nAverage Rating: 4.3\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'LAPCOS', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Moisturizing', 'Scent': 'Cucumber', 'Skin Type': 'Normal', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5 x 4 x 3 inches; 1 Pounds', 'UPC': '818929024478'}\nReview Text: Did you skip your skin case routine before bed? Did you then proceed to wake up too late to do it in the morning? Look no further for your solution!<br />I really enjoy these quick morning masks. Sometimes my face needs refreshing before I put my makeup on in the morning, but I rarely wake up early enough to wait for a 15-20 min mask to set in. This mask is perfect, because you only need 5 minutes. I put mine on and I make my coffee and feed my cats. By the time I\u2019m done with that, it\u2019s about time to take off the mask and start getting ready.<br />The mask moisturized and refreshed my skin. My face felt ready to put my makeup on. It didn\u2019t make my face too oily for my makeup or anything. My makeup set in nicely.<br />The packaging is nice. It is similar to a tissue box. There are little tweezers to help you grab out a mask.<br />I have tried some other types of masks from this brand, and this is my favorite I have tried from Lapcos. I would use this product again.\nReview Title: Quick morning mask!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Caudalie Vinosource SOS Intense Hydration Set: Hydrating Trio for Sensitive Skin including a Daily Foam Cleanser, Hydrating Serum, Facial Moisturizer\nReview Date: 2020/11/23\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '6.93 x 5.35 x 2.64 inches; 14.5 Ounces'}\nReview Text: Perfect gift for your skin-care loving friend!<br />I have loved this skin care set. I have been using all 3 products almost every day for the past 3 weeks. The gift/value set comes with a instant-foaming face wash, serum, and face moisturizer. This is my first time trying this brand, and I am very impressed.<br /><br />The instant-foaming face wash:<br />I have never tried an instant-foaming wash before. It still produced a nice lather on my face. It is great for a daily moisturizer, but I still like to use an exfoliant every few days.<br /><br />The serum:<br />The serum had a more creamy texture. It soaked into my skin quick. It created a nice based for the moisturizer.<br /><br />The moisturizer:<br />The moisturizer was thick and creamy. I have VERY dry skin, and my skin soaked it right up. It felt really nice on my skin. My skin stayed moisturized throughout the day after using in the morning.<br /><br />None of the products irritated my skin. I have dry skin with some rosacea. All products had a similar light floral scent. The sizes are great. I still have plenty of product after using a few weeks.<br /><br />I recommend this set! The packaging is nice and aesthetically pleasing. It is readily giftable.\nReview Title: Perfect gift for skin-care lovers!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: COSMOCOS FromNature Perfect Cover BB Cream - Light Beighe/Natural Beige SPF 50+ / PA+++ Sun Protection, Natural Skin Tone, High Coverage Korean Cosmetic K Beauty - 50g (1.76 fl oz) (Natural Beige)\nReview Date: 2020/12/18\nStore: COSMOCOS\nAverage Rating: 3.8\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'COSMOCOS', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '1.72 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Use for': 'Skin', 'Product Dimensions': '6 x 1.5 x 1 inches; 2.89 Ounces', 'UPC': '364597179557'}\nReview Text: Overall, I do really like this BB cream. Here are my pros and cons.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-The BB cream is moisturizing. I have super dry skin, and it felt replenishing.<br />-This cream provided great coverage despite it being a thinner consistency.<br />-I put it on my face to even skin tone on \u201cno make up days\u201d and I also use it with my normal make up routine.<br />-The price is very fair for the quality.<br />-This cream has high SPF, so it is perfect for summer days. Sun screen is an important part of skin care routine, so it is nice to have the BB cream and sun screen combined.<br /><br />CONS<br />-This BB cream might be too dewy for oily skin. It is perfect for dry skin though.<br />-This made my fine lines stand out more if I didn\u2019t blend it in super well.<br /><br />There are more pros than cons to this BB cream. I would order it again.\nReview Title: Nice BB cream!\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
