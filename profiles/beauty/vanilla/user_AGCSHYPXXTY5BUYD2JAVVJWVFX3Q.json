The flaw is the spinning sprayer that allowed my expensive orange cleaner to pour out of the top all around the nozzle.  cheaply made  but all in all a good glass bottle with a terrible srayer . If you just need a bottle with a screw top your good. If you have a different sprayer you can take off a plastic bottle great. Thats what I did.

It burned<br />around the sides of my nose down by my mouth and after a couple of days made scabby tissue ,it was pretty raw. I guess I have sensitive skin.  I can use it but will avoid this super tender area. It worked to lighten the top of the nose blackheads. I definitely think 2 times a week is the max for using to avoid my issue.",
