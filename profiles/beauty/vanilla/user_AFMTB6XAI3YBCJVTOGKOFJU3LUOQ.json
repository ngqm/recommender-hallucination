(3-Pack)\nReview Date: 2014/07/13\nAverage Rating: 3.6\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '8.4 x 4.9 x 2.9 inches; 14.46 Ounces', 'UPC': '741655221609'}\nReview Text: We have strayed from a national name brand of sauer kraut and was that a  big mistake. The store brand was one that almost everyone set aside on their plate and did not eat. We went back to a  name brand and that was Del Monte. The kraut we think is the best on the market. We do nto like that other kinds of kraut such as Bavarian. We want the real stuff, at least to us it is the real stuff. Did you know the whole  14.5 oz can only has 10 calories in it and zero fat. Even for carbs there is only 1g. Now this is where we definitely go wrong as we serve it with smoked sausage, which we know is totally off the chart. Don't do this often---just occasionally. The meal is delicious. I do have a note fro Del Monte. Remember when your cans contained 16 oz of kraut, then you cut back and now it's 14.5 oz. Please quit doing this to us!.Do you realize, and I am sure you do, that I now have about 10% LESS to serve to my family.\nReview Title: Some Of The Best Sauer Kraut There Is !\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Spa Grade Jade Roller for Face with Gua Sha | Jade Face Roller Massager | Jade Facial Roller | Face Roller Massager | Jade Rollers | Wrinkle Roller\nReview Date: 2018/12/14\nStore: Jane Cosmetics\nAverage Rating: 4.3\nProduct Details: {'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.1 x 3.4 x 1.2 inches; 4.8 Ounces', 'UPC': '814689026516', 'Manufacturer': 'Jane & Co.'}\nReview Text: This Jade face roller and Jade Gua Sha tool comes packaged nicely.

All the bottles are the same 8 oz size.  I like the spray handles.  They fit in my hand and are easy to spray.  The sprayer can be set 3 ways.... OFF,  STREAM,  and MIST.  I am currently using the mist on my plants.  The liquid comes out evenly and does not drip out of the nozzle.  The pick up hose inside the bottle goes all the way to the bottom so you get all the liquid.  These are 3 good spray bottles and well worth the price.\nReview Title: Good size plastic spray bottles\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Spray Bottle,Fine Mist Mini Clear50ml/2oz Spray Bottles,Small Reusable Empty Plastic Bottles with Atomizer Pumps (25 pack,2 Funnels included)\nReview Date: 2020/11/02\nStore: Woaiwo-q\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Woaiwo-q', 'Material': 'Polypropylene', 'Capacity': '50 Milliliters, 60 Milliliters', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Special Feature': 'Mist Spray'}\nReview Text: These are nice small, short plastic bottles.

This organizer reminds me of the inexpensive makeup box I use to buy my girls when they were 6 years old.  I expected a lot more from this organizer considering it cost almost $55.  This is a plastic organizer.  The organizer has some scuff marks on the body and then a couple on the clear top lid.  I am disappointed with this organizer especially at this price point.\nReview Title: Not Impressed\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Spray Bottle, 1.7oz / 50ml Transparent Empty Fine Mist Plastic Reusable Travel Bottle Set, With 4 Funnels And 6 Labels, Suitable For Perfume, Essential Oil Spray, Medical Alcohol, Etc.

    "text": "Both my girls have longer hair and like to get it off their neck during the hot summer months.  My girls have been using these clips for a week and so far, so good.  There are 8 hair clips in this package so they each took 4 clips.  There are 2 styles.  One style is curved teeth clips while the other is more a rectangle with teeth.  The girls have tried both styles and they say both work well.  Only time will tell us if these clips will last but at under $10 for 8 clips who cares.  Both girls are happy with the style, colors and cost.",
