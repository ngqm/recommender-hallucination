I was so surprised when I took these out of the package. They are very sturdy and look amazing. I wasn't expecting them to be as heavy as they were, but they really are pieces of art. There were a few loose hairs, but once those fell out (as most brushes do), they worked great. The carrying case they came with was also very cute. These are perfect for any Harry Potter fan. I am still so happy with how great these are.\nReview Title: Quality!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Maya Mari Hydrating Argan Oil Shampoo \u2013 Rich in Nutrients, Restores Moisture & Shine, 32 oz\nReview Date: 2020/09/10\nStore: MAYA MARI\nAverage Rating: 4.3\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'MAYA MARI', 'Hair Type': 'Damaged,Curly Hair', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material Type Free': 'Paraben Free', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating', 'Product Dimensions': '3.25 x 3.25 x 10 inches; 1.94 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'MMAROILSP', 'UPC': '850004068267'}\nReview Text: I love the pump that this shampoo comes with. It's great to easily add the product to your hand while showering. This is also a nice big size for the price.<br /><br />The shampoo is a bit watery, but it does lather very nicely and my hair feels smooth and silky after using it. I feel like I can use this everyday without drying out my hair. The shampoo smells really nice and I love the scent - it's not too strong. I had to use maybe two pumps to fully cover my hair while showering.\nReview Title: Love the pump\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Butterfly Nail Art Decals Water Transfer Stickers, 22 Sheets Butterfly Nail Sticker DIY Nail Decals, 2 Set Butterfly Nail Glitter Holographic Stickers Reflected Butterfly Designs for Nails Supply\nReview Date: 2020/10/24\nStore: B bangcool\nAverage Rating: 4.6\nProduct Details: {'Surface Recommendation nail': '', '': 'Unit Count 1.00 Count', 'Shape Irregular': '', 'Brand': 'B bangcool', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '6.3 x 3.54 x 1.57 inches', 'Theme': 'Butterfly', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Reusability': 'Single Use', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Pattern': 'Insects', 'Product Dimensions': '6.3 x 3.54 x 1.57 inches; 5.61 Ounces'}\nReview Text: Overall these stickers are very cute, and they stick on the nail easily. I feel like some of the stickers are very blurry, and it's hard to see what exactly the details are, which is a bit disappointing.

The pump is easy to use and my skin feels great after using it. There is also a lot of product in this, so I will be getting a lot of use out of it.<br /><br />This came arrived and the safety cap was cracked, so it leaked out of the top and was a bit of a mess to clean up.

The smell isn't too overwhelming, and honestly I could use a bit more smell. It foams up really well, and glides on the skin. You can use not a lot and still cover your entire body. It washes off nicely, and you don't really smell it afterward. I have been using this for about a week and the container hasn't rusted or anything either, which is something that tends to happen with products in a metal container. I wish there was a way to know how much was left, so I know when to get a new one, but overall I am happy with this body wash.\nReview Title: Smells Great, Good Foaming\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: invisibobble Sprunchie Spiral Hair Ring - True Black - Scrunchie Stylish Bracelet, Strong Elastic Grip Coil Accessories for Women - Gentle for Girls Teens and Thick Hair\nReview Date: 2020/12/14\nStore: invisibobble\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Item Form': 'Scrunchie', 'Brand': 'invisibobble', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Item Weight': '2 Grams', 'Number of Pieces': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '2.83 x 2.8 x 0.87 inches; 0.07 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'IB-SP-HP10001'}\nReview Text: I am really impressed with this scrunchie. I have tried to use the invisibobble before, but I have very curly hair and my hair would always get caught in them, even if it did hold my hair up all day. I was so excited to give this a try. It is my new favorite hair accessory. The velvet is very smooth and it grips onto my hair all day. When I take it down, I don't have a very noticeable crease, and it also doesn't tear my hair out. I wish I had 100 of these in every color, I'm now a fan!\nReview Title: LOVE THIS\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Biutee Nail Stamping Plates 5pcs Templates With Stamper Scraper Set Nail Art Plates set animal flower Christmas halloween design\nReview Date: 2020/12/27\nStore: Biutee\nAverage Rating: 3.9\nProduct Details: {'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.42 x 5.75 x 1.18 inches; 5.47 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'TOOL-AT-755', 'Manufacturer': 'Biutee'}\nReview Text: I have tried and tried again for this to work, but I cannot for the life of me figure out how to use this. I have watched videos, tutorials, and spent hours trying these plates to get something, but I can't figure it out. I used different types of nail polishes, waited different amounts of times, and even used a stamper from another set (that also doesn't work) and the nail polish does not go onto the stamper. I feel like I see a lot of videos online of these working, but this is my second set and my second try, and it still does not work for me.\nReview Title: Did not work\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Soo'AE Sweet Pink Bubble Mask, Clarifying & Softening, 1 Count\nReview Date: 2021/01/17\nStore: SOOAE\nAverage Rating: 3.6\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'SOOAE', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Product Benefits': 'Softening,Softer', 'Scent': 'Peach', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Product Dimensions': '3.5 x 0.1 x 5.5 inches; 0.32 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I was expecting some larger bubbles than this mask gave me. I kept it on a bit longer than the recommended 3 minutes to see if the bubbles would get any larger, but they didn't. I think it worked well, but I think that the gimmick isn't worth what you get. My face felt pretty good afterward, but it wasn't anything special.

It's a great size, and heats up the water very quickly. I also like the tools that this comes with. I feel like the headband is a touch too small for my head, but it is very cute. After using it, my skin felt hydrated, and it really opened up my pores. The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I wish the cord was a bit longer and thinner. I have to use an extension cord to use it at my makeup desk.\nReview Title: Obsessed\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Avajar Aqua A-Solution Mask 10 Pack - Hydrating Face Masks for Women and Men| Moisturizing Face Mask | Collagen Face Sheet Masks Set | Korean Face Mask Sheets Pack\nReview Date: 2021/03/03\nStore: a DAILY SELF-CARE COSMETICS avajar\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'a DAILY SELF-CARE COSMETICS avajar', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Product Benefits': 'Moisturizing', 'Scent': 'Hydrating', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Product Dimensions': '5.28 x 1.57 x 6.89 inches; 11.99 Ounces'}\nReview Text: This mask was easy to open and place on my face. The mask also did not slide while on my face. There weren't a lot of flaps that are hard to manage. My skin felt moisturized after using these, and my skin looked very hydrated.

My boyfriend uses this in his very straight hair and he has no issues. It holds his hair, doesn't leave a bump, and he likes how they look overall.

I had to use a translating app to figure out what each pouch was.<br /><br />The first time I used this product, I used it wrong because I used step 3 first, but that was because there is a big \"step 3\" on the front of the pouch. My skin felt good after using it the right way, but it's just confusing packaging. The face mask was very difficult to unwrap, which is very frustrating when you are trying to relax with some self care. I don't think I would get these again, but I will use up the rest of the masks that I have.\nReview Title: A little much\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Scrunchie Holder Stands with 8 Pack Large Size Scrunchies - Acrylic Hair Ties Organizer for Teenage Girls and VSCO Girls Gift Stuff\nReview Date: 2021/05/02\nStore: Beeager\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Color': 'Yellow,Gray,White', 'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Item Form': 'Scrunchie', 'Brand': 'Beeager', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Package Dimensions': '10.55 x 3.98 x 3.7 inches; 10.86 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I was really happy with the performance of this scrunchie stand.
