Strong!!! As soon as I tore open the packet ... bam. That smell hit me.<br /><br />The actual pads come out of the packet folded in half, have a pinkish color & they seem to be made out of felt or a felt like fabric.<br /><br />I decided to use one to take off my bright Red toenail polish. The first 2 nails came clean but then I started to notice that the remover pad was smearing the polish all over my toes & leaving finger nail polish color on my fingers.<br /><br />Overall, the pads do work but you're probably going to have to use at least 2 at a time. That means only 5 nail polish removals per box & for the price listed, I find them highly overpriced.<br /><br />Excuse my swollen foot picture, I'm trying to show how using just 1 nail polish remover pad left my toenail/toe area with a pinkish red hue.\nReview Title: Just Okay \ud83d\udc85\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Bouquet Garni Body Shower White Musk - Unique Fragrance Decanting Engineering Method gives Long Lasting Rich Fragrance - Gentle and Mild Cleansing Scented Body Wash with Natural Surfactant 17.85 Fl Oz\nReview Date: 2020/10/20\nStore: Bouquet Garni\nAverage Rating: 4.0\nProduct Details: {'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Skin Type': 'All, Dry', 'Brand': 'Bouquet Garni', 'Scent': 'Garni', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '8.23 x 6.34 x 3.66 inches; 1.34 Pounds'}\nReview Text: I was so excited to try this \"Bouquet Garni Body / Shower Wash\".<br /><br />The presentation is so nice & makes the product seem so high end.<br /><br />The body wash arrives in its own logo cardboard box.

The bristles don't fall out when you are using them either.<br /><br />The two brushes that have the least amount of bristles are my favorites. They are like ultra fine & are great for painting designs like stripes, lines & even little dots on your fingernails.<br /><br />The only downside to these brushes was after about 3 uses the bristles all curved to one side, like a C shape. That kind of sucked.<br /><br />The other 3 brushes with more bristles are still in good, like new shape.\nReview Title: Not A Bad Set Of Brushes \ud83d\udc85\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: New Road Health Supply - No Rinse Bathing Wipes for Adults, Disposable Shower Wipes, Adult Wipes for Elderly and Bedridden, pH Balanced and Hypoallergenic, 12 Count Pack of 3\nReview Date: 2022/05/14\nStore: Revive Rinse-Free\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Revive Rinse-Free', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Material Feature': 'Disposable', 'Unit Count': '12.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '3', 'Package Dimensions': '11.5 x 5.31 x 1.81 inches; 1.17 Pounds', 'UPC': '850030075147', 'Manufacturer': 'Revive Rinse-Free'}\nReview Text: I received 3 packs of \"Revive Rinse Free Bathing Wipes\". Each pack contains 12 wipes.<br /><br />I wanted to try these wipes because I thought they could be a better option for me than regular baby wipes for my period accident clean ups & they are pretty nice (not perfect).<br /><br />I have heavy extended length menstrual periods and have always used regular baby wipes for any messy / accident clean ups. That way I can just throw them away after I'm done with them.<br /><br />These bathing wipes are way larger than a typical baby wipe. They are white in color and have a light perfume type of scent (which is probably the Chamomile Extract).<br /><br />They can be microwaved (for no more than 15 seconds according to the pack) if you wanted them warm but I just used them \"as is\" right out of the packs.<br /><br />They are wet enough to get the job done but not dripping wet (leaking) everywhere. They are also a nice thickness and soft to the touch.<br /><br />They didn't irritate my sensitive skin at all. They also aren't soapy at all, they left my skin feeling okay (clean) maybe a little bit sticky but nothing that I couldn't tolerate.<br /><br />I do like these wipes overall because they are large in size and affordable.\nReview Title: They Are Not Bad \ud83d\udc69\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

    "text": "I received one pack of \"Disposable Face Towels\".<br /><br />I use facial towels like this daily for my facial care routine. I find it easier to just use one facial towel each time for washing & then rinsing my face (so the same facial towels gets rinsed out multiple times under running water). That's compared to the alternative of using a new clean wash cloth every single time multiple times a day.<br /><br />These facial towels are White in color & have a circle / dot type of pattern. They are also a decent size, big enough to cover my palm & I found them easy to hold / work with. They have no scent.<br /><br />They seem to hold up fairly well even when using them with facial products that contain alcohol or other stronger types of ingredients.",
