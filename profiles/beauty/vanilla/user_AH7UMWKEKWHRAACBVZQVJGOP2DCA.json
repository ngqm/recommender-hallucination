After you shampoo your beard you basically strip it of oils and dirt. That is good but you have to replace the oils if you don't want the dreaded beard itch and dandruff. This stuff does a great job at replacing the striped oils. It keeps my beard happy and that helps keep me happy. I also enjoy the sent of this balm. It is a mild sent of citrus orange in my opinion. I have used others with less sent and some that are much stronger. This sent seems to leave about an hour after applying.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Natural ingredients<br />Good conditioning<br />Easy to use tin.<br />Easy to apply consistency<br /><br />Cons:<br />If I use it multiple times in day I started to get zits in certain areas.<br /><br />All in all.
