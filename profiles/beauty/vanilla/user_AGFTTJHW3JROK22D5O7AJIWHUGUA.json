Sticking a bath pillow to the wall only means that your vertical head has a bit of padding.  This bath pillow has changed that!  Because it's so long and softer than an inflatable pillow, it actually sort of creates that angle so my head does not have to vertical!  After my first bath, I was trying to think of a way to hang it up to dry when I realized it actually has a hook just for that!

I've tried quite a few different tweezers, but my favorite is an old Revlon one that I've had for more than 15 years.  To me, it's not just about the angle or the point - it's the gripping power.  This LeiCare set works well and have become my go-to splinter removers.  They grip well and for the price (currently $6.99 for both tweezers and the case), I think these are a good deal.  My only complaint is with the case.  It's basically cardboard so while it's held up so far, I don't think it will last long.

I feel like the brush is more intense and the silicone head is more gentle on the skin.  I can really notice a difference after I use the brush.  My skin is much smoother.  I assume it's because it's exfoliating and removing the dead skin.  There are 2 speed settings and I've found the lower setting doesn't do much so I use it on the higher setting.  I like that it can be used in the shower since I wash my face in the shower.  I just wish it was rechargeable.

It's pretty elegant, especially for tea.  I would expect a high-end candle to look like this, not a canister of tea!  It's beautiful, but again, for tea.  The box is nice with a soft, thick elastic band to keep the top on.  The jar is a light purple glass with a plastic lid.  They did slap a warning about the horrific smell when you open the cap.  It's pretty bad and strong.  However, I bravely pushed on and made a cup.  It doesn't really smell that bad once it's steeped.  I steep it in 195 degree water for 7 minutes.  It does seem to take the edge off, but the flavor is really just okay.  At $68 (currently) for 50 tea bags, I think the packaging must be really expensive.  I usually drink Yogi Bedtime Tea because it's readily available at the grocery store and I love the way it smells and tastes.

It came in an unsealed box (the Amazon package was sealed, of course, but the actual box the tube was in wasn't taped or sealed in any way) and the lid didn't have any shrink-wrap, or foil strip, or even tape.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of scents, and while this one is not bad, it's not great either. It's a little on the strong side for my tastes.<br /><br />Speaking of tastes, this gloss/mask has a bit of an oily/greasy taste. It's not bad, but doesn't match the smell of it. I don't mind it, but I thought I'd mention it since it's important to some people.<br /><br />All that said, it moisturizes pretty well and I like the way my lips feel in the morning, which is saying a lot.
