I don't put a lot of make up on. My make up routine is eyeliner, mascara and blush. This makeup remover towelettes doesn't have enough moisture to do the job right, and it dried out quickly as I was wiping my face with it. All it did was smudge the make up around my eyes leaving me with racoon eyes. Once my eyes started to feel irritated I stopped using it, and I used Garnier cleansing water with a cotton pad. I took a picture of the towelette and the cotton pad side by side to show how much make up this product left behind. Also, this cleanser smells so bad that I had to hold my breath when using it.

The pin side is very pointy and sharp so be very careful when brushing. I use the soft brush side of it when I apply my dog's eye stain remover gel. It distributes the gel better than using my fingers. The only thing that concerns me is the pin side for wiggly dogs. If your dog moves around constantly during grooming then this brush is not for you. My Mal-Shi is very calm during grooming so he just stands still, but my Shih Tzu is very wiggly, so I can't use this brush on him. The pin side is like needles, if he moves his head slightly he would get injured.

After I dipped the cotton pads in nail polish remover, I wrapped them around my nails and put the nail clippers on for 15 minutes.

I used it once every 2 weeks so I've used it 5 times so far. Now, the sessions will be only once a month until all the unwated hair is removed. The manufacturer recommends using it once every 2 weeks for the first 5 sessions and then once a month after that, so using it multiple times a week won't change the outcome. The areas I use this device are my legs, under arms, bikini area and upper lip. The only difference I've noticed so far is the upper lip hair. It is growing significantly less, like almost 90% is gone. The rest of the body hair still grows the same amount, but the hair started to grow softer. I assume the hair is finally becoming weaker. I am half Greek and half Italian, I have olive skin color with dark hair, so it might take over a year for me to see some results. Overall, the device is very easy to use and it is painless, but it gets super hot to the touch after about 5-10 minutes of continues usage. I use the device on my legs first and then take a break until it cools down, and then I continue using it on other parts of the body and stop to cool it down again. I have to admit it is frustrating to stop the session to cool down the device. I don't know if other hair removal devices get this hot.

I don't put a lot of make up on. My make up routine is eyeliner, mascara and blush. This makeup remover towelettes doesn't have enough moisture to do the job right, and it dried out quickly as I was wiping my face with it. All it did was smudge the make up around my eyes leaving me with racoon eyes. Once my eyes started to feel irritated I stopped using it, and I used Garnier cleansing water with a cotton pad. I took a picture of the towelette and the cotton pad side by side to show how much make up this product left behind. Also, this cleanser smells so bad that I had to hold my breath when using it. I don't recommend this cleanser at all.\nReview Title: Smells terrible, dries out quickly, doesn't remove make up\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Follain Everybody Bar Soap | Lavender & Bergamot, Skin Moisturizing Hand & Body Cleanser with Shea Butter, Argan Oil, Hydrate for Softer Skin, Non-Drying, Rich-Lather, Cruelty Free, 5 oz\nReview Date: 2020/11/30\nStore: Follain\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Brand': 'Follain', 'Scent': 'Bergamot,Lavender', 'Material Feature': 'Cru, Non GMO, Dermatologist Tested', 'Product Dimensions': '3.75 x 2.25 x 1 inches; 5.11 Ounces', 'Item model number': '692764483009', 'UPC': '692764483009'}\nReview Text: This soap doesn't have the best scent, but it is very creamy and moisturizing. It is a big bar of soap too so it will last me a long time. Because of its creamy texture, I used this soap to shave instead of using my shaving cream and it did a wonderful job!

The pin side is very pointy and sharp so be very careful when brushing. I use the soft brush side of it when I apply my dog's eye stain remover gel. It distributes the gel better than using my fingers. The only thing that concerns me is the pin side for wiggly dogs. If your dog moves around constantly during grooming then this brush is not for you. My Mal-Shi is very calm during grooming so he just stands still, but my Shih Tzu is very wiggly, so I can't use this brush on him. The pin side is like needles, if he moves his head slightly he would get injured. I can't risk it.\nReview Title: Effective, but not for wiggly dogs\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Heyedrate Activated Charcoal Soap Bar and Face Wash | Organic, Vegan, Natural Soap made with Dead Sea Mud and Our Essential Oil Blend (1 Pack (5 Ounces))\nReview Date: 2021/03/22\nStore: Eye Love\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Brand': 'Eye Love', 'Scent': 'Eucalyptus, Coconut, Grapefruit, Rosemary', 'Material Feature': 'Organic, Natural, Vegan', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '4 x 1 x 1 inches; 4.97 Ounces', 'UPC': '850436007827'}\nReview Text: I am not stranger to charcoal facial soap. I used to use the liquid version of it and got great results in the past. Since spring is here, I wanted to get rid of dead skin and rejuvenate my skin. This charcoal soap doesn't lather a lot but it is as effective as the liquid one. I distributed it using my silicone brush cleaner and got an amazing result. My skin feels cleaner, brighter and smoother. All the combination of natural ingredients in it nourishes my skin. This soap bar is going to last me a long time.

It was my first time doing gel nail and I loved it, but I didn't realize gel polish needs to be removed using a special technique. That's how I came across with this remover kit and I am glad I ordered it. I guess some people wrap aluminum foil around their nails, but I don't know how efficient that is. After I dipped the cotton pads in nail polish remover, I wrapped them around my nails and put the nail clippers on for 15 minutes. When I took them off, the gel polish looked soft and some of them were already peeled, so I used the scrapper to get rid of the rest of the polish, and filed my nails to smooth them out. That's it! This kit is very easy to use and does the job.\nReview Title: Easy to use, does the job quickly\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Yayoge Gel Nail Polish Kit \uff0c6 Colors Gel Nail Polish Base and Top Coat \uff0cUV Gel Nail Polish Set \uff0cSoak Off Gel Nail Art Manicure Kit, Ideal Gifts DIY Salon and Home\nReview Date: 2021/04/08\nStore: yayoge\nAverage Rating: 3.1\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Yayoge', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Glossy', 'Special Feature': 'Long-lasting', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Liquid Volume': '0.33 Fluid Ounces', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '8.66 x 7.09 x 2.36 inches', 'Product Dimensions': '8.66 x 7.09 x 2.36 inches; 13.76 Ounces'}\nReview Text: Before I cured my nails with the UV light, I applied different colors on each nail to see which one would compliment my skin. Unfortunately, I didn't like any of the colors in this set. Two of the gel polish are the same exact color, so I received 5 different colors not 6. The title of this product claims that it comes with a UV lamp, but it doesn't. I am glad I tested the colors on my nails before going further.

It hydrates my cuticles and makes my nails look shiny. The only bad thing is that it doesn't remove nail polish easily. I had to put a lot of pressure on and go over a nail multiple times to be able to remove the nail polish. Let's put it this way, if I was wiping my nails with a regular acetone it would have taken me couple swipes, but with this nail polish remover it took 15 swipes. I would still prefer this remover because it didn't dry my nails. My nails look like I just applied cuticle oil. It smell really good too.\nReview Title: Nourishing nail polish remover\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Got2b Glued Spray Wax with 2-in-1 Dual Nozzle, 8 oz\nReview Date: 2021/04/25\nStore: Got2B\nProduct Description: ['The first dual-finish spray wax has officially hit the shelves!

I used it once every 2 weeks so I've used it 5 times so far. Now, the sessions will be only once a month until all the unwated hair is removed. The manufacturer recommends using it once every 2 weeks for the first 5 sessions and then once a month after that, so using it multiple times a week won't change the outcome. The areas I use this device are my legs, under arms, bikini area and upper lip. The only difference I've noticed so far is the upper lip hair. It is growing significantly less, like almost 90% is gone. The rest of the body hair still grows the same amount, but the hair started to grow softer. I assume the hair is finally becoming weaker. I am half Greek and half Italian, I have olive skin color with dark hair, so it might take over a year for me to see some results. Overall, the device is very easy to use and it is painless, but it gets super hot to the touch after about 5-10 minutes of continues usage. I use the device on my legs first and then take a break until it cools down, and then I continue using it on other parts of the body and stop to cool it down again. I have to admit it is frustrating to stop the session to cool down the device. I don't know if other hair removal devices get this hot. This is my first time using something like this so I can't compare.\nReview Title: Painless and easy to use, but the device gets super hot\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Women Ultra Smooth Razor Womens Razors for Shaving Comfortable handle 5-blade Razor + 2 Refill Blades for a Smooth and safety Shave Reusable Razors for Girls Women\nReview Date: 2021/09/23\nStore: RONGCHUANG\nAverage Rating: 4.0\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '8 x 5 x 1 inches; 7.41 Ounces', 'UPC': '607816401771'}\nReview Text: [[VIDEOID:605657cac95f549a7d3c2e340303de40]] I love the sleek design of this razor and the ceramic base it comes with. The razor gives a super close shave and makes my skin feel soft and smooth. The only thing that makes me nervous is the handle. It becomes slippery in the shower so I can't get a good grip. It worries me that I will cut myself when I am shaving. I searched if the company sells refill blades for this but they don't have them. You will have to purchase the whole set again, so that is something to think about before purchasing.\nReview Title: The handle becomes slippery in the shower\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
