I soak in the tub using luxurious bath bombs, spend hours playing with hair products, yet still wrap my hair up every night even though I have two blow dryers and a hand full of hair dryer brushes. I still just prefer to leave my hair wrapped up until bed and deal with the messy curly consequences the next morning. This is by far the BEST hair wraps I've ever used. It is made if microfiber and is soft as blankets. The turban is great for just throwing your hair in there, while the hair towel wraps up nicely and has a good button and band on it to hold it in place. The two hair ties are nice, but not needed. Still useful though! The towels themselves absorb all of the water and hold it in place. So, once you take the towels off, they are soaked for hours, unlike your hair. These are by far the best hair towels I've ever left in my hair for hours at a time.\nReview Title: Love the Turban\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Panama Jack Sunscreen Lip Balm - SPF 45, Tropical & Mango 6 Pack Plus, Broad Spectrum UVA-UVB Sunscreen Protection, Prevents & Soothes Dry, Chapped Lips\nReview Date: 2020/11/12\nStore: Panama Jack\nAverage Rating: 4.9\nProduct Details: {'Scent': 'Mango', 'Product Benefits': 'Soothing', 'Item Weight': '4.25 Grams', 'Number of Items': '6', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '5.08 x 4.72 x 1.34 inches; 0.15 Ounces'}\nReview Text: Moisturizing and flavorful at the same time!

It comes with the paints and brushes, so no need to buy some. It also folds into a storage box, which is excellent for keeping the mess contained. You want to fold the velcro in, not out. But it works both ways.

Just shy of $15 for 12 excellent masks is a steal. Most face masks that dry out your skin fall around the same price, but these actually restore and calm without drying. The masks fit nicely, not too small and not too large. They are unscented which is glorious because I can't stand a mask that smells like perfume while trying to relax. The aloe is really calming and you feel well hydrated overnight. There are multiple styles with two of each and they each have different effects. They don't leave behind a greasy residue at all either. The packaging is also nice, so you can gift these to someone as is or open them and have a spa day at home.

The scrunchies are cute and functional! All the rage these days with youth. The only thing I notice that is different about this one than others is that it doesn't have the open cylinder at the top. Most of the others have an open top for bobbie pins and clips. However, that is not a negative as it literally is perfectly sized and comes with everything needed.

When I write a review, it is based on everything including the price. There is no way you will catch me buying this at $34 for a ONE TIME USE bag. If this was less than $10, it would be great. You use the entire bag and try to relax. It's like a detox in a way. But, it's not worth the price point. It comes with a stone inside \"yay!\". Still not worth $34. It's epsom salts with some essential oils and moisturizing oils. That's great and all, but have we forgot that it is still a one time use bag that costs more than buying the ingredients and making them yourself? Especially since I didn't notice a difference compared to other similar packaged salts.

The mannequin comes without a wig, but I had one on hand to make my art more realistic. It's very proportional to a normal head circumference. I like that it has the shoulders so I can use a scarf and hat to show off.<br /><br />For $65 at the time of review, I really can't complain. It's so realistic, that you can use it as a display or you can use it to train yourself I'm hair. It even has a spot for earrings too. Overall, I have zero complaints.

The masks fit nicely, not too small and not too large. They are unscented which is glorious because I can't stand a mask that smells like perfume while trying to relax. The aloe is really calming and you feel well hydrated overnight. There are multiple styles with two of each and they each have different effects. They don't leave behind a greasy residue at all either. The packaging is also nice, so you can gift these to someone as is or open them and have a spa day at home. I would 100% buy these if you need a new face mask routine.\nA little over $1 a pack\ngo1go Bath Bombs Gift Set, 6 Pack Natural Rich in Essential Oils Spa Bath Fizzies for Moisturizing Dry Skin, Gift Ideas for Girlfriends, Women, Moms, Men and Kids, Birthday, Valentine, Mothers Day\ngo1go\n{'Brand': 'go1go', 'Scent': 'Lavender, Rose', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Moisturizing', 'Product Benefits': 'Soothing,Stress Relief,Moisturizing,Relaxing,Aromatherapy', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '7.95 x 5.71 x 2.6 inches; 1.45 Pounds', 'Manufacturer': 'go1go'}\nThese bombs are not terribly fancy for what you get. Very little scent, however they don't stain the tub. It's difficult to say these are worth anything more than 3 stars though because the scents just isn't there. What scent there is doesn't match what they are. You also don't know what kind they are because there is no scent listed on the label or box.

Depending on what kind of hair ties you are using, this could hold anywhere from 8 scrunchies to 50 hair ties. It literally comes fully assembled, ready to be used right out of the box. The scrunchies are cute and functional! All the rage these days with youth. The only thing I notice that is different about this one than others is that it doesn't have the open cylinder at the top. Most of the others have an open top for bobbie pins and clips. However, that is not a negative as it literally is perfectly sized and comes with everything needed. And even better, it's the perfect less than $10 item for birthdays or gifts at $9.99 at the time of review.\nComes fully assembled!\nPursoma Beyond The Body After the Class Post Workout Soak, 9 oz\nPursoma\n{'Brand': 'Pursoma', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Stress Relief,Anti-inflammatory,Pain Relief,Cleansing,Pore', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Unit Count': '1.0 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5 x 7.5 inches; 9.24 Ounces', 'UPC': '857525007096'}\nHere's the thing; This is a small bag at an extravagant price. When I write a review, it is based on everything including the price. There is no way you will catch me buying this at $34 for a ONE TIME USE bag. If this was less than $10, it would be great. You use the entire bag and try to relax. It's like a detox in a way. But, it's not worth the price point. It comes with a stone inside \"yay!\". Still not worth $34. It's epsom salts with some essential oils and moisturizing oils. That's great and all, but have we forgot that it is still a one time use bag that costs more than buying the ingredients and making them yourself? Especially since I didn't notice a difference compared to other similar packaged salts.

The mannequin comes without a wig, but I had one on hand to make my art more realistic. It's very proportional to a normal head circumference. I like that it has the shoulders so I can use a scarf and hat to show off.<br /><br />For $65 at the time of review, I really can't complain. It's so realistic, that you can use it as a display or you can use it to train yourself I'm hair. It even has a spot for earrings too. Overall, I have zero complaints. It stands perfectly because of the size and shape. It has a good base. Whether it is for hair design or a display, this will work well!\nWorks For My Crocheting",

It does lather pretty well and the bottle is large, but it just didn't cut it for mine. I have thick hair and what we thought was the extra shine left a layer of grease on my brush the next day.

I soak in the tub using luxurious bath bombs, spend hours playing with hair products, yet still wrap my hair up every night even though I have two blow dryers and a hand full of hair dryer brushes. I still just prefer to leave my hair wrapped up until bed and deal with the messy curly consequences the next morning. This is by far the BEST hair wraps I've ever used. It is made if microfiber and is soft as blankets. The turban is great for just throwing your hair in there, while the hair towel wraps up nicely and has a good button and band on it to hold it in place. The two hair ties are nice, but not needed. Still useful though! The towels themselves absorb all of the water and hold it in place. So, once you take the towels off, they are soaked for hours, unlike your hair. These are by far the best hair towels I've ever left in my hair for hours at a time.\nReview Title: Love the Turban\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Panama Jack Sunscreen Lip Balm - SPF 45, Tropical & Mango 6 Pack Plus, Broad Spectrum UVA-UVB Sunscreen Protection, Prevents & Soothes Dry, Chapped Lips\nReview Date: 2020/11/12\nStore: Panama Jack\nAverage Rating: 4.9\nProduct Details: {'Scent': 'Mango', 'Product Benefits': 'Soothing', 'Item Weight': '4.25 Grams', 'Number of Items': '6', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '5.08 x 4.72 x 1.34 inches; 0.15 Ounces'}\nReview Text: Moisturizing and flavorful at the same time!

This will keep the kids busy for a while, but they will love it.<br /><br />The dinosaurs are not too small and can be easily painted by 4 year olds. May not be the prettiest, but its about being creative. The mat is the perfect size and the paints are easy to clean up. They are washable so the hands can be cleaned up after. It comes with the paints and brushes, so no need to buy some. It also folds into a storage box, which is excellent for keeping the mess contained. You want to fold the velcro in, not out. But it works both ways.

Once you understand the twirling left and right (depending in which direction you want your curls), you'll be on your way to curls that look right out of a beauty pageant. I don't say that in a negative way. They are very beautifully curled. Little girls would love having these curls.<br /><br />You can curl them and then brush them out a bit to give them a more natural look. The two barrels are easily interchangeable so you can do large curls and small curls. I have very thick hair and found these to be fun to wear without needing that hair cut.
