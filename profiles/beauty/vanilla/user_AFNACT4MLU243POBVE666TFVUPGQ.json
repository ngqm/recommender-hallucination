I've only tried it once and it stayed put for 24 hrs, even though a shower! Now that's what I call really waterproof! I don't normally sleep in makeup of any kind but wanted to give it an \"all night\" durability test. Woke up the next morning....was still there! Expected at least some \"mascara\" marks on my pillowcase but there was nary a mark. But my biggest surprise came when I awoke without \"racoon eyes\"!!! I usually wear \"tubing\" mascaras as other formulas end up under my eyes within a few hours, I actually expected this mascara to do the same.<br /><br />Volume and length? It definitely added length.  I use Latisse so my lashes have stayed long as I've aged and this mascara provided additional length.  As to volume,  not so much.  However, I only used one coat so it may indeed give the volume advertised with another coat. I really did not notice any \"fibers\" and being a lens wearer perhaps that's not a bad thing.  The formula is not thick so it applies smoothly without leaving clumps. It was fairly easy to remove  with a cotton pad soaked in micro-cellular water.  All in all, if you are looking for staying power this mascara is worthy of a try.<br /><br />The packaging is unique! Hans Holbein's portrait of a young Princess Elizabeth [later Queen Elizabeth I] just caught my eye. I found the square shape vs round tube a lot easier to hold and the brush is a standard design found on many other mascara brands.\nReview Title: WORTHY OF A TRY FOR STAYING POWER ALONE PLUS- No Racoon Eyes!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: EASYDEW Fill Up Volume Spot 0.67 fl oz -Anti-Aging Filler Spot Good for Topical Wrinkle Care with Hyaluronic Acid I Moisturizer with Instant Filling Effect and Skin Renewal | For Topical Area\nReview Date: 2020/11/18\nStore: EASYDEW\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'EASYDEW', 'Scent': 'Aloe Vera', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Active Ingredients': 'Hyaluronic acid', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Product Dimensions': '1.46 x 0.91 x 5.71 inches; 1.41 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I just started using this filler and at this time I don't feel its had the appropriate time for me to see any change in the depth of my fine lines. So this will be a 1st impression review that I will revisit after I've used this for a few weeks.<br /><br />[From the box/packaging] This product is made by the Korean,  Daewoong Pharmaceutical [DN Co.] Company which according to the company's website is a global healthcare company that strives to contribute to the beauty molding industry in Korea and around the world.<br /><br />The gel has an easy to use unique packaging that doses out just the right amount needed to pat over wrinkles and fine lines. The gel, when first applied, feels slightly sticky but does not remain so on the skin and it worked well under foundation with no pilling or reaction.<br /><br />Being a skin care/cosmetic junkie and always a bit skeptical,  I did a little digging into the ingredients. It does contain proven HA [hyaloronic acid] which is a good start in my opinion. I did find one ingredient I wanted to know more about namely:<br /><br />EGF [epidermal growth factor) a/k/a SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-1: - From the INCI website - Epidermal growth factor is a protein that stimulates cell growth.  I encourage you to research this ingredient for additional information for informed decision making.<br /><br />Right now, I'm skeptically giving this 3 stars for seemingly falling into the Cosmeceuticals [cosmetic products that claimed to have medicinal or drug-like benefits]<br /><br />11/29/20 Update:  I've used this for a few weeks now and my smile lines, although not doing a disappearing act,  they are less noticeable.

I use the makeup artist's Scotch tape trick for applying eye shadow [see Dominique Sachse's, Caught on Tape U tube video] and love the effect. However, Scotch tape doesn't stick to skin evenly/smoothly leaving gaps and when its peeled off it takes some foundation with it. I was hoping this would work better and I've not been disappointed.  It's easy to apply and goes on smoothly with no wrinkles or gaps and it removes without taking foundation with it. Leaving you with a nice winged effect to your shadow. Now that I think about it, it should also work for winged eyeliner.\nReview Title: PERFECT ALTERNATIVE FOR EYESHADOW SCOTCH TAPE TRICK\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: UJM Magnetic Eyelashes 10 Pairs Reusable Magnetic Eyelash and Eyeliner Kit Natural Look False Lashes with Tweezers No Glue Needed Waterproof Magnetic Lashes\nReview Date: 2021/01/04\nStore: UJM\nAverage Rating: 4.2\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'UJM', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '8 x 4 x 0.4 inches', 'Material Feature': 'Gluten Free', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Mounting Type': 'Eyelash Glue', 'Product Dimensions': '8 x 4 x 0.4 inches; 2.89 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'UJM-010'}\nReview Text: These are natural looking lashes that were easy to apply.

I'm 70 and my once oily skin is now normal so the addition of HA prompted me to give it a try. Its so finely milled that it goes on light as air and disappears into your foundation. I only use a tiny amount of powder on my T-zone, but with slightly oily eyelids, shadow tends to crease even with primer so I tried it on my lids. After my eye cream and primer, I dusted it lightly over my crease area and applied shadow. My shadow stayed put with O creasing! And, unlike other powders I've tried on my lids, this one didn't enhance my slightly crinkly lids! This one is worth the $$.\nReview Title: LIGHT AS AIR / STOPS SHADOW CREASING / WORKS WELL ON OLDER SKIN\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: FOAMIST Thickening Caffeine 3 Peptides Complex Hair Conditioner for hair loss, thin hair 250ml / 8.4 fl.oz.\nReview Date: 2022/07/30\nStore: FOAMIST\nAverage Rating: 4.0\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'FOAMIST', 'Item Form': 'Conditioner', 'Active Ingredients': 'caffeine,peptides,triclosan', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Hair Loss,Thickening,Hair Growth', 'Package Dimensions': '8.19 x 6.38 x 1.89 inches; 9.59 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I'm on the fence regarding the merits of this conditioner. I have aging [I'm 74] thin baby fine color treated hair with only normal seasonal hair loss.  On the first try, I washed my hair using my normal shampoo and applied the conditioner following the directions, leaving it on 3 mins then rinsing it out. After one use,  I'm not overly impressed with its ability to add thickness to my strands but it did leave my hair soft and didn't weigh it down.<br /><br />Its a thick cream with a pleasant odor and on short hair [pixie] a little goes a long way. I plan on using it over the next few weeks hoping eventually it will thicken and volumize my thin hair and encourage growth. If I see a major difference I'll revise this review. The bottom line is that for some, it may be worth trying.\nReview Title: MAY TAKE SOME TIME TO SEE RESULTS ON THIN BABY FINE HAIR\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I'm 70 and my once oily skin is now normal so the addition of HA prompted me to give it a try. Its so finely milled that it goes on light as air and disappears into your foundation. I only use a tiny amount of powder on my T-zone, but with slightly oily eyelids, shadow tends to crease even with primer so I tried it on my lids. After my eye cream and primer, I dusted it lightly over my crease area and applied shadow. My shadow stayed put with O creasing! And, unlike other powders I've tried on my lids, this one didn't enhance my slightly crinkly lids! This one is worth the $$.\nLIGHT AS AIR / STOPS SHADOW CREASING / WORKS WELL ON OLDER SKIN\nFOAMIST Thickening Caffeine 3 Peptides Complex Hair Conditioner for hair loss, thin hair 250ml / 8.4 fl.oz.\nFOAMIST\n{'Brand': 'FOAMIST', 'Item Form': 'Conditioner', 'Active Ingredients': 'caffeine,peptides,triclosan', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Hair Loss,Thickening,Hair Growth', 'Package Dimensions': '8.19 x 6.38 x 1.89 inches; 9.59 Ounces'}\nI'm on the fence regarding the merits of this conditioner. I have aging [I'm 74] thin baby fine color treated hair with only normal seasonal hair loss.  On the first try, I washed my hair using my normal shampoo and applied the conditioner following the directions, leaving it on 3 mins then rinsing it out. After one use,  I'm not overly impressed with its ability to add thickness to my strands but it did leave my hair soft and didn't weigh it down.<br /><br />Its a thick cream with a pleasant odor and on short hair [pixie] a little goes a long way. I plan on using it over the next few weeks hoping eventually it will thicken and volumize my thin hair and encourage growth. If I see a major difference I'll revise this review. The bottom line is that for some, it may be worth trying.\nMAY TAKE SOME TIME TO SEE RESULTS ON THIN BABY FINE HAIR",

I've only tried it once and it stayed put for 24 hrs, even though a shower! Now that's what I call really waterproof! I don't normally sleep in makeup of any kind but wanted to give it an \"all night\" durability test. Woke up the next morning....was still there! Expected at least some \"mascara\" marks on my pillowcase but there was nary a mark. But my biggest surprise came when I awoke without \"racoon eyes\"!!! I usually wear \"tubing\" mascaras as other formulas end up under my eyes within a few hours, I actually expected this mascara to do the same.<br /><br />Volume and length? It definitely added length.  I use Latisse so my lashes have stayed long as I've aged and this mascara provided additional length.  As to volume,  not so much.  However, I only used one coat so it may indeed give the volume advertised with another coat. I really did not notice any \"fibers\" and being a lens wearer perhaps that's not a bad thing.  The formula is not thick so it applies smoothly without leaving clumps. It was fairly easy to remove  with a cotton pad soaked in micro-cellular water.  All in all, if you are looking for staying power this mascara is worthy of a try.<br /><br />The packaging is unique! Hans Holbein's portrait of a young Princess Elizabeth [later Queen Elizabeth I] just caught my eye. I found the square shape vs round tube a lot easier to hold and the brush is a standard design found on many other mascara brands.\nReview Title: WORTHY OF A TRY FOR STAYING POWER ALONE PLUS- No Racoon Eyes!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: EASYDEW Fill Up Volume Spot 0.67 fl oz -Anti-Aging Filler Spot Good for Topical Wrinkle Care with Hyaluronic Acid I Moisturizer with Instant Filling Effect and Skin Renewal | For Topical Area\nReview Date: 2020/11/18\nStore: EASYDEW\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'EASYDEW', 'Scent': 'Aloe Vera', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Active Ingredients': 'Hyaluronic acid', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Product Dimensions': '1.46 x 0.91 x 5.71 inches; 1.41 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I just started using this filler and at this time I don't feel its had the appropriate time for me to see any change in the depth of my fine lines. So this will be a 1st impression review that I will revisit after I've used this for a few weeks.<br /><br />[From the box/packaging] This product is made by the Korean,  Daewoong Pharmaceutical [DN Co.] Company which according to the company's website is a global healthcare company that strives to contribute to the beauty molding industry in Korea and around the world.<br /><br />The gel has an easy to use unique packaging that doses out just the right amount needed to pat over wrinkles and fine lines. The gel, when first applied, feels slightly sticky but does not remain so on the skin and it worked well under foundation with no pilling or reaction.<br /><br />Being a skin care/cosmetic junkie and always a bit skeptical,  I did a little digging into the ingredients. It does contain proven HA [hyaloronic acid] which is a good start in my opinion. I did find one ingredient I wanted to know more about namely:<br /><br />EGF [epidermal growth factor) a/k/a SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-1: - From the INCI website - Epidermal growth factor is a protein that stimulates cell growth.  I encourage you to research this ingredient for additional information for informed decision making.<br /><br />Right now, I'm skeptically giving this 3 stars for seemingly falling into the Cosmeceuticals [cosmetic products that claimed to have medicinal or drug-like benefits]<br /><br />11/29/20 Update:  I've used this for a few weeks now and my smile lines, although not doing a disappearing act,  they are less noticeable. I've not had any adverse reaction to this gel and have added a star due to the results I've seen.

I use the makeup artist's Scotch tape trick for applying eye shadow [see Dominique Sachse's, Caught on Tape U tube video] and love the effect. However, Scotch tape doesn't stick to skin evenly/smoothly leaving gaps and when its peeled off it takes some foundation with it. I was hoping this would work better and I've not been disappointed.  It's easy to apply and goes on smoothly with no wrinkles or gaps and it removes without taking foundation with it. Leaving you with a nice winged effect to your shadow. Now that I think about it, it should also work for winged eyeliner.\nReview Title: PERFECT ALTERNATIVE FOR EYESHADOW SCOTCH TAPE TRICK\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: UJM Magnetic Eyelashes 10 Pairs Reusable Magnetic Eyelash and Eyeliner Kit Natural Look False Lashes with Tweezers No Glue Needed Waterproof Magnetic Lashes\nReview Date: 2021/01/04\nStore: UJM\nAverage Rating: 4.2\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'UJM', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '8 x 4 x 0.4 inches', 'Material Feature': 'Gluten Free', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Mounting Type': 'Eyelash Glue', 'Product Dimensions': '8 x 4 x 0.4 inches; 2.89 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'UJM-010'}\nReview Text: These are natural looking lashes that were easy to apply.

I'm so glad that I did as it exceeded my expectations to the point that I've overlooked a few things I'd normally dock it on.<br /><br />First use: My usual routine is to wash my makeup off and immediately apply HA [Hyaluronic acid] to relieve the resulting dry tight feeling.  I filled this sprayer with HA serum and at first, didn't feel anything but cool air hitting my face and wondered if any serum was even coming out. Then suddenly the tightness was gone and my face felt like it was covered with a moisture mask. When applying HA with my fingers it always took a minute or two to soak in, not so with this sprayer the results were immediate! Although the Nano mist is so fine its impossible to see, the end results is an amazing feeling of soft fully moisturized skin.<br /><br />With this sprayer you can chose to use serums, toners or water so your not limited to only water like other Nano sprayers. This sprayer is well made and the USB cord is included, the liquid chamber is small [perhaps two tablespoon capacity] easy to fill and it only used a tiny amount of serum to cover my face and neck.<br /><br />The only Cons are the USB port's location on the bottom so it must be laid on its side to charge {that's weird} and the instruction booklet could use a little help. But, as stated at the beginning of this review I'm so impressed with how my skin feels I'm forgiving the aforementioned transgressions and giving this a 5 star rating.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't normally get excited about skin care tools but this one is an exception and its made me a Nano spray believer. Highly recommend.<br /><br />I hope you find this review helpful.\nReview Title: NOT A SKINCARE GIMMICK GIVES AMAZING RESULTS\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Garnier Whole Blends Softening Shampoo Bar for Fine to Normal Hair, Oat Delicacy, 2 Oz, 1 Count (Packaging May Vary)\nReview Date: 2021/07/28\nStore: Garnier\nProduct Description: ['Raise the bar on shampoo!

The description and images leaves the impression that this is a powder product, in reality, the texture is closer to ELF's putty primer. When I applied it to dry bare skin using the puff it pilled slightly, I did get better results blending it with my finger tips. It leaves an overall light green veil of color on bare skin that's not overly noticeable and leaves a matte finish. Don't let the matte finish fool you though, it melts into your skin leaving it moisturized without feeling greasy.<br /><br />My skin is only slightly sensitive and when irritated doesn't react with major noticeable redness or heat. It did calm the redness I sometimes have around my nose and chin.  I've not yet tested this over or under foundation and wonder if it would work well as a primer?
