She has to go to a camp which has a lot of other teens at it for a week to work for a city reach out program.  She wanted to bring her Clarisonic, but I talked her into trying this one out.  It is easy to transport and use and if it is lost or taken, it is not as expensive to replace.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS BRUSH LIKE?<br />First of all, this comes in a nice hard case which is great for travel.  It comes with one soft brush for daily use and a harder brush for once a week or so use.  There is a silicone brush head which is for dry sensitive skin types.  The brush runs on batteries which did not come with our unit.  They are AA batteries.  There are two speeds- slower for daily use and higher for the harder brush to exfoliate.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT WORK?<br />There are two speeds.  The first speed is very slow and my daughter is not fond of it.  She prefers to use it on the second speed which is faster.  Since it runs on batteries, it is not going to have the consistency as a plug in version.  My daughter prefers the exfoliating brush and uses it 2 times a week.  She feels that it cleans her skin as good or better than her Clarisonic Mia as it gets rid of the dead skin cells leaving her skin softer and more clear too.<br /><br />It seems to be very waterproof.  My daughter uses this in the shower and has had no problems with it.  After almost a month of use, twice a week, she is not having problems with the batteries running down yet.  She does  a lot of house sitting so having this handy has been great.<br /><br />AFTER EXFOLIATING BRUSH<br />After using the exfoliating brush, my daughter wanted me to mention that it is important to put on good moisturizer as the skin has been exfoliated well and you will need to make sure to use moisturizer on the face to protect the skin as it repairs.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />If you want the cleaning of a Clarisonic Mia but want something more travel friendly that cleans well, this might be a brush for you to try out.  Working best on the second speed with the exfoliating brush, twice a week does the trick for our daughter.  She really likes it and thinks it works as good or at times better than her Clarisonic Mia which she still has.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS for this one although it is not fair to grade it against the Clarisonic which is electrically powered, it works as well but does have the battery power.  I debated giving it four stars, but it does work better than any battery powered brush we have tested so far, so I am leaving it at five.  The soft brush is not too great, though, so perhaps see this as FOUR AND A HALF.\nReview Title: Best Battery Powered Brush We Have Ever Used Cleans As Good As Clarisonic Which We Also Have\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Manicure and Pedicure Nail Clipper from POWERGROOMING - Powerful Trimmer for Thick and Thin Finger Nails and Toe Nails - Included Nail File and\"Catcher\" for Easy Cleanup (1 Pack)\nReview Date: 2018/12/18\nStore: POWERGROOMING\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'POWERGROOMING', 'Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Blade Edge': 'Straight', 'Blade Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Target Audience': 'Women, Men', 'Package Dimensions': '3.8 x 1.3 x 1 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'UPC': '653233212735', 'Manufacturer': 'POWERGROOMING'}\nReview Text: I don't know about you, but our household goes through nail clippers fast.  Most of the time they don't cut right, or they just don't last.  Toenail clippers- well it is even harder to find a decent pair.  Let's see how this set measured up for us..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS NAIL CLIPPER SET LIKE?<br />This set comes with a hefty set of nail clippers.  It says it is for fingernails and toenails.  More on that in a minute.  The clipper comes with a catch all for the clippings.  It also comes with a faux leather snap shut case that also houses a nail file.<br /><br />HOW DO THESE CLIPPER PERFORM?<br />These clippers are surprinsingly nice.  I tried them on both finger and toe nails and they worked very well.  I did not get any ragged edges, or dull bent nails or anything else that I usually have problems with regarding most clippers.  I did even have good results on the thickest nail which is on the largest toe.<br /><br />WHO MIGHT NOT BENEFIT BY THESE CLIPPERS?'<br />The only person I would think would not benefit from these are those who deal with very thick elderly nails.  Those need special clippers.<br /><br />THE NAIL FILE<br />The nail file is nice, very fine grade of file, this files nails decently.  The tip is not overly great at cleaning under the nail but it works okay.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This nail clipper seems to work well on finger and toe nails not having any trouble with ragged edges or dull bending of nails.  The enclosed case is great in that it keeps the file and clippers together.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS. I like the whole set although the nail file could be a bit better.\nReview Title: FINALLY Truly Nice Toenail Clippers & Bonuses\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Curling Iron 1\u00bc'' with 24k Gold,\u00a0Hair Curler Curling Wand with Dual Voltage for All Hair Types\nReview Date: 2019/07/24\nAverage Rating: 3.1\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '11.2 x 9.2 x 2.3 inches; 1.95 Pounds', 'UPC': '714453116958'}\nReview Text: When it comes to styling devices, my family all has different preferences because we all have different hair.  This looked like a really great product.  Let's take a look..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This comes in a nice box, well packed in a fancy presentation and comes with a little manual.  The device has four buttons on it which are power, temp up or temp down or timer.  The bent curling iron is supposed to be more handy to use.<br /><br />MANUAL<br />The manual is bare bones.  It looks fancy but never tells what temperature or time would be good to start with for different types of hair.  That was very disappointing.  It does tell how to basically press the buttons and what they are for, however.<br /><br />HOW DID THIS PERFORM?<br />We tried this several times on various occasions.  Each time, we set the temperature higher and higher until we were at the top temp but very few of the curls we tried making worked.  The hair simply had a light bend in it.  When using a different curling iron with each person, the hair looked great.  Finally after trying for the last time today, we have determined that this curling iron just does not work.  I am not sure if we got a bad one or what, but it just does not do hardly anything except leaving a partial bend in the hair no matter how we wind it.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Although a great concept, this curling iron did not seem to curl hair properly no matter what hair we used it on or how high or low the temperature was set.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />TWO STARS.  Great idea, just didn't work at all for us.\nReview Title: We Tried EVERYTHING To Get This To Work\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Mountain Falls Regular Nail Polish Remover for Natural Nails with Vitamin E and Panthenol, 10 Fluid Ounce\nReview Date: 2019/11/25\nStore: Mountain Falls\nAverage Rating: 4.3\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Mountain Falls', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Item Weight': '0.7 Pounds', 'Unit Count': '10 Fl Oz'}\nReview Text: When it comes to nail polish remover, I have two choices.  I use either the store brand, or professional brand, which is often pure acetone used in tough removal like gel polish.  Let's look at this one.<br /><br />WHAT TYPE OF POLISH?<br />I had on a very dark red polish which was wearing very intensely for a week.  Removal with some removers would leave red stains everywhere.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This polish remover comes in the same type of bottle most store brands do.  There is no special scent and it is typical remover.<br /><br />HOW DID THIS PERFORM?<br />This polish remover took off the red polish with no problem, left no red staining, and did not leave my nails completely parched like some harsher ones might.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This polish removes regular nail polish (not talking about gel here) very well.  It does not leave nails too stripped.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />Five stars.  It does what it is supposed to to without excessive problems or smells.\nReview Title: Removes Regular (Not Gel) Tough Polish Well, Does Not Leave Nails Parched\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Elegant Compact Lighted Makeup Mirror for Travel, Purse and Handbags,1X and 10X Magnifying Handheld Makeup Mirror with 12 LEDs Lights,Double Side LED Travel Makeup Mirror(White)\nReview Date: 2020/02/05\nStore: deweisn\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '4.2 x 4.1 x 0.9 inches; 2.82 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I was spoiled.  I had a wonderful big compact mirror from OTT LITE some time ago.  I used it a lot.  However, it broke and I could not replace it.  I was hoping  Let's take a look.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This mirror closes and snaps shut with a plastic clip on it.  It says open, but honestly, it is not easy to do.  Once open, the inside has the 10X magnifier on one side and the reguiar mirror surrounded by the light ring.<br /><br />ON/OFF<br />This has one light brightness- on.  There is a little switch on the back that you push from one side to the other to turn it on and off.  It does not shut the light off when you close it.<br /><br />CASE<br />The case is quite slick.  If it is cold out and my hands are cold, it is sometimes a bit tough to hold on to this.  Most of the time it is not a problem.<br /><br />BRIGHTNESS<br />This is a bit too bright for me.  It really does seem to be so bright that I can not look into the regular mirror long, but the magnifier is okay IF I REALLY WANT TO SEE MY PORES.  Sorry, but it is a bit overwhelming.<br /><br />BATTERIES<br />This takes 2 CR2032 batteries.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />I am not really that impressed with this mirror.  It works, but it is a bit frustrating to open, and bright to look into.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />THREE STARS.  This works, but it is not the best light in my opinion.  That little switch on the back could easily be damaged in my purse.\nReview Title: Not Quite As Nice As I Had Hoped- BLINDING At Times\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: BE PLAIN Vitamin Ampoule 1.01 fl oz. - Korean Multi Vitamin Serum for Face with Vitamin B, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Hyaluronic Acid\nReview Date: 2020/04/23\nStore: Be Plain\nAverage Rating: 4.0\nProduct Details: {'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'Be Plain', 'Item Weight': '30 Grams', 'Item Volume': '30 Milliliters', 'Unit Count': '1.01 Fl Oz', 'Product Dimensions': '1.57 x 1.57 x 3.74 inches; 1.06 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'BP008'}\nReview Text: I am always on the lookout for really nice simple skin care.  Let's take a look at this ampule.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This is a clear solution that comes out with an eye dropper.<br /><br />HOW TO USE<br />The idea is that you use a toner on your CLEAN face, apply this to the face and neck and chest, and then follow up with a moisturizer.<br /><br />WHAT DOES IT PROMISE TO DO?<br />This promises to lighted dark spots, and add firmness, glow, and hydration.<br /><br />DOES IT DO WHAT IT SAYS?<br />I used this with another Korean toner which is pretty simple, and also the BE PLAIN Aqua moisturizer.  When used, this did not seem to moisturize that much on its own, and for brightness and glow, I would say not over WOW factor after using for a month.<br /><br />DID SKIN LOOK FIRMER?<br />I guess you could say my skin looked a bit firmer, but nothing so dramatic that people said, \"WOW, WHAT ARE YOU USING ON YOUR FACE?\"<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a scent free, easy to use serum for the face.  It works well with moisturizer, is simple, scent free, and gives a moderate amount of what it says it will do.  It is not remarkable, but it is not terrible either.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.

When I read about this product and the lovely smell it had, I was very excited to try it.  Let's take a look.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This cream is yellow in color- very pale yellow.  It is creamy but not heavy.  There is a very faint lemon smell, but there is also a smell which is not good- almost like the oils in the cream are about to turn completely rancid.  They are not quite there yet, but I have used enough products over time where I recognize that smell.<br /><br />That is not necessarily the fault of the cream.  This could have been kept in a hot warehouse too long, or who knows what.  The manufacture date on my box is April 2019.  That is over a year old already.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT WORK?<br />Since it is not unbearable at this point, I wanted to at least test the product for a few days.  There was no burning or stinging, so it is still okay to use for now.  The product is quite nice.  It does soak in quickly and it does not leave the face greasy at all.<br /><br />WHAT IS THE EFFECT ON SKIN?<br />The next morning after using this, I will say that the skin is left looking like it has a slight glow to it.  It does leave the skin looking much nicer than other creams I have used.  It is warmer weather right now and this cream is still not leaving the face greasy or heavy at all.  My skin is definitely left looking nice the next morning.<br /><br />ANY SENSITIVITY?<br />I have not had any sensitivity to the sun or anything else yet.  Like I said, I can not use this long as it is ready to turn bad soon so I only have a short time.  For now, it is really nice.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />I really wish that this cream was fresher than it is.  The product manufacture date on it is April of 2019.  I am really disappointed that I could not test it at its best because it has great potential to be a really nice cream.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS- I can not give this five stars in its current state.  It is potentially really nice cream though.  If you get a fresh one, I imagine it is really nice.  Just make sure to use it up and if you live in a hot climate, keep it in the refrigerator or air conditioning.\nReview Title: Seems To Work, But I Think Mine Might Be Going Rancid\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: JARGOD 1pcs 100% Kolinsky Sable Acrylic Nails Round Nail Art Brush (size 4)\nReview Date: 2020/06/29\nStore: JARGOD\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'JARGOD', 'Handle Material': 'Acrylic', 'Head Material': 'Kolinsky', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '7.7 x 0.3 x 0.3 inches; 0.63 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I have a set of Kolinsky sable brushes which moths got at a while ago and I have been wanting to replace them.  This was a perfect shape for me, so I got it.  Let's see what happened.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This has a wood handle for nails or even watercolor painting- it is a nice solid wood handle.  The brush itself is a teardrop shape with a very fine point.  The ferrule is average, nothing WOW, but not awful either.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?<br />This brush has a nice pocket in it which absorbs the watercolor when using it.  It will gradually disperse the paint in a nice thin line, but it does make it so I don't have to dip it as constantly as with a narrow brush.  As for smoothness of lines and how it paints, I really like it.  It is great for small areas of paintings.<br /><br />CLEANING<br />I clean this regularly in the same product that I use for cleaning wool when it is time to store it.  It has deterrent to moths in it.  Other than that, I just clean with water most of the time and only use the other stuff when i am going to put it away for any length of time.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Although this can be used for nails, I prefer it for watercolor.  I like nail brushes out of synthetic brushes instead of real sable.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This works for what I want it for in doing watercolors.  It is not quite as nice as the Kolinsky Sable brushes I lost, but it is a nice fill in for now.  I would buy it again.\nReview Title: Used For Watercolors, It Works Well For Small Details\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Kaneles 80s Costumes Wig for Men Long Curly Brown Gradient White 70s Heavy Metal Rocker Mullet Wig Anime Wig\nReview Date: 2020/07/10\nStore: Kaneles\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Material': 'Metal', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Brand': 'Kaneles', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'UPC': '697478158649'}\nReview Text: I have been working with wigs for quite a few years now.  One thing I know is a good quality vs not so great quality wig.  Let's take a look at this one.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br /><br />HAIR<br />This wig has some great hair. the colors are definitely platinum white and what I would call light auburn base hairs.  The white hairs are about 1/3 or so longer than the auburn hairs.  There is a nice kink to the hairs.<br /><br />THICKNESS<br />That is where this wig is sadly lacking.  At the top, the wefts of hair are way too far apart. The lace in the cap is a very light butter colored yellow.  The hair is not too thin, but it is not quite thick enough to cover hair below.  Yes, this comes with a nylon cap, but it just is not comfortable with those.  If you have dark hair it will definitely show the bright colored lace and elastics through the wig when the wind blows.<br /><br />BANGS/STYLE<br />That is where this wig is just not practical unless you don't mind looking stupid for a party or Halloween.  The bangs are WAY too long for anyone to wear.  That usually would not be a problem, but what you will get instead of the cool light ends on the entire head is chopped bang that is bland looking and then these white cool looking ends around the head.  The bangs are best cut painstakingly so that the auburn is cut way shorter (about 2/3) than the white hairs.  That takes a lot of time but worth the effort.  Then you have to cut them at a staggered manner.<br /><br />Other than the bangs being hard to trim so you can at least function with this wig on, the overall style is fabulous.  I love how it falls and looks while on the head.<br /><br />ELASTIC BANDS<br />Inside the wig, there are elastic bands with hooks to help hold the wig on the head. You might want to take them down to the spot you like it in as the hooks have a tendency to come undone during wearing.<br /><br />WHAT I WANT IN A WIG<br />Believe it or not, I would actually wear a wig like this with the right outfit, and not to be silly either.  I prefer wigs that look authentic,, and can be worn realistically as well as for fun.<br /><br />1.  I have to be able to see out of it<br />2.  I have to be able to wear it comfortably without fussing<br />3.  I want it to not have my real hair showing<br />4.  I want it to look realistic<br />5.  I want it to last for quite a few wearings<br /><br />DOES THIS WIG PASS THE TEST?<br />I am giving this wig THREE stars because it is hard to wear and see.  In order to trim this in a realistic manner, I have to take a LOT of time and that takes stars off for me.  I happen to love the style and coloring, so I am wiling to put the work into it, but honestly, I think it should be a bit shorter in the bangs area since it is so hard to trim and keep it looking real.  Also, the wefting on the top is just a bit too widely spaced.  I wish also that the cap was made with light auburn lace and elastic instead of the icy yellow colors.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />If you want to wear this for fun, it will be hard to see and hard to trim and not look silly in this.  It is comfortable and the style is epic, but there will be work required.  You can bandana it to help, but it still will look a bit floppy unless trimmed a little bit in the bangs/fringe area.  I like this, but it takes work to wear and not look silly for me.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />THREE STARS.  The trimming of the bangs is VERY time consuming since we only have one shot at it and if it is screwed up, then the wig is toast.  I wish there was more hair on top and that the lace cap did not show as easily.  A darker cap underneath (light auburn color) would have been much nicer with this.  I will still use this, but it could have been a bit nicer with small inexpensive changes.\nReview Title: Halloween Or Messing Around Okay, But Serious Wear, Not So Much\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Catrice | SUNGASM Luminizing Bronzer 02 | For A Sun-Kissed Shimmery Finish | Highly Pigmented & Blendable | Vegan, Paraben Free, Oil Free | Cruelty Free\nReview Date: 2020/07/31\nStore: Catrice\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Coverage': 'Full', 'Brand': 'Catrice', 'Color': 'C02 Bronzed Euphoria', 'Product Dimensions': '2.72 x 2.72 x 0.51 inches; 1.52 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I am a makeup artist.  I am always finding ways to make cosmetics work for all sorts of uses to get the best look and bang for the buck.  This Luminating Bronzer has some surprises up its sleeve.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />COMPACT<br />This comes in a heavy cardboard compact with a strong cardboard hinge on it.  There is no mirror.  The pan inside has printed letters and design on it.  In this case, the color is number 2, the darker of the two in this collection.<br /><br />WHAT COLOR IS THIS?<br />This bronzer is a unique color.  Instead of being the usual brown or orange color so many bronzers are, this one is a rose toned base which at first seems unusual.  If used on cooler toned skin, you will still see a luminzer effect but the undertone is more of a rose tan.<br /><br />WHAT COLOR SKIN DID I USE THIS ON?<br />Right now, I tried this on two colors of skin.  One was translated into MAC foundation color as NC27- a tanned color which leans toward the cooler side, and NW25 which is a cooler lighter caucasian leaning color.<br /><br />EFFECTS?<br />Things like this have a need for you to choose the right brush.  The wrong brush can make it look horrible.  The right brush can make it look like a million bucks.  When used with a STIPPLING brush (look that up to find out what that means), this bronzer provides the perfect luminescence and glow along with color.<br /><br />You can see the cheekbones highlighted and see the spot of color, but it is subtle, and not overbearing.<br /><br />If you use the dense fluffy brush like you might use to apply blush, the results border on ridiculous.  It is like you have smears of bright shimmer on and it is hard to blend in well.<br /><br />WHAT OTHER USES?<br />Interestingly, I have both color 1 and 2 of this line of Sungasm bronzers.  When using this particular color 2 on the creases of the eyes, it provides a GORGEOUS natural look similar to the old J Lo type look or other natural based looks which in reality take a lot of makeup but they just don't look like it.<br /><br />This put together with color 1 in this series, the two together make a great duo on the eyes.  It really is amazing.  It brings out the color of the eyes perfectly.  In fact, I use the lighter one on the upper cheekbones for highlight/bronzer and the darker number 2 under it and blend well.  The effect is subtle but beautiful.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY TO EYES<br />I have used good shadow brushes and my finger as well.  The idea is for medium to subtle color, use a tear drop shaped shadow brush.  For more intensity use a flat eye shadow brush on top of eye primer and blend once you have applied the other colors.  For a quick application, I have successfully used my fingers.<br /><br />DOES IT BURN ON THE EYES?<br />I have a terrible time with products on my eyes.  They usually burn and give me trouble.  This bronzer did not do that.  If you are concerned, be sure to get a good eye primer that you are comfortable with and use that first on your eyes.<br /><br />WHAT ABOUT DARKER SKIN TONES?<br />If you use this on darker skin tones, there is a good chance it could show up a bit on the ghostly side.  It has to be applied very lightly and blended well a little at a time to test the best depth if you want to try it.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Not only as a gorgeous rose based bronzer highlighter, but also as a contour or all over eye shadow, this color bronzer is a great price with good performance.  It is not the usual color for bronzers but it works on medium to lighter skin tones.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This is a great multi purpose product for summer.  It doubles as bronzer and luminzer but also as a great eye shadow.\nReview Title: Nice As Bronzer On Cooler Toned Skin, But Fabulous Eye Shadow Too,- Read On\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Catrice | SUNGASM Luminizing Bronzer 01 | For A Sun-Kissed Shimmery Finish | Highly Pigmented & Blendable | Vegan, Paraben Free, Oil Free | Cruelty Free\nReview Date: 2020/07/31\nStore: Catrice\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Brand': 'Catrice', 'Color': 'C01 Golden Ecstasy', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Product Dimensions': '2.72 x 2.72 x 0.51 inches; 1.27 Ounces'}\nReview Text: As a makeup artist, I am always trying to find ways to get the most mileage out of the products that I use.

It is still on the cooler side, but light warmer skin tones could use this too.<br /><br />TYPE OF SKIN TESTED ON?<br />This was tested on both MAC translation of skin tones NW 25 (which is what you see in the photos) and NC37 which is a more tan but cooler skin tone.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY?<br />This applies well but you have to be sure you find the right brush.  A stippling brush was the best way to get a natural look from this bronzer and highlighter.  It allows for subtle application so that it does not look like you have on too much.  If you use too dense of a brush, it is easy to get a stripe of glow on your face that others will see and it can really look odd.  You also need to get a fresh brush and blend it very well into your skin.  Apply this in the backwards 3 figure on each side of your face.  Imagine two 3s in a mirror image on your face with the tips and centers touching.<br /><br />ANY OTHER USES?<br />I found that this also makes a fabulous eye shadow.  I found it to be a perfect match with the other color in this series of number 2 which is a darker more rose brown color.  This is a great companion to that.  If this is all you have, It also makes a great eye shadow alone or with another lighter satin finish shadow or even a matte.  I would not go super frosty.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY TO EYES<br />In terms of eyes, you can use this as a contour, all over color, or in combination with the other darker color of this Sungasm series or another set of shadows.  The application is best for a lighter look to use a teardrop shaped brush.  Then for a heavier look with more color, a flat eye shadow brush packing this gently into place over a good eye primer is the way to go.  For a quick application, you can also use a finger to apply and blend it with a brush or your finger<br /><br />ANY IRRITATION PROBLEMS?<br />I am VERY sensitive and did not have any problems with this product on the face or eyes.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />As long as you are willing to take some time to find the right brush for the application of this, this bronzer is a pretty color especially for cooler toned skin.  It is a good highlighter for darker skin tones as a highlighter, though.  This is beautiful on the face, eyes, and in tandem with the other color of this bronzer too.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This is a nice bronzer and I am surprised at how well it works on cooler skin tones, something that is not all that easy to find, especially in TWO colors of a collections.\nReview Title: GReat Bronzer For Medium To Lighter Skin Tones, But Great Eye Shadow Too- Read On\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: 100Pcs Baby Hair Ties for Girls and Kids Elastic Toddler Hair Ties, Cotton Toddler Hair Ties , Candy Color Small Seamless Hair Ties, No Crease Soft Hair Accessories Ponytail Holders Assorted Colors\nReview Date: 2021/07/08\nStore: Geruicee\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Color': 'B', 'Material': 'Rubber', 'Item Form': 'Elastic', 'Brand': 'Geruicee', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '0.31 x 5.28 x 5.43 inches', 'Product Dimensions': '0.31 x 5.28 x 5.43 inches; 1.34 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Geruicee'}\nReview Text: I have baby fine hair.

She has to go to a camp which has a lot of other teens at it for a week to work for a city reach out program.  She wanted to bring her Clarisonic, but I talked her into trying this one out.  It is easy to transport and use and if it is lost or taken, it is not as expensive to replace.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS BRUSH LIKE?<br />First of all, this comes in a nice hard case which is great for travel.  It comes with one soft brush for daily use and a harder brush for once a week or so use.  There is a silicone brush head which is for dry sensitive skin types.  The brush runs on batteries which did not come with our unit.  They are AA batteries.  There are two speeds- slower for daily use and higher for the harder brush to exfoliate.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT WORK?<br />There are two speeds.  The first speed is very slow and my daughter is not fond of it.  She prefers to use it on the second speed which is faster.  Since it runs on batteries, it is not going to have the consistency as a plug in version.  My daughter prefers the exfoliating brush and uses it 2 times a week.  She feels that it cleans her skin as good or better than her Clarisonic Mia as it gets rid of the dead skin cells leaving her skin softer and more clear too.<br /><br />It seems to be very waterproof.  My daughter uses this in the shower and has had no problems with it.  After almost a month of use, twice a week, she is not having problems with the batteries running down yet.  She does  a lot of house sitting so having this handy has been great.<br /><br />AFTER EXFOLIATING BRUSH<br />After using the exfoliating brush, my daughter wanted me to mention that it is important to put on good moisturizer as the skin has been exfoliated well and you will need to make sure to use moisturizer on the face to protect the skin as it repairs.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />If you want the cleaning of a Clarisonic Mia but want something more travel friendly that cleans well, this might be a brush for you to try out.  Working best on the second speed with the exfoliating brush, twice a week does the trick for our daughter.  She really likes it and thinks it works as good or at times better than her Clarisonic Mia which she still has.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS for this one although it is not fair to grade it against the Clarisonic which is electrically powered, it works as well but does have the battery power.  I debated giving it four stars, but it does work better than any battery powered brush we have tested so far, so I am leaving it at five.  The soft brush is not too great, though, so perhaps see this as FOUR AND A HALF.\nBest Battery Powered Brush We Have Ever Used Cleans As Good As Clarisonic Which We Also Have\nManicure and Pedicure Nail Clipper from POWERGROOMING - Powerful Trimmer for Thick and Thin Finger Nails and Toe Nails - Included Nail File and\"Catcher\" for Easy Cleanup (1 Pack)\nPOWERGROOMING\n{'Brand': 'POWERGROOMING', 'Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Blade Edge': 'Straight', 'Blade Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Target Audience': 'Women, Men', 'Package Dimensions': '3.8 x 1.3 x 1 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'UPC': '653233212735', 'Manufacturer': 'POWERGROOMING'}\nI don't know about you, but our household goes through nail clippers fast.  Most of the time they don't cut right, or they just don't last.  Toenail clippers- well it is even harder to find a decent pair.  Let's see how this set measured up for us..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS NAIL CLIPPER SET LIKE?<br />This set comes with a hefty set of nail clippers.  It says it is for fingernails and toenails.  More on that in a minute.  The clipper comes with a catch all for the clippings.  It also comes with a faux leather snap shut case that also houses a nail file.<br /><br />HOW DO THESE CLIPPER PERFORM?<br />These clippers are surprinsingly nice.  I tried them on both finger and toe nails and they worked very well.  I did not get any ragged edges, or dull bent nails or anything else that I usually have problems with regarding most clippers.  I did even have good results on the thickest nail which is on the largest toe.<br /><br />WHO MIGHT NOT BENEFIT BY THESE CLIPPERS?'<br />The only person I would think would not benefit from these are those who deal with very thick elderly nails.  Those need special clippers.<br /><br />THE NAIL FILE<br />The nail file is nice, very fine grade of file, this files nails decently.  The tip is not overly great at cleaning under the nail but it works okay.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This nail clipper seems to work well on finger and toe nails not having any trouble with ragged edges or dull bending of nails.  The enclosed case is great in that it keeps the file and clippers together.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS. I like the whole set although the nail file could be a bit better.\nFINALLY Truly Nice Toenail Clippers & Bonuses\nCurling Iron 1\u00bc'' with 24k Gold,\u00a0Hair Curler Curling Wand with Dual Voltage for All Hair Types\n{'Package Dimensions': '11.2 x 9.2 x 2.3 inches; 1.95 Pounds', 'UPC': '714453116958'}\nWhen it comes to styling devices, my family all has different preferences because we all have different hair.  This looked like a really great product.  Let's take a look..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This comes in a nice box, well packed in a fancy presentation and comes with a little manual.  The device has four buttons on it which are power, temp up or temp down or timer.  The bent curling iron is supposed to be more handy to use.<br /><br />MANUAL<br />The manual is bare bones.  It looks fancy but never tells what temperature or time would be good to start with for different types of hair.  That was very disappointing.  It does tell how to basically press the buttons and what they are for, however.<br /><br />HOW DID THIS PERFORM?<br />We tried this several times on various occasions.  Each time, we set the temperature higher and higher until we were at the top temp but very few of the curls we tried making worked.  The hair simply had a light bend in it.  When using a different curling iron with each person, the hair looked great.  Finally after trying for the last time today, we have determined that this curling iron just does not work.  I am not sure if we got a bad one or what, but it just does not do hardly anything except leaving a partial bend in the hair no matter how we wind it.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Although a great concept, this curling iron did not seem to curl hair properly no matter what hair we used it on or how high or low the temperature was set.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />TWO STARS.  Great idea, just didn't work at all for us.\nWe Tried EVERYTHING To Get This To Work\nMountain Falls Regular Nail Polish Remover for Natural Nails with Vitamin E and Panthenol, 10 Fluid Ounce\nMountain Falls\n{'Brand': 'Mountain Falls', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Item Weight': '0.7 Pounds', 'Unit Count': '10 Fl Oz'}\nWhen it comes to nail polish remover, I have two choices.  I use either the store brand, or professional brand, which is often pure acetone used in tough removal like gel polish.  Let's look at this one.<br /><br />WHAT TYPE OF POLISH?<br />I had on a very dark red polish which was wearing very intensely for a week.  Removal with some removers would leave red stains everywhere.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This polish remover comes in the same type of bottle most store brands do.  There is no special scent and it is typical remover.<br /><br />HOW DID THIS PERFORM?<br />This polish remover took off the red polish with no problem, left no red staining, and did not leave my nails completely parched like some harsher ones might.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This polish removes regular nail polish (not talking about gel here) very well.  It does not leave nails too stripped.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />Five stars.  It does what it is supposed to to without excessive problems or smells.\nRemoves Regular (Not Gel) Tough Polish Well, Does Not Leave Nails Parched\nElegant Compact Lighted Makeup Mirror for Travel, Purse and Handbags,1X and 10X Magnifying Handheld Makeup Mirror with 12 LEDs Lights,Double Side LED Travel Makeup Mirror(White)\ndeweisn\n{'Package Dimensions': '4.2 x 4.1 x 0.9 inches; 2.82 Ounces'}\nI was spoiled.  I had a wonderful big compact mirror from OTT LITE some time ago.  I used it a lot.  However, it broke and I could not replace it.  I was hoping  Let's take a look.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This mirror closes and snaps shut with a plastic clip on it.  It says open, but honestly, it is not easy to do.  Once open, the inside has the 10X magnifier on one side and the reguiar mirror surrounded by the light ring.<br /><br />ON/OFF<br />This has one light brightness- on.  There is a little switch on the back that you push from one side to the other to turn it on and off.  It does not shut the light off when you close it.<br /><br />CASE<br />The case is quite slick.  If it is cold out and my hands are cold, it is sometimes a bit tough to hold on to this.  Most of the time it is not a problem.<br /><br />BRIGHTNESS<br />This is a bit too bright for me.  It really does seem to be so bright that I can not look into the regular mirror long, but the magnifier is okay IF I REALLY WANT TO SEE MY PORES.  Sorry, but it is a bit overwhelming.<br /><br />BATTERIES<br />This takes 2 CR2032 batteries.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />I am not really that impressed with this mirror.  It works, but it is a bit frustrating to open, and bright to look into.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />THREE STARS.  This works, but it is not the best light in my opinion.  That little switch on the back could easily be damaged in my purse.\nNot Quite As Nice As I Had Hoped- BLINDING At Times\nBE PLAIN Vitamin Ampoule 1.01 fl oz. - Korean Multi Vitamin Serum for Face with Vitamin B, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Hyaluronic Acid\nBe Plain\n{'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'Be Plain', 'Item Weight': '30 Grams', 'Item Volume': '30 Milliliters', 'Unit Count': '1.01 Fl Oz', 'Product Dimensions': '1.57 x 1.57 x 3.74 inches; 1.06 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'BP008'}\nI am always on the lookout for really nice simple skin care.  Let's take a look at this ampule.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This is a clear solution that comes out with an eye dropper.<br /><br />HOW TO USE<br />The idea is that you use a toner on your CLEAN face, apply this to the face and neck and chest, and then follow up with a moisturizer.<br /><br />WHAT DOES IT PROMISE TO DO?<br />This promises to lighted dark spots, and add firmness, glow, and hydration.<br /><br />DOES IT DO WHAT IT SAYS?<br />I used this with another Korean toner which is pretty simple, and also the BE PLAIN Aqua moisturizer.  When used, this did not seem to moisturize that much on its own, and for brightness and glow, I would say not over WOW factor after using for a month.<br /><br />DID SKIN LOOK FIRMER?<br />I guess you could say my skin looked a bit firmer, but nothing so dramatic that people said, \"WOW, WHAT ARE YOU USING ON YOUR FACE?\"<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a scent free, easy to use serum for the face.  It works well with moisturizer, is simple, scent free, and gives a moderate amount of what it says it will do.  It is not remarkable, but it is not terrible either.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  This is decent, but not my favorite product at this point.\nSimple Scent Free Skin Care Absorbs Easily Does It Do What It Says?\nIryasa Night Indulge Cream - Natural Face Cream for Dry Skin - Vegan Anti Aging Night Cream for Women - Firming Cream for Face and Neck - Organic Vitamin C Moisturizer for Face - 1.7oz\nIRYASA\n{'Brand': 'IRYASA', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '1.7 Ounce', 'Use for': 'Face', 'Skin Type': 'Mature', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2.76 x 2.76 x 2.2 inches; 1.76 Ounces'}\nI am all about natural skin care.  When I read about this product and the lovely smell it had, I was very excited to try it.  Let's take a look.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This cream is yellow in color- very pale yellow.  It is creamy but not heavy.  There is a very faint lemon smell, but there is also a smell which is not good- almost like the oils in the cream are about to turn completely rancid.  They are not quite there yet, but I have used enough products over time where I recognize that smell.<br /><br />That is not necessarily the fault of the cream.  This could have been kept in a hot warehouse too long, or who knows what.  The manufacture date on my box is April 2019.  That is over a year old already.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT WORK?<br />Since it is not unbearable at this point, I wanted to at least test the product for a few days.  There was no burning or stinging, so it is still okay to use for now.  The product is quite nice.  It does soak in quickly and it does not leave the face greasy at all.<br /><br />WHAT IS THE EFFECT ON SKIN?<br />The next morning after using this, I will say that the skin is left looking like it has a slight glow to it.  It does leave the skin looking much nicer than other creams I have used.  It is warmer weather right now and this cream is still not leaving the face greasy or heavy at all.  My skin is definitely left looking nice the next morning.<br /><br />ANY SENSITIVITY?<br />I have not had any sensitivity to the sun or anything else yet.  Like I said, I can not use this long as it is ready to turn bad soon so I only have a short time.  For now, it is really nice.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />I really wish that this cream was fresher than it is.  The product manufacture date on it is April of 2019.  I am really disappointed that I could not test it at its best because it has great potential to be a really nice cream.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS- I can not give this five stars in its current state.  It is potentially really nice cream though.  If you get a fresh one, I imagine it is really nice.  Just make sure to use it up and if you live in a hot climate, keep it in the refrigerator or air conditioning.\nSeems To Work, But I Think Mine Might Be Going Rancid\nJARGOD 1pcs 100% Kolinsky Sable Acrylic Nails Round Nail Art Brush (size 4)\nJARGOD\n{'Brand': 'JARGOD', 'Handle Material': 'Acrylic', 'Head Material': 'Kolinsky', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '7.7 x 0.3 x 0.3 inches; 0.63 Ounces'}\nI have a set of Kolinsky sable brushes which moths got at a while ago and I have been wanting to replace them.  This was a perfect shape for me, so I got it.  Let's see what happened.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This has a wood handle for nails or even watercolor painting- it is a nice solid wood handle.  The brush itself is a teardrop shape with a very fine point.  The ferrule is average, nothing WOW, but not awful either.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?<br />This brush has a nice pocket in it which absorbs the watercolor when using it.  It will gradually disperse the paint in a nice thin line, but it does make it so I don't have to dip it as constantly as with a narrow brush.  As for smoothness of lines and how it paints, I really like it.  It is great for small areas of paintings.<br /><br />CLEANING<br />I clean this regularly in the same product that I use for cleaning wool when it is time to store it.  It has deterrent to moths in it.  Other than that, I just clean with water most of the time and only use the other stuff when i am going to put it away for any length of time.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Although this can be used for nails, I prefer it for watercolor.  I like nail brushes out of synthetic brushes instead of real sable.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This works for what I want it for in doing watercolors.  It is not quite as nice as the Kolinsky Sable brushes I lost, but it is a nice fill in for now.  I would buy it again.\nUsed For Watercolors, It Works Well For Small Details\nKaneles 80s Costumes Wig for Men Long Curly Brown Gradient White 70s Heavy Metal Rocker Mullet Wig Anime Wig\nKaneles\n{'Material': 'Metal', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Brand': 'Kaneles', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'UPC': '697478158649'}\nI have been working with wigs for quite a few years now.  One thing I know is a good quality vs not so great quality wig.  Let's take a look at this one.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br /><br />HAIR<br />This wig has some great hair. the colors are definitely platinum white and what I would call light auburn base hairs.  The white hairs are about 1/3 or so longer than the auburn hairs.  There is a nice kink to the hairs.<br /><br />THICKNESS<br />That is where this wig is sadly lacking.  At the top, the wefts of hair are way too far apart. The lace in the cap is a very light butter colored yellow.  The hair is not too thin, but it is not quite thick enough to cover hair below.  Yes, this comes with a nylon cap, but it just is not comfortable with those.  If you have dark hair it will definitely show the bright colored lace and elastics through the wig when the wind blows.<br /><br />BANGS/STYLE<br />That is where this wig is just not practical unless you don't mind looking stupid for a party or Halloween.  The bangs are WAY too long for anyone to wear.  That usually would not be a problem, but what you will get instead of the cool light ends on the entire head is chopped bang that is bland looking and then these white cool looking ends around the head.  The bangs are best cut painstakingly so that the auburn is cut way shorter (about 2/3) than the white hairs.  That takes a lot of time but worth the effort.  Then you have to cut them at a staggered manner.<br /><br />Other than the bangs being hard to trim so you can at least function with this wig on, the overall style is fabulous.  I love how it falls and looks while on the head.<br /><br />ELASTIC BANDS<br />Inside the wig, there are elastic bands with hooks to help hold the wig on the head. You might want to take them down to the spot you like it in as the hooks have a tendency to come undone during wearing.<br /><br />WHAT I WANT IN A WIG<br />Believe it or not, I would actually wear a wig like this with the right outfit, and not to be silly either.  I prefer wigs that look authentic,, and can be worn realistically as well as for fun.<br /><br />1.  I have to be able to see out of it<br />2.  I have to be able to wear it comfortably without fussing<br />3.  I want it to not have my real hair showing<br />4.  I want it to look realistic<br />5.  I want it to last for quite a few wearings<br /><br />DOES THIS WIG PASS THE TEST?<br />I am giving this wig THREE stars because it is hard to wear and see.  In order to trim this in a realistic manner, I have to take a LOT of time and that takes stars off for me.  I happen to love the style and coloring, so I am wiling to put the work into it, but honestly, I think it should be a bit shorter in the bangs area since it is so hard to trim and keep it looking real.  Also, the wefting on the top is just a bit too widely spaced.  I wish also that the cap was made with light auburn lace and elastic instead of the icy yellow colors.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />If you want to wear this for fun, it will be hard to see and hard to trim and not look silly in this.  It is comfortable and the style is epic, but there will be work required.  You can bandana it to help, but it still will look a bit floppy unless trimmed a little bit in the bangs/fringe area.  I like this, but it takes work to wear and not look silly for me.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />THREE STARS.  The trimming of the bangs is VERY time consuming since we only have one shot at it and if it is screwed up, then the wig is toast.  I wish there was more hair on top and that the lace cap did not show as easily.  A darker cap underneath (light auburn color) would have been much nicer with this.  I will still use this, but it could have been a bit nicer with small inexpensive changes.\nHalloween Or Messing Around Okay, But Serious Wear, Not So Much\nCatrice | SUNGASM Luminizing Bronzer 02 | For A Sun-Kissed Shimmery Finish | Highly Pigmented & Blendable | Vegan, Paraben Free, Oil Free | Cruelty Free\nCatrice\n{'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Coverage': 'Full', 'Brand': 'Catrice', 'Color': 'C02 Bronzed Euphoria', 'Product Dimensions': '2.72 x 2.72 x 0.51 inches; 1.52 Ounces'}\nI am a makeup artist.  I am always finding ways to make cosmetics work for all sorts of uses to get the best look and bang for the buck.  This Luminating Bronzer has some surprises up its sleeve.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />COMPACT<br />This comes in a heavy cardboard compact with a strong cardboard hinge on it.  There is no mirror.  The pan inside has printed letters and design on it.  In this case, the color is number 2, the darker of the two in this collection.<br /><br />WHAT COLOR IS THIS?<br />This bronzer is a unique color.  Instead of being the usual brown or orange color so many bronzers are, this one is a rose toned base which at first seems unusual.  If used on cooler toned skin, you will still see a luminzer effect but the undertone is more of a rose tan.<br /><br />WHAT COLOR SKIN DID I USE THIS ON?<br />Right now, I tried this on two colors of skin.  One was translated into MAC foundation color as NC27- a tanned color which leans toward the cooler side, and NW25 which is a cooler lighter caucasian leaning color.<br /><br />EFFECTS?<br />Things like this have a need for you to choose the right brush.  The wrong brush can make it look horrible.  The right brush can make it look like a million bucks.  When used with a STIPPLING brush (look that up to find out what that means), this bronzer provides the perfect luminescence and glow along with color.<br /><br />You can see the cheekbones highlighted and see the spot of color, but it is subtle, and not overbearing.<br /><br />If you use the dense fluffy brush like you might use to apply blush, the results border on ridiculous.  It is like you have smears of bright shimmer on and it is hard to blend in well.<br /><br />WHAT OTHER USES?<br />Interestingly, I have both color 1 and 2 of this line of Sungasm bronzers.  When using this particular color 2 on the creases of the eyes, it provides a GORGEOUS natural look similar to the old J Lo type look or other natural based looks which in reality take a lot of makeup but they just don't look like it.<br /><br />This put together with color 1 in this series, the two together make a great duo on the eyes.  It really is amazing.  It brings out the color of the eyes perfectly.  In fact, I use the lighter one on the upper cheekbones for highlight/bronzer and the darker number 2 under it and blend well.  The effect is subtle but beautiful.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY TO EYES<br />I have used good shadow brushes and my finger as well.  The idea is for medium to subtle color, use a tear drop shaped shadow brush.  For more intensity use a flat eye shadow brush on top of eye primer and blend once you have applied the other colors.  For a quick application, I have successfully used my fingers.<br /><br />DOES IT BURN ON THE EYES?<br />I have a terrible time with products on my eyes.  They usually burn and give me trouble.  This bronzer did not do that.  If you are concerned, be sure to get a good eye primer that you are comfortable with and use that first on your eyes.<br /><br />WHAT ABOUT DARKER SKIN TONES?<br />If you use this on darker skin tones, there is a good chance it could show up a bit on the ghostly side.  It has to be applied very lightly and blended well a little at a time to test the best depth if you want to try it.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Not only as a gorgeous rose based bronzer highlighter, but also as a contour or all over eye shadow, this color bronzer is a great price with good performance.  It is not the usual color for bronzers but it works on medium to lighter skin tones.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This is a great multi purpose product for summer.  It doubles as bronzer and luminzer but also as a great eye shadow.\nNice As Bronzer On Cooler Toned Skin, But Fabulous Eye Shadow Too,- Read On\nCatrice | SUNGASM Luminizing Bronzer 01 | For A Sun-Kissed Shimmery Finish | Highly Pigmented & Blendable | Vegan, Paraben Free, Oil Free | Cruelty Free\nCatrice\n{'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Brand': 'Catrice', 'Color': 'C01 Golden Ecstasy', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Product Dimensions': '2.72 x 2.72 x 0.51 inches; 1.27 Ounces'}\nAs a makeup artist, I am always trying to find ways to get the most mileage out of the products that I use.  This bronzer had some surprises to it.  Read on..<br /><br />PHOTO- My photo has swatches of both color 1 and 2 which are labeled.  I tried to get accurate photos colorwise and it is hard to do as the camera does not capture the nuances.  When applied with a brush, the effect is MUCH lighter.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />COMPACT<br />The compact is a high layered cardboard with a strong hinge to it.  There is no mirror and the pan inside has the product with designs pressed into it.  It does not come with a brush.<br /><br />WHAT IS THE COLOR LIKE?<br />This color is more of a bronze gold color.  It is still on the cooler side, but light warmer skin tones could use this too.<br /><br />TYPE OF SKIN TESTED ON?<br />This was tested on both MAC translation of skin tones NW 25 (which is what you see in the photos) and NC37 which is a more tan but cooler skin tone.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY?<br />This applies well but you have to be sure you find the right brush.  A stippling brush was the best way to get a natural look from this bronzer and highlighter.  It allows for subtle application so that it does not look like you have on too much.  If you use too dense of a brush, it is easy to get a stripe of glow on your face that others will see and it can really look odd.  You also need to get a fresh brush and blend it very well into your skin.  Apply this in the backwards 3 figure on each side of your face.  Imagine two 3s in a mirror image on your face with the tips and centers touching.<br /><br />ANY OTHER USES?<br />I found that this also makes a fabulous eye shadow.  I found it to be a perfect match with the other color in this series of number 2 which is a darker more rose brown color.  This is a great companion to that.  If this is all you have, It also makes a great eye shadow alone or with another lighter satin finish shadow or even a matte.  I would not go super frosty.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY TO EYES<br />In terms of eyes, you can use this as a contour, all over color, or in combination with the other darker color of this Sungasm series or another set of shadows.  The application is best for a lighter look to use a teardrop shaped brush.  Then for a heavier look with more color, a flat eye shadow brush packing this gently into place over a good eye primer is the way to go.  For a quick application, you can also use a finger to apply and blend it with a brush or your finger<br /><br />ANY IRRITATION PROBLEMS?<br />I am VERY sensitive and did not have any problems with this product on the face or eyes.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />As long as you are willing to take some time to find the right brush for the application of this, this bronzer is a pretty color especially for cooler toned skin.  It is a good highlighter for darker skin tones as a highlighter, though.  This is beautiful on the face, eyes, and in tandem with the other color of this bronzer too.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This is a nice bronzer and I am surprised at how well it works on cooler skin tones, something that is not all that easy to find, especially in TWO colors of a collections.\nGReat Bronzer For Medium To Lighter Skin Tones, But Great Eye Shadow Too- Read On\n100Pcs Baby Hair Ties for Girls and Kids Elastic Toddler Hair Ties, Cotton Toddler Hair Ties , Candy Color Small Seamless Hair Ties, No Crease Soft Hair Accessories Ponytail Holders Assorted Colors\nGeruicee\n{'Color': 'B', 'Material': 'Rubber', 'Item Form': 'Elastic', 'Brand': 'Geruicee', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '0.31 x 5.28 x 5.43 inches', 'Product Dimensions': '0.31 x 5.28 x 5.43 inches; 1.34 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Geruicee'}\nI have baby fine hair.

Then I apply a Hyaluronic Acid serum on my skin.  After that, I use this Vitamin C lotion and I finish with the XXI firming lotion on top of that.  I only do this 1 time at night.<br /><br />RESULTS<br />The results of this product line have been really impressive.  My face has looked younger, more glowy, and my skin looks more awake and less tired.  I have been through a lot of deaths this year and my face has looked very tired.  I could not believe how much this and the other two XXI products affected how I look.  It was quite exciting for me right now.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />My skin glows after using this.  It is soft, moisturized and when combined with the other XXI cleanser and firming lotion, the results are impressive.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.

It did not burn or hurt at all, it felt nice.<br /><br />HAIR CLEAN?<br />I have very fine hair which is easily weighed down.  It is hard to find a shampoo that encourages volume, does not make my hair look flat, and that does not make it full of static.  This shampoo leaves my hair clean for a few days and it somewhat encourages waves.  I can not comment on static, as it is not near winter yet.  My hair was not left dry or frizzy at all.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a nice shampoo.  It is a small bottle, but a little bit goes a long way.

She has to go to a camp which has a lot of other teens at it for a week to work for a city reach out program.  She wanted to bring her Clarisonic, but I talked her into trying this one out.  It is easy to transport and use and if it is lost or taken, it is not as expensive to replace.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS BRUSH LIKE?<br />First of all, this comes in a nice hard case which is great for travel.  It comes with one soft brush for daily use and a harder brush for once a week or so use.  There is a silicone brush head which is for dry sensitive skin types.  The brush runs on batteries which did not come with our unit.  They are AA batteries.  There are two speeds- slower for daily use and higher for the harder brush to exfoliate.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT WORK?<br />There are two speeds.  The first speed is very slow and my daughter is not fond of it.  She prefers to use it on the second speed which is faster.  Since it runs on batteries, it is not going to have the consistency as a plug in version.  My daughter prefers the exfoliating brush and uses it 2 times a week.  She feels that it cleans her skin as good or better than her Clarisonic Mia as it gets rid of the dead skin cells leaving her skin softer and more clear too.<br /><br />It seems to be very waterproof.  My daughter uses this in the shower and has had no problems with it.  After almost a month of use, twice a week, she is not having problems with the batteries running down yet.  She does  a lot of house sitting so having this handy has been great.<br /><br />AFTER EXFOLIATING BRUSH<br />After using the exfoliating brush, my daughter wanted me to mention that it is important to put on good moisturizer as the skin has been exfoliated well and you will need to make sure to use moisturizer on the face to protect the skin as it repairs.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />If you want the cleaning of a Clarisonic Mia but want something more travel friendly that cleans well, this might be a brush for you to try out.  Working best on the second speed with the exfoliating brush, twice a week does the trick for our daughter.  She really likes it and thinks it works as good or at times better than her Clarisonic Mia which she still has.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS for this one although it is not fair to grade it against the Clarisonic which is electrically powered, it works as well but does have the battery power.  I debated giving it four stars, but it does work better than any battery powered brush we have tested so far, so I am leaving it at five.  The soft brush is not too great, though, so perhaps see this as FOUR AND A HALF.\nReview Title: Best Battery Powered Brush We Have Ever Used Cleans As Good As Clarisonic Which We Also Have\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Manicure and Pedicure Nail Clipper from POWERGROOMING - Powerful Trimmer for Thick and Thin Finger Nails and Toe Nails - Included Nail File and\"Catcher\" for Easy Cleanup (1 Pack)\nReview Date: 2018/12/18\nStore: POWERGROOMING\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'POWERGROOMING', 'Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Blade Edge': 'Straight', 'Blade Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Target Audience': 'Women, Men', 'Package Dimensions': '3.8 x 1.3 x 1 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'UPC': '653233212735', 'Manufacturer': 'POWERGROOMING'}\nReview Text: I don't know about you, but our household goes through nail clippers fast.  Most of the time they don't cut right, or they just don't last.  Toenail clippers- well it is even harder to find a decent pair.  Let's see how this set measured up for us..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS NAIL CLIPPER SET LIKE?<br />This set comes with a hefty set of nail clippers.  It says it is for fingernails and toenails.  More on that in a minute.  The clipper comes with a catch all for the clippings.  It also comes with a faux leather snap shut case that also houses a nail file.<br /><br />HOW DO THESE CLIPPER PERFORM?<br />These clippers are surprinsingly nice.  I tried them on both finger and toe nails and they worked very well.  I did not get any ragged edges, or dull bent nails or anything else that I usually have problems with regarding most clippers.  I did even have good results on the thickest nail which is on the largest toe.<br /><br />WHO MIGHT NOT BENEFIT BY THESE CLIPPERS?'<br />The only person I would think would not benefit from these are those who deal with very thick elderly nails.

The tip is not overly great at cleaning under the nail but it works okay.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This nail clipper seems to work well on finger and toe nails not having any trouble with ragged edges or dull bending of nails.

The device has four buttons on it which are power, temp up or temp down or timer.  The bent curling iron is supposed to be more handy to use.<br /><br />MANUAL<br />The manual is bare bones.  It looks fancy but never tells what temperature or time would be good to start with for different types of hair.  That was very disappointing.  It does tell how to basically press the buttons and what they are for, however.<br /><br />HOW DID THIS PERFORM?<br />We tried this several times on various occasions.  Each time, we set the temperature higher and higher until we were at the top temp but very few of the curls we tried making worked.  The hair simply had a light bend in it.  When using a different curling iron with each person, the hair looked great.  Finally after trying for the last time today, we have determined that this curling iron just does not work.

I use either the store brand, or professional brand, which is often pure acetone used in tough removal like gel polish.  Let's look at this one.<br /><br />WHAT TYPE OF POLISH?<br />I had on a very dark red polish which was wearing very intensely for a week.  Removal with some removers would leave red stains everywhere.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This polish remover comes in the same type of bottle most store brands do.  There is no special scent and it is typical remover.<br /><br />HOW DID THIS PERFORM?<br />This polish remover took off the red polish with no problem, left no red staining, and did not leave my nails completely parched like some harsher ones might.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This polish removes regular nail polish (not talking about gel here) very well.  It does not leave nails too stripped.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />Five stars.  It does what it is supposed to to without excessive problems or smells.\nReview Title: Removes Regular (Not Gel) Tough Polish Well, Does Not Leave Nails Parched\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Elegant Compact Lighted Makeup Mirror for Travel, Purse and Handbags,1X and 10X Magnifying Handheld Makeup Mirror with 12 LEDs Lights,Double Side LED Travel Makeup Mirror(White)\nReview Date: 2020/02/05\nStore: deweisn\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '4.2 x 4.1 x 0.9 inches; 2.82 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I was spoiled.  I had a wonderful big compact mirror from OTT LITE some time ago.  I used it a lot.  However, it broke and I could not replace it.  I was hoping  Let's take a look.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This mirror closes and snaps shut with a plastic clip on it.  It says open, but honestly, it is not easy to do.  Once open, the inside has the 10X magnifier on one side and the reguiar mirror surrounded by the light ring.<br /><br />ON/OFF<br />This has one light brightness- on.  There is a little switch on the back that you push from one side to the other to turn it on and off.  It does not shut the light off when you close it.<br /><br />CASE<br />The case is quite slick.  If it is cold out and my hands are cold, it is sometimes a bit tough to hold on to this.  Most of the time it is not a problem.<br /><br />BRIGHTNESS<br />This is a bit too bright for me.  It really does seem to be so bright that I can not look into the regular mirror long, but the magnifier is okay IF I REALLY WANT TO SEE MY PORES.  Sorry, but it is a bit overwhelming.<br /><br />BATTERIES<br />This takes 2 CR2032 batteries.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />I am not really that impressed with this mirror.  It works, but it is a bit frustrating to open, and bright to look into.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />THREE STARS.  This works, but it is not the best light in my opinion.  That little switch on the back could easily be damaged in my purse.\nReview Title: Not Quite As Nice As I Had Hoped- BLINDING At Times\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: BE PLAIN Vitamin Ampoule 1.01 fl oz. - Korean Multi Vitamin Serum for Face with Vitamin B, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Hyaluronic Acid\nReview Date: 2020/04/23\nStore: Be Plain\nAverage Rating: 4.0\nProduct Details: {'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'Be Plain', 'Item Weight': '30 Grams', 'Item Volume': '30 Milliliters', 'Unit Count': '1.01 Fl Oz', 'Product Dimensions': '1.57 x 1.57 x 3.74 inches; 1.06 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'BP008'}\nReview Text: I am always on the lookout for really nice simple skin care.

When used, this did not seem to moisturize that much on its own, and for brightness and glow, I would say not over WOW factor after using for a month.<br /><br />DID SKIN LOOK FIRMER?<br />I guess you could say my skin looked a bit firmer, but nothing so dramatic that people said, \"WOW, WHAT ARE YOU USING ON YOUR FACE?\"<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a scent free, easy to use serum for the face.  It works well with moisturizer, is simple, scent free, and gives a moderate amount of what it says it will do.

When I read about this product and the lovely smell it had, I was very excited to try it.  Let's take a look.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This cream is yellow in color- very pale yellow.  It is creamy but not heavy.  There is a very faint lemon smell, but there is also a smell which is not good- almost like the oils in the cream are about to turn completely rancid.  They are not quite there yet, but I have used enough products over time where I recognize that smell.<br /><br />That is not necessarily the fault of the cream.  This could have been kept in a hot warehouse too long, or who knows what.  The manufacture date on my box is April 2019.  That is over a year old already.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT WORK?<br />Since it is not unbearable at this point, I wanted to at least test the product for a few days.  There was no burning or stinging, so it is still okay to use for now.  The product is quite nice.  It does soak in quickly and it does not leave the face greasy at all.<br /><br />WHAT IS THE EFFECT ON SKIN?<br />The next morning after using this, I will say that the skin is left looking like it has a slight glow to it.  It does leave the skin looking much nicer than other creams I have used.  It is warmer weather right now and this cream is still not leaving the face greasy or heavy at all.  My skin is definitely left looking nice the next morning.<br /><br />ANY SENSITIVITY?<br />I have not had any sensitivity to the sun or anything else yet.  Like I said, I can not use this long as it is ready to turn bad soon so I only have a short time.  For now, it is really nice.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />I really wish that this cream was fresher than it is.  The product manufacture date on it is April of 2019.  I am really disappointed that I could not test it at its best because it has great potential to be a really nice cream.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS- I can not give this five stars in its current state.  It is potentially really nice cream though.  If you get a fresh one, I imagine it is really nice.  Just make sure to use it up and if you live in a hot climate, keep it in the refrigerator or air conditioning.\nReview Title: Seems To Work, But I Think Mine Might Be Going Rancid\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: JARGOD 1pcs 100% Kolinsky Sable Acrylic Nails Round Nail Art Brush (size 4)\nReview Date: 2020/06/29\nStore: JARGOD\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'JARGOD', 'Handle Material': 'Acrylic', 'Head Material': 'Kolinsky', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '7.7 x 0.3 x 0.3 inches; 0.63 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I have a set of Kolinsky sable brushes which moths got at a while ago and I have been wanting to replace them.  This was a perfect shape for me, so I got it.  Let's see what happened.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This has a wood handle for nails or even watercolor painting- it is a nice solid wood handle.  The brush itself is a teardrop shape with a very fine point.  The ferrule is average, nothing WOW, but not awful either.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?<br />This brush has a nice pocket in it which absorbs the watercolor when using it.  It will gradually disperse the paint in a nice thin line, but it does make it so I don't have to dip it as constantly as with a narrow brush.  As for smoothness of lines and how it paints, I really like it.  It is great for small areas of paintings.<br /><br />CLEANING<br />I clean this regularly in the same product that I use for cleaning wool when it is time to store it.  It has deterrent to moths in it.  Other than that, I just clean with water most of the time and only use the other stuff when i am going to put it away for any length of time.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Although this can be used for nails, I prefer it for watercolor.  I like nail brushes out of synthetic brushes instead of real sable.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This works for what I want it for in doing watercolors.  It is not quite as nice as the Kolinsky Sable brushes I lost, but it is a nice fill in for now.  I would buy it again.\nReview Title: Used For Watercolors, It Works Well For Small Details\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Kaneles 80s Costumes Wig for Men Long Curly Brown Gradient White 70s Heavy Metal Rocker Mullet Wig Anime Wig\nReview Date: 2020/07/10\nStore: Kaneles\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Material': 'Metal', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Brand': 'Kaneles', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'UPC': '697478158649'}\nReview Text: I have been working with wigs for quite a few years now.  One thing I know is a good quality vs not so great quality wig.  Let's take a look at this one.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br /><br />HAIR<br />This wig has some great hair. the colors are definitely platinum white and what I would call light auburn base hairs.  The white hairs are about 1/3 or so longer than the auburn hairs.  There is a nice kink to the hairs.<br /><br />THICKNESS<br />That is where this wig is sadly lacking.  At the top, the wefts of hair are way too far apart. The lace in the cap is a very light butter colored yellow.  The hair is not too thin, but it is not quite thick enough to cover hair below.  Yes, this comes with a nylon cap, but it just is not comfortable with those.  If you have dark hair it will definitely show the bright colored lace and elastics through the wig when the wind blows.<br /><br />BANGS/STYLE<br />That is where this wig is just not practical unless you don't mind looking stupid for a party or Halloween.  The bangs are WAY too long for anyone to wear.  That usually would not be a problem, but what you will get instead of the cool light ends on the entire head is chopped bang that is bland looking and then these white cool looking ends around the head.  The bangs are best cut painstakingly so that the auburn is cut way shorter (about 2/3) than the white hairs.  That takes a lot of time but worth the effort.  Then you have to cut them at a staggered manner.<br /><br />Other than the bangs being hard to trim so you can at least function with this wig on, the overall style is fabulous.  I love how it falls and looks while on the head.<br /><br />ELASTIC BANDS<br />Inside the wig, there are elastic bands with hooks to help hold the wig on the head. You might want to take them down to the spot you like it in as the hooks have a tendency to come undone during wearing.<br /><br />WHAT I WANT IN A WIG<br />Believe it or not, I would actually wear a wig like this with the right outfit, and not to be silly either.  I prefer wigs that look authentic,, and can be worn realistically as well as for fun.<br /><br />1.  I have to be able to see out of it<br />2.  I have to be able to wear it comfortably without fussing<br />3.  I want it to not have my real hair showing<br />4.  I want it to look realistic<br />5.  I want it to last for quite a few wearings<br /><br />DOES THIS WIG PASS THE TEST?<br />I am giving this wig THREE stars because it is hard to wear and see.  In order to trim this in a realistic manner, I have to take a LOT of time and that takes stars off for me.  I happen to love the style and coloring, so I am wiling to put the work into it, but honestly, I think it should be a bit shorter in the bangs area since it is so hard to trim and keep it looking real.  Also, the wefting on the top is just a bit too widely spaced.  I wish also that the cap was made with light auburn lace and elastic instead of the icy yellow colors.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />If you want to wear this for fun, it will be hard to see and hard to trim and not look silly in this.  It is comfortable and the style is epic, but there will be work required.  You can bandana it to help, but it still will look a bit floppy unless trimmed a little bit in the bangs/fringe area.  I like this, but it takes work to wear and not look silly for me.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />THREE STARS.  The trimming of the bangs is VERY time consuming since we only have one shot at it and if it is screwed up, then the wig is toast.  I wish there was more hair on top and that the lace cap did not show as easily.  A darker cap underneath (light auburn color) would have been much nicer with this.  I will still use this, but it could have been a bit nicer with small inexpensive changes.\nReview Title: Halloween Or Messing Around Okay, But Serious Wear, Not So Much\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Catrice | SUNGASM Luminizing Bronzer 02 | For A Sun-Kissed Shimmery Finish | Highly Pigmented & Blendable | Vegan, Paraben Free, Oil Free | Cruelty Free\nReview Date: 2020/07/31\nStore: Catrice\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Coverage': 'Full', 'Brand': 'Catrice', 'Color': 'C02 Bronzed Euphoria', 'Product Dimensions': '2.72 x 2.72 x 0.51 inches; 1.52 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I am a makeup artist.  I am always finding ways to make cosmetics work for all sorts of uses to get the best look and bang for the buck.  This Luminating Bronzer has some surprises up its sleeve.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />COMPACT<br />This comes in a heavy cardboard compact with a strong cardboard hinge on it.  There is no mirror.  The pan inside has printed letters and design on it.  In this case, the color is number 2, the darker of the two in this collection.<br /><br />WHAT COLOR IS THIS?<br />This bronzer is a unique color.  Instead of being the usual brown or orange color so many bronzers are, this one is a rose toned base which at first seems unusual.  If used on cooler toned skin, you will still see a luminzer effect but the undertone is more of a rose tan.<br /><br />WHAT COLOR SKIN DID I USE THIS ON?<br />Right now, I tried this on two colors of skin.  One was translated into MAC foundation color as NC27- a tanned color which leans toward the cooler side, and NW25 which is a cooler lighter caucasian leaning color.<br /><br />EFFECTS?<br />Things like this have a need for you to choose the right brush.  The wrong brush can make it look horrible.  The right brush can make it look like a million bucks.  When used with a STIPPLING brush (look that up to find out what that means), this bronzer provides the perfect luminescence and glow along with color.<br /><br />You can see the cheekbones highlighted and see the spot of color, but it is subtle, and not overbearing.<br /><br />If you use the dense fluffy brush like you might use to apply blush, the results border on ridiculous.  It is like you have smears of bright shimmer on and it is hard to blend in well.<br /><br />WHAT OTHER USES?<br />Interestingly, I have both color 1 and 2 of this line of Sungasm bronzers.  When using this particular color 2 on the creases of the eyes, it provides a GORGEOUS natural look similar to the old J Lo type look or other natural based looks which in reality take a lot of makeup but they just don't look like it.<br /><br />This put together with color 1 in this series, the two together make a great duo on the eyes.  It really is amazing.  It brings out the color of the eyes perfectly.  In fact, I use the lighter one on the upper cheekbones for highlight/bronzer and the darker number 2 under it and blend well.  The effect is subtle but beautiful.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY TO EYES<br />I have used good shadow brushes and my finger as well.  The idea is for medium to subtle color, use a tear drop shaped shadow brush.  For more intensity use a flat eye shadow brush on top of eye primer and blend once you have applied the other colors.  For a quick application, I have successfully used my fingers.<br /><br />DOES IT BURN ON THE EYES?<br />I have a terrible time with products on my eyes.  They usually burn and give me trouble.  This bronzer did not do that.  If you are concerned, be sure to get a good eye primer that you are comfortable with and use that first on your eyes.<br /><br />WHAT ABOUT DARKER SKIN TONES?<br />If you use this on darker skin tones, there is a good chance it could show up a bit on the ghostly side.  It has to be applied very lightly and blended well a little at a time to test the best depth if you want to try it.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Not only as a gorgeous rose based bronzer highlighter, but also as a contour or all over eye shadow, this color bronzer is a great price with good performance.  It is not the usual color for bronzers but it works on medium to lighter skin tones.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This is a great multi purpose product for summer.  It doubles as bronzer and luminzer but also as a great eye shadow.\nReview Title: Nice As Bronzer On Cooler Toned Skin, But Fabulous Eye Shadow Too,- Read On\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Catrice | SUNGASM Luminizing Bronzer 01 | For A Sun-Kissed Shimmery Finish | Highly Pigmented & Blendable | Vegan, Paraben Free, Oil Free | Cruelty Free\nReview Date: 2020/07/31\nStore: Catrice\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Brand': 'Catrice', 'Color': 'C01 Golden Ecstasy', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Product Dimensions': '2.72 x 2.72 x 0.51 inches; 1.27 Ounces'}\nReview Text: As a makeup artist, I am always trying to find ways to get the most mileage out of the products that I use.  This bronzer had some surprises to it.  Read on..<br /><br />PHOTO- My photo has swatches of both color 1 and 2 which are labeled.  I tried to get accurate photos colorwise and it is hard to do as the camera does not capture the nuances.  When applied with a brush, the effect is MUCH lighter.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />COMPACT<br />The compact is a high layered cardboard with a strong hinge to it.  There is no mirror and the pan inside has the product with designs pressed into it.  It does not come with a brush.<br /><br />WHAT IS THE COLOR LIKE?<br />This color is more of a bronze gold color.  It is still on the cooler side, but light warmer skin tones could use this too.<br /><br />TYPE OF SKIN TESTED ON?<br />This was tested on both MAC translation of skin tones NW 25 (which is what you see in the photos) and NC37 which is a more tan but cooler skin tone.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY?<br />This applies well but you have to be sure you find the right brush.  A stippling brush was the best way to get a natural look from this bronzer and highlighter.  It allows for subtle application so that it does not look like you have on too much.  If you use too dense of a brush, it is easy to get a stripe of glow on your face that others will see and it can really look odd.  You also need to get a fresh brush and blend it very well into your skin.  Apply this in the backwards 3 figure on each side of your face.  Imagine two 3s in a mirror image on your face with the tips and centers touching.<br /><br />ANY OTHER USES?<br />I found that this also makes a fabulous eye shadow.  I found it to be a perfect match with the other color in this series of number 2 which is a darker more rose brown color.  This is a great companion to that.  If this is all you have, It also makes a great eye shadow alone or with another lighter satin finish shadow or even a matte.  I would not go super frosty.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY TO EYES<br />In terms of eyes, you can use this as a contour, all over color, or in combination with the other darker color of this Sungasm series or another set of shadows.  The application is best for a lighter look to use a teardrop shaped brush.  Then for a heavier look with more color, a flat eye shadow brush packing this gently into place over a good eye primer is the way to go.  For a quick application, you can also use a finger to apply and blend it with a brush or your finger<br /><br />ANY IRRITATION PROBLEMS?<br />I am VERY sensitive and did not have any problems with this product on the face or eyes.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />As long as you are willing to take some time to find the right brush for the application of this, this bronzer is a pretty color especially for cooler toned skin.  It is a good highlighter for darker skin tones as a highlighter, though.  This is beautiful on the face, eyes, and in tandem with the other color of this bronzer too.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This is a nice bronzer and I am surprised at how well it works on cooler skin tones, something that is not all that easy to find, especially in TWO colors of a collections.\nReview Title: GReat Bronzer For Medium To Lighter Skin Tones, But Great Eye Shadow Too- Read On\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: 100Pcs Baby Hair Ties for Girls and Kids Elastic Toddler Hair Ties, Cotton Toddler Hair Ties , Candy Color Small Seamless Hair Ties, No Crease Soft Hair Accessories Ponytail Holders Assorted Colors\nReview Date: 2021/07/08\nStore: Geruicee\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Color': 'B', 'Material': 'Rubber', 'Item Form': 'Elastic', 'Brand': 'Geruicee', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '0.31 x 5.28 x 5.43 inches', 'Product Dimensions': '0.31 x 5.28 x 5.43 inches; 1.34 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Geruicee'}\nReview Text: I have baby fine hair.

I was going to give this to my daughter (she has scalp issues) but I think I will buy her a 2nd one and keep this one for me.\nReview Title: VERY Small Bottle, But Works Well\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Dead Sea Mud Soap,125gr, Minerals & Salt Spa Skincare for Multi Skin Disorders Natural Treatment for Face & All Body, Natural Beauty Care, All Skin types, Perfect for Oily Skin Treatment, Smooth Face & Body Within 5-10 Min\nReview Date: 2021/12/14\nStore: MINERALS MINERALS\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Skin Type': 'Oily', 'Brand': 'MINERALS MINERALS', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Material Type Free': 'Paraben Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '3.39 x 1.97 x 0.98 inches; 4.16 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'MS-05', 'UPC': '787269003378'}\nReview Text: HOW THIS COMES<br />This bar of soap comes wrapped in plastic with a label on each side.<br /><br />TEXTURE<br />This bar of soap is very crumbly before unwrapped.  The soap feels like it will crumble but when you put water on it, it turns into a very muddy bar of soap.  You can feel the mud in it.<br /><br />CLEANING<br />This does clean the skin well, but if you have normal to dry skin, it really does make it feel stripped and tight when done using it.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS<br />There is nothing in this bar of soap to indicate its ingredients other than Dead Sea Mud.<br /><br />COUNTRY OF ORIGIN<br />Israel<br /><br />WHO MIGHT LIKE THIS<br />Anyone with very dirty greasy skin or who has problems with oil and blemishes might be able to use this.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This bar of soap does not list ingredients but you can definitely feel there is a lot of mud in it.  It cleans well but strips the skin.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  No ingredient list took a star off for me.  The performance is good for some skin, but mine is more on the normal to dry side so I don't use it as much as the guys do.\nReview Title: For Oily Problem Skin Yes, For Drier Skin, Feels Dried Out And Tight\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

    "title": "This Is A Great Design- But Caution, How To Get Out Of A Jam",
    "text": "I have baby fine hair.  Thin hair makes it difficult to curl my hair because either they are too hot, to large, hair gets caught in clips, or other reasons.  As a result, I don't curl my hair often.  This might change that.<br /><br />CHARGING<br />Charging this took 3 hours once I got it.  It has a gauge on it which lets you know when the battery is full and status of it.<br /><br />CONTROL PANEL<br />The control panel is covered in the instructions, but it is not quite what it is described.  I found it very intuitive, however and no problem in using it.  Just mess with the buttons and you will figure it out.  The right button changes the section, the left button chooses the level.<br /><br />SETTING<br />Every time I turn this off, I have to reset it to F instead of C and then I have to reset the different times too.  It does not remember so far every time I have used it and I have tried multiple ways.<br /><br />CURLING<br />This thing is AWESOME.  The thing is you have to have SMALL pieces of hair and make sure no other hairs are caught with it.  If you don't then it will curl your hair tight and jam it up.  More on that later.  I set my hair for baby fine at 300F and 8 seconds and once it heated up, the curls were perfect.  I had to redo a few of them but for the most part they were nice.<br /><br />JAM<br />When you are not careful to separate ALL hair from a section, sometimes the shorter hairs will catch in the roller in the opposite direction and it will cause a jam.  It is scary.  That is one reason why I set it only at 8 seconds.  All you do is make sure you have a mirror and then hit the controls until you reverse the direction and run it for a moment and VOILA- hair is out.<br /><br />Make sure to comb the hair and then redo it in smaller sections.<br /><br />TIMER<br />One more thing, this will roll up your hair and then it will beep each second of the count down of your hair in the roller.  It gives a long beep when done, you release the button and your hair comes out.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a great curling iron.  I love that I can do this in the living room with a mirror and not have to stand in the bathroom.  My hair looks natural and beautiful.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS I wish this would set itself to Farenheit and stay there.  It is annoying to reset it every time.  I know it is supposed to stay, but mine doesn't.  Other than that, this would get five stars, but I am taking one off for that.<br /><br />PHOTO<br />I posted a photo of my hair so you can see how curly it is.  Keep in mind, I have very little hair and it is very very fine.  This curling iron really make my hair look amazing.",
