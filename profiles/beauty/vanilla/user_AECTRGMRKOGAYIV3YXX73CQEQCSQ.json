I decided to try two super inexpensive versions , both costing around $20 and see if this significantly more expensive option from GloPRO was really worth it. In short, yes. Both of the cheaper options were incredibly painful and flimsy feeling. One of them even felt kind of like getting a face tattoo. It was awful. The GloPRO option actually feels nice on the skin because of the vibration feature and the red light therapy is a huge benefit for those monthly breakouts. I do feel like my skin care is absorbing more effectively since I've been using this, but it's still an extremely expensive tool.

While I've never tried the Dyson, I was excited by the design and so I picked this one up. On the plus side it does have an extremely long cord so if you can't stand right directly next to you anymore you'll be fine but it is not a swivel cord so it's not as maneuverable as others. It's not a huge deal for me but just something to be aware of. I love the hat and cold functions which makes it really nice to set your hair at the end and seal in the style. If you've only ever used regular hair dryers you'll really appreciate this added feature. It's a pretty substantial hair dryer. If you're used to really inexpensive lightweight ones you'll notice the additional weight however it's not so heavy that your arm will get tired even if you have a ton of hair like I do.

The hair does have that typical slight plastic sheen but it's not nearly as noticeable as others I've seen especially blonde wigs. There's a good amount of hair here as well so it's not one of those wigs that gets wispy towards the ends. The part hairline could look a little better but if you fiddle with it you can make it look pretty good.

It shows the curling iron on a model's hair and it looks like an average sized curling wand with three barrels. No, in person this thing is so tiny. It honestly looks like a curling iron for dolls. As you can see in my photo I'm using a pencil for scale. Each of these barrels is about a pencil and a half to two pencils big. Meaning that the type of curls you get are more like 1920s finger waves than anything you would probably want to wear today. It's just ridiculous.\nReview Title: Is this a curling wand for dolls?

I was kind of expecting this to be a mess but I was curious so I decided to try it. This works exceptionally well. I have tried some of these little three-pronged brow markers in the past and never been very impressed. These have enough stability to them that you really can flick and get straight little lines that look just like hairs. They are thin and you have actual control. This formula also lasts forever! I definitely have to use makeup remover to get it off, so it is for sure waterproof. I also like that this color isn't pulling red on me. So often browns do that but this is nice and dark and definitely neutral. The only complaint I have is that when I open these there was a little bit of ink that had leaked out around the applicator at the top so it looked a little messy, but I love the way this works so much I don't care One thing to note is that it's best to put this on before you use any other wax or gels to keep your brow hairs in place. This really doesn't work well on top of anything but dry plain skin.\nReview Title: This stuff looks great and it lasts forever on your eyebrows\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Oralphi Soft Tapered Toothbrush, with Super Tapered Bristles for Periodontal Pocket Care (4 Count, Full Head)\nReview Date: 2021/06/21\nStore: Oralphi\nAverage Rating: 4.2\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Oralphi', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Item Firmness Description': 'Soft', 'Material Feature': 'Reusable', 'Unit Count': '4.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '7.87 x 4.92 x 0.67 inches; 4.66 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Oralphi'}\nReview Text: This is a decent set of toothbrushes.

There's something about the vintage aesthetic that they capture so perfectly that always draws me in. I wasn't sure what I would think about their actual lipsticks however because of the bullet style is so unusual, but I really love this. The formula is creamy but long-lasting and even leaves a little bit of a stain, and the color is just the perfect red in my opinion it's a slightly deeper red so it feels a little more sophisticated and a little more wearable than a brighter red. It also has a slight blue base to it which makes your teeth look a little wider. The packaging is absolutely lovely and I actually find that I really enjoy the style of the lipstick bullet. I still always wear a lip liner of course but the angle of this makes it really easy to fully coat your lips.

I was kind of expecting this to be a mess but I was curious so I decided to try it. This works exceptionally well.

These have enough stability to them that you really can flick and get straight little lines that look just like hairs. They are thin and you have actual control. This formula also lasts forever! I definitely have to use makeup remover to get it off, so it is for sure waterproof. I also like that this color isn't pulling red on me. So often browns do that but this is nice and dark and definitely neutral. The only complaint I have is that when I open these there was a little bit of ink that had leaked out around the applicator at the top so it looked a little messy, but I love the way this works so much I don't care One thing to note is that it's best to put this on before you use any other wax or gels to keep your brow hairs in place.

I wasn't sure what I would think about their actual lipsticks however because of the bullet style is so unusual, but I really love this. The formula is creamy but long-lasting and even leaves a little bit of a stain, and the color is just the perfect red in my opinion it's a slightly deeper red so it feels a little more sophisticated and a little more wearable than a brighter red. It also has a slight blue base to it which makes your teeth look a little wider. The packaging is absolutely lovely and I actually find that I really enjoy the style of the lipstick bullet. I still always wear a lip liner of course but the angle of this makes it really easy to fully coat your lips.

I decided to try two super inexpensive versions , both costing around $20 and see if this significantly more expensive option from GloPRO was really worth it. In short, yes. Both of the cheaper options were incredibly painful and flimsy feeling. One of them even felt kind of like getting a face tattoo. It was awful. The GloPRO option actually feels nice on the skin because of the vibration feature and the red light therapy is a huge benefit for those monthly breakouts. I do feel like my skin care is absorbing more effectively since I've been using this, but it's still an extremely expensive tool.

They do expand when wet and I really do like the shape of the larger ones in this set--they are very similar to the Real Techniques sponges--but they're just not as soft and bouncy as some of the others that I prefer.

While I've never tried the Dyson, I was excited by the design and so I picked this one up. On the plus side it does have an extremely long cord so if you can't stand right directly next to you anymore you'll be fine but it is not a swivel cord so it's not as maneuverable as others. It's not a huge deal for me but just something to be aware of. I love the hat and cold functions which makes it really nice to set your hair at the end and seal in the style. If you've only ever used regular hair dryers you'll really appreciate this added feature. It's a pretty substantial hair dryer. If you're used to really inexpensive lightweight ones you'll notice the additional weight however it's not so heavy that your arm will get tired even if you have a ton of hair like I do.
