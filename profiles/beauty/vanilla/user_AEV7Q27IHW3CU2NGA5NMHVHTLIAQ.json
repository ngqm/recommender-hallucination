When I went to use it again, even the strongest blade setting, it did not seem to be getting the hair for a close enough shave. So it seemed to do well when the hair is longer. It gave me ingrown hair bumps in some areas. I am not sure if it's not due to not using a lubricant or not. It holds pretty well in the shower. But I don't think it's supposed to be used while you are showering. It is very light to hold. I appreciate the left and right blades for sensitive areas, however, the curve around the middle blade has no use. I am not sure what its purpose is for, as much as I have tried to figure it out, it seems to do nothing.
