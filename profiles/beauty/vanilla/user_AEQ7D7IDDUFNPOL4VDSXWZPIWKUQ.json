Not sure if people are drinking gels in the shower or just really self-conscious about cleanliness. Either way, I often find myself ordering products online. The selection at physical stores is iffy.

Bouquet Garni is double the size. That's a good thing. Less I've gotta get out. I'm not crazy about the White Musk smell. It's a floral scent. I'm more of a woodsy, fruity scent.

I'm always keeping my eyes open for beneficial face creams and serums. I became obsessed with healthy skin after moving to Puerto Rico. We all of us know about the sun's damaging effects. It's harmful to all skin, not just those with aging skin. Algae can quite possibly reduce the breakdown of hyaluronic acid within the skin. Algae subspecies have anti-aging benefits. Undaria pinnatifida extract is shown to reduce wrinkle depth and improve over-all skin appearance. It also helps to protect the skin's natural stores of collagen and hyaluronic acid. The alteromonas ferment extract is found in deep seawater algae. It has binding properties that help hydration. Salicornia herbacea extract contains good-for-the-skin things \u2013 increasing skin barrier and deep hydration. It might even help the skin recover. Caprylic triglyceride reduces dryness and has anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal properties. It will not clog pores and is suitable for people with oily skin. Arginine protects the skin from free radicals that contribute to fine lines. Arginine in cosmetics hydrates and boosts collagen production. The parfum ingredient is not damaging to the skin. Maltol and POLYQUATERNIUM-80 (plant-based) is used in cosmetics regularly and deemed safe.  NMF (Natural Moisturizing Factor) components work to keep skin supple and hydrated. The combination of these ingredients is a friend to the skin's health. Understanding what's in our products ensures that we are buying serums we actually want to put on our faces. Knowing all of this, I am 100% satisfied with applying this serum. The smell is reminiscent of cotton candy. It isn't overpowering. In fact, I think it enhances my want to use. It feels indulgent.

Hoping for positive results from BEPHOLAN serum. Ingredients are reported to be natural ingredients such as hydrolyzed oat protein, olive glycerides, and sodium hyaluronate. After doing a bit of online investigation about sodium hyaluronate, there is some indication that it can assist in hair growth. It may moisturize the hair shaft and keep it from breakage. Turns out, it could help hair growth. So, does this apply to eyelashes? Hmm. The serum comes in a mascara tube. Instead of applying with a brush, the serum is applied to the eye with a mascara wand. I've gotta say - I thought this would be better applied to roots, but the serum doesn't seem to adhere to the wand as it would to a small brush-on wand. I have to really dig the wand into the container to get the serum to stick to the applicator. My solution is to use my own small paintbrush. Thankfully, it seems to apply to my lashes much better. I've been using this lash serum for less than a week. I don't normally post reviews until I've had noticeable improvements. The product description says that lashes may show improvement within two weeks. I will post an update in two weeks to a month. I believe consistency is key with most of these products. I use it twice a day on days that I'm on top of my game. It's quick and easy. Most days, though, it's once a day. BEPHOLAN Cosmetics suggests taking a BEFORE and AFTER picture of your lashes.

The product description says that lashes may show improvement within two weeks. I will post an update in two weeks to a month. I believe consistency is key with most of these products. I use it twice a day on days that I'm on top of my game. It's quick and easy. Most days, though, it's once a day. BEPHOLAN Cosmetics suggests taking a BEFORE and AFTER picture of your lashes. Stay tuned.\nReview Title: Eyelash Serum\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Claw Hair Clips, IKOCO 6 Pack Jaw Clips Stylish Matte Plastic Strong Hold Hair Clamps Box Packaged for Thin Fine Hair with 10Pcs Black Hair ties (2.4Inch)\nReview Date: 2021/01/22\nStore: IKOCO\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'IKOCO', 'Hair Type': 'Fine', 'Color': 'Green,Grey', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material': 'Plastic, Metal, Acrylic', 'Product Dimensions': '6.25 x 4.25 x 2 inches; 5.89 Ounces'}\nReview Text: Yes! Yes! Yesssss!!<br /><br />Several years ago, my daughter got me hooked on this style of hair clip. Unfortunately, we could only find them at a big-name retailer. And...you could only get a set of three. For hair clips, they weren't cheap. Hello! I found these on Amazon, got triple the clips, and all contained in a plastic box that I use to keep them from breaking during travel. Bonus: these clips aren't as fragile as the others. The clips come in three colors: black, gold, and matte silver. You get two of each color. I have extremely long hair and I wear it up 95% of the time. The clips hold well \u2013 wet or dry hair. They're not huge or bulky. I've tried many clips. As for these, they're perfect! Best hair accessory. I don't leave home without one.\nReview Title: Claw Clips\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

    "text": "I cannot live without hair clips! Are the clips the sturdiest? It depends. I do wear the clips on a daily basis. I am unsure whether it is frequent use that causes the clips to break or maybe I received a weak set. The average use of one clip is around two or three months, depending on wear and tear. Several of my clips have gone askew. Not the worst. Does the job. I do like the design and it holds my hair well.",
