When I first opened the jar I saw that it was a clay based masque and I thought DRYING. However, this is NOT THE CASE AT ALL! The masque is carefully formulated to be both cleansing and exfoliating, but also moisturizing. I felt slight warming and tingling while the masque was on, but it was not irritating at all. The masque contains very small beads made of jojoba that soften on your skin while you have the masque on. When you wash the masque off with warm water, rub the beads in for extra moisture.
