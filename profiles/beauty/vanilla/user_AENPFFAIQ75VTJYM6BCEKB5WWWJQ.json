It's seemed to be like unwrapping an onion, with a box, then a smaller box, and paper. The bottle is wrapped in tissue paper and unfortunately the cleanser had leaked all over the paper and turned it a dark yellow color. This is a foaming cleanser and when mixed with water, the consistency is rather thick. I suffered from breakouts all over my forehead during the week or two using this cleanser which is a very unusual spot for me to break out. I had some other treatments affecting my hormones at the same time, so I can't say for certain that my skin condition was due to this product alone, but it certainly didn't help. When I switched to using Cetaphil cleanser, the breakouts cleared up almost immediately.

I was pleased to try Mr. Pristine's beard shampoo and so far I've been pleased with the results.<br /><br />First of all, it smells great.  None of the scents are overwhelming or powerful.  The faint mint is nice and refreshing.  Secondly, the lather is fine.  I noticed that if I apply some to my hair and work a lather, it's nice and frothy.  I then apply to my beard and give it a good cleaning.  If I apply the shampoo directly to my beard, the later is noticeably less frothy.

    "text": "My 11 year old daughter tried these with her thick long hair in the following styles:<br /><br />A bun-the hair clip didn't stay tight enough to hold the style<br />A ponytail- it's very tricky to pull the hair tight and get the plastic clip around the hair.<br />One of the clips broke because she over stretched it, in order to open it as wide as possible.<br /><br />She lost interest quickly and rarely uses them now. She prefers a good old fashion rubber band for ponytails.",
