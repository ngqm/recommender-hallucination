If I were a gym owner,  I would keep these well in stock! This is a nice big cloth, used to clean up after a workout. It is not dripping wet but it is adequately moist. There is a slight clean scent to it, but nothing perfumy or anything that would fight with a perfume. It did a nice job, however other than doing may be under arms face and chest one of these towels would not be enough if you really wanted to clean yourself up.  These would also be great during camping trips. Or even long car trips when you like to refresh. For what it is, I don\u2019t think the price is unreasonable. If I were a gym owner I would give each patron two of these towels when they arrived. I thought the product was good, the towel was really soft and enjoyable to use.

What I did like about it was it was not as oily as many of the products that I\u2019ve had in the past. It did leave my skin feeling soft and refreshed. And I do think the price is very reasonable for the quality of the ingredients that are in it. I took one star off for the misrepresentation of the exfoliation product.\nReview Title: Not great for exfoliating, but a pleasant experience\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: 2oz / 60ml Glass Spray Bottles for DIY Refill, Essential Oils, Pillow Mists,Fine Mist Spray -3Packs Amber Color\nReview Date: 2020/07/31\nStore: EagleKing\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'EagleKing', 'Material': 'Glass', 'Capacity': '2 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '3', 'Special Feature': 'Mist Spray', 'Package Dimensions': '6.3 x 6.1 x 1.7 inches; 8.78 Ounces'}\nReview Text: Sturdy components, good quality glass bottle, sprays a perfect super fine mist.

If I were a gym owner,  I would keep these well in stock! This is a nice big cloth, used to clean up after a workout. It is not dripping wet but it is adequately moist. There is a slight clean scent to it, but nothing perfumy or anything that would fight with a perfume. It did a nice job, however other than doing may be under arms face and chest one of these towels would not be enough if you really wanted to clean yourself up.  These would also be great during camping trips. Or even long car trips when you like to refresh. For what it is, I don\u2019t think the price is unreasonable. If I were a gym owner I would give each patron two of these towels when they arrived. I thought the product was good, the towel was really soft and enjoyable to use.  The towel itself is also as strong as it is soft. I will make sure to have a couple of these in my purse at all times.\nReview Title: The Covid answer to post gym workouts!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Empty Brown Glass Spray Bottles2-Pack, Refillable 16 oz Containers for Essential Oils, Cleaning Products, Aromatherapy, Misting Plants, or Cooking - Reliable Sprayer with Mist and Stream Settings\nReview Date: 2020/08/22\nStore: Cherry\nAverage Rating: 3.7\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Cherry', 'Material': 'Glass', 'Capacity': '16 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Product Care Instructions': 'Hand Wash Only', 'Package Dimensions': '9.09 x 6.46 x 3.35 inches; 4.94 Ounces', 'UPC': '791523234187'}\nReview Text: Nice quality but overpriced.
