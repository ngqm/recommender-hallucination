Left it on for 5 mins and brushed it through my hair with a comb in the shower. The smell is amazing( if you like bananas, which I do ) After washing I let my hair air dry and my hair is so smooth and soft. I also have a nice shine to my hair. I notice with this product a little goes a long way so one bottle can last a while. Never used a hair mask before and I really like the life it gave my hair back.

It does stay in place and gives some life to your hair. Over time though ( talking full day wear at least 8 hours) it can become bothersome. I found it easier to have wet hair and twist your hair into the clips. Value is fair.",
