This seems to be the new craze I\u2019m only going to give this one a four-star because I feel like it\u2019s not gonna last two months like it says on the packaging I have medium to long hair and it takes quite a bit of rubbing that\u2019s on in order to feel like I\u2019ve got a good lather going. The price seems pretty comparable to other products out there and it\u2019s definitely worth the try if I had shorter hair maybe it would last longer I\u2019m not sure. It\u2019s made with natural ingredients and no plastic packaging so it\u2019s better for the environment. I would definitely recommend it is worth a try and it would say it\u2019s reasonably priced and smells very nice\nReview Title: Nice shampoo bar\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: CAXIRO IPL Hair Removal Device for Women and Man, Permanent Reduction in Hair Regrowth for Body, Face & Precision Areas (Bikini and Underarms)\nReview Date: 2021/07/20\nStore: CAXIRO\nAverage Rating: 2.8\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '7.76 x 7.68 x 2.32 inches;
