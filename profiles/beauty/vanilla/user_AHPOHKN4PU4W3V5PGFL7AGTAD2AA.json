They all say they will make your wrinkles or crows feet shrink or smooth out or give your 40 something face a &#34;youthful&#34; glow again. At best, these products moisturize, cleanse, and some provide some protection from sun exposure damage.<br /><br /> This serum from EB5 makes the usual claims, of course, but it's not as outrageously expensive as so many of the other brands. It's a creamy concoction and it takes very little to cover my entire face - the instructions say just use one pump and that is sufficient. There's a faint scent that makes me think of Asian food - I guess that's the sesame seed oil,but the scent fades quickly. It takes about ten minutes to fully absorb into my skin, so I am not using this immediately before going to bed. I haven't had any skin irritation or breaking out in a week. Nor have I noticed any visible difference in the overall condition of my skin and no &#34;plumping&#34; in my laugh lines. My face is soft and it feels just a moisturized as when I use only my regular moisturizer.

Perhaps if your hair is very fine or very short you can make these work,  but I can't stand them.\nReview Title: Pulls and tangles long hair\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Black Wolf - Men\u2019s Ultra Hydrating Moisturizer - 1.7 Fl Oz \u2013 Soothe Dry, Patchy & Flaky Areas on your Skin - Fast Absorbing Formula Won't Feel Heavy or Greasy - Sulfate Free for Dry Skin\nReview Date: 2020/10/04\nStore: Black Wolf\nAverage Rating: 4.6\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Black Wolf', 'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Unit Count': '1.7 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Package Dimensions': '5.39 x 3.15 x 1.46 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'BLKWLF_MOIST_DRY', 'UPC': '850021340087'}\nReview Text: I've been using this on my feet rather than my face. It's just too heavy and thick for a face cream. After 4 days, my heels are definitely softer.<br /><br />It seems to absorb reasonably quickly, but slower than my usual moisturizer and skin cream. I can't detect any perfumes in this and that's definitely good.\nReview Title: Nice for dry, cracked heels\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: LCPCX Horse grooming kit, horse brush kit with 2 pet gloves, suitable for horses, dogs, cattle, cats, bears and other hairy pet care tools\nReview Date: 2021/07/30\nStore: LCPCX\nAverage Rating: 4.0\nProduct Details: {'Product Dimensions': '8.9 x 4.3 x 1.78 inches; 11.99 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I don't really have any use for the gloves included in this set. The curry comb is what I wanted. It works like it should and removes excess hair without pinching. Our donkey seems to really prefer a curry comb to any other type of brush and he likes this one.\nReview Title: Good with coarse donkey hair\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
