You clip your hair in the bottom little clipper and I prefer the low speed and it winds your hair for you up the wand! It gets nice and hot and curls did stay well after hrs or wear in semi humid weather. Definitely takes a little getting use to but it\u2019s pretty cool. You do need to take slightly smaller sections of hair to curl so the clipper can hold it but I really enjoyed using this!\nReview Title: I was skeptical but this is super amazing\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: JPNK 4PCS Anti-Static Detangling Fine & Wide Tooth Shower Comb Set\nReview Date: 2020/02/05\nStore: JPNK\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Material': 'Plastic', 'Brand': 'JPNK', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy,Straight', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '12 x 3.1 x 0.7 inches; 5.61 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I love these combs not only for myself but for my daughters hair.

First off, it's a super flimsy and you can't use much pressure when pressing against teeth. Also, the pointed end that is supposed to clear put any food from between the teeth isn't pointed enough so you can't really get in there all the way.
