I usually use it for a professional everyday look for work. However , it is versatile enough that I can intensify it for evening or dressy occasions or tone it down for subtly enhancing a \"no makeup\" look. Because it is neutral and universally flattering on almost all skin tones (may not show up well if you have a deep toned complexion), I can wear it with any color in my wardrobe. I also like that it has a fantastic cool toned set of colors that do not end up showing up blue or purple on the skin. The undertones are very subtle, just like real skin! So hard to find - there seems to be a profusion of warm toned makeup out there, but very little cool or neutral toned makeup that produces a smooth, natural looking and flattering gradient of color on the skin.
