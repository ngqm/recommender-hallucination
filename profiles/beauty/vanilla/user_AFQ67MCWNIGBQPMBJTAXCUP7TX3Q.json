I like the variety of stencils included. It was easy to position and hold one in place. The problem was with the pencil...every time you try to color your eyebrow, the tip just rolls back into the tube after each pass over, making it annoying to have to keep holding the stencil with one hand while constantly twisting the color back out of the applicator with the other!

There was no peeling off, and I was barely able to rinse it off...was very hard, and looked like I was taking paint chips off my face! I used the lemon mask, which was the only one that was a whitening mask...I wonder though, since it definitely isn't going to whiten after just one mask, do I have to keep buying this set just to get the lemon one? Doesn't seem worth it.

It was slightly bigger than some, but you can easily fold over to fit. Holes for eyes and mouth were perfect size, and fits well over the nose! No unpleasant fragrance and lots of essence. The best part is that it doesn't leave your skin feeling even 1% sticky after taking it off! Great quantity for the price as well...definitely recommend!\nReview Title: One of the best!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: VOFEL Jelly Masks for Facials Mask Powder for Moisturizing Anti Aging Jelly Face Mask Peel Off 9 Pcs\nReview Date: 2022/06/24\nStore: VOFEL\nAverage Rating: 3.4\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'VOFEL', 'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Scent': 'Vanilla,Lemon', 'Skin Type': 'All, Oily, Sensitive', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '6.5 x 3.46 x 1.46 inches; 5.86 Ounces', 'UPC': '770456407264'}\nReview Text: This was not my first time using a jelly mask and I followed mixing instructions as usual, so I have no clue why the mask ended up as it did. I put everything that was in the bowl onto my face...was going to wait the minimum 20 minutes before removing, however, the mask was already a dried, powdery clay-looking mess before the time was up. There was no peeling off, and I was barely able to rinse it off...was very hard, and looked like I was taking paint chips off my face! I used the lemon mask, which was the only one that was a whitening mask...I wonder though, since it definitely isn't going to whiten after just one mask, do I have to keep buying this set just to get the lemon one? Doesn't seem worth it. On the bright side, it did make my face feel soft after the irritation and annoyance of removing the mask...but, I can get the same results elsewhere, so definitely won't order again!\nReview Title: Very disappointed\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: By Terry Hyaluronic Pressed Hydra-Powder | Transcluscent | Infused with Hyaluronic Acid | Vegan\nReview Date: 2022/07/01\nStore: By Terry\nAverage Rating: 4.3\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'By Terry', 'Item Form': 'powder', 'Finish Type': 'Matte', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '3.19 x 3.15 x 0.75 inches; 2.82 Ounces', 'Item model number': '3700076457087'}\nReview Text: Nice mirrored compact with a basic powder puff.

I was afraid that it would have a medicinal smell since the ingredients include Centella Asiatica, however I was surprised when I opened the tube and was hit with a fragrance that, to me, smells like fresh cut grass! Has a gel-like texture with added bits of what look like tea leaves. It doesn't lather much, but is more like a cream when you start to massage it over your skin.

This is like other peels that state they remove dead skin cells, however, at least this brand isn't trying to make you believe that the particles you see after massaging onto the skin are those cells, because they're not! You will see a small amount of particles or a lot, depending on how much you use, and it is only the product...that's how they work, the gel turns into an exfoliator! I've never had any of these peels, including this one, really clean the pores...however, it does leave the skin feeling soft and refreshed. I did take away 1 star because the tube seems to not contain much gel, as compared to other Vitamasques products.
