Harmony (1) will relieve a multitude of irritations caused by many different issues. One of the main irritations are pads or tampons. Every month, especially for a heavy period, menstrual pads can cause painful irritations, dryness, rashes, pain and itching. Then when you are into menopause, the irritations, dryness, rashes, pain and itching are a hundred times worse, due to heavy periods that can last forever.<br /><br />There are many other issues that can cause constant irritations besides pads and tampons- if you\u2019ve ever had a bad Urinary Tract Infection, where you are urinating frequently in pain, the rashes are unbearable. Having a weak bladder at times where you need a heavier pad or diaper causes more unpleasant rashes. It is so difficult to find a cream that will actually help with severe chafing, dryness, pain, itching and irritations. This V. Harmony Vaginal Moisturizer helps immensely with chafing and dryness. But when it comes to helping with severe rashes, itching and pain- make sure you refrigerate this first before applying, because you will be happy you did. Applying this cold is the best relief ever- the pain goes away immediately.

I don\u2019t always get a good night\u2019s sleep and in the morning, the puffiness shows and sometimes dark circles accompany the puffiness.<br /><br />This Eye Firming Serum works unbelievably fast. The puffiness goes away within an hour. As for dark circles, they do fade out with daily use- you will notice a difference within a week. The main thing I noticed is a tighter, firmer feel of my under eye area. This tightening and firming of the delicate eye area actually does make fine lines disappear. Age spots don\u2019t disappear, but your skin will brighten up.<br /><br />This Eye Firming Serum is so easy to use. You simply apply a drop or two with the dropper and lightly dab into your skin with a finger. If you do this at night, you will wake up to a firmer skin and it looks brighter, but it\u2019s the feeling of firmness and tightness you will love.

This is not for every man, but for a man who likes a more vibrant scent. These scents are very noticeable and not light, being a very woodsy, earthy, warm fragrance with a touch of zest. 4 STARS.<br /><br />NOTTING HILL- The top notes begin with bergamot, lemon and lime for a clean, natural scent. Then the middle notes have bolder peppercorn and jasmine bringing a rose/herbal scent. At the bottom are cedarwood, sandalwood, amber and a powdery musk for a very potent woodsy, animal musky scent.

It has stretchability and velcro to adjust it tightly to your head. Both the net cap and headband are so easy to apply.

I have combination skin- some parts dry, regular and oily. I also have aging skin, so I really didn\u2019t think this primer spray would help me, but it surprisingly did. This comes in a spray bottle and you have to shake the bottle well before spraying, keeping your eyes tightly shut.<br /><br />It sprays with a fine mist, but has a foaming in it. After spraying, I gently rubbed it more evenly on my face. It dries instantly and wow, my face felt like velvet. If anyone knows about aging skin- your make-up shows the fine lines and wrinkles more exaggerated. This primer spray somehow smooths your skin more, leaving it like a smooth slate for make-up. I am very impressed with this spray, as nothing helps aging skin like this does for make-up, powder, even  touch up concealers. A wonderful product. 5 STARS.\nReview Title: Puts A Layer Of Silky Smoothness Between You & Your Make-Up\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Altaba Ombre Brown Short Bob Wig with Bangs Natural Looking Bob Wigs for Women 12\" Straight Silky Hair Synthetic Heat Resistant Wigs for Daily Party Cosplay Hair Wig\nReview Date: 2020/11/27\nStore: Altaba\nAverage Rating: 3.5\nProduct Details: {'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Special Feature': 'Heat Resistant', 'Brand': 'Altaba', 'Package Dimensions': '12.09 x 8.07 x 2.28 inches; 5.93 Ounces'}\nReview Text: Altaba Brown Short Bob Wig With Bangs Natural Looking Bob Wigs For Women 12\" Straight Silky Hair Synthetic Heat Resistant Wigs For Daily Party Cosplay Hair Wig is a cute bob wig.

The wig has elastic around the sides that stretches to fit your head. Around the ears are comfortable flaps. Inside the wig are four tiny combs to keep it in place. As for the bangs, if they are too long, no cutting is needed- just pull the wig back farther.<br /><br />The color is gorgeously mixed with the darker roots and several blonde colors mixed together for a truly natural look. There is no shiny fake look to the sheen and it\u2019s not too thick, making it so natural. The heaviest part of the hair is where it should be on top of the head and with the bangs layered beautifully. The back is layered perfect as well and is so breathable!

This wig immediately reminded me of Sleeping Beauty\u2019s gorgeous long curls and color. These curls are absolutely divine in both the ends and bangs. Truly a magnificent princess wig. There are elastic bands at the back of the wig to make it fit any size head. It will fit a small to large head with these clip elastic adjustments. Should the wig be too large for a really young, small child, you can always stitch it closer in the back on the inside. A couple stitches has made any wig tighter, and you can always remove the stitches for a larger child. However, I found the elastic straps hook really tight or looser, so I didn\u2019t have a need for that. The curls are layered for a stunning effect. I love the bangs having those same large curls for a true princess look. The color is a light and gold blonde mix- just gorgeous.

You have to test the products on your skin first to make certain you have no allergic reactions before using them. I thought the glue pen is just an adhesive and the eyeliner pen, as with all false eyelash eyeliner pens was magnetic, but I was wrong. The glue and eyeliner seem to be both magnetic. You have to wait until both are completely dry before applying the lashes, as the magnetic properties are what keep your lashes on. The 5 pairs of lashes are all very lovely and there is something for every occasion from work to play to dress up. I wish it had been made more clear that these are magnetic lashes, as I only use glue adhesive lashes, and only hypo allergenic glues to protect my eyes. To remove these lashes with the magnetic liner or adhesive on your eyes, you need a good liquid make up remover and cotton pads. For not making the magnetic properties totally clear even though the lashes are lovely, 3 STARS.\nReview Title: Pretty, But Totally Magnetic Lashes With No Regular Adhesive\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I thought the glue pen is just an adhesive and the eyeliner pen, as with all false eyelash eyeliner pens was magnetic, but I was wrong. The glue and eyeliner seem to be both magnetic. You have to wait until both are completely dry before applying the lashes, as the magnetic properties are what keep your lashes on. The 5 pairs of lashes are all very lovely and there is something for every occasion from work to play to dress up. I wish it had been made more clear that these are magnetic lashes, as I only use glue adhesive lashes, and only hypo allergenic glues to protect my eyes. To remove these lashes with the magnetic liner or adhesive on your eyes, you need a good liquid make up remover and cotton pads. For not making the magnetic properties totally clear even though the lashes are lovely, 3 STARS.\nPretty, But Totally Magnetic Lashes With No Regular Adhesive",

Harmony (1) will relieve a multitude of irritations caused by many different issues. One of the main irritations are pads or tampons. Every month, especially for a heavy period, menstrual pads can cause painful irritations, dryness, rashes, pain and itching. Then when you are into menopause, the irritations, dryness, rashes, pain and itching are a hundred times worse, due to heavy periods that can last forever.<br /><br />There are many other issues that can cause constant irritations besides pads and tampons- if you\u2019ve ever had a bad Urinary Tract Infection, where you are urinating frequently in pain, the rashes are unbearable. Having a weak bladder at times where you need a heavier pad or diaper causes more unpleasant rashes. It is so difficult to find a cream that will actually help with severe chafing, dryness, pain, itching and irritations. This V. Harmony Vaginal Moisturizer helps immensely with chafing and dryness. But when it comes to helping with severe rashes, itching and pain- make sure you refrigerate this first before applying, because you will be happy you did. Applying this cold is the best relief ever- the pain goes away immediately.

I don\u2019t always get a good night\u2019s sleep and in the morning, the puffiness shows and sometimes dark circles accompany the puffiness.<br /><br />This Eye Firming Serum works unbelievably fast. The puffiness goes away within an hour. As for dark circles, they do fade out with daily use- you will notice a difference within a week. The main thing I noticed is a tighter, firmer feel of my under eye area. This tightening and firming of the delicate eye area actually does make fine lines disappear. Age spots don\u2019t disappear, but your skin will brighten up.<br /><br />This Eye Firming Serum is so easy to use. You simply apply a drop or two with the dropper and lightly dab into your skin with a finger. If you do this at night, you will wake up to a firmer skin and it looks brighter, but it\u2019s the feeling of firmness and tightness you will love. Applying a good moisturizer after the Eye Serum really makes your under eye skin look fabulous and feeling hydrated. Keeping the dropper clean after use will result in always having the serum perfect and moist with no dried out particles.

There is no shiny fake look to the sheen and it\u2019s not too thick, making it so natural. The heaviest part of the hair is where it should be on top of the head and with the bangs layered beautifully. The back is layered perfect as well and is so breathable! You can part it any where and it always looks perfect. The wig also comes with directions and a net to cover your hair. A perfect, natural looking wig right out of the bag!\nReview Title: Perfect, Beautiful, Natural Looking Wig Right Out Of The Bag\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Crystal Rhinestone Gold Tone headband White/Mix color Gemstone Thin Hair Hoop goddess Daily hair accessory for Women Girls\nReview Date: 2021/03/25\nStore: CAFUDEYE\nAverage Rating: 3.5\nProduct Details: {'Color': 'Clear,Golden,White,Gold', 'Material': 'Metal', 'Fabric Type': 'Velvet', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Brand': 'CAFUDEYE', 'Package Dimensions': '7.48 x 6.22 x 0.94 inches; 1.76 Ounces'}\nReview Text: Crystal Rhinestone Gold Tone headband White/Mix color Gemstone Thin Hair Hoop goddess Daily hair accessory for Women Girls is the most comfortable gem studded headband I have ever worn. This is especially nice for younger people who hate the pain of a tight headband, but want to wear one for that special occasion. And this headband is so beautiful, you will want one for that special occasion.<br /><br />The headband itself feels like a very thin, light metal underneath soft gold fabric. The ends are wrapped yet again with a soft, silky black fabric to sit like a feather behind your ears. The stones are firmly set on a thin metal band which are attached to the gold fabric. What surprises me is this headband doesn\u2019t slip at all on my medium size head. I can also wear it like a crown which looks stunningly beautiful with all the \u201cdiamonds\u201d sparkling. It\u2019s the loveliest headband that is beyond soft and comfortable and will make everyone feel like royalty when wearing it for a most special occasion. 5 STARS.\nReview Title: Most Comfortable, Beautiful Headband That Doubles As A Crown\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: X-TRESS Classic Realistic Bob Wig Ombre Brown Short Hair Side Part Heat Resistant Fiber for Black Women Synthetic Wigs\nReview Date: 2021/03/25\nStore: X-TRESS\nAverage Rating: 3.4\nProduct Details: {'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy', 'Special Feature': 'Heat Resistant', 'Brand': 'X-TRESS', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult'}\nReview Text: X-TRESS Classic Realistic Bob Wig Ombre Brown Short Hair Side Part Heat Resistant Fiber for Black Women Synthetic Wigs is a very pretty side part wig. The actual color and style are beautiful and very natural looking. You will not find a more beautiful wig at this price. The wig cap has elastic adjustable hooks, so it will fit your head perfectly. The color and styling are the most beautiful features of this wig. The only thing that gives this wig away that it is indeed a wig, is the part. It\u2019s a little too thick at the part. The black roots blend down into the most beautiful golden brown hair. The wig is styled into lovely blown back waves, which is especially flattering around the face. A beautiful wig in color and style. 4 \u00bd STARS.\nReview Title: Beautiful Wig In Both Color & Style\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Kids Size Long Wavy Cosplay Wig for Princess Halloween Party\nReview Date: 2021/05/29\nStore: ColorGround\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Special Feature': 'Heat Resistant', 'Brand': 'ColorGround', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '11.73 x 7.6 x 1.61 inches; 10.23 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'CM06011043'}\nReview Text: Kids Size Long Wavy Halloween Wig (for 4-12 years old) is a stunning, beautiful wig for costume or play. This wig immediately reminded me of Sleeping Beauty\u2019s gorgeous long curls and color. These curls are absolutely divine in both the ends and bangs. Truly a magnificent princess wig. There are elastic bands at the back of the wig to make it fit any size head. It will fit a small to large head with these clip elastic adjustments. Should the wig be too large for a really young, small child, you can always stitch it closer in the back on the inside. A couple stitches has made any wig tighter, and you can always remove the stitches for a larger child. However, I found the elastic straps hook really tight or looser, so I didn\u2019t have a need for that. The curls are layered for a stunning effect. I love the bangs having those same large curls for a true princess look. The color is a light and gold blonde mix- just gorgeous. This is one beautiful wig for play or costume. 5 STARS.\nReview Title: Stunning, Beautiful, Adjustable Wig For Costume Or Play\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: QTMY Wide Headbands Fashion Women Baroque Crystal Gemstone Hair Accessories Head Band Fashion Headwear Hairbands for Women\nReview Date: 2021/06/13\nStore: QTMY\nAverage Rating: 3.6\nProduct Details: {'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Occasion': 'Wedding, Birthday', 'Material': 'Plastic', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Brand': 'QTMY', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.5 x 5.94 x 1.97 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'ZJ'}\nReview Text: QTMY Wide Headbands Fashion Women Baroque Crystal Gemstone Hair Accessories Head Band Fashion Headwear Hairbands for Women is a very pretty, highly dressy headband with lots of bling. The thick headband itself is almost two inches wide, yet very flexible and soft. It stays on your head in total comfort, even with it\u2019s weight. The hundreds of diamond look crystal stones are glued on and you have to be careful putting it on and removing it, so that it doesn\u2019t catch your hair. I received a pretty flower and pearl hair barrette free with this purchase- also glued on pieces and one already fell off- but an easy fix with a craft glue.

You have to test the products on your skin first to make certain you have no allergic reactions before using them. I thought the glue pen is just an adhesive and the eyeliner pen, as with all false eyelash eyeliner pens was magnetic, but I was wrong. The glue and eyeliner seem to be both magnetic. You have to wait until both are completely dry before applying the lashes, as the magnetic properties are what keep your lashes on. The 5 pairs of lashes are all very lovely and there is something for every occasion from work to play to dress up. I wish it had been made more clear that these are magnetic lashes, as I only use glue adhesive lashes, and only hypo allergenic glues to protect my eyes. To remove these lashes with the magnetic liner or adhesive on your eyes, you need a good liquid make up remover and cotton pads. For not making the magnetic properties totally clear even though the lashes are lovely, 3 STARS.\nReview Title: Pretty, But Totally Magnetic Lashes With No Regular Adhesive\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
