I love the long chiseled pencil shape because it makes it easier to apply straight stokes of color to my very thin brows without looking drawn on or penciled in. However, it does skip a bit compared to my gel brow color that is applied with a brush. The sponge tip is great for softening the sharp line on the thicker area of my brow and i dab it with a bit of eye shadow to set it.  The color stays put and looks natural without leaning towards red. What more can you ask of a good brow pencil for brunettes? I overplucked my brows in my youth when pencil-thin brows were was the style (okay, I'm dating myself here) but this seems to apply quickly and easily and works well with super-thin brows without making me look like Groucho Marx. It works, it stays and looks great.

I had tested two mascaras on each eye and this one really stood out. I have been wearing it for almost 36 hours and even slept in it.  After rubbing my eyes since the last night, the top lashes held and I didn't wake up with raccoon eyes. however, it does flake a bit. It applied smoothly and since It's not a quick drying mascara so you have a bit of time to tease out the lashes to avoid  any clumping..\nReview Title: Made my lashes dramatically darker and fuller\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Natural Waterproof Lash Mascara Black, 4D Silk Fiber Eyelash Mascara Makeup, Lengthening and Thick, No Clumping, Smudge-proof, Long-Lasting Voluminous Eyelashes Dramatic Extension Makeup Kit Eye Lash\nReview Date: 2020/07/30\nStore: SIKEMAY\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Color': 'black', 'Brand': 'SIKEMAY', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '7.2 x 4 x 1.2 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '764690676845', 'Manufacturer': 'SIKEMAY'}\nReview Text: I tried two 4D Silk mascaras by this brand on each eye for comparison and the CPCP Real Eyes Long Fiber Eyelash Mascara offers excellent lash separation. The thin comb bristle brush is great for separation, especially on the lower lashes.  I've worn both for 36 hours and after massive eye rubbing, I am surprised at how fresh it looks. I awoke with no raccoon eyes and no need to reapply it today. it didn't flake off! This is truly a long-lasting mascara.<br /><br />**  If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know.

It's interesting that there is such a contrast in thickness between the black and colored bands. Perhaps the colorful bands are meant for children's hair.

Even the smallest ones are too large and applying several coats just results in a thick, messy tacky line. I have hooded lids and it transferred the upper lid in the blink of an eye.  The eyeliner itself is nearly impossible to remove. I applied it on my hand and had to use a stiff scrub brush in order to remove it.<br />I tried a few sets of magnetic lashes and only one performed fairly well, but this wasn't one of them.\nReview Title: Seemed like a good idea at the time.\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Hyaluronic Acid Serum for face - 11% Low molecules Anti-aging Hydrating Booster Serum 100% Pure Hyaluronic Acid\nReview Date: 2020/09/16\nStore: MEAROSA DESIGN\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'MEAROSA DESIGN', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Fl Oz', 'Product Dimensions': '1.77 x 1.77 x 3.94 inches; 4.3 Ounces', 'UPC': '628504326121'}\nReview Text: This high HA formulation has a lot of great ingredients, and visibly reduced the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles with the first use.<br /><br />As a woman of a certain age, I am thrilled to find an effective and reasonably priced product that leaves my complexion 'naturally' soft, smooth and hydrated without leaving a slimy, or shiny silicone type residue.<br /><br />Too many beauty serums  tend to over promise, and under deliver in addition to being way overpriced., so  I am delighted to find a reasonably priced product that exceeded my expectations.
