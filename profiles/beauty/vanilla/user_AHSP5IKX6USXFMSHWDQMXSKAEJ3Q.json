This feels light, not greasy and yet is very effective at moisturizing skin. It's quickly absorbed by my skin.

Other facial scrubs I've tried have coarser particles, so coarse it feels like I'm rubbing sand on my face.<br /><br />What I don't like is that the product I received will expire in less than 3 months - Oct 2020. This doesn't seem to be just a one-time occurrence. I also purchased the  \"Higher Education MBA Night Renewing Serum with 0.5% retinol\". That one expires even sooner - on Sep 2020.<br /><br />I don't know what Amazon's policy is on expiration dates for skin care products. But, if I were purchasing this from a physical store, I wouldn't get something that expires in less than 3 months. I expect a product to be good for at least a year. Granted, expired doesn't automatically mean that a product is unusable. However, customers don't like getting old stock especially when a customer still has to pay full price for it. I didn't it but, if I were, I'd be annoyed enough to return the item.<br /><br />I also don't know if Higher Education regularly sends soon-to-expire items to Amazon or if they're just doing this to Vine purchases. Either way, that's really not good practice. For a facial scrub that costs $25, I don't expect the seller to pass off expiring products on me.<br />UPDATE - After going through reviews of the two Higher Education products, it appears that they regularly send soon-to-expire products to customers. Bad seller - Higher Education. Really really bad.<br /><br />One star for sending me an old product. Amazon, stop selling old products! Customers who paid full price for this - you should return the product.\nReview Title: expires in less than 3 months\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: MBA Renewing Retinol Serum, 1.7 fl. oz, 0.5% Retinol Hydrates & Brightens Skin's Appearance by Diminishing the Look of Breakouts, Hyperpigmentation, and Signs of Aging by Higher Education Skincare\nReview Date: 2020/08/03\nStore: Higher Education\nAverage Rating: 2.8\nProduct Details: {'Skin Type': 'All', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'Higher Education', 'Item Form': 'Serum', 'Unit Count': '1.7 Fl Oz', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.5 x 3.4 x 1.5 inches; 3.99 Ounces', 'UPC': '811381034009'}\nReview Text: Received July 23, 2020.<br /><br />I use this 2x a week in the evenings after applying hyaluronic serum. I've experienced no allergic reaction. I chose this because the retinol concentration (0.5%) isn't too high.<br /><br />This is the second Higher Education skin care product I've purchased that has a very short expiration period - expires in less than 2 months (Sep 2020). The first was the \"Grinding Away skin polishing scrub\" that expires in less than 3 months (Oct 2020).<br /><br />I'm really annoyed that Higher Education is stocking Amazon with old products. If I were paying full price for this, I would expect to receive \"fresh\" products - with at least a year before expiration. If I were purchasing this from a physical store, I'd give this back to the counter lady and just look for something else.<br /><br />One star for sending me an old product.

It's 29\" long. One inch isn't much. Whether 29 or 30\", it's still too short for a tall guy with long arms. It also doesn't scrub that well. I have a 130-cm (51 inches) nylon exfoliating scrub from Daiso. That one really makes great contact with my back and can also be folded up tight to scrub the rest of my body (arms, neck, etc.).

I had to use the slots closest to the middle to ensure masks fit snugly and don't fall down. I could just tie another loop to make the loops shorter but I prefer using these extenders because they hold the loops better. My ears are small.

The bottle is good quality but I don't like the spray head. I prefer the gun trigger type because there's little force required to spray. Also, with oils, spray heads don't really work in that you can't get a mist. All you're going to get is a stream of oil unless you dilute that oil. I don't want to dilute my cooking oils so I'm fine with getting just streams instead of mists.\nReview Title: spray heads not so good\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Neck Gaiter Face Mask , Breathing Face Cover, Reusable Cooling Bandana, Washable Scarf (4 Pack Nebula)\nReview Date: 2021/02/03\nStore: FCY\nAverage Rating: 4.0\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '6.34 x 5.43 x 1.34 inches; 5.43 Ounces', 'UPC': '700306867573'}\nReview Text: FCY (Blue Mars) neck gaiters nebula 4 pk<br /><br />The colors are very nice. The fabric edges are all finished. They fit very snug against the nose and mouth. The fabric is thin. Coupled with the very snug fit, the outline of your nose and mouth is going to be very visible. Because of the snug fit, talking while wearing this gaiter isn't comfortable.<br /><br />I got these to provide some blocking against the cold and cold wind.

Waterfall, 12oz, 3pk<br /><br />I love the shape of the bottle, the color and the mild sweet scent. The soap was fairly thick. It was adequately sudsy. What I hated was the pump. I couldn't do just a slight push (if I only wanted a small amount). It was hard to push just slightly down. It was easier to give it just one full push but that squirted out too much soap. I suppose manufacturers make it that way so the product gets used up quickly. I replaced the pump head with another pump head (salvaged from my other pump bottles) that was easier to push down.\nReview Title: Love the soap, hate the pump head\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Travel Bottles for Toiletries, Silicone Travel Size Bottles And Squeezable Containers Holders with belt clip Keychain for Backpack, Shampoo, Liquid, Cosmetic Products(2 oz, 6 Pack)\nReview Date: 2021/12/02\nStore: MACRAY\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'MACRAY', 'Material': 'Silicone', 'Capacity': '2 Ounces', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '11.73 x 6.61 x 1.61 inches; 8.47 Ounces', 'UPC': '782938308006'}\nReview Text: Macray Travel bottle with clip 2oz 6pk - X002N638MR<br /><br />I wanted to use these to hold hand sanitizer. I clip it to the shoulder strap (on my chest) of my backpack so my hand sanitizer is always within reach. However, this type of container isn't well suited for squeezing out gels in small amounts. The bottle is so soft that you have to really be careful with how you squeeze it. It easily splurts out blobs that are too much for just hand sanitizer.  I found these bottles are better used for shampoo, conditioner, body wash where you need much larger volumes squeezed out than you would need for hand sanitizer.\nReview Title: hard to squeeze out just a small amount\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Other facial scrubs I've tried have coarser particles, so coarse it feels like I'm rubbing sand on my face.<br /><br />What I don't like is that the product I received will expire in less than 3 months - Oct 2020. This doesn't seem to be just a one-time occurrence. I also purchased the  \"Higher Education MBA Night Renewing Serum with 0.5% retinol\". That one expires even sooner - on Sep 2020.<br /><br />I don't know what Amazon's policy is on expiration dates for skin care products. But, if I were purchasing this from a physical store, I wouldn't get something that expires in less than 3 months. I expect a product to be good for at least a year. Granted, expired doesn't automatically mean that a product is unusable. However, customers don't like getting old stock especially when a customer still has to pay full price for it. I didn't it but, if I were, I'd be annoyed enough to return the item.<br /><br />I also don't know if Higher Education regularly sends soon-to-expire items to Amazon or if they're just doing this to Vine purchases. Either way, that's really not good practice. For a facial scrub that costs $25, I don't expect the seller to pass off expiring products on me.<br />UPDATE - After going through reviews of the two Higher Education products, it appears that they regularly send soon-to-expire products to customers. Bad seller - Higher Education. Really really bad.<br /><br />One star for sending me an old product. Amazon, stop selling old products! Customers who paid full price for this - you should return the product.\nexpires in less than 3 months\nMBA Renewing Retinol Serum, 1.7 fl. oz, 0.5% Retinol Hydrates & Brightens Skin's Appearance by Diminishing the Look of Breakouts, Hyperpigmentation, and Signs of Aging by Higher Education Skincare\nHigher Education\n{'Skin Type': 'All', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'Higher Education', 'Item Form': 'Serum', 'Unit Count': '1.7 Fl Oz', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.5 x 3.4 x 1.5 inches; 3.99 Ounces', 'UPC': '811381034009'}\nReceived July 23, 2020.<br /><br />I use this 2x a week in the evenings after applying hyaluronic serum.

Also, with oils, spray heads don't really work in that you can't get a mist. All you're going to get is a stream of oil unless you dilute that oil.

It was easier to give it just one full push but that squirted out too much soap. I suppose manufacturers make it that way so the product gets used up quickly.

The bottle is so soft that you have to really be careful with how you squeeze it. It easily splurts out blobs that are too much for just hand sanitizer.

Other facial scrubs I've tried have coarser particles, so coarse it feels like I'm rubbing sand on my face.<br /><br />What I don't like is that the product I received will expire in less than 3 months - Oct 2020. This doesn't seem to be just a one-time occurrence. I also purchased the  \"Higher Education MBA Night Renewing Serum with 0.5% retinol\". That one expires even sooner - on Sep 2020.<br /><br />I don't know what Amazon's policy is on expiration dates for skin care products. But, if I were purchasing this from a physical store, I wouldn't get something that expires in less than 3 months. I expect a product to be good for at least a year. Granted, expired doesn't automatically mean that a product is unusable. However, customers don't like getting old stock especially when a customer still has to pay full price for it. I didn't it but, if I were, I'd be annoyed enough to return the item.<br /><br />I also don't know if Higher Education regularly sends soon-to-expire items to Amazon or if they're just doing this to Vine purchases. Either way, that's really not good practice. For a facial scrub that costs $25, I don't expect the seller to pass off expiring products on me.<br />UPDATE - After going through reviews of the two Higher Education products, it appears that they regularly send soon-to-expire products to customers.

Waterfall, 12oz, 3pk<br /><br />I love the shape of the bottle, the color and the mild sweet scent. The soap was fairly thick. It was adequately sudsy. What I hated was the pump. I couldn't do just a slight push (if I only wanted a small amount). It was hard to push just slightly down. It was easier to give it just one full push but that squirted out too much soap. I suppose manufacturers make it that way so the product gets used up quickly. I replaced the pump head with another pump head (salvaged from my other pump bottles) that was easier to push down.\nReview Title: Love the soap, hate the pump head\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Travel Bottles for Toiletries, Silicone Travel Size Bottles And Squeezable Containers Holders with belt clip Keychain for Backpack, Shampoo, Liquid, Cosmetic Products(2 oz, 6 Pack)\nReview Date: 2021/12/02\nStore: MACRAY\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'MACRAY', 'Material': 'Silicone', 'Capacity': '2 Ounces', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '11.73 x 6.61 x 1.61 inches; 8.47 Ounces', 'UPC': '782938308006'}\nReview Text: Macray Travel bottle with clip 2oz 6pk - X002N638MR<br /><br />I wanted to use these to hold hand sanitizer. I clip it to the shoulder strap (on my chest) of my backpack so my hand sanitizer is always within reach. However, this type of container isn't well suited for squeezing out gels in small amounts. The bottle is so soft that you have to really be careful with how you squeeze it. It easily splurts out blobs that are too much for just hand sanitizer.  I found these bottles are better used for shampoo, conditioner, body wash where you need much larger volumes squeezed out than you would need for hand sanitizer.\nReview Title: hard to squeeze out just a small amount\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
