I\u2019m not sure why sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) would need to be added to the organic aloe leaf juice.

The oil is so strong that I smelled it even before removing it from the box or breaking the seal on the bottle. The bottle is tiny but mighty, I guess!<br /><br />The oil almost pours out from the bottle, so be careful when adding this to a diffuser or anything else. I accidentally added too much to my diffuser the first time I tried it, because the oil dripped out so quickly.<br /><br />The cedarwood scent is very woodsy. I personally find the scent calming. I read it can also help keep insects away.<br /><br />The bottle says the extraction method is steam distilled, but does not say where the oil was distilled or anything regarding the country of origin.\nReview Title: Very strong\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: 1800 Watt Hair Dryer with Diffuser Hot and Cool Settings 2 Speed Adjustable Negative Ionic Hair Blow Dryer 2 Smoothing Concentrators and 1 Hair Scalp Massager Shampoo Brush for Curly Hair,Woman,Kids\nReview Date: 2020/08/02\nStore: Lassie\nAverage Rating: 4.3\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Lassie', 'Wattage': '2000 watts', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Special Feature': 'Comb, Massage, Hot, Blow', 'Included Components': 'Diffuser, Concentrator', 'Product Dimensions': '11.4 x 9.4 x 3.7 inches; 2.43 Pounds', 'Manufacturer': 'Lassie'}\nReview Text: The look of the Lassie hair dryer is what caught my eye first. It just looks cool! I have the PinkGray color. The gray is a medium shade with a smooth finish that won\u2019t pick up hairs and dust. The pink is a metallic magenta that really pops.<br /><br />The speed controls are on the handle. The slide button doesn\u2019t move easily, so there\u2019s not a big chance of accidentally changing the speed/temperature without meaning to. On the back of the handle is the option for either cool or hot temperature.<br /><br />The hair dryer doesn\u2019t dry my hair any faster than any other hair dryer I\u2019ve used. But I like that I can set the temperature to cool to lessen damage and not have to hold in a cool shot button.<br /><br />The hair dryer isn\u2019t as lightweight as some plastic models I\u2019ve used, but it\u2019s weighted pretty well. The weight of it is distributed evenly on both sides of the handle.<br /><br />The attachments have little tabs that line up with notches on the nozzle, and then you twist them to lock them in place. I like it -- there\u2019s less chance of them popping off while I use the hair dryer.<br /><br />The bottom of the hair dryer says the rated power is 1800 watt, which is contrary to the description which says it is 2000 watt.\nReview Title: Looks cool and works well\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Nail Files 16 Pcs, Double Sided Emery Board Manicure Tools for Filing Natural Gel and Acrylic Nails for Home and Salon Use\nReview Date: 2020/09/15\nStore: Keiby Citom\nAverage Rating: 4.3\nProduct Details: {'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'Keiby Citom', 'Grit Number': '100', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '7.8 x 5.08 x 0.59 inches; 5.29 Ounces', 'UPC': '742025065137', 'Manufacturer': 'YHIT'}\nReview Text: This pack of 16 nail files from Keiby Citom is a great value.<br /><br />I started doing dip nails at home, and the worst part is getting off the old manicure. I have to file off the layers of top coat, which can take a while if I don\u2019t have a good file. I prefer a glass file for actually shaping my nails, but they\u2019re not good for removing layers of polish.<br /><br />Using one of these files, I had the top coat filed off all my nails in less than ten minutes. The 100 grit side is perfect. I actually asked a nail tech friend what I should use, and she told me 100 grit.<br /><br />The files come in a zipper seal plastic bag that can be used to store them.<br /><br />The edges of the files aren\u2019t sharp. I\u2019m talking about the edges that touch your skin; sometimes these can be sharp, especially on pro files, and need to be seasoned to prevent cuts. No problems with that here.\nReview Title: Great files\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Lnlofen Silicone Back Scrubber for Shower, Exfoliating Long Silicone Body Back Brush, Handle Scrubbing Pad, Easy to Clean, Lathers Well, Comfortable Massage for Shower(Green)\nReview Date: 2020/09/15\nStore: Lnlofen\nAverage Rating: 4.0\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '9.37 x 7.44 x 1.93 inches; 7.05 Ounces', 'UPC': '768894803786'}\nReview Text: I like one side of this Silicone Back Scrubber from Lnlofen. The \u201csoft brush\u201d side, the one with the longer bristles, works great for scrubbing my back. I can actually feel the bristles move against my skin, and so I feel like I\u2019m getting clean.<br /><br />The other side, the \u201cstiff brush\u201d side, just slid right over my skin. I didn\u2019t feel the bumps at all.<br /><br />I\u2019m 5\u20195\u201d and slender, the back scrubber is long enough for me.<br /><br />The package includes a hook to hang the brush in the shower, but I just loop it over the shower rail and it dries quickly. The brush can roll up into a compact bundle for storage.\nReview Title: One side works, but that's all I need\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Makeup Headband - 3PCS Spa Headband For Washing Face Skincare Towel Headbands Shower Hair Band\nReview Date: 2022/04/08\nStore: Tinpin\nAverage Rating: 4.2\nProduct Details: {'Color': 'Pink,Silver', 'Material': 'Foam', 'Number of Items': '3', 'Brand': 'Tinpin', 'Size': '3 piece Set', 'Package Dimensions': '8.35 x 7.17 x 2.13 inches; 3.99 Ounces'}\nReview Text: If I have a choice between a plain headband and a unicorn headband, well, I\u2019m picking the unicorn headband every time!<br /><br />These headbands are super cute and colorful. The faux fur is soft and doesn\u2019t shed, and really adds to the unicorn aspect. The horns stand up from the headband, and are sparkly silver. The ears don\u2019t stand up as well, they\u2019re a bit floppy, and also have sparkly silver on the backs.<br /><br />The headbands are on the smaller side. I measured approximately 6 inches across the opening with a headband unstretched, and about 9 inches when fully stretched. I like that the headbands are tight, they stay on my head and hold my hair back. I don\u2019t have to keep fussing with them, they stay in place. They are about 2\u00bd inches wide, which helps with comfort.\nReview Title: Cute and functional\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Vitamasques Cica Green Tea Jelly Facial Cleanser Gentle pH Cleanser is Refreshing, Cleansing & Exfoliating for Smooth, Clean & Radiant Skin - Vegan, Free from Parabens & Gluten\nReview Date: 2022/07/17\nStore: Vitamasques\nAverage Rating: 4.0\nProduct Details: {'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'Vitamasques', 'Scent': 'Tea Tree', 'Material Feature': 'Vegan', 'Package Dimensions': '5.24 x 1.81 x 1.38 inches; 2.89 Ounces', 'UPC': '750258969917'}\nReview Text: This jelly facial cleanser from Vitamasques is made in Korea.<br /><br />The tube has a foil safety seal under the white cap. The cleanser is brown with a jelly-like consistency. It does have a scent, a mix of green tea and tea tree oil. I do notice the scent when using the cleanser but the scent doesn\u2019t linger.<br /><br />A small drop is enough to wash my face and neck. It doesn\u2019t make a lot of lather but does feel silky going on the skin. I really like the consistency of it.<br /><br />And I really like how well the cleanser works! It cleaned two layers of sunscreen grime and sweat off my face. Some face washes don\u2019t remove all the sunscreen residue, and I have to keep washing my face or use an exfoliating scrub. This cleanser? One wash and done. I was amazed by how well it worked.<br /><br />I\u2019m in my 30s, white, with sensitive combination skin. The cleanser did not irritate my face at all.\nReview Title: Gentle effectie cleanser, made in Korea\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

It just looks cool! I have the PinkGray color. The gray is a medium shade with a smooth finish that won\u2019t pick up hairs and dust. The pink is a metallic magenta that really pops.<br /><br />The speed controls are on the handle. The slide button doesn\u2019t move easily, so there\u2019s not a big chance of accidentally changing the speed/temperature without meaning to. On the back of the handle is the option for either cool or hot temperature.<br /><br />The hair dryer doesn\u2019t dry my hair any faster than any other hair dryer I\u2019ve used.

The weight of it is distributed evenly on both sides of the handle.<br /><br />The attachments have little tabs that line up with notches on the nozzle, and then you twist them to lock them in place. I like it -- there\u2019s less chance of them popping off while I use the hair dryer.<br /><br />The bottom of the hair dryer says the rated power is 1800 watt, which is contrary to the description which says it is 2000 watt.\nLooks cool and works well\nNail Files 16 Pcs, Double Sided Emery Board Manicure Tools for Filing Natural Gel and Acrylic Nails for Home and Salon Use\nKeiby Citom\n{'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'Keiby Citom', 'Grit Number': '100', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '7.8 x 5.08 x 0.59 inches; 5.29 Ounces', 'UPC': '742025065137', 'Manufacturer': 'YHIT'}\nThis pack of 16 nail files from Keiby Citom is a great value.<br /><br />I started doing dip nails at home, and the worst part is getting off the old manicure.

Expect to get wet the first few times, if not more. The learning curve and mess is worth it -- my mouth generally feels cleaner after using one -- but I don\u2019t love this particular model.<br /><br />I wanted a water flosser that wouldn\u2019t take up a lot of space on my bathroom counter. This one is a sort of all-in-one, with the reservoir built into the handle, but I kept getting water bubbles in the tank/tip, which made flossing take a lot longer.<br /><br />There\u2019s only 3 speeds: low, medium, and high. The low is quite low. And because of where the speed switch button is, it\u2019s really easy to accidentally switch speeds while using the flosser.<br /><br />The flosser charges via USB, but with a proprietary end (not A or C or anything like that).\nReview Title: Cordless Water Flosser\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Pharmacopia Tangerine-Flavored Lip Balm - Set of 2, 0.25oz - Nourishing Herbal Lip Elixir with 100% Natural and Certified Organic Ingredients\nReview Date: 2020/02/27\nStore: Pharmacopia\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Pharmacopia', 'Item Form': 'Balm', 'Finish Type': 'Natural', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Soothing,Nourishing', 'Package Dimensions': '3.6 x 1.7 x 0.7 inches; 0.25 Ounces', 'UPC': '087819800366'}\nReview Text: I spend 99% of my life with chapped lips, so I\u2019m always looking for a chapstick or lip balm that will actually work.<br /><br />I was intrigued by the hemp oil in the Pharmacopia Tangerine-Flavored Lip Balm.

The lotion has a medium-weight consistency and gets the job done for about half the day.<br /><br />What I don\u2019t like about this lotion is the scent. The scent is subtle, sort of like vanilla coconut, and it\u2019s fine at first.

This gel absorbed into my skin after about a minute, without leaving behind a sticky or tacky feeling. I\u2019ve used some aloe vera gels that have left me a sticky mess, but not this one. So I like the quick absorption.<br /><br />The gel does have a slight scent to it.

I\u2019m not sure why sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) would need to be added to the organic aloe leaf juice.

I\u2019m not as good as I should be at keeping to a proper skincare routine. So I thought this sleeping mask would be great. Put it on before bed and wake up with a hydrated, healthier face.<br /><br />The directions say \u201cApply a generous layer before you sleep or whenever your skin needs a nourishing boost.\u201d I started with a small pea-sized drop, which was enough for my whole face.<br /><br />The mask has a gel consistency and goes on clear. But it did not absorb into my skin. After fifteen minutes, my face was still sticky and tacky. No way would I go to sleep like that, my face would stick to the pillow.<br /><br />So I washed the mask off, which was a disappointment since it\u2019s supposed to be a \u201cnon-wash off mask.\u201d My skin was a little softer, but having to wash my face because it was still sticky defeats the purpose of a mask that I\u2019m supposed to be able to wear to sleep.",
