    "text": "[[VIDEOID:e42d22e07c66c0dc8e53f32b9597fe11]] I usually love this brand, I've used it for years. But this brush is total trash!!! It's not an acrylic brush, more like paintbrush. I gave it to my daughter since she's a painter.  Now if you're a beginner then maybe it's fine but I've been doing nails for many years so I'm used to higher quality. I was only able to do one hand before the bristles bent backwards and had to be constantly dipped back in monomer to reshape it. Now that's saying something because I use odorless monomer and that helps your brush keep its shape but not this brush. Also, the sizing is was off at well. The two brushes in the picture are both the same size",
