I have heard women LOVE them.  I am not ever going to spend $300 - $400 on a hair dryer.  No way!  This one looks a lot like a Dyson.  I can't imagine how a Dyson would be better than this one.  This one is great!  I LOVE it.  I have curly hair and it works wonderful for me.  I dry my hair upside down with the diffuser on cool.  That really helps to cut down on the frizz.  It takes awhile but it's worth it.  I change out the nozzle and use one of the other tools to dry and lift at my scalp.  It gives me a lot more volume.  The dryer is a little heavier than some of my other dryers.  Yes, I have several.  I also like that you don't get all hot and sweaty when drying your hair.  My husband loves that I don't heat up the bathroom!  I really can't say enough good about this dryer.  It is well worth the price.  If you want hot air, this probably isn't the best dryer for that.  It doesn't get really hot.  The cord is long.  I cut a piece of velcro to wrap around it and it works great to keep it untangled.

The air does flow through somewhat.  But these things are painful!  I haven't figured out how to use them without them pulling.  If I put them close to my scalp, they pull.

I like the tousled look but this is a little much.  There's lots of really light colored strands sticking out.  The ends seem to be lighter than the rest of the hair.

I got this in a lighter shade because you can never tell how dark they will be.  I have medium brown hair.  This was lighter than my hair.  I just spray it with root touchup spray and I can get it to match.  I put my medium length hair in a ponytail, wrap it around into a tiny bun and then put this over it.

One is a facial roller with different size ends.  One end is 1 1/2\" and the other is 1\".  The larger one is great for all over your face - forehead, cheeks and neck. The smaller end is good for around the eyes and chin area.  Put this in the refrigerator and it's heaven to use!  Feels wonderful.  And at the same time it's helping to firm your face and neck.  The other box comes with dermarollers.  Two different sizes - one has a 1 1/2\" head and the other is a 3/4\" head.  I use the bigger one all over my face and then apply moisturizer.  It really helps it to absorb better.  The smaller one I use gently around my eyes.  But I mostly use it on my eyebrows with growth serum.  I roll the area first, apply the serum and roll again.  It helps to open up the hair follicles and allow the serum to absorb better. It's slightly painful and leaves your face red.  But it clears up in about an hour for me.  The handles are comfortable to hold while using.  They come in nice clear plastic cases.\nReview Title: Love these!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: HAIRCUBE Natural Looking Short Blonde Wigs Pixie Cut Dark Root Ombre Blonde Wigs with Bangs Wigs for Women\nReview Date: 2021/01/21\nStore: HAIRCUBE\nAverage Rating: 3.2\nProduct Details: {'Material': 'Memory Fiber', 'Hair Type': 'Pixie Cut', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Brand': 'HAIRCUBE', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '10.4 x 7.8 x 3.2 inches; 3.99 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'aswig61-wm3045'}\nReview Text: This wig is beautiful!  It does not look like a wig.  The roots are dark and the rest is blonde.  The crown is very layered and you can't see any part.  There are not fake wig areas that show.  It's got wig combs in the front and the back.  There's lots of volume on the top.  It's a short tapered cut around the ears and back of the neck.  It's very easy to style.  I just fluffed it up with a comb.  I have medium brown hair.  This is a lot lighter than my natural color.  So, I can't pass it off as my own hair.  But other than that I would totally be able to fool people.  I loved the cut so much I decided to cut my hair the same way on the crown.  It gives me so much more volume.  You really can't do wrong with this wig.  It's excellent quality at a very low price.

It's not a flat part.  It's staggered.  You can work with it and it looks very realistic.  There are virtually no bangs on this.  The front hairline looks fake.  I am going to try to cut some bangs and see if that helps the look.  But the hair color is not to my liking.  It has orange highlights.  But mostly around the front!  There's large clumps in the front and the back is mixed in better.  I tried spraying it with root touch up spray to tone them down some.  The hair is shiny.  You will have to use dry shampoo on it to get rid of some of that.  It does not come with any wig clips inside.  It does have the adjustable strap.  I wish there weren't so many issues with this wig.  I love the realistic part!!  The best I've seen in any wig.\nReview Title: I got #30 - dark brown.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Aesfee Makeup Mirror Vanity Mirror with Lights, 1x/2x/3x Magnification LED Lighted Trifold Cosmetic Mirrors, 3 Color Lighting Modes Touch Control Dimmable Countertop Illuminated Mirrors - White\nReview Date: 2021/02/18\nStore: Aesfee\nAverage Rating: 3.5\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Aesfee', 'Shape': 'Rectangular', 'Product Dimensions': '2.6 x 6.5 x 0.01 inches; 2.85 Pounds', 'Mounting Type': 'Tabletop Mount', 'Special Feature': 'Dimmable, Trifold, Lighted, Adjustable, Touch_sensor', 'Item model number': 'AF-805', 'UPC': '608912294366'}\nReview Text: I can't say anything bad about the light this mirror provides.  It has three light levels.  I usually just use the same one.  The daylight one can be a little too much.  You can definitely see every flaw in your face!  I like that you can use this with batteries or USB charged.  I have so many other things plugged into my outlets.  This is just one less.  There are two fold out mirrors - one on top on the left side and one on the bottom on the right side.  They have different levels of magnification.  Those would be a little better if they were a little larger.  The middle mirror is the perfect size though.  This stands up on a base.  I just wish the mirror tilted back a bit farther.  It's kind of difficult to do my eyebrows without lowering my head down.  I may make a stand for it to lift it up about 2 -3\".  But it's a nice light and magnification.\nReview Title: It is bright!\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Rose Quartz Roller with Derma Roller 0.25mm, Facial Kit with Microneedle and Pink Jade Rollers\nReview Date: 2021/02/20\nStore: LOLYSENTA\nAverage Rating: 4.6\nProduct Details: {'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.1 x 5.1 x 1.6 inches; 8.78 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'LS17', 'UPC': '850002524062', 'Manufacturer': 'LOLYSENTA, LLC'}\nReview Text: I love the combination of these two rollers.  The microneedle roller is great for rolling your face before applying moisturizer.  It helps your skin absorb it better.  I also use it on my eyebrows.  I have very sparse eyebrows.  I am applying hair growth serum on them.  I roll my eyebrows, apply the serum and then roll it again to help it get better absorbed.  It really seems to be helping!  I have fine hairs growing back in.  I also like the derma roller.  I put it in the refrigerator.  It feels so good to roll over your forehead and across your eyes.  Helps to relieve headaches too.

That is so hard to get.  The hair on this is a little shiny but not bad.  I can spray it with dry shampoo and it dulls it some.  So, that's not a problem.  It has (3) clips - one on each side and in the back.  I would like a clip in front also.  I have some small clips I can sew in to help the front stay in place.  The part on this is very fake looking.  But most of them are.  I sprayed it with root touch up spray.  That helps a lot!  But I haven't been able to figure out how to use this without it being totally flat on top of my head.  It just screams fake!  The hair is very thick also.  I will have to thin it out and cut the length off some.  There's a lot you have to do to make this presentable.

It really helps it to absorb better.  The smaller one I use gently around my eyes.  But I mostly use it on my eyebrows with growth serum.  I roll the area first, apply the serum and roll again.  It helps to open up the hair follicles and allow the serum to absorb better. It's slightly painful and leaves your face red.  But it clears up in about an hour for me.  The handles are comfortable to hold while using.  They come in nice clear plastic cases.\nLove these!\nHAIRCUBE Natural Looking Short Blonde Wigs Pixie Cut Dark Root Ombre Blonde Wigs with Bangs Wigs for Women\nHAIRCUBE\n{'Material': 'Memory Fiber', 'Hair Type': 'Pixie Cut', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Brand': 'HAIRCUBE', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '10.4 x 7.8 x 3.2 inches; 3.99 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'aswig61-wm3045'}\nThis wig is beautiful!  It does not look like a wig.  The roots are dark and the rest is blonde.  The crown is very layered and you can't see any part.  There are not fake wig areas that show.  It's got wig combs in the front and the back.  There's lots of volume on the top.  It's a short tapered cut around the ears and back of the neck.  It's very easy to style.  I just fluffed it up with a comb.  I have medium brown hair.  This is a lot lighter than my natural color.  So, I can't pass it off as my own hair.  But other than that I would totally be able to fool people.  I loved the cut so much I decided to cut my hair the same way on the crown.  It gives me so much more volume.  You really can't do wrong with this wig.  It's excellent quality at a very low price.  I wish I could get it in medium brown.\nOne of the most natural looking wigs I've seen.\nM-BOX Straight Short Bob Wig Women\u2019s Bob Wig With Bangs Heat Resistant Fiber Hair Synthetic Wig None Lace Cosplay Wigs Natural Looking\uff08#30 14inch\uff09\nM-BOX\n{'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Brand': 'M-BOX', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '10.63 x 8.46 x 2.52 inches; 10.55 Ounces', 'UPC': '717373470629'}\nFirst off, the top part looks very realistic.  It's not a flat part.  It's staggered.  You can work with it and it looks very realistic.  There are virtually no bangs on this.  The front hairline looks fake.  I am going to try to cut some bangs and see if that helps the look.  But the hair color is not to my liking.  It has orange highlights.  But mostly around the front!  There's large clumps in the front and the back is mixed in better.  I tried spraying it with root touch up spray to tone them down some.  The hair is shiny.  You will have to use dry shampoo on it to get rid of some of that.  It does not come with any wig clips inside.  It does have the adjustable strap.  I wish there weren't so many issues with this wig.  I love the realistic part!!  The best I've seen in any wig.\nI got #30 - dark brown.\nAesfee Makeup Mirror Vanity Mirror with Lights, 1x/2x/3x Magnification LED Lighted Trifold Cosmetic Mirrors, 3 Color Lighting Modes Touch Control Dimmable Countertop Illuminated Mirrors - White\nAesfee\n{'Brand': 'Aesfee', 'Shape': 'Rectangular', 'Product Dimensions': '2.6 x 6.5 x 0.01 inches; 2.85 Pounds', 'Mounting Type': 'Tabletop Mount', 'Special Feature': 'Dimmable, Trifold, Lighted, Adjustable, Touch_sensor', 'Item model number': 'AF-805', 'UPC': '608912294366'}\nI can't say anything bad about the light this mirror provides.  It has three light levels.  I usually just use the same one.  The daylight one can be a little too much.  You can definitely see every flaw in your face!  I like that you can use this with batteries or USB charged.  I have so many other things plugged into my outlets.  This is just one less.  There are two fold out mirrors - one on top on the left side and one on the bottom on the right side.  They have different levels of magnification.  Those would be a little better if they were a little larger.  The middle mirror is the perfect size though.  This stands up on a base.  I just wish the mirror tilted back a bit farther.  It's kind of difficult to do my eyebrows without lowering my head down.  I may make a stand for it to lift it up about 2 -3\".

The microneedle roller is great for rolling your face before applying moisturizer.  It helps your skin absorb it better.  I also use it on my eyebrows.  I have very sparse eyebrows.  I am applying hair growth serum on them.  I roll my eyebrows, apply the serum and then roll it again to help it get better absorbed.  It really seems to be helping!  I have fine hairs growing back in.  I also like the derma roller.  I put it in the refrigerator.  It feels so good to roll over your forehead and across your eyes.  Helps to relieve headaches too.  This is a nice duo to add to your daily facial routine.\nHelps your skin absorb moisturizer.\nHOOJIH Hair Topper, 12\" Wavy Wiglet Hairpieces Clips in Hair Extensions for Women with Thinning Hair Add Volume and Coverage - Brown with Highlight\nHOOJIH\n{'Brand': 'HOOJIH', 'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Extension Length': '12 Inches', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy', 'Installation Type': 'Clip-In', 'Package Dimensions': '6.93 x 5.71 x 2.17 inches; 5.08 Ounces', 'UPC': '767065779448'}\nWell, I finally got a hair topper that actually matches my hair.  That is so hard to get.  The hair on this is a little shiny but not bad.  I can spray it with dry shampoo and it dulls it some.  So, that's not a problem.  It has (3) clips - one on each side and in the back.  I would like a clip in front also.  I have some small clips I can sew in to help the front stay in place.  The part on this is very fake looking.  But most of them are.  I sprayed it with root touch up spray.  That helps a lot!  But I haven't been able to figure out how to use this without it being totally flat on top of my head.  It just screams fake!  The hair is very thick also.

I have heard women LOVE them.  I am not ever going to spend $300 - $400 on a hair dryer.  No way!  This one looks a lot like a Dyson.  I can't imagine how a Dyson would be better than this one.  This one is great!  I LOVE it.  I have curly hair and it works wonderful for me.  I dry my hair upside down with the diffuser on cool.  That really helps to cut down on the frizz.  It takes awhile but it's worth it.  I change out the nozzle and use one of the other tools to dry and lift at my scalp.  It gives me a lot more volume.  The dryer is a little heavier than some of my other dryers.  Yes, I have several.  I also like that you don't get all hot and sweaty when drying your hair.  My husband loves that I don't heat up the bathroom!  I really can't say enough good about this dryer.  It is well worth the price.  If you want hot air, this probably isn't the best dryer for that.  It doesn't get really hot.  The cord is long.  I cut a piece of velcro to wrap around it and it works great to keep it untangled.  Highly recommend!!\nReview Title: I would think it's comparable to the $400 dryers.\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Creamily Women Short Bob Wig with Air Bangs Dark Brown Synthetic Chin Length Straight Hair Daily Wear Heat Resistant Full Replacement Wig\nReview Date: 2020/09/04\nStore: Creamily\nAverage Rating: 3.5\nProduct Details: {'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '12 x 4 x 1 inches', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Brand': 'Creamily', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '12 x 4 x 1 inches; 6.46 Ounces'}\nReview Text: This wig is a lot shorter than it looks in the picture.

These clips actually do provide lift.  I don't know how well they would work on straight hair.  I always end up with an indention near the root where I clip these.  That doesn't matter that much on my hair because it's curly and the waves it creates works with curls.  I use my blow dryer with these in to speed up the drying process.  The air does flow through somewhat.  But these things are painful!  I haven't figured out how to use them without them pulling.  If I put them close to my scalp, they pull.  If I put them down a little, they pull.  I usually just dry them as quickly as possible and take them out.

I like the tousled look but this is a little much.  There's lots of really light colored strands sticking out.  The ends seem to be lighter than the rest of the hair.  I just took my scissors and cut those off.  Now I like it!  The hair texture is not shiny.  It looks like real hair.  At least it looks like my hair!  I got this in a lighter shade because you can never tell how dark they will be.  I have medium brown hair.  This was lighter than my hair.  I just spray it with root touchup spray and I can get it to match.  I put my medium length hair in a ponytail, wrap it around into a tiny bun and then put this over it.

    "text": "I have beige undertones in my skin.  I got the beige and it's a little dark.  It does however, work great for contouring.  It has a nice suntan glow.  The compact is made very well.  It has a mirror in the lid.  It comes with a soft puff for applying.  The color is packed into a foam pad.  But it lifts easily with the puff.  It goes on lightly.  If you want a more dramatic look, just add more.  There is no fragrance.  I love that!  I won't be using this all over my face, so I am not sure about the SPF.  If it matched better, it would be perfect.  Really gives you a suntanned glow.",
