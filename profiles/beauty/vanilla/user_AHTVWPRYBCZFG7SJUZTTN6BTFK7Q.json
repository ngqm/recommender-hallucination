I don't know about you but I tend to wander a lot in this tiny former coal mining town where the people live and breathe in dust, and I wear it all over my face, I believe.<br />So scrubbing away all of that once a day feels brilliant. This isn't a harsh face wash. It's a gentle exfoliant but you can feel the grain in it while you wash your face. It's working well too. My skin isn't dried out and feels generally better than where I was using normal soap. And I like how you don't really need to use much of this to get it all over your face.<br />The scent was a bit of a let down because it's sort of nice but a bit weak. You might think this daft but I love a good scent that smells like a delicious candy while washing my face, or perhaps a nice lemony scent.<br />This is ok but it's working very well to clean my skin so no complaints really.\nReview Title: Pretty good\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Lavender Foot Peel Mask 2 Pcs for Softing Smoothing Feet,Peeling Away Calluses and Dead Skin CellsExfoliating Foot Mask,Repair Rough Heels,Get Silky Feet\nReview Date: 2021/06/08\nStore: BOOSCA\nAverage Rating: 3.7\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'BOOSCA', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Product Benefits': 'Smoothing,Nourish', 'Scent': 'Lavender', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Package Dimensions': '7.52 x 5.24 x 0.47 inches; 2.89 Ounces', 'UPC': '783103348421'}\nReview Text: This Melao lavender exfoliant foot peel works very well. The box contains one set of booties for one time use. It\u2019s real simple to use these. You have to start off by cleaning your feet well. It doesn\u2019t hurt to give them a bit of a soak for a time as well beforehand. Just to get them good ready. Next, you place the booties on your feet. It\u2019s recommended that you put socks over the booties to hold them firmly in place since you have to wear them for an hour. I did just that and think that\u2019s a mighty fine recommendation to follow. When that hour is up, you take all that off your feet and give your feet a good washing with soap and water. Now comes the waiting game. At first, I thought they did absolutely nothing.For days, I thought they did nothing. Then, around the 4th/5th day my feet just started to peel. They were shedding skin. It was so weird! They continued to do that for a few days and when it was all over my feet did look and feel really nce for quite some time. Just remember to keep moisturizing to keep them looking and feeling nice for a long time after.<br /><br />The thing about this product is that you can\u2019t expect instant results. It takes a few days and you have to still use the same moisturizers and stuff you were using on your feet, or at least I did. I have really dry feet in spots and I despise it so to have something actually work for a little while was great. You would have to use these every so often though, I think, to keep them as nice.<br />At this time, when I type this, there isn\u2019t a price listed for these so I can\u2019t tell you if it\u2019s worth it or not but they work well and could be.\nReview Title: It's good\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: JODK Heatless Curling Rod Headband, No Heat Hair Curlers Ribbon with Hair Clips and Scrunchie, Soft Plush & 100% Silk Rollers for Long Hairs Sleep In, DIY Hair Styling Tools Kit for Women Girl's-Pink\nReview Date: 2022/01/29\nStore: JODK\nAverage Rating: 4.0\nProduct Details: {'Item Form': 'Clip', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Number of Items': '5', 'Material': 'Silk, Cotton', 'Size': '8 Piece Set', 'Package Dimensions': '9.25 x 4.84 x 2.83 inches; 7.37 Ounces'}\nReview Text: This is an interesting way to get some very nice curls in your hair. It\u2019s a long soft rod type thing. The material is the usual you\u2019d get for a curler wrapped in silk. It\u2019s all bendy and what you do is sort of braid your hair onto/with this. After that, you use the included scrunchies to hold it in place at the bottom.<br /><br />This sounds all well and good but, maybe it was just me, it was difficult to get my hair twisted correctly onto the rod. My hair is long, reaching about mid back and perfectly straight. If you get it on there right, it comes out looking very nice. It just takes a whole lot of practice. Also, as a side note, if your hair is a little damp, it works better.<br /><br />This comes with the main curler, two large scrunchies, two smaller scrunchies, two hair clips, and a nice bag to keep everything in. The scrunchies are silk.<br /><br />This works nicely and it\u2019s worth trying out if you want heatless curls.

It leaves your skin feeling incredibly clean and soft. It makes you feel like you used something that is good for you.<br /><br />It\u2019s a little pricey for one bar of soap but at the same time it does work quite well.

    "text": "If you are looking for a hair straightener brush that really works great on long hair (past the middle of the back) this might just be for you.<br />I have very long hair that has terrible ends. I'm in need of a good hair cut! However, this straightener brush really made them look so much better, almost healthy! I used it with the steam feature and I don't think I've liked a straightener this much in a very long time.<br />I should probably mention something more about this device. This has a 30 second (to a minute) fast heating time, three different heat settings, a steam feature, an anti-scalding feature, and constant temperature protection. It also comes with a glove to protect your hand from the heat, a little water bottle thingy for the steam feature (I think), and a hair clip to use while straitening.<br />I really like this. Usually this type of thing takes me at minimum fifteen minutes or so. This took me about 7 to get a decent effect.<br />I recommend this if you are looking for a hair straightener that will give you a near salon look.",
