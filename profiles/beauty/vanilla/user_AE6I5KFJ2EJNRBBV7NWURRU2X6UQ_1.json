She does like the 30-inch length of the wig, the thickness and the curly design and she does like that it doesn\u2019t require glue to wear it. She says the wig fits her head perfectly well, comfortable to wear and easy to put on and take off without any issues, and she says she likes that it comes with 4 combs and adjustable strap, but she doesn\u2019t like that it has an unnatural hairline. She was equally disappointed that the T- middle part is too wide and the lace front shows too clearly when she wears the wig (see the attached first image). Another thing, she doesn\u2019t like that the color of the lace is not a natural color for black women.\nReview Title: Soft, wavy and glueless......but the T- part shows unnatural color for black women!\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
