We use a lot of soap. That orange goop with pumice in it is our normal heavy duty hand cleaner, this soap is equivalent to that soap without the orange scent. You definitely do need water for it to be effective even though the bottle claims you don't. The hand cream is a great heavy duty healing lotion, similar to eucerin.

There is no bright orange or pale yellow, there are a lot of browns and many more muted pastel colors. The package arrived open with clips strewn about the box. That being said, they stay in my daughter's super fine hair better than the clips of this type we have used before. They have stayed in through a full school day and gymnastics class without falling out. They do have some rainbow colors, just not as many as we'd hoped for. We got 105 clips. So it the colors are important to you, know that they are on the more pastel side of what's pictured and that there is no true orange. They don't come in a giftable package. If staying in hair is what is important to you, these can't be beat.\nReview Title: Muted colors, super staying power\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Barber Hair Cutting Cape for Men Women, Made with Ultra Soft Silk Fiber, 63\" x 57\"\nReview Date: 2020/07/10\nStore: SmoTecQ\nAverage Rating: 4.3\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '11.8 x 9.2 x 0.7 inches; 4.8 Ounces'}\nReview Text: The front of this cape is super long (almost too long) however the back is cut in a way such that no matter how you adjust the neck, only about the top 12\" of the back are covered, leaving the lower back exposed. It is like a long rectangle with the corners of the short end joined behind the neck at a diagonal. It is better than nothing but the cut is just off. Maybe if you have an actual barbers chair it works better. I was using a towel as a cape when I cut my husband and kids hair, and this on top of a towel for the lower back (or two of these capes alternating directions so the long part can go in the front and the back) should do a better job than just the towel. The fabric is cheap thin polyester, which gets the job done but is definitely not \"ultra soft silk fiber\" as stated in the description. The neck is easy to adjust and fasten, so at least it has that going for it.\nReview Title: Strange cut\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Hoop Headbands for Women Premium Tortoise Acetate Wide Headbands No-Slip Grip Hair Hoop Styling Accessorie for Girls,Twin Pack(Marble)\nReview Date: 2020/11/12\nStore: C\u00c9LLOT\nAverage Rating: 3.7\nProduct Details: {'Number of Items': '2', 'Brand': 'C\u00c9LLOT', 'Item Form': 'Spiral', 'Unit Count': '2.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '9.29 x 5.59 x 1.26 inches; 2.4 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I got these headbands for my children (who keep breaking their narrower headbands. These seem very sturdy. There are 3 sets of tiny teeth on the underside, spaced about 4\" apart from each other that hold the headband in even the finest of hair without being uncomfortable. The teeth are small and probably fragile. These headbands appear to be 2 thinner headbands fused together. The top is completely smooth, the bottom has a small ridge running down the middle. One headband is a rainbow of colors, the other is mottled blue and green. Both headbands are about one inch wide. They do a good job holding fine straight or curly hair away from the face. They fit my 3 year old and my 6 year old perfectly, comfortable without slipping. They are tight on an adult head, and squeeze my skull uncomfortably at the base. In my opinion these are ideal for kids and teens but not so great for adults. The \"end holders\" to keep them in shaper are just tiny sections of thin rubber tubing.
