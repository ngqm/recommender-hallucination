I have dry skin and powder often makes me look cakey, this sits on my skin nicely and doesn't look too thick or powdery. I would say this has light to medium coverage. The shade I received is 100 light, it pulls too yellow/orange on me, I wish it had a more neutral undertone. I like that it has SPF 30 and is water/sweat resistant, I will probably get a lot more use out of this in the summer than in the winter.

The blush is not super pigmented, but I prefer my blushes to be blendable so they look more natural. The gold highlighter is gorgeous, it is not glittery but more of a shimmer. It is buildable, so you can make it look natural or blinding. The contour/bronzer is probably my least favorite part of the palette but I still like it. It was a little difficult to blend, it blends out best with a big, fluffy brush. The shade is somewhere between a contour and bronzer, it\u2019s a little too warm for my skin to be used as a contour so I blend it out more like a bronzer.
