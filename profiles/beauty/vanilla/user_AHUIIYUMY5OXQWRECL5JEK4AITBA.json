I found the brush bristles to be a little longer than a normal paint brush length so they were harder to use until I got used to them.  I bet that length is handier for nails.  I like these overall. They are priced well.\nReview Title: using these for rock painting\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Amtidy Women's Rhinestone Crown Tiara, Bridal Wedding Dance Party Birthday Party Women's Headband Tiara, Queen Tiara With Comb\uff08Silver\uff09\nReview Date: 2020/08/19\nStore: Amtidy\nAverage Rating: 3.7\nProduct Details: {'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material': 'Polyester, Plastic', 'Fabric Type': 'Polyester', 'Brand': 'Amtidy', 'Size': 'Queen', 'UPC': '782931993803'}\nReview Text: I liked these headbands.  They were not too tight or too loose.  I like that they kept their shape even though I slept in it.  I like the size of these because they cover my gray roots well.

I think they are pretty standard other than that.  I wish instead of the greenish ones that they put gray in the pack.  These come in separate 24 pin packs so if there is a color that you don't like you can pass them on to someone else, or share them between grumpy siblings who hate to share.\nReview Title: bobby pins in a variety pack\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: uxosuz Beard Apron for Men Beard Catcher for Shaving Beard Apron Trimming Apron with 2pcs Suction Cups+ 1pc Brush\nReview Date: 2021/01/23\nStore: uxosuz\nAverage Rating: 3.3\nProduct Details: {'UPC': '721996979933'}\nReview Text: Just know in advance you will need to provide your own suction cups to attach this to your mirror.  The included set are terrible.  The cape itself is white and thin but works fine. It is long enough for hubby to use in the bathroom with our standard depth counters.  If you have deep countertops you might have to stand right up to it to make this work.  It helps if you have a little drape to catch the hair.  You don't want to stand so far back that it is flat.  Hubby is messy so I was hoping this would help decrease the mess.  It will if I buy some better suction cups and sweet talk him into using it.\nReview Title: terrible suction cups, decent cape\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Amacle Hair Bow Organizer Holder for Girls - Hair Accessories Storage Wall Hanger, Pack of 3\nReview Date: 2021/06/14\nStore: Amacle\nProduct Description: ['Specification:', 'Total length: 76 cm / 30 inch', 'Total length: 76 cm / 30 inch', 'Cloth string length: 55cm / 22 inch ( not included the hanging loop )', 'Cloth string length: 55cm / 22 inch ( not included the hanging loop )', 'Width: 25 cm / 10 inch', 'Width: 25 cm / 10 inch', 'Wood bar diameter: 1.5 cm / 0.6 inch', 'Wood bar diameter: 1.5 cm / 0.6 inch', 'Quantity: 3 pieces', 'Quantity: 3 pieces', 'Note:', 'All', 'hair clips', 'showing on the pics are', 'not included', '.']\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Product Dimensions': '30 x 12 x 1 inches; 12.84 Ounces', 'UPC': '743811744472', 'Manufacturer': 'Huobei(Fuzhou)E-Commerce Co.,Ltd'}\nReview Text: These three bow holders for your wall are bright and fun and perfect for your bow wearing youngsters.  They are pretty simple and you could probably make them yourselves if you are crafty.  You would probably spend as much on supplies as the price of these, though.  If you want to skip the crafting then this is for you.<br /><br />You can personalize by removing the fabric strips and mixing them and reattaching.  Later on when your bow wearing youngsters are done with these you can always use the dowels and fabric strips for other crafts.<br /><br />My only complaint is that they use the same fabric for the hanger.  It is just glued onto the dowel and it is also stretches out easily.  I would have liked this better if the hanger was more sturdy.\nReview Title: simple, crafty look hair bow holders\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: COLORGRAM Artist Formula Auto Brow Pencil 0.25g- True Beauty K-Drama Makeup, Built-in-Spoolie, Clump-Free Formula, Softly Glides, Natural Look (05 Gray Brown)\nReview Date: 2021/06/15\nStore: COLORGRAM\nAverage Rating: 3.7\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'COLORGRAM', 'Item Form': 'Pencil', 'Finish Type': 'Natural', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Product Benefits': 'Softening'}\nReview Text: The one I received is dried out and takes a lot of swipes on my hand to get the color started  Once the color starts coming out it is very lovely but it still takes pressure to get the color to show.

Upon arrival, this 3 pack was in a clear plastic sleeve with an insert that only said VEGAWIWI.  It had no information on the product AT ALL, no origin, no instructions, nothing.  Could they be silk? Sure.  Do I have any proof? No.  If you want to be absolutely sure, I recommend that you buy from a company or brand that has multiple silk products.  I couldn't find another product on Amazon with this name, at least not at this moment.  The sticker on the package from Amazon did say Made In China.\nReview Title: are they silk?\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

    "text": "These are some fun colors from INH.  They are not for the timid.  I had used an INH semi-permanent color (pink quartz) before and knew what to expect.  This time I tried Wish Bear that is a green blue color. I have curly hair and usually just add color to a few curls around my face, but this time I was feeling crazy and did a full head application. I had mixed results with the different levels of dark and light in my hair.  I would say that the image with the different results based on your starting color are accurate.  If you have a mix of levels in your hair then you will get a mixed  look, too.  This will look best (and get you that prettiest Care Bear color) on a pre bleached platinum level hair.<br /><br />Application is easy if you prep you surfaces (old towels are great) and wear gloves during application. I followed the instructions and had washed the night before so I was applying to dry unconditioned hair. I didn't use a bowl and a brush.  I just used my fingers and was careful to section and saturate. I left it on for an hour because I know from using semi-permanent colors over the last year that I need longer than the usual 30 minutes.  On pastel shades I usually go an hour to two hours.  If you are unsure then do a strand test before you go all over crazy like I did.<br /><br />My hair felt great afterwards.  It is conditioning.  It very much reminds me of the expensive brand that starts with an O.  Would I get this particular color again? For me, probably not. I did not have light enough hair to get the Care Bear look.  I also don't think the green in the blue green works on me. Would I get this brand again? I sure would.",
