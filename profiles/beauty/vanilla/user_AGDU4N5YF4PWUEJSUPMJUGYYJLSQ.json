I put my bronzer and highlighter on and then applied this powder using a powder brush. I would only use the applicator inclosed with it if I had no other choice. I went out in my yard and watered all of my flowers, it was 80 degrees out so quite warm. Came back inside and looked in the mirror and my face was still matte. Went about the rest of my day which included a 2.5 mile walk with my family. When I went to wash the makeup off my face my nose was only slightly shiny, that\u2019s it.

These brushes are great quality and deliver an excellent blow out. My hairs smooth and soft with minimal frizz and it stays that way throughout the day. Argan oil infused brushes have been a game changer with my wavy frizzy hair. While the price is high for some I can promise that it\u2019s worth every cent and you won\u2019t be disappointed.\nReview Title: Comparable to Moroccan Oil brushes\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: L'ANGE HAIR Argan-Infused Round Brush | Lightweight & Ergonomic Design | 53MM Tourmaline Ceramic Barrel | Blush\nReview Date: 2022/09/01\nStore: L'ANGE HAIR\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Brand': \"L'ANGE HAIR\", 'Shape': 'Round', 'Product Benefits': 'Smoothing', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Material': 'Ceramic', 'Package Dimensions': '10.1 x 3.1 x 3 inches; 4.8 Ounces', 'Item model number': '2459', 'UPC': '810108191315'}\nReview Text: This argan-infused round brush is of excellent quality and comparable to Moroccan oils infused brushes. This is the 4th one I\u2019ve ordered, it\u2019s safe to say I\u2019m addicted. I have 2 different sizes for home and 2 different sizes for my house up north. This large barrel gives my long thin hair extra volume at the roots. I get a excellent blow out, my hairs smooth and frizz free. I won\u2019t use any other kind of brush with my wavy frizzy hair. While the price is high for some I can promise that it\u2019s worth every penny and you won\u2019t be disappointed.\nReview Title: Comparable to Moroccan oil brushes!!!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: SalonSilk Round Brush Set\nReview Date: 2022/12/14\nStore: SALON SILK\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'SALON SILK', 'Shape': 'Round', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Material': 'Boar, Nylon, Ceramic', 'Package Dimensions': '10.67 x 5.12 x 4.8 inches; 1.19 Pounds'}\nReview Text: These brushes are good quality for the price you\u2019re paying. They aren\u2019t the greatest brushes I\u2019ve ever used but they\u2019re also a fraction of the price I usually pay. You\u2019re getting a lot for your money. Roughly $7 per brush is a steal for these. They style your hair nicely, the ceramic holds heat to smooth your hair. The bristles do tug on my hair slightly but it\u2019s not a huge issue. They work great on my daughters thick curly hair.\nReview Title: Decent brushes for price\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
