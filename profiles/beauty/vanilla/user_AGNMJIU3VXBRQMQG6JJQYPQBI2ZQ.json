The mask is well coated with the honey tea tree serum on a mesh-like sheet. I use the extra serum in the package and apply it on my neck and arms. It's soothing and refreshing, and the scent is not to strong. It made my skin feel soft and supple. It didn't irritate my skin at all.

It comes with a big spatula that you use to apply and remove the gel. I use this 1-2x week to give my irritated skin a break. Had to refer back to their amazon product page to get the directions on how to use and for how long. I apply a good amount to my face and leave it on for 20 minutes. The gel smells very herbal and has tiny bits of artemisia leaf in it.  The mask did help reduce the redness on my cheeks and nose. It left my skin feeling moisturized and refreshed.

The wipes do have phenoxyethanol, which can contain trace amounts of 1, -dioxane (carcinogen) but apparently it's safe at low levels (FYI). It's stated on the box that they try to be zero waste, but honestly... not really. They come individually packaged in a plastic bag and in a box, which are both not biodegradable. It would've been better if the wipes came all together in one packet instead of individual packs. It would've reduced some waste. The wipes are expensive at $.90 each.

You need at least 5-8 pumps for it to somewhat lather and coat the skin. I use a body glove with this wash by the way. The scent smells okay, however, it does smell like stuff you'd use to clean the bathroom or other household objects. Haven't had an allergic reactions to it. It doesn't really moisturize but doesn't strip the skin and dry it out. Great that it is vegan and plant-derived but there's nothing special about this body wash.

You get a great assortment of the spiral cord, regular cotton ties and one small pink scrunchie. They do a good job of keeping my thick hair up without tugging on my hair. Usually I need 2 of the goodie brand hair ties to keep my hair up the way I want but just one of these ties does the trick. They\u2019re are a tad tight to keep on my wrist but the ties come in a nice carrying bag. With goodie hair ties I usually stretchy them out after 10+ uses. Hoping these will be durable.

First off, it took FIVEver to expression the gel out. I think I clicked the bottom 50 times before a tiny bead of gel started to appear, I had to aggressively click and slam the pen onto the counter to get more product out. Once I was finally able to get enough product out, I dried my teeth (after flossing and brushing first) and wiped the silicone bristles onto my teeth from premolar to  premolar on my upper and lower teeth, I used the box it came in to fan and dry off my teeth. I did this before bed time so I wouldn\u2019t have the urge to eat or drink after. The gel will become stringy once your inner lips and cheek touch the gel and there\u2019s a mild taste to it.  So far I\u2019ve used this pen nightly for 4 days and I\u2019ve seen a tiny bit of results. You\u2019re supposed to use it twice a day for 2 weeks. I haven\u2019t experienced any sensitivity from the gel, partly because I\u2019ll use sensodyne toothpaste to brush and the gel is formulated with potassium nitrate that helps prevent sensitivity. Other good ingredients include xylitol and natural antioxidants. Overall good product, just need a better way to get the product out without having to click it. Twisting would be a better option and maybe transparent packaging so you know how much product is left.\nReview Title: Good so far\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

The mask is well coated with the honey tea tree serum on a mesh-like sheet. I use the extra serum in the package and apply it on my neck and arms. It's soothing and refreshing, and the scent is not to strong. It made my skin feel soft and supple. It didn't irritate my skin at all. Next time, I'll put it in fridge prior to using for a more cooling experience.\nReview Title: Great face mask\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Silicone Back Scrubber For Shower,Strong Rub Back Mud Silica Gel Bath Towel, Easy to Clean, All Parts Of The Body To Remove Ash And Mud\nReview Date: 2020/08/02\nStore: LHIUEM\nAverage Rating: 3.9\nProduct Details: {'Material': 'Silicone', 'Brand': 'LHIUEM', 'Operation Mode': 'Manual', 'Package Dimensions': '11.02 x 7.87 x 2.48 inches; 1.21 Pounds', 'UPC': '791523116391'}\nReview Text: It does lightly scrub the back a bit. Lathers and spreads the body wash well, however, it is sort of heavy and a pain to use. I\u2019ll still use it but not on a daily basis.

It comes with a big spatula that you use to apply and remove the gel. I use this 1-2x week to give my irritated skin a break. Had to refer back to their amazon product page to get the directions on how to use and for how long. I apply a good amount to my face and leave it on for 20 minutes. The gel smells very herbal and has tiny bits of artemisia leaf in it.  The mask did help reduce the redness on my cheeks and nose. It left my skin feeling moisturized and refreshed. Definitely recommend for people with irritated and oily skin or after a long week of wearing a tight N95 mask.\nReview Title: Very cooling\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Glow Line Individual Hand Wipes - Hand Wipes Travel Size, Lavender Rose Travel Hand Wipes - Moist Towelettes Individually Wrapped, Wet Wipes Individually Wrapped w/Murumuru Seed & Peptides - 15 ct\nReview Date: 2020/11/29\nStore: BUSYCO\nAverage Rating: 3.3\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'BUSYCO', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Unit Count': '15.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '4.5 x 7.3 x 3.5 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nReview Text: These wipes are okay to use when your hands are feeling soiled. They're saturated and well stay pretty wet for a few minutes or so.  Unscented and doesn't leave my hands dry or sticky. The size of the wipe is a little smaller compared to other hand wipes. The wipes do have phenoxyethanol, which can contain trace amounts of 1, -dioxane (carcinogen) but apparently it's safe at low levels (FYI). It's stated on the box that they try to be zero waste, but honestly... not really. They come individually packaged in a plastic bag and in a box, which are both not biodegradable. It would've been better if the wipes came all together in one packet instead of individual packs. It would've reduced some waste. The wipes are expensive at $.90 each. Not worth it in my opinion.\nReview Title: Biodegradable wipes but not the packaging\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Hylunia Hydrate Body Wash - Energizing Blend With Mango 8.5 oz\nReview Date: 2020/12/14\nStore: Hylunia\nAverage Rating: 3.4\nProduct Details: {'Product Dimensions': '2 x 2 x 5 inches; 11.22 Ounces', 'Item model number': '059ENM-250-R', 'UPC': '185449000313'}\nReview Text: This body wash isn't the best. You need at least 5-8 pumps for it to somewhat lather and coat the skin. I use a body glove with this wash by the way. The scent smells okay, however, it does smell like stuff you'd use to clean the bathroom or other household objects. Haven't had an allergic reactions to it. It doesn't really moisturize but doesn't strip the skin and dry it out. Great that it is vegan and plant-derived but there's nothing special about this body wash. I wouldn't recommend it.\nReview Title: Meh, doesn't lather well\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: MIZON Real Vitamin C Ampoule, Pure Vitamin C, No Water Added,10 Ingredients, Tone correction treatment, Nutrition, Face Moisturizer (1.01 fl oz)\nReview Date: 2021/02/15\nStore: MIZON\nAverage Rating: 4.2\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'MIZON', 'Item Form': 'Serum', 'Active Ingredients': 'Vitamin C', 'Unit Count': '1.01 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '4.1 x 2.7 x 1.7 inches; 5.61 Ounces'}\nReview Text: It\u2019s a great vitamin C ampoule but you need to use it within 3 mths. I keep it in the fridge to extend the life of this serum. It\u2019s slightly thick like oil and has a very pale yellow hue to it. The scent of this stuff is faint and subtle but doesn\u2019t smell bad. It\u2019s kept in a dark glass bottle to prevent light when effecting the serum. It absorbs into the skin well and it has helped with my skin complexion. Great stuff!\nReview Title: Keep chilled\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Spove Spiral Hair Ties Hair Coils Hair Coil Seamless Non-slip Mixed Ponytail Holder Hair Ties for Women & Kids 15pcs\nReview Date: 2021/04/17\nStore: SPOVE\nAverage Rating: 4.3\nProduct Details: {'Material': 'Plastic, Cotton', 'Item Form': 'Spiral', 'Brand': 'SPOVE', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Number of Pieces': '15', 'Package Dimensions': '6.54 x 5.83 x 1.3 inches; 1.45 Ounces', 'UPC': '631145785158'}\nReview Text: Love these hair ties. You get a great assortment of the spiral cord, regular cotton ties and one small pink scrunchie. They do a good job of keeping my thick hair up without tugging on my hair. Usually I need 2 of the goodie brand hair ties to keep my hair up the way I want but just one of these ties does the trick. They\u2019re are a tad tight to keep on my wrist but the ties come in a nice carrying bag. With goodie hair ties I usually stretchy them out after 10+ uses. Hoping these will be durable.

It\u2019s lightweight and leaves a nice matte/satin finish on my skin. It actually doesn\u2019t make my skin oily nor leave a whitecast. The product feels like a lotion that glides on easy and absorbs well into my skin. There\u2019s almost no scent to it, which is a plus. It contains pretty good ingredients to prevent water loss and keeps the skin hydrated and reduces the look of wrinkles!

The consistency is definitely like lotion and more on the thinner side. I prefer a more creamy texture for hand creams. The scent is okay, more like a powder green tea type scent.

When twisting to get my product the lipstick would retract back. It\u2019s weird to apply it at the corners of the lips. Also, when I opened the cap, a bit of the lipstick corner smudged against the lid. It glides on easy, isn\u2019t sticky and it\u2019s very moisturizing the color is vibrant. It\u2019s not an all-day lip product because this can easily come off when eating or drinking. For 13.99? Nah..not worth it.

The bar is about the size of a small mandarin orange. It lather ups my hair pretty well and has a slight rosemary scent to it. I\u2019ll lather, rinse, repeat and go in with a silicone head massager. I\u2019ll follow with my own conditioner. I\u2019ll wash off the excess foam and place the bar back onto the paper it came in. I did notice that the shampoo did slight fade my purplish hair and made it look a bit brassy so I won\u2019t use this too long often. Overall, good eco friendly solid shampoo, the price is similar to that of other solid shampoo brands. Be cautious with some colored hair though.\nReview Title: This shampoo is solid ;)\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: GLO to Go Teeth Whitening Pen \u2014 Easy to Use, Safe & Effective Dentist-Invented Whitening Treatment \u2014 Designed for Sensitive Teeth, Travel Friendly, Cinnamint Flavor\nReview Date: 2022/06/11\nAverage Rating: 3.7\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'GLO Science', 'Product Benefits': 'Natural plant-based ingredients help promote a clean and healthy smile and noticeably whiter teeth in 1 week.Natural plant-based ingredients help promote a clean and healthy smile and noticeably whiter teeth in 1 week.

First off, it took FIVEver to expression the gel out. I think I clicked the bottom 50 times before a tiny bead of gel started to appear, I had to aggressively click and slam the pen onto the counter to get more product out. Once I was finally able to get enough product out, I dried my teeth (after flossing and brushing first) and wiped the silicone bristles onto my teeth from premolar to  premolar on my upper and lower teeth, I used the box it came in to fan and dry off my teeth. I did this before bed time so I wouldn\u2019t have the urge to eat or drink after. The gel will become stringy once your inner lips and cheek touch the gel and there\u2019s a mild taste to it.  So far I\u2019ve used this pen nightly for 4 days and I\u2019ve seen a tiny bit of results. You\u2019re supposed to use it twice a day for 2 weeks. I haven\u2019t experienced any sensitivity from the gel, partly because I\u2019ll use sensodyne toothpaste to brush and the gel is formulated with potassium nitrate that helps prevent sensitivity. Other good ingredients include xylitol and natural antioxidants. Overall good product, just need a better way to get the product out without having to click it. Twisting would be a better option and maybe transparent packaging so you know how much product is left.\nReview Title: Good so far\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

The cap has a dropper in it to help control the amount of serum comes out. The serum was quite runny and it would drip off my hand so I had to cup my hand to prevent it from going everywhere. The bottle is small and is best to used up within 2 weeks. I ended up getting 3 weeks out of this bottle. I used it day and night and noticed my sun spots slightly lighten up. It didn't irritate my skin which I liked. I applied this after toning and before my sunscreen. Good stuff but dislike how runny it was, it was like water. The lotion I didn't care for to much but I like the pouch it came in. You can use it after to store another toiletries, etc.",
