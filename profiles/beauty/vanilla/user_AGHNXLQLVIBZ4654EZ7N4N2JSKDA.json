They go on in a narrower line, of course, but then you can take your finger, or a brush, and spread it out to look more like an eyeshadow rather than a pencil. It's a little harder to apply under the eyes when you have a pencil design like this, but it's doable.

It just seemed like it would be difficult to get one without the other. But really, it's not too bad.<br /><br />The colors go on pretty well, even the lighter color does. They go on in a narrower line, of course, but then you can take your finger, or a brush, and spread it out to look more like an eyeshadow rather than a pencil. It's a little harder to apply under the eyes when you have a pencil design like this, but it's doable. (It is a powder, though, so it doesn't stay very well underneath the eyes.)<br /><br />Overall, pretty colors, interesting pencil design, and a good product that I can recommend.\nReview Title: Pretty colors that go on nicely.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Magnesium Salt Bath Flakes | 8 lb Bulk Size | Body and Foot Soak | By Horbaach\nReview Date: 2021/04/14\nStore: Horb\u00e4ach\nAverage Rating: 4.6\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Horb\u00e4ach', 'Product Benefits': 'Relaxing', 'Unit Count': '128.0 Ounce', 'Item Weight': '8 Pounds', 'Variety': 'Bath Soak', 'Product Dimensions': '10 x 3 x 15 inches; 8 Pounds', 'UPC': '840050601426', 'Manufacturer': 'Horbaach'}\nReview Text: I'm a bath taker and I always use either epsom salts or magnesium chloride flakes. You would think they'd all kind of be the same, but take it from me, they're not. Sometimes the salts are very difficult to dissolve and don't have the same feel. But these flakes are awesome! They dissolve easily and make the water feel so soft and lovely. I feel wonderful after bathing in these salts.<br /><br />The package was popped open when it arrived, but I taped it up and it's held fine. Sometimes that happens with heavy bags being thrown in flimsy boxes.<br /><br />The bag says to use 3 cups, but I usually do about 2, because I prefer having expensive magnesium chloride flakes last a little longer. Two cups is quite sufficient and is what is recommended with many other brands.\nReview Title: Dissolves well, works beautifully\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: C'est Moi Vanilla Vibes Sugar Balm Body Scrub | Invigorating & Hydrating Exfoliant, Clinically Tested Non-Toxic Ingredients feat.

My favorite has been Kiehl's Creme de Corps Soy Milk & Honey Body Polish, and I haven't really found anything that I like as much as that. I wanted to try this because I like the brand C'est Moi, and also because this product comes in a handy jar, which makes it so easy to scoop out and apply to skin.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this product didn't live up to my expectations. It does have excellent exfoliators and feels like a good scrub for the skin all over my body, but the residue it leaves on my skin is icky. It's just too much - kind of feels like a coating of Crisco on my skin.<br /><br />Also, the scent is odd. It doesn't smell like vanilla. It smells like... well, it's hard to explain. It's just off, and I had an aversion to it.\nReview Title: Greasy Residue and Scent is Odd\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: MISS SPA Head to Toe Body and Facial Mask Set, Brighten Under-Eye, Deep Therapy Lip Mask, Moisturizing Foot Booties, Anti-Aging, Anti-Wrinkle, Skin Care for Women, 3-Pack\nReview Date: 2021/05/25\nStore: MISS SPA\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'MISS SPA', 'Product Benefits': 'Softening', 'Scent': 'Fresh', 'Skin Type': 'Dry,All Skin Types', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Product Dimensions': '3.07 x 0.24 x 4.33 inches; 2.15 Ounces', 'UPC': '838623303099'}\nReview Text: First off, I really enjoyed the moisturizing foot booties. They were my favorite in this set. They were non-irritating and left my feet feeling super soft. (I put socks on immediately after so I wouldn't slip on my bamboo floors.)<br /><br />The eye gels were decent. I didn't see any visible results (like de-puffing) but they felt nice.<br /><br />The lip mask was unique! I didn't know lip masks existed. I panicked at first, feeling like I couldn't breathe, which is totally stupid, because I sit with my mouth closed all the time.  I guess the thought of not breathing through my mouth for 20 minutes sent me into a panic. ha! It didn't feel like it did much to soften my lips, however, so not sure I'd put myself through that panic again (just teasing).<br /><br />This is a cute set and would be a cute addition to a gift.\nReview Title: Decent set of Masks\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: YNN Y-Not-Natural Organic Kakadu Plum Extract Anti-Aging Moisturizer by Jillaroo \u2013 100g | Vitamins E, C, A | Fragrance Free Advanced Skin Care and Wrinkle Removal (Kakadu Plum)\u2026\nReview Date: 2021/06/30\nStore: YNN Y-Not-Natural\nAverage Rating: 4.2\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'YNN Y-Not-Natural', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '3.5274 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Package Dimensions': '6.54 x 1.85 x 1.81 inches; 3.53 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Y-Not Natural Aust Pty Ltd'}\nReview Text: This is a lovely moisturizer that leaves me skin feeling soft and hydrated. I'm 52 with mostly normal (occasionally a little dry) skin that only needs a bit extra moisture at night. I like to use this in the morning, as it's just the right amount of moisture to carry me through the day.<br /><br />This is unscented and doesn't irritate my skin at all. It's a little runny, so the hole it comes out of is a tad big and sometimes dispenses too much all at once, but now that I know that, it's not too hard to control.<br /><br />And not that it matters to some, but I think the packaging design is quite pretty.\nReview Title: Gentle, Unscented Moisturizer\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
