I began using this conditioner shortly after my hair was colored in November and I just went for a touch up and got feed back from my stylist. While I thought the color had less brassiness I wanted her professional opinion. Without prompting she said my hair looked great (except for the roots) and asked what I had been doing different. The silver conditioner was my response. My husband, who is totally white haired also has been using the conditioner once per week. To keep the yellow out of his hair he shampoos and conditions purple once a week and this has been a positive addition to his routine. Be careful not to over use this product because the results will be undesirable.\nReview Title: Reduces Oxidation and Brassiness\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Replacement Toothbrush Heads Compatible With Oral B Braun Electric Toothbrush, 4 Count\nReview Date: 2019/06/25\nStore: HDY\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'HDY', 'Size': '4 Count (Pack of 1)', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Item Firmness Description': 'Extra Soft', 'Number of Pieces': '4', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '0.43 x 0.39 x 2.76 inches; 0.81 Ounces', 'UPC': '632088377561', 'Manufacturer': 'HDY'}\nReview Text: After buying name brand toothbrushes for years I was skeptical to try an off brand. So far both my husband and I are impressed with the quality of these brushes. They are firmer than the name brand brush but that is good because the brand brushes splay out the bristles long before the 3 month recommended change time. He tried this brush first and commented that his teeth felt so much cleaner, when I brushed later I agreed with his reaction. These come 4 in a package with color rings attached.
