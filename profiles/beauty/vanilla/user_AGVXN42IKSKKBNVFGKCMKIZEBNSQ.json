I didn't know what it would really do but I gave it a chance and tried this stuff. Holy cow does this stuff actually work and it looks awesome and natural. Key word, natural. I used it just like the instructions said and it smoothed out the small lines at the corner of my eyes and under the eyes. It completely reduced the size of my pores on my nose, which are usually very large. I mean, it made my face look great but the real test was how did my make up look over this stuff. Well, it looked wonderful. It made my make up go on smoother than ever before and the real test was the fact it not only lasted all day but even all night until I washed my face. I couldn't believe how well Mistiq actually worked and how great it worked under my make up. This is one product that I completely recommend and suggest it be a staple in every woman's make up bag.\nReview Title: Refreshing and Smoother Looking Skin\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Elegant Black Quality Plastic Shark Tooth / Comb Design Head Band / Hair Holder By VAGA\nReview Date: 2015/11/03\nStore: VAGA\nProduct Description: ['Shark Tooth Shaped Black Plastic Headband', 'If you would like to see more high quality VAGA products, click on our brand name under the title of this listing.Strong headband will effectively hold straight, smooth hair as well as curly and fuzzy.Headband is 3.5cm wide.']\nAverage Rating: 3.8\nProduct Details: {'Color': 'Black', 'Material': 'Plastic', 'Brand': 'VAGA', 'Size': 'One Size', 'Item Form': 'Elastic', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'UPC': '661799009348', 'Manufacturer': 'VAGA'}\nReview Text: I am totally disappointed with this headband. One it is super cheap and easily bendable which means it will break easily. I have very fine hair so this headband is just horrible with my hair. It sticks up at the top and doesn't hold any hair back because my hair just slides out of it. Now, if someone has very thick hair then this would work perfect for them but for someone like me with very fine hair, this headband just isn't right for me.\nReview Title: Made for people with thick hair!\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Got Glamour Cuticle Pusher, Stainless Steel, Professional Series\nReview Date: 2016/04/05\nStore: Got Glamour\nAverage Rating: 3.4\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '7.3 x 4.8 x 0.5 inches; 0.35 Ounces', 'UPC': '794168154841'}\nReview Text: I'll admit that I do have a nail addiction and I do my nails all of the time. Honestly, it's much cheaper that way. Anyway, normally I don't fool with pushing my cuticles because I'm always loosing the wooden pushers and they always go so dull after using them for a while. Well, now I don't have to keep buying those because this cuticle pusher is awesome and made out of stainless steal. It has a really awesome design, a very nice weight so that it stays in the hand and also can be used to clean out from under the nails too.<br /><br />I really do love using this though. I always give it a little wipe with an alcohol pad and then do what I need to do. I use the curved ended down to push my cuticles back and then use it face up to clean out from under my nails, because lets face it. It doesn't matter what you do, stuff is still gonna get up in there and you have to clean it out every so often.<br /><br />Anyway, works great and totally worth the price.

    "text": "First, these are so super cute and I loved them when I first got them. However, the love quickly faded as I started using them. While they totally work and hold your hair up, they break very easily and I have very fine thin hair. So, if they break so easily with my fine hair, then people with thicker hair, well good luck. These are better for looks than actually using them to hold your hair, and that's not what I was looking for. So, while these are super stinking cute, they don't really work holding your hair without breaking.",
