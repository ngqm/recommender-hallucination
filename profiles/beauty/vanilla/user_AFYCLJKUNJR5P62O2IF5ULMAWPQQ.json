The bundles are probably middle weight-not super thin or lightweight but not suer heavy either. They are perfect for making clip in extensions or pony tail wraps.  The hair is soo soft and thick but looks fine with my fine hair.<br />Mine came with a small silk piece to use as a topper or perhaps bangs.  The one I got was a bit weird. The hair all went to a slight angle. I don't know if this is from being packed or what. I am going to wash it and brush it straight while wet and see how it dries. I'd love to have a little topper piece but if it stays slanted I'll make it into something else.\nReview Title: Gorgeous hair!!!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: C.O.

I have a plethora of creams and lotions but nothing works as well as this Quince hand lotion. Seriously, this is best hand cream I've ever used.<br /><br />The tube it good sized and the lotion is thick and creamy. It isn't greasy at all and absorbs into the skin. I does feel like it creates some kind of invisible glove barrier.  Since using it, my hands and cuticles have been softer and are healing.  The scent is very faint and a little odd. I can't quite put my finger on what it is, but it does have a bit of a citrusy scent. It doesn't smell like quince fruit or carrot, but it's not a bad smell.<br /><br />C.O. Bigelow makes amazing products and this one doesn't disappoint.  Put it on at night and your hands will thank you. You'll feel and see a difference in the morning!\nReview Title: Works like a dream\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: ABH AmazingBeauty Hair Clip Ins - AmazingBeauty Luxury Blonde Remy Human Hair Double Weft Clip in Hair Extensions, Full Head 140 Gram, 7 Pieces with 18 Clips, Platinum Blonde 60, 20 Inch\nReview Date: 2019/12/27\nStore: ABH AMAZINGBEAUTY HAIR\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'ABH AMAZINGBEAUTY HAIR', 'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Extension Length': '20 Inches', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Installation Type': 'Clip-In', 'Package Dimensions': '10.2 x 4 x 3 inches; 10.41 Ounces', 'UPC': '639846527848'}\nReview Text: I have only had synthetic hair clip ins in the past and had no idea how dreamy real hair pieces would be. This hair is SOOO SOFT!!!!. It is light enough that I can't even tell they are clipped it, they feel natural.  The texture is fine and they blend well with my baby fine/thin hair.  I got the light blonde and while it didn't match my platinum perfectly, it was close enough.<br />My hair went from platinum to copper red last week so I needed a different color. I dyed these and they match perfectly.  I wish I could find a clip on pony tail or wrap from this company. These are so worth the money. They also come with a rat tail comb to help with sectioning and teasing your hair to attach these, extra clips and a nice drawstring storage bad.\nReview Title: These are great quality hair!!!!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Lovrio 20\" 20 Pcs 50g Glue Hair Extensions Piano Color Dirty Blonde mixed with Light Golden Blonde P18-22 Seamless in Human Hair Hair Extensions With Adhensive Tape\nReview Date: 2020/03/05\nStore: Lovrio\nAverage Rating: 4.0\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Lovrio', 'Hair Type': 'Oily', 'Installation Type': 'tape', 'Package Dimensions': '10.24 x 4.25 x 1.89 inches; 6.7 Ounces', 'UPC': '633085357099'}\nReview Text: I've been wanting to try tape in extensions and see how well they would do in my baby fine thin hair. In the past, sew in and clip in extensions pulled the hair from my scalp.  The salon I got to charges over $300 for a set so I was hesitant to spend that kind of money if it wasn't going to work well for me.<br /><br />I decided to get these so I could try them before spending hundreds at the salon.  They came quickly and are really wonderful quality hair. They are super soft and come with everything you need to put them in yourself-the hair pieces, tapes and a comb. I watched a few youtube videos to make sure I wouldn't screw it up. I wanted to add them just to the sides of my head, where I'm thinnest to see how I liked using/wearing them.  The application was super easy.  I am so surprised how easy this is to do yourself at least on the sides of your head. The back of the head will be a challenge but have a friend help you out. These also come with additional adhesive in case of any mistakes. There are only 20 pieces which create 10 hair pieces because you sandwich your hair between two loose hair pieces. So if you want a thicker look or have thick hair you'll want to order two boxes.<br /><br />I'm super pleased with these and will order more when these need replaced.\nReview Title: Gorgeous Hair Extensions\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: WOME Jumbo Braiding Hair 165G Low Temperature Synthetic Fiber Hair 3Pcs Blonde Color Crochet Twist Braids 82\" Long Hair Extensions for Woman\nReview Date: 2020/11/02\nStore: WOME\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '12.8 x 10.16 x 2.95 inches; 1.19 Pounds'}\nReview Text: I got this to make some falls and braids to attach to my own hair.

I do one about every 3 - 4 months. Its gross but cool to see all the dead skin peel off and soft beautiful skin underneath. I've tried many brands and this was one of the best. Some just kinda flake and look like you have foot dandruff. Nothing to peel and your feet don't feel much different after wards. However this brand mask peeled off in huge pieces. It was grossly satisfying to peel it off.<br /><br />I left the foot masks on for 2 hours, didn't mean too but I was web surfing and lost track of time. They didn't sting or burn at all. It started to peel in a couple of days and was the fastest peel I've ever gotten. Right now they are mostly dead skin free except for the edges which are flaky. The bottoms are soft and I'm really happy with this mask.

They have been great. They are made of thick plastic with a long inner tube so every last drop gets used. I've used all of them and none clog or have stopped working.<br />Very very pleased with them.\nReview Title: Handy little spray bottles\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: 15Pcs Nail Clips for Polygel: Nail Tips Clip for Quick Building Polygel nail forms Nail clips Kit for polygel Finger Nail Extension UV LED Builder Clamps Manicure Nail Art Tool\nReview Date: 2021/10/10\nStore: Trati\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Size': '1 Count (Pack of 1)', 'Brand': 'Trati', 'Coverage': 'Full Well Tips', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Number of Pieces': '15', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.4 x 1.1 x 0.71 inches; 2.75 Ounces', 'UPC': '729993185500'}\nReview Text: If you do polygel or glue on nails, these are pretty useful to hold it on your natural nail. They aren't perfect though. The grip could be tighter. They didn't fit my little fingers very well at all, but worked ok on my other fingers. They are clear so if you do clear nails or polygel forms, you can put them under the UV light and have it cure the gel. Overall a good deal.\nReview Title: Useful for glue on nails\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

They are very clear and great if you want to have clear tips with dried flowers or glitter decorations.  There is a variety of sizes to fit everyone and the fit on the nails has been really good.",
