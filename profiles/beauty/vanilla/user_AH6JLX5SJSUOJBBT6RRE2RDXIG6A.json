I wouldn't say it's in bad shape but I feel it is for being in mid 30s. Having health stuff going on, former daily tanning machine user, former smoker and my weight goes up-and-down- all things that have contributed to my skin changes and my neck is no exception. This cream is soothing and leaves a lot of moisturize but not a lot of goop. I feel like my skin looks smoother, though I'm sure more consistent and long-term use will bring the most benefits and results. The texture of it is so creamy and thick and feels great on! Arrived sealed and packaged-up really well.\nReview Title: Liking it\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Altaba Long Blonde Wavy Wigs for Women Ombre Blonde Middle Part Wigs Natural Looking Synthetic Wig Party Cosplay Wigs for Women Heat Resistant Fiber (Light Brown to Golden)\nReview Date: 2021/03/25\nStore: Altaba\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Hair Type': 'Wavy', 'Brand': 'Altaba', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Special Feature': 'Glueless', 'Package Dimensions': '12.2 x 8.5 x 2.44 inches; 9.14 Ounces'}\nReview Text: Soft and pretty.

I like that it's got the multiple colors, I personally haven't had many that do. The length and style combined with the colors is a lot of fun. It sheds a little. I try to be careful with the ends as they've been a little tangly but it's a costume wig so I often experience that with other costume wigs, especially with length and curls.

So getting the opportunity to try it out allowed me to branch out and try a shade I would normally be hesitant to buy. I'm glad because I love it! I ended-up loving the shade and how it looks on me. It applies so smoothly and even feels moisturizing while wearing. I love the shimmer- it's enough to be noticeable and pretty but isn't too much. Happy with it!\nReview Title: Happy with it!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

    "text": "To me the shade on the product picture looks like it might have a little pink in it but I don't notice it when I apply it. Maybe that's just me \ud83e\udd14 Regardless, I feel the shade is very pretty...and definitely is metallic.<br /><br />It's also very long-lasting- to the point that later when taking it off, I used both an oil cleanser and makeup remover. Transferring is minimal. It actually stays a little sticky the whole time while wearing it, so that makes it a little surprising that it's so long lasting- since many liquids dry completely. It's not overly sticky, so I didn't find it bothersome.<br /><br />Applies smoothly- it does feel like a velvety, whipped texture<br /><br />If you're concerned about the appearance of lines on your lips with a liquid lipstick- I feel this is one makes them a bit pronounced.<br /><br />Overall, for a liquid lipstick, I think it's pretty good. Has rich pigment and has a stand-out metallic look<br /><br />Packaging is pretty",
