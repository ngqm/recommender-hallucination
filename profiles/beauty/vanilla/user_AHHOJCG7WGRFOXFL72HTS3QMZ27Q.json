  "raw_response": "The individual displays a strong interest in skincare products, especially those focused on brightening, moisturizing, and firming effects. They have consistently purchased sheet masks and cleansers over the years, indicating a preference for multi-functional products like those containing vitamins, aloe vera, and hyaluronic acid. \n\nHowever, the user's ratings imply dissatisfaction with many items, particularly regarding effectiveness, scent, and texture. They frequently provide low ratings for products that fail to deliver claimed results or have undesirable characteristics, such as unpleasant smells or inadequate cleaning.\n\nIn contrast, they show enthusiasm for moisturizing products that provide a pleasant scent and effective hydration, as exemplified by their positive review of a body butter. The person's buying habits suggest that while they seek products that enhance skin appearance, they are discerning and likely to be disappointed by underperforming items.\n\nOverall, the key trends include a focus on skincare, a preference for natural ingredients, and high expectations for product performance, leading to critical evaluations of purchases.",
