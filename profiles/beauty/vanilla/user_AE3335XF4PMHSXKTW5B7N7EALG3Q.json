Very unusual and I haven't seen mascaras like this one before which makes it very visually appealing. The wand is silicone or rubbery. The mascara is very black and bold on the lashes (I have brown lashes and it pops in color). The fibers are there, there are very many of them and wand builds on those fibers very very well with every application stroke. There are two things that make me uncomfortable about this mascara. First is the smell of it. It is a very strong / pungent chemical smell that does not smell like your average mascara from a drug or department store. Second, it is made in China. Maybe I am paranoid, but learning a little of how cheap cosmetics are made oversees, the smell reminds me of all the descriptions from those documentaries. On the bright side (aside the smell), my eyes did not sting upon application, the mascara did not shed, and removing it (although it is waterproof) was very easy with regular miscellar water and a cotton pad. Because of the smell, not a product I would purchase again or give as a gift. But overall very pretty and definitely builds the length + volume with the fibers that are part of the mascara.\nReview Title: Pretty and lots of fibers but smells funky\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Bouquet Garni Body Shower White Musk - Unique Fragrance Decanting Engineering Method gives Long Lasting Rich Fragrance - Gentle and Mild Cleansing Scented Body Wash with Natural Surfactant 17.85 Fl Oz\nReview Date: 2020/10/26\nStore: Bouquet Garni\nAverage Rating: 4.0\nProduct Details: {'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Skin Type': 'All, Dry', 'Brand': 'Bouquet Garni', 'Scent': 'Garni', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '8.23 x 6.34 x 3.66 inches; 1.34 Pounds'}\nReview Text: I don't typically like musk as its very strong and powdery.. But this body wash altered my perspective a bit. One small pump of this body wash covers your entire body. Is that not cost effective or what? The consistency of the soap it self is very dense and thick and not droopy and watery like most body washes out-there. The smell lingers for a few hours until you bathe again so its like wearing a perfume without a perfume (if you like the scent of course). The foam is also very rich if using this soap with a sponge.

Really concentrated and thick/creamy, and you can definitely feel the sunscreen in it, cuz it makes it more thicker than most other BB creams with low levels of SPF. The color selection is SUPER limited, but I chose the lightest one and I am normally like a 120 Ivory in Maybelline (Matte version) drugstore foundation. It blended out very well. You need only but a small amount of it so it lasts a long time, and it has a pleasant smell to it (at least for me). The only and only thing I dislike is the cakiness of this foundation that forms in creases (around the mouth, eyes, forehead, chin area etc.). Primer no primer, lotion or no/lotion, setting spray or no setting spray - or just on bare cleansed face. Cakiness still forms for me in about 30-60 minutes. This happens even with super little application - which is annoying. But the quality of coverage and texture is there if it wasn't for the cakiness I experience every time I use it.\nReview Title: Cakey but nice coverage...\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Dr. Au Anti-Aging Face Oil Retinol Serum by Au Natural Skinfood - Promotes Youthful, Glowing Skin | Collagen Boosting Wrinkle Repair | No Oily Residue - Just Soft to the Touch Skin | Day & Night Moisturizing treatment for Men and Women\nReview Date: 2020/12/10\nStore: A\u00da NATURAL SKINFOOD\nAverage Rating: 4.2\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'A\u00da NATURAL SKINFOOD', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Type': 'Oily', 'Item Volume': '4 Fluid Ounces', 'Product Dimensions': '0.9 x 0.9 x 3.8 inches; 1.59 Ounces'}\nReview Text: Oil comes in a very elegant small glass bottle with dropper, but be aware that the glow that you achieve with this oil is due to the shimmer that is inside the bottle.

Its application is easy, the clay spreads into a thin layer, BUT this mask is not for everyone. I am part of that \"not-everyone\". I have oily combo skin and somewhat sensitive skin...this mask upon application stung/burned. So the ingredients may not also be for everyone. But lets talk about the packaging and the quantity of the mask it self. The tin came all scratched up and \"worn out\". When I examined it, it looked as if it's old, and sat around for a while. (not a giftable appearance). Quantity and price is a joke. If you refer to my pictures, the small jar is about 30% full. Where is the other 70%? Or at least another 30%? This mask goes on your face in an even but thicker layer as all clay-masks do. So there is definitely no value here.\nReview Title: Not a very good mask...\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: NACOLUS Gentle Soothing Exfoliating Gloves Professional Korean exfoliating mitt,Two-sided Use skin exfoliator for body,Dead Skin Exfoliating Gloves for softer & smoother skin Chemical free ,Pink\nReview Date: 2021/08/12\nStore: NACOLUS\nAverage Rating: 3.8\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'NACOLUS', 'Skin Type': 'Acne Prone', 'Product Benefits': 'Exfoliating', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Material Type Free': 'Chemical Free', 'Product Dimensions': '8.66 x 5.9 x 0.12 inches; 1.13 Ounces', 'UPC': '049500266806'}\nReview Text: This shower mit is very similar to what is used in Korean spas during a body scrub treatment. This mit-scrubby looks gentle but don't be fooled as it is abrasive and really works to remove dead / dry skin and increase circulation. The quality of the mit is very good, and is sown well - however one huge downfall is that it shrinks when it comes in contact with water and later when hung to dry. So basically it never really goes back to its original or close to its original form. I found this very frustrating because even my small hands get stuck in there when I try to use it. I now use it without putting my hand inside, but it works best when wearing it as a mit over your hand because you have more control over the sponge.\nReview Title: Works great but shrinks in size....\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Liquid Foundation Makeup Sunscreen 2 Pcs 35ml Waterproof Oil Control Moisturizing Lightweight Non Stick Concealer Foundation for Face and Body in Glass Bottle with 2 Pcs Black Makeup Sponge\nReview Date: 2021/09/05\nStore: Marine Forest\nAverage Rating: 3.6\nProduct Details: {'Item Form': 'Stick,Liquid', 'Finish Type': 'Natural', 'Package Information': 'Bottle', 'Brand': 'Marine Forest', 'Coverage': 'Light', 'Package Dimensions': '5.12 x 4.26 x 1.54 inches; 7.68 Ounces', 'UPC': '729843537381'}\nReview Text: This foundation may not work for oily combo skin.
