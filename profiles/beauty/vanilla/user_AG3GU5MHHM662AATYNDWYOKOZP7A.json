This is a good value sized bottle and I expect it to last for quite awhile.\nReview Title: Good stuff!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Pretty Frank Natural Deodorant - No Aluminum Deodorant for Women, Men, Teens, & Kids \u2013 Paraben Sulfate Free Solid Deodorant Featuring Shea Butter, Coconut Oil, Vitamin E & Baking Soda (Lavender)\nReview Date: 2020/08/31\nStore: PRETTY FRANK\nAverage Rating: 3.9\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'PRETTY FRANK', 'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Scent': 'Lavender, Coconut', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '5.87 x 5.12 x 1.14 inches; 4.23 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'DSF-BS-LAV'}\nReview Text: I've been a natural deodorant user for years and have tried many brands on the market, my favorite so far has been Native, which is also one of the most popular, so I thought I would do a comparison with that brand.<br /><br />Both are stick deodorants, but the PF deodorant has a larger case, and just a little more product, barely enough worth mentioning though. The deodorant on the PF brand slides on thicker and isn't as hard as the Native deodorant so it would be easier to apply too much with the PF than with Native. Not huge but something to consider.<br /><br />They both seem to do an equally good job at keeping odor away and I noticed no increase in odor while wearing the PF vs. the Native.<br /><br />Price-wise they are about the same so you really don't save money either way.<br /><br />Fragrance-wise I didn't really have a preference for one brand vs. the other, they both have a nice range of fragrance and there is enough variety to appeal to most people.<br /><br />Because of application, I will be sticking with Native, but if you are looking for something that glides on a bit thicker than this would be the best choice.\nReview Title: A great option!\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: SUPRENT Razors for Men with Matrix Cutter Head, 38.5\u00b0 Golden Angle Shaving Kit for Men, Travelling Razor Kit-1 Mens Razor Handle, 2 Blade Refills,1 Dock,1 Shave Foam\nReview Date: 2021/08/31\nStore: SUPRENT\nAverage Rating: 3.6\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'SUPRENT', 'Number of Blades': '6', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Handle Material': 'Metal', 'Product Dimensions': '3.94 x 3.94 x 1.97 inches; 1.28 Pounds'}\nReview Text: Not a dude but I have plenty of curves so I can testify to how well these work on curves and because of the shape of these they are easy to use on all curves.

They worked well though if used with another non-oil cleanser, and for that reason I give them 5 stars as they really do take off all my makeup and moisturize my face well.",
