I feel like the rubber bit that holds it together will eventually break. It is just flimsy. But, for now, it does its job.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe individual exhibits a strong preference for high-quality, reusable beauty products, demonstrating a commitment to sustainability. Consistent positive sentiments are noted for items with soft textures and comfort, enhancing their experience, particularly in makeup removal and hair accessories that avoid causing discomfort. Common themes reveal a focus on makeup and hair solutions designed for everyday use, indicating practicality and ease of use as essential factors.\n\nQuality is prioritized, but the individual is moderately price-sensitive, as seen in the mixed ratings for lip products, which often do not meet their expectations for longevity and feel. Personalized styling options like wigs are explored, reflecting a desire for versatility, though satisfaction levels are lower due to quality discrepancies. \n\nOverall, core preferences highlight a blend of functionality and comfort with an inclination towards eco-friendly choices, while maintaining a critical eye for product performance and value. Their purchase behavior suggests a discerning shopper looking for reliability and satisfaction in beauty routines, favoring products that provide both aesthetic appeal and practical benefits.",
