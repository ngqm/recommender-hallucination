It comes with 9 colors to choose from, 5 of which are matte and the rest shimmer. The matte shadows don't cake and the shimmer ones go on smoothly and are not greasy. I like the blend of the colors in the set, they are nicely matched. I like that the colors are subtle, yet provide a good variety for you to play around with and express yourself. The wheel does spin, but only when it is closed, which is not a functional feature and is just for aesthetics. Once you open the lid, the wheel locks in place. I wish there was a way to rotate it once the lid is open.

She has medium-long hair and makes turbans out of regular towels all the time, so I thought that she would enjoy this. The hair wraps are cute and soft to the touch, so they feel comfortable to wear. Unfortunately, some of the strings were loose, so not a very high quality sewing.  Because the product is made with soft microfiber material, it does not work as well as a regular towel to dry the hair. The cap is even less effective than the turban, because the hair stays loose inside and the moisture does not absorb. My daughter complained that she wore the wrap for a while and when she took it off, her hair was still very wet. She told me that the regular towels work much better. The material also takes forever to dry once it gets wet, unlike a regular towel. Therefore, I wish that the product was made of an actual towel material. I think it would have worked much better for the intended purpose.\nReview Title: Hair Stays Wet And Wraps Take Forever To Dry\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Bold Men, Shampoo 250 ml- Mens Daily Shampoo (Dark Grizzly)\nReview Date: 2020/12/31\nStore: BOLD MEN\nAverage Rating: 4.0\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'BOLD MEN', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Hair Type': 'Coarse, Curly', 'Scent': 'Cinnamon,Citrus', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '1.97 x 1.97 x 7.48 inches; 9.59 Ounces', 'Item model number': '793611800595', 'UPC': '793611800595'}\nReview Text: I got this shampoo for my husband.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThis individual exhibits a clear preference for quality and effectiveness in personal care products, particularly in cosmetics and grooming. Consistently higher ratings are given to products that emphasize soothing, refreshing, or distinctive sensory experiences, such as pleasant scents in body washes and effective results in shampoos.\n\nCommon themes in purchases include a focus on practicality and multi-functionality, as noted in the eyeshadow\u2019s versatility and the convenience of the razor design. However, they show a degree of dissatisfaction with quality inconsistencies, especially in the microfiber hair towel wraps and lotion\u2019s moisturizing capability, indicating a fine balance between aesthetics and functional efficacy.\n\nQuality seems more critical than price, as most ratings reflect disappointment when products underperform, regardless if they are budget-friendly or not. The individual appreciates products that offer a tailored experience without resorting to harsh chemicals or overpowering fragrances, particularly for sensitive skin types. The interest in gift-able items suggests they value items that can serve dual purposes, such as personal use and gifting. \n\nOverall, this shopper favors well-designed, effective personal care items that provide sensory pleasure while being mindful of quality and performance standards.

I love the combination of items, it is almost like opening gifts on Christmas and pulling out one item after the other. I love the soap bar and the bath bombs. The candle is also a nice touch and smelled amazing! This is probably silly, but my favorite item in the box was actually the bottle opener that is shaped like a key. It is so unique and functional, and something that will last a long time. I was not so impressed with the wine stopper. It looks like metal but is made of plastic. I also don't really like messages on my cups, so would have preferred that to be plain or with a graphic/picture design. The cup itself is good and has a nice sliding lid that fits quite snuggly. The set also comes with a blank card inside. Overall, quite a nice gift set and put a smile on my face when I opened it.",
