With younger children, picking nail polish is a given, so despite the gel\u2019s potential to last for up to two weeks, they manage to remove it in just a few days.  For them, though, it means another nail session and new colors, so no big deal.  The gel nail polish was hopefully our answer to increase the duration and longevity of their finished nails.<br /><br />Anzuo Gel Nail Polish offers attractive color kits.  We received the Kit 3 set, which contains black, red, white, and three shades of tan to brown.  Like others have commented, the lids only contain numbers, and the kit includes stickers where the user has to create the swatches.  This is an inconvenience, but not the end of the world.  We found it to be a good test to see how the gel polish would actually apply and then finish.<br /><br />The gel was rather thick, even after keeping it at room temperature, and rolling it to ensure sufficient mixing.  With thinner and increased coats, the polish results in deep, beautiful colors that we really enjoy.  The white looks like white-out, even with a top clear coat, though.  The black and red are the favorites in our home.<br /><br />The main problem we experienced and shared with others is the inconsistency and deficiencies in the product\u2019s marketing.  There are typos, poor translation and grammar, and worse yet, is the inconsistency in the cure times advertised by the company on the Amazon site and the actual shipping box.  The box says cure time is 10-30 seconds by LED/UV lamp, but the website says time frames up to 120 seconds.  That is a huge difference that seriously impacts the quality and life of the nail finish.  We cure using time frames of 60-120 seconds, depending upon the wattage used by our lamp.  With these longer cure times, we have been able to keep the polish looking well and intact for over a week now, even on our children\u2019s nails.<br /><br />If you can overlook the need to label the bottles, disregard the spelling and grammatical errors, and then utilize your own cure times, the Anzuo gel polish is worth using.\nReview Title: Color Kit 3- Beautiful colors, long-lasting finish, but poor marketing job\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Aibilye Shower Cap, 3Pcs Shower Cap For Women,Shower Cap For Kids, Double Waterproof,Hair Care Cap,Salon Shower Cap,Reusable, Medium Size(STYLE-3)\nReview Date: 2020/12/07\nStore: Aibilye\nAverage Rating: 4.3\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Aibilye', 'Material': 'Polyester', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Kid', 'Pattern': 'Floral', 'Size': 'Medium', 'Package Dimensions': '11.1 x 8.1 x 0.2 inches; 3.99 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I got these for myself and my daughters.

The gel nail polishes also smell great, like I\u2019ve been working on a Christmas tree.  The colors in this set are some of our favorites.  The dark green and the dark glittery blue are our favorites.  We find it best to apply more than one coat, although Pine is not incorrect in advertising that one coat is essentially equal to two of those from other companies.  The chameleon set\u2019s colors look amazing and although not exactly like the stickers on the top of the polishes, they still are good enough to tell which is which.  The different colors are a great combination and allow for salon quality finishes.  I have found the Pine gel nail polishes last a very long time when you properly prepare your nails before application, and when you allow the polish to have sufficient cure times.  I have also found that my nail beds are less beat up when using the Pine products.  The color options and long lasting finish of Pine is hard to beat, and I strongly recommend this product and brand.\nReview Title: Dark and glittery finish that provides top notch nails!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

The unicorns on them are fun and whimsical and the colors are nice. They work well in the shower and cover my hair when I don't want it wet. However they are a little big on my head so they are even bigger on my daughters head. If you have extra thick hair these would be great coverage though. They do what we need them to do but wish they fit just a little better.\nReview Title: waterproof but a little big\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Glazed Apricot - South of France Natural Body Care Moisturizing Sugar Polish 8oz Tube (1)\nReview Date: 2020/12/17\nStore: South of France Natural Body Care\nAverage Rating: 3.7\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'South of France Natural Body Care', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Product Benefits': 'Moisturizing', 'Active Ingredients': 'shea butter', 'Material Feature': 'Gluten Free, Natural', 'Product Dimensions': '8 x 2.8 x 2 inches; 8 Ounces', 'UPC': '856885005179'}\nReview Text: This is the first sugar scrub I have used. I had a hard time with how greasy it was. I would never use this all over my body. Just on my heels and knees or hands when they are dry.

The gel nail polishes also smell great, like I\u2019ve been working on a Christmas tree.  The colors in this set are some of our favorites.  The dark green and the dark glittery blue are our favorites.  We find it best to apply more than one coat, although Pine is not incorrect in advertising that one coat is essentially equal to two of those from other companies.  The chameleon set\u2019s colors look amazing and although not exactly like the stickers on the top of the polishes, they still are good enough to tell which is which.  The different colors are a great combination and allow for salon quality finishes.  I have found the Pine gel nail polishes last a very long time when you properly prepare your nails before application, and when you allow the polish to have sufficient cure times.  I have also found that my nail beds are less beat up when using the Pine products.  The color options and long lasting finish of Pine is hard to beat, and I strongly recommend this product and brand.\nReview Title: Dark and glittery finish that provides top notch nails!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n    Structure your response as:\n   \n    SUMMARY:\n    [Final synthesis of preferences and patterns]",
  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe analysis of the purchase history reveals a strong preference for quality beauty and personal care products, particularly in skincare and nail care. The individual consistently rates items above 4.0 and shows a tendency towards products that are reusable, multifunctional, and appeal to both personal and family use. There is a clear bias towards items that allow for home beauty routines, such as nail polishes and makeup application tools, indicating a penchant for DIY beauty experiences.\n\nCommon themes include a focus on soft, gentle materials suitable for all skin types and an affinity for aesthetically pleasing designs, as seen in the makeup brushes and shower caps. The buyer appreciates practical features like multipacks and organizational aspects, as highlighted by the spray bottles and reusable makeup remover pads.\n\nQuality is essential, with multiple mentions of product longevity and good functioning, yet the reviews occasionally reflect a sensitivity to flaws or inconveniences, such as product marketing discrepancies or size issues. This suggests an expectation for excellent value and usability, balancing quality with reasonable pricing.\n\nOverall, their core preferences indicate a desire for family-friendly, aesthetically pleasing, and multifunctional beauty products, with a significant emphasis on quality and practicality while remaining conscious of potential flaws or limitations.",

    "text": "Pine gel nail polish smells great, looks amazing, and lasts a long time.  The dark blue is our favorite color and we love that you can get the deep color with great glitter and shine using just one coat, on top of the base coat.  There are no base or top coats included, but as long as you have them, the set, along with a nail clipper and file is all you need to have salon quality manicure and pedicure.  The magnet included with the kit is rectangular, as shown, and is effective at making long streaks on the nails.  With some practice, you\u2019ll be able to create very defined cat eyes, but make sure you keep the cure lights right nearby, or you\u2019ll lose the streaking.  Additionally, make sure that you buff the nails lightly, clean the nails thoroughly, and run full cure times if you want to have the nail polish last more than two weeks.  Following this simple procedure will hopefully give you a high quality and long lasting finish like I have experienced.  I recommend Pine Gel Nail Polish and am sure you\u2019ll be super happy with the results.",
