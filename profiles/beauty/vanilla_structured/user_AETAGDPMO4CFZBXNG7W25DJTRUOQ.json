    "text": "These are really handy to have.  I find using a makeup removing cream or gel a bit annoying and any sort of wash type remover ends up trailing down my arms and neck.  You know how when you see women on movies gently splashing their faces and not making a mess?  Well that's not me.  So back to the pads.  I do like them.  They're nicely soaked and a decent size, about the size of a large cotton pad but it took 3 pads to make an inroad at removing my makeup and I don't think I plaster it on, just a bit of foundation, some mascara and a bit of blush.  The bonus is that you can use both sides but I do think it could do a better job at actual makeup remover.  For a quick cleanup and removing tinted moisturiser it does a good enough job.  If you're using it as part of a multi phase make up removal which I do when I have the time and motivation then this is a great second step.  I didn't have any adverse reactions.  I didn't dislike them, I just wasn't blown away by them and my search for the unicorn of make up removers continues.<br /><br />All in all they work as well as your average micellar water with the added convenience of having the pad and micellar water all in one.",
