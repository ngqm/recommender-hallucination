The scents of the Sandalwood and Ylang oil are not very strong. The shower gel because of the oil will not lather very good but my skin felt good after using it. Didn't get dry or itchy. The bath salts were very nicely scented and was great in the bath. I would have just purchased the bath salts as the shower gel is the only complaint in this kit. Was expecting a better lather and more of a scent but overall it was a nice gift and came packaged in a nice wooden double door box that the kids want to paint now.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe shopping history indicates a strong preference for self-care and spa-related products, particularly those focusing on relaxation, skin nourishment, and aesthetic enjoyment. The individual consistently expresses interest in gender-neutral scents such as sandalwood and coconut, favoring products that incorporate natural and organic ingredients. \n\nA pattern emerges around purchasing bath and body items, including spa gift sets, bath bombs, and accessories that enhance the bathing experience. The sentiment analysis reveals a desire for quality but also a degree of disappointment with performance in some items, particularly related to lather and longevity of nail products.\n\nThe individual values aesthetic appeal and unique packaging, illustrated by the choice of beautifully designed gift items and spa accessories. However, there is a noticeable sensitivity to product effectiveness and quality, as reflected in critiques of certain products not meeting expectations in longevity or functionality. \n\nPrice sensitivity appears moderate, with occasional purchases leaning towards value (e.g., larger sets of bath bombs) while also indulging in higher-end spa gift sets. Overall, the core preferences reflect a commitment to nurturing experiences for self and family, focusing on quality ingredients, sensory appeal, and thoughtful presentation in product choices.",

A little more expense for typical bar soap, but the same as buying a bottle of facewash. This soap is a rather large bar and didn't fit into my soap box. After using for a week, my soap container will shut with the edges worn down a little. This soap is my go to for face washing and even my beard. The scent is very light and doesn't linger. It lathers good and after you rinse with warm water my face feels smooth and clean. By the end of the day my face has a little oil again, but doesn't seem to be as bad. I believe my redness and couple acne spots has improved and more face washing hasn't dried out my skin.",
