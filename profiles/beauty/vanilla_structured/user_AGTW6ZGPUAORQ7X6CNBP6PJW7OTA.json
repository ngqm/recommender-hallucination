The scent is very natural, but unfortunately it's not. Rather than using the pricier essential oils of peppermint and lavender, the company uses synthesized fragrance.

The scent is very natural, but unfortunately it's not. Rather than using the pricier essential oils of peppermint and lavender, the company uses synthesized fragrance.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:  \nThe individual showcases a strong interest in personal care products, particularly in skin and hair care, emphasizing quality and performance over brand names. They consistently exhibit moderate price sensitivity, expressing disappointment or hesitation with products deemed overpriced, despite recognizing their effectiveness. \n\nIn terms of product effectiveness, they appreciate products that deliver noticeable results, which is evident in the higher ratings for items that performed well (e.g., oral hygiene tools and deep cleansing products). However, there's a clear frustration with items that fail to meet expectations, particularly regarding lash care and shampoo, highlighting a tendency to rate products based on personal narratives of success or failure. \n\nCommon themes include a preference for moisturizing, high-quality formulations with pleasing scents and textures, particularly in skincare and haircare lines. Additionally, the individual seems to favor versatile products that serve multiple purposes, such as scrubs that function as pre-shave treatments. \n\nOverall, their genuine preferences align with effective, well-scented products, mindful of price, showing an inclination toward high-quality skincare and haircare solutions that promise practical benefits while remaining skeptical of high-cost items without clear deliverables.",
