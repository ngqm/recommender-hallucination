I didn\u2019t like it for our toddler and couldn\u2019t even tolerate it for me. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m really that picky of a person, but I just didn\u2019t jive with the smell. I even offered it to my husband because he likes organic lotions for the back of his arms where he has some KP but even he didn\u2019t like it! I guess in a pinch we could use it, but it will not be preferred over other scents.\nReview Title: The packaging is cute, the smell is not\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: NEW Challenger Men's Rinse Free Hand Wash - 1oz - Portable, 30% Alcohol Hand Wash both Cleans & Moisturizes.

Really beautiful roller and I thought the derma roller was really cool...until I read the instructions. \u201cRoll back and forth 4-5 times...only apply light pressure and do not PUNCTURE the skin....sterilize the roller before and after each use for 30 MINUTES in disinfecting alcohol\u201d. Y\u2019all, I\u2019m a busy mom with a toddler, I do not have the time to disinfect something for almost an hour each time I use it, and by use it, I mean roll it 4-5 times total. So while the jade roller is really beautiful and easy to use in of itself, this derma roller kinda seems...extra. I personally would prefer this to just be the roller; I\u2019m too worried about actually using the roller incorrectly and hurting my skin, so I\u2019ll just leave that type of work to the professionals. If you are looking for a jade roller only, there are lots of other options. If you want the full derma experience, then this option would be great for you.\nReview Title: Really nice combo, but with one caveat\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Kidskin- Foaming Body Wash with Tea Tree Oil- Helps Combat Body and Foot Odor and Stubborn Body Acne and Skin Issues - Cruelty Free, Gluten Free, Paraben Free, Sulfate Free, Unscented, and Vegan- Made in USA\nReview Date: 2021/03/16\nStore: Kidskin\nProduct Description: ['Kidskin Foaming Body Wash with Tea Tree Oil is designed exclusively for teens, tweens, pre teens, and boys and girls to work as an effective, yet gentle body wash.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe analyzed purchase history indicates a preference for effective, quality skincare products, particularly those suited for sensitive skin. Consistently high ratings suggest a strong appreciation for products that are gentle and non-irritating, as highlighted by positive sentiments towards various cleansers and masks. The individual frequently opts for clean, natural formulations with appealing scents, though they exhibit sensitivity to unpleasant fragrances, as noted in the low rating for one lotion.\n\nThemes around product use reveal a tendency towards comprehensive skincare routines, valuing products that enhance overall skin texture, hydration, and healing properties. There is also a likeliness to choose items that offer a spa-like experience, especially in masks.\n\nQuality is a significant factor, with a clear inclination towards organic and value-driven brands. Price sensitivity appears moderate, as there are instances of purchasing both budget-friendly and higher-end items, prioritizing performance over price. Lastly, the desire for practicality is evident in choices like portable hand sanitizers and functional shower accessories, suggesting a busy lifestyle.\n\nOverall, the core preferences underscore a commitment to gentle, effective skincare with natural ingredients, alongside a balance of quality and practicality in everyday purchases.",
