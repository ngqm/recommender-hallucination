First let me say that I do like the idea - i love it in fact.  I was so excited about receiving this product because it was so different and unique.  I wanted to learn how to use this product in different ways.  When I received it, I got the bag as pictured above and couldn't figure out what was inside.  There was no description on the outside at all.  I didn't know what was inside till I ripped the bag open. After I opened it, I immediately saw the beautifully colored foil wrapped buds and remembered \"Oh yes, this is the flower buds that I saw that can be used as tea, bath pods and for baking.\"  There was no description, instructions or anything inside other than the beautifully foil wrapped buds.  I'm still left wondering how I will use them.  If I use for tea, I suppose I just wing it and drink the tea when I think it's done as there's no recipe for how long to steep to experience the perfect amount of flavor is extracted.  If I use for a bath, I'm sure there would be much more flexibility but it also advertises you can use for baking.  I have no idea how to use it for that.  If I wanted to use it for a gift, it would be incomplete not to mention that in order to even know what I ordered, I had to already open the pretty bag so that would ruin the presentation.  I feel this is a great product with great potential to be a high end gift or luxury indulgence.

They won't rattle around in there because they have grooves where the brush and stem both can easily fit inside and clip into place.  The reason I gave these a 3 star rating was because the clip that is to keep the case closed doesn't really clamp or close right.  It's very loose and I think that you will need a rubber band to keep the case closed.  I know that's not really a big deal but given that I haven't even used these yet I can't blame wear and tear on the fact that the clasp doesn't work.  It didn't work from the moment I took it out of the box.  I suppose if you put this case inside a toiletry bag, it's unlikely it will open even without a rubber band so really, if you need something to pack up your electric toothbrush, these cases will work and hold most brands of electric toothbrush and the price was fair.\nReview Title: Travel Electric Toothbrush Case\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: FERYES Makeup Sponge Holder with Makeup Sponge\u2013 Eco-Friendly Silicone Beauty Make Up Blender Case and Dry & Wet Use Foundation Sponge for Travel - Khaki (MS Khaki)\nReview Date: 2021/10/27\nStore: FERYES\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'FERYES', 'Color': '(MS Khaki)', 'Material': 'Silicone', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Makeup', 'Package Dimensions': '3.19 x 2.48 x 2.44 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'LEYIX', 'Country of Origin': 'China'}\nReview Text: One issue I've had in my makeup drawer is that I hate to just put my blender sponge in there without being inside something to keep it clean and sanitary.  This solves that problem nicely.  It's very soft and pliable and opens with a squeeze of the ends of the container.  It's very easy to use and your sponge fits nicely inside.  It seems quite durable and like it would last a good long time.  It's also easy to clean and allows circulation in case you wash your sponge and it's slightly damp.

This lipstick is a great nude color and goes well with just about anything I wear - be it red or pink.  You must always have a good versatile lipstick color in your purse at all times.  Your clothes change but you always take the same purse when you're out and about.  Your lipstick in that purse should go with everything you're wearing.  The feel of this lipstick is also very nice which is a huge plus.

They won't rattle around in there because they have grooves where the brush and stem both can easily fit inside and clip into place.  The reason I gave these a 3 star rating was because the clip that is to keep the case closed doesn't really clamp or close right.  It's very loose and I think that you will need a rubber band to keep the case closed.  I know that's not really a big deal but given that I haven't even used these yet I can't blame wear and tear on the fact that the clasp doesn't work.  It didn't work from the moment I took it out of the box.  I suppose if you put this case inside a toiletry bag, it's unlikely it will open even without a rubber band so really, if you need something to pack up your electric toothbrush, these cases will work and hold most brands of electric toothbrush and the price was fair.\nTravel Electric Toothbrush Case\nFERYES Makeup Sponge Holder with Makeup Sponge\u2013 Eco-Friendly Silicone Beauty Make Up Blender Case and Dry & Wet Use Foundation Sponge for Travel - Khaki (MS Khaki)\nFERYES\n{'Brand': 'FERYES', 'Color': '(MS Khaki)', 'Material': 'Silicone', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Makeup', 'Package Dimensions': '3.19 x 2.48 x 2.44 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'LEYIX', 'Country of Origin': 'China'}\nOne issue I've had in my makeup drawer is that I hate to just put my blender sponge in there without being inside something to keep it clean and sanitary.  This solves that problem nicely.  It's very soft and pliable and opens with a squeeze of the ends of the container.  It's very easy to use and your sponge fits nicely inside.  It seems quite durable and like it would last a good long time.  It's also easy to clean and allows circulation in case you wash your sponge and it's slightly damp.

I was impressed too with how pretty the packaging was.  There's nothing nicer than when you take your lipstick out of your purse and everyone sees how pretty the tube is - but I digress.  This lipstick is a great nude color and goes well with just about anything I wear - be it red or pink.  You must always have a good versatile lipstick color in your purse at all times.  Your clothes change but you always take the same purse when you're out and about.  Your lipstick in that purse should go with everything you're wearing.

First let me say that I do like the idea - i love it in fact.  I was so excited about receiving this product because it was so different and unique.  I wanted to learn how to use this product in different ways.  When I received it, I got the bag as pictured above and couldn't figure out what was inside.  There was no description on the outside at all.  I didn't know what was inside till I ripped the bag open. After I opened it, I immediately saw the beautifully colored foil wrapped buds and remembered \"Oh yes, this is the flower buds that I saw that can be used as tea, bath pods and for baking.\"  There was no description, instructions or anything inside other than the beautifully foil wrapped buds.  I'm still left wondering how I will use them.  If I use for tea, I suppose I just wing it and drink the tea when I think it's done as there's no recipe for how long to steep to experience the perfect amount of flavor is extracted.  If I use for a bath, I'm sure there would be much more flexibility but it also advertises you can use for baking.  I have no idea how to use it for that.  If I wanted to use it for a gift, it would be incomplete not to mention that in order to even know what I ordered, I had to already open the pretty bag so that would ruin the presentation.  I feel this is a great product with great potential to be a high end gift or luxury indulgence.  They just have one more step to complete in the way of instructions and explanation on the packaging to make it achieve it's potential.  This idea could easily go viral and become very popular.\nReview Title: Dried Flower Buds\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Kneipp Body Lotion (Lavender)\nReview Date: 2021/02/22\nAverage Rating: 4.0\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Kneipp', 'Scent': 'Lavender', 'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Active Ingredients': 'lavender,vitamin a', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '5.2 x 2.72 x 13.7 inches; 7.05 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I love that this is Vegan!

You can use them alone and enjoy just a nice clear gloss over your natural color lips, or you can put it over top of your color and no worry of changing the color of your favorite lipstick. It will add a very nice bit of shine and a little bit of a sparkle to whatever color you decide to slide it over.  I do not notice a lot of flavor to these glosses, but the color is very pretty.
