This mini straightener is perfect for camping and on the go. I actually got this to keep at the office for emergencies but I'll be taking it with me when I go camping too.<br />Due to the smaller size it takes a little longer to straighten my hair. This isn't ideal for every day use unless you have really short hair, but it works great in a pinch or when you are trying to pack light.<br />It comes with a pretty blue green travel case/bag. It has dual voltage 100-240V and an adapter for worldwide travel.<br />It has 1 heat setting and that's 410\u00b0.

I ordered these after a friend was telling me about how great magnetic liner is. I was super impressed with how easy it is for me to put these on.<br />I'm kind of confused on whether the liner is sticky and magnetic or just magnetic. I didn't let it dry all the way before doing my eyebrows and my lower eyelid got stuck to my upper eyelid. I couldn't tell if that was magnet pull or glue.<br />Whatever the liner is, it keeps those lashes in place and they are so easy to put on. The brush is thin but the thicker the line, the better it will hold on to the lashes.<br />My eye lids are sort of small and I think I'm going to have to trim these a tiny bit or the ends can be a little jabby in the corner of my eye.<br />I haven't worn these out yet due to the pandemic but I know the liner lasts because you have to scrub hard to get it off.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:  \nThe analyzed purchase history reveals a strong preference for travel-friendly beauty tools and products that cater to convenience and functionality. The individual consistently favors miniaturized versions of hair styling tools, such as straighteners and curling irons, highlighting a necessity for portability, which aligns with their travel habits (e.g., camping and office use). Ratings indicate satisfaction with ease of use and effectiveness, though there is mild disappointment regarding performance consistency, particularly with hair toners and conditioning treatments.\n\nThe person values quality, demonstrated by their choice of products with average ratings generally above 3.5, indicating a willingness to invest in effective solutions, but appears somewhat price-sensitive, opting for products that provide good value, evidenced by positive sentiments towards cruelty-free and natural ingredients.\n\nCommon themes include a penchant for multifunctional beauty products (like magnetic lashes with eyeliner) and a tendency to favor brands with solid reputations (e.g., Milantia). Overall, the individual\u2019s core preferences emphasize portability, functionality, and ethical considerations in their beauty purchases, making them a savvy shopper who seeks convenience while maintaining quality standards.",
