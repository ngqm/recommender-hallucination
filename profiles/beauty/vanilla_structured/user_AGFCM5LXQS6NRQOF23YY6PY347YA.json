  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe individual exhibits a clear preference for practical and quality grooming products, prioritizing functionality over brand prestige. Their consistent ratings hover around the 4.0 mark, indicating a tendency toward satisfaction balanced with critical assessment. Key themes emerge around travel convenience and personal care, as evidenced by multiple purchases of portable items like travel shaving kits and toiletry bottles.\n\nQuality is a focal point, with preferences for natural materials (e.g., horn comb) and effective solutions for grooming (e.g., denture toothpaste). The user demonstrates price sensitivity; while appreciating reasonable pricing, they are also wary of purchasing items that seem subpar or \"toy-like.\" For instance, the review on the plastic razor highlighted concerns about sturdiness alongside acceptance of its travel suitability.\n\nOverall, the individual's patterns reveal a penchant for practical, high-quality grooming and travel accessories, emphasizing utility, sustainability, and a modest budget in product selections.",

    "text": "I just ordered and will update when I receive. A good value for a novelty theme comb. The Fonz had one, on Happy Days. I lose comes and rarely have the same combination by end of the week.  Maybe these will get me to hang on longer.  I'm cursed with cowlicks, and fine hair, so need narrow toothed combs. This looks like it would work.<br />I would prefer plastic as metal tends to be sharp on thr scalp.<br />12/30/22<br />Just received. Lightweight plastic. Not sure the lasting gravity, but is nice that comb itself is plastic not metal. Metal tends to be hard on the scalp.<br /><br />Value for money is good as there are 4 switch-combs. Can keep 1 in car, office, gym bag and home and carry<br />Always a way to style before a meeting. After work date, whenever  grooming necessity is called",
