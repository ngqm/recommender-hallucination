It has a long swivel cord that helps maneuver the iron while styling and infrared heat that ensures even distribution.  I have naturally straight hair but use a flat iron to calm the frizz from humidity.  I start with spritzing a heat protectant spray from roots to ends all over my hair and I dry my hair with a hairdryer until it is damp.  I do not recommend using this flat iron when your hair is still dripping with water. When your hair is damp you will see steam.  I was afraid it would damage my hair, but I have found that when I straight iron it when it is still damp the style holds longer and it seems shinier.  The iron heats up quickly with a 30-second heat up time and stays hot for an hour before the auto shut off feature kicks in.  The ceramic plates glide nicely through my hair and leave it \"de-frizzed\" all day.  The iron comes in a drawstring sack that makes storage easy.\nReview Title: Good bargain for great style\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Mountain Falls Nourishing Nail Polish Remover for Natural Nails, with Vitamin E and Panthenol, 6 Fluid Ounce\nReview Date: 2019/09/11\nStore: Mountain Falls\nProduct Description: [\"Don't wait for your next spa day to treat yourself.

The individual consistently seeks effective solutions for hair management, showing a particular affinity for tools capable of accommodating various hair types and conditions, as evidenced by the enthusiasm for a multi-functional hair straightener. \n\nProduct sentiment trends indicate satisfaction with products that deliver on performance and usability, with high ratings often correlated with innovative features such as quick heat-up time and user-friendly design. On the contrary, lower ratings stem from products that fall short in efficacy or perceived value, such as the nail polish remover.\n\nCommon themes in product purpose suggest an inclination towards self-care and grooming, highlighting a trend for items that balance convenience with quality. Additionally, the reviews indicate a tolerance for mid-range pricing when a product meets or exceeds expectations in performance, while revealing sensitivity to perceived overpricing, especially in cases of underwhelming product performance.\n\nIn synthesis, the core preferences include an expectation of high performance and reliability in beauty products, a focus on multifunctionality, and a keen awareness of value versus cost, guiding future purchases towards brands and products that uphold these standards.",
