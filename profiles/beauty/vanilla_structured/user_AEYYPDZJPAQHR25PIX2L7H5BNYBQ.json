  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThis individual demonstrates a strong preference for beauty and personal care products, particularly in skin and lip care. Consistently high ratings (averaging above 4.0) indicate satisfaction with product efficacy and quality.

Price sensitivity is apparent, as the user explicitly notes the attractiveness of prices that allow exploration of multiple products without excessive financial risk.\n\nIn summary, this shopper values quality in beauty products while remaining pragmatic about price and the opportunity to try a range of products, all aimed at enhancing their skincare routine.",
