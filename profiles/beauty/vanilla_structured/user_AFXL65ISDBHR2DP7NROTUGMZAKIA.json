This is a smooth, creamy, nice-smelling product that seems to really and truly be helping my cellulite. I am 5'2&#34; and I weigh a firm, fit, muscular 125 pounds. I am also 43 years old and a mother of 3. Being as small as I am, I expected a few stretch marks with my pregnancies. I actually got lucky and ended up with very few stretch marks, but I did earn a little cellulite in my belly. Particularly around an old scar from where I had my appendix out at age 15. For whatever reason, this scar has become decidedly attached to some very stubborn fat cells. No matter what exercises I do, or how much cardio I do, this little scar retains a firm hold on an ugly little bubble of cellulite, and it's one of the few places I got a handful of stretch marks.<br />I have tried tons of products over the years, and never had much success. Now, I'm not saying this product is a miracle, because it isn't. My cellulite and stretch marks didn't disappear over night, or even in a week. But I have noticed some improvement, and I'm certain it isn't wishful thinking. I never hold much hope for any of these products, so that I'm never too disappointed. Also, I've stared in the mirror at this ugly little place on my body for years now. There has definitely been improvement.<br />This cream also makes my skin soft, and that's always a plus. At $22.00 for 4oz, I certainly wouldn't buy it as an all over lotion, but for spot treating stretch marks and cellulite....definitely.<br />I received this item at a discount for an honest review. I would have posted pictures, but I'm too self-conscious to do so...even without my face in the pic. But this is an honest review and I have in no way been compensated.\nReview Title: This is the real deal....\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: UNGLINGA Black Mask Blackhead Remover Purifying Peel Off Mask Bamboo Activated Charcoal Face Deep Pore Cleansing Mask For Face Nose and Acne Blemishes Treatment\nReview Date: 2015/09/21\nStore: UNGLINGA\nProduct Description: ['CONCERNS: Enlarged pore, Blackheads, Anti-aging, Fine lines and blemishes, Oily skin, Strawberry nose.

This mask goes on amazingly smooth, with very little scent. My daughter and I used it together.
