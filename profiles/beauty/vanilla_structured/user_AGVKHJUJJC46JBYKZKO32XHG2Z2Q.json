With the utmost respect for our eco system, La Deessa sustainably combines Natural, Organic, Plant Based and Wild Crafted Botanicals with clinically proven & independently peer reviewed superstar natural and organic age-defying ingredients with highly effective delivery systems to create results-driven anti aging skin care products. KEY INGREDIENT HIGHLIGHTS: ALOE VERA increases your body\u2019s production of collagen and is packed with essential vitamins including A, B1, B2, B6, B12, C & E. Aloe penetrates skin four-times (4x) more rapidly than water and accelerates skin cell reproduction by as much as eight-times (8x)! VITAMIN C supports every aspect of collagen production from stem cell activity to improving the structural integrity, resilience and stability of the skin. Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate is an extremely stable and gentle Vitamin C derivative and a precursor to Vitamin C; it waits to convert into Ascorbic Acid until it is fully absorbed, at which time the sodium molecules separate, converting it into pure Vitamin C deep within your skin...this prevents irritation and amplifies antioxidant benefits, making Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate a superior form of Vitamin C in cosmetic formulations. HYALURONIC ACID has the unique ability to hold more than 1000 times its weight in water, allowing the skin to retain more water. Amazingly, hyaluronic acid adjusts its moisture absorption to your skin\u2019s need for moisture making it ideal for all skin types. Hyaluronic acid also protects the epidermis by scavenging reactive oxygen species generated by ultra violet light. Our formulations contain high percentages of Hyaluronic Acid. MSM- METHYL SULPHONYL MTHANE (ORGANIC SULFUR) Dubbed the \u201cBeauty Mineral\u201d Organic sulfur is referred to as the \u201cBeauty Mineral\u201d because it promotes oxygen transport across cell membranes (intracellular) facilitating cellular regeneration\u2026resulting in skin that is more beautiful.']\nAverage Rating: 3.5\nProduct Details: {'Skin Type': 'All', 'Scent': 'Fragrance Free', 'Brand': 'La Deessa', 'Item Form': 'liquid', 'Material Feature': 'Organic, Gluten Free, Natural, Vegan', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '4 x 2 x 2 inches; 3 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'LD-VITAC20', 'UPC': '040232150944', 'Manufacturer': 'La Deessa'}\nReview Text: Thank you La Deessa for sending me this great product to try out!

It also really helps with all that puffiness that I always have under my eyes in the morning.  I naturally have dark circles around my eyes so I don't really benefit from the eye brightening capabilities of this eye cream but I can see how it would work great for those people that have dark circles from things like not getting enough sleep.

Consistent high ratings (notably 5.0) suggest a positive sentiment towards products that emphasize hydration and skin rejuvenation, such as serums and creams featuring Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, and natural botanicals. \n\nCommon themes in their purchases indicate a focus on addressing specific skin concerns such as fine lines, wrinkles, dark circles, and acne, favoring lightweight, non-greasy formulations that absorb quickly. Their reviews reflect satisfaction with products that provide visible results, particularly in improving skin tone, texture, and moisture retention.\n\nThe analysis also reveals a moderate sensitivity to quality, as the average ratings oscillate around 3.5 to 4.0, implying that while they seek high-performing items, they are discerning in their evaluations. They are inclined towards products perceived as value-for-money, likely favoring brands that offer effective, all-natural ingredients without harmful chemicals, aligning with their desire for safety and efficacy.\n\nOverall, the core preferences center on results-driven, sustainable skincare solutions that emphasize natural wellness and cater to active skincare routines aimed at maintaining youthful skin.\n",

At almost 50 and as someone who can't be bothered with any sort of skincare he is the perfect candidate for this Eye Cream.  He has fine lines, wrinkles and even some crow's feet.  So, he volunteered to be my model.  Below, are the before and after pictures...<br />You can see in the untouched before pictures the deep lines and crow's feet and then in the after picture those are all less noticeable.  This was after just 30 seconds and there is even more improvement after 1 minute or longer.  However, I wanted you to see how fast it works!  Plus, the effect will last for hours.<br />The price tag on this H1 Amino Supertox by HeavenHerald81 retails for $149.00 so it's not cheap.  For the price it's definitely not something you would use everyday but it's perfect for a special event! This would be a great product to get it you have a special event coming up like a class reunion or wedding!<br />***As a beauty and skincare blogger I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  However, all of my ratings and reviews are my own thoughts and my own opinions and if I don\u2019t believe in the product and use it myself then I will not provide a positive review or rating.***",
