And I\u2019m thrilled to find that Amazon has it so I can never be without it! I have waist-length hair that is kinky curly with gray hair throughout that I wear straightened. This product is the only one that keeps my hair from frizzing no matter how hot and humid it gets! And the shine and softness of my hair is the best it\u2019s ever been. I use it after using It\u2019s A Ten Miracle Silk Leave-In after washing my hair with Wen.<br /><br />Even if you have long hair, use this stuff sparingly and make sure you liquify it in the palms of your hand and between your fingers before you put it through your hair.<br /><br />Another plus: the huge bottle lasts me about 6 months. Keep in mind my hair is dry so I only wash it twice a week.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:  \nThe shopper demonstrates a clear preference for hair care and hair extension products, primarily focusing on those that promise effective styling and enhancement. Positive ratings are consistently given to moisturizing and anti-frizz hair care solutions, revealing a strong desire for products that contribute to shine and softness, particularly for curly or dry hair types. Conversely, the individual expresses significant dissatisfaction with various hair extensions, specifically citing issues with weight, color discrepancies, and poor quality leading to matting. \n\nCommon themes highlight a priority on product functionality\u2014anti-frizz properties and the appearance of natural hair\u2014alongside dramatic discontent when products fail to meet expectation in terms of performance or quality. The shopper's sentiment reflects a noteworthy price sensitivity, indicating a willingness to invest in quality products (as indicated by the high rating of a favorable product), yet a decisive rejection of low-quality or misrepresented items, as seen with the low ratings for extensions falsely marketed as Remy hair.\n\nOverall, this individual's core preferences revolve around finding effective, high-quality hair care solutions that cater to specific hair types and provide long-lasting results, while expressing frustration when products fall short of their advertised claims.",
