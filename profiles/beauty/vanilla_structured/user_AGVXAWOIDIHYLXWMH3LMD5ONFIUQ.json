  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe purchase history indicates a preference for skincare and beauty products, particularly those targeting anti-aging and wrinkle reduction. Consistently high ratings (5.0) are given to effective products that meet these aesthetic goals, suggesting a strong appreciation for efficacy in skincare. However, there are notable adverse reactions associated with some eye creams, indicating sensitivity and a low tolerance for certain ingredients. \n\nThe user appears to favor creams and oils that are multi-functional, as seen in their usage of specific products on both the face and hands. The presence of negative experiences with eye creams suggests a careful approach is required when selecting products for sensitive areas, reflecting a potential allergy or intolerance.\n\nIn terms of quality, the user seems to value longevity and scent in fragrance products, evidenced by positive feedback on a body oil that lasts long and smells pleasant. Price sensitivity appears moderate, with reviews reflecting both satisfaction and frustration regarding value for money, particularly in instances of poor product performance.\n\nOverall, core preferences include a strong inclination toward products that deliver visible results for aging skin, while avoiding harsh or poorly formulated items, as well as a balance between affordability and quality in product selection.",
