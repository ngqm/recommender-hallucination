It measures 2 5/8 inches in diameter and about 7/8  inches deep. It fits easily into carry-on luggage, a shaving kit, or a backpack. To me the scent smelled more like chalk than coconut, but it lathers well, cleans thoroughly, and washes out well with no residual scent, so I'm not docking it any stars for the scent. I don't see myself reordering it at the current list price of $13.00 (13% off the original price of $15.00), because there are many other bars with a more pleasant fragrance that do just as good a job, but I will gladly use the rest of this bar without complaint. No matter what, shampoo bars are handy for traveling and are great for the environment, and I like the eco-friendly packaging of just a simply, recyclable cardboard box and no plastic wrapper.\nReview Title: Lathers Well, Cleans Well, Nice and Portable for Travel\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Hot Cream 2 Pack, Belly Fat Burner Sweat Cream for Women and Men, Fat Burning Slimming Cream, Slim Weight Loss Cream, Anti-Cellulite Massage Cream for Body Shaping Waist, Abdomen and Buttocks\nReview Date: 2021/09/01\nStore: Purvigor\nAverage Rating: 3.8\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Purvigor', 'Scent': 'Unscented', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Unit Count': '2.1164 Ounce', 'Package Dimensions': '5.59 x 4.96 x 1.73 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Purvigor'}\nReview Text: This order comes with two 60 ml tubes of slimming cream. I use a disposable glove to apply it, and that keeps me from accidentally getting it in my eyes or anywhere else I don't intend for it to be. My focus area with this cream is my abdomen, admittedly one of the hardest areas to lose belly fat regardless of method. The burn is delayed for about 10 minutes, but when it starts, I can definitely feel it. It's a strong sensation, but not painful, and it reassures me that the cream is activating. Like probably many other folks who use this cream, I am also doing other things at the same time to try and lose weight: watching what I eat, exercising more, drinking more water, etc. Therefore, even though I am very slowly seeing a reduction in my belly fat, it's difficult for me to say how much of that is from using this cream and how much is from the other measures that I am taking to produce the same result. I consider $12.98 for two tubes a reasonable price for adding this cream to my weight loss efforts, and will continue to use it as long as I continue to see results.\nReview Title: Can Definitely Feel the Heat\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Bath Bombs Gift Set, Bath Bomb Gift for Women with Rose Petals, Lavender Scent 5pc Handmade Bubble Bath Gift Box with Soap & Petals Mothers Day Gifts Ideas for Mom, New Mom, Wife Birthday Gift for Her\nReview Date: 2021/09/15\nStore: # BFFLOVE\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Brand': '# BFFLOVE', 'Scent': 'Lavender,Rose', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Benefits': 'Softening,Stress Relief,Moisturizing,Aromatherapy', 'Material Feature': 'Organic, Vegan', 'Product Dimensions': '7.65 x 1.85 x 5.35 inches; 13.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '810001817473', 'Manufacturer': '# BFFLOVE'}\nReview Text: This is an absolutely wonderful gift set that is even nicely pre-wrapped with colorful paper and a beige ribbon and bow. The back of the box has a label explaining what's inside, but because of the type of adhesive and the type of glossy wrapping used, this label can be easily peeled off with no sticky adhesive remnant on the wrapping paper (see my before and after photos). Inside the wrapper, is a plain white sturdy cardboard box. Inside, there is a wrapped square bar of scented soap, a box of dried rose petals that look and smell pretty, and three rose and lavender scented bath bombs that spell out the word \"MOM.\" The \"O\" in \"MOM\" is shaped like a pink heart. All these items are resting on a bed of white nesting paper. Both the wrapping paper for the soap and the cardboard of the box containing the rose petals have the same pattern as the outer wrapping paper. Among other ingredients, each bath bomb contains coconut oil, sea salt, and shea butter. For the dried rose petals, it says to place them in still, warm bath water. It also says to drain the bath as usual as the dried florals are biodegradable. This gift is not just for Mother's Day, it's for any mom, any day, who would enjoy a thoughtful gift and a relaxing bath with these lovely scented bath bombs.\nReview Title: Very Nice Pre-Wrapped Gift Set for Moms of All Ages\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Facial Cleansing Brush, Wireless Charging Base Soft Brush Set with 3 Brush Heads for Face Spa, Exfoliating, Massaging and Deep Cleansing\nReview Date: 2021/10/01\nStore: Syllable\nAverage Rating: 3.5\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Syllable', 'Power Source': 'electric', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '8.74 x 6.89 x 3.31 inches; 1.52 Pounds'}\nReview Text: When I first tried this facial cleansing brush I thought it was broken, the brushes would not spin they just vibrated.

There's also a wireless charging base that can hold one of the brush heads, a charging cable (USB to micro USB) and a \"user guide\" which is not very good (it states that there are two brushes, there are three, a number of other problems).  The guide also recommends replacing the brushes after using for 3 months but I couldn't find any replacement brushes.

The plastic 6 oz bottle has an iridescent label that reflects light just like bubbles do, which is kind of cool. The ingredient list is full of natural components, which is good. The bottle has an inner safety seal, so there was no leakage during shipment. This also reassures me that the contents have not been tampered with. The wash itself applies smoothly. Best of all, though, are the results. This cleans my face thoroughly and gently, and shrinks my pores well. My skin feels smooth and fresh after using this. I have very sensitive skin, and it's extremely hard for me to find a face wash that cleans well without leaving my face feeling dry and irritated. This face wash does exactly what I need for it to do. It currently lists for $20, but it takes very little to clean my entire face, so I expect it to last a while. After trying so many disappointing facial cleansers, I am quite happy with this one and definitely consider it a good value.\nReview Title: Cleans Well and Shrinks Pores\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Gryph & IvyRose Coat of Arms Hydrating Lotion for Kids - Hydrating Moisturizer with Shea Butter & Coconut Oil - All Natural, Sustainable, Cruelty Free, No Parabens, No Sulfates, Vegan - USA Made - 8oz\nReview Date: 2021/11/27\nStore: Gryph & IvyRose\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Gryph & IvyRose', 'Scent': 'Coconut Shea', 'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Active Ingredients': 'Sweet Almond Oil', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '5.67 x 2.28 x 2.24 inches; 8 Ounces', 'UPC': '856991007210'}\nReview Text: This Gryph & IvyRose Coat of Arms Body Lotion smells so good that I can't seem to stop sniffing my hands once I've applied the lotion.

I tried a prior one that was much bigger with supporting sides that ran halfway down my back, and found that it put me at an awkward angle in the tub that put way too much pressure on my tailbone and was extremely uncomfortable. I ordered this one to replace the other one, and I am thrilled with it. It's incredibly comfortable to rest my head against, and stays in place well using the two large suction cups on the back of it. I usually like to slide deeper into the tub about halfway through my bath, and this pillow is small enough and light enough that I can simply and easily readjust it to my new position, and it's still just as secure and just as comfortable after I've moved it. When I'm done bathing, it has a handy plastic hook attached that I can use to hang the bath pillow on the towel rack to dry.

The box is black trimmed in gold. On the cover there is a gold outline of a compact mirror. Inside that outline it says, \"Not a Day Over Fabulous.\" Inside, there is a nice large white woven cosmetic bag (that of course could be used for lots of other things, too), a 4\" square jewelry plate, and a gold compact mirror. All say in flowing script, \"Beautiful girl you can do fabulous things.\" The compact case has the same inscription on both the front and back cover, which is great. In its brand new state, the writing on the compact mirror doesn't show up well from a distance, but I think with use the engraved area will darken a bit and the writing will be better seen. The message is meant for the one holding the mirror, anyway, and not others nearby, so even if it doesn't darken, it still delivers inspiration where it's intended. The mirror quality is good. These items make a perfect gift set to give to a girl in age or a girl at heart, and I'm sure would be appreciated by either.\nReview Title: Nice Presentation, Great Positive Message, Very Giftable\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: B.O.B BARS OVER BOTTLES Solid Conditioner Bar for Balanced Moisture| Oily Hair | Hair Care, Ideal Ph Balance | Natural, Vegan | Eco-friendly, Sustainable, Plastic Free | Waterless & Zero Waste\nReview Date: 2022/01/04\nStore: B.O.B BARS OVER BOTTLES\nAverage Rating: 4.2\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'B.O.B BARS OVER BOTTLES', 'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Material Feature': 'Natural, Plant Based, Vegan, Waterless, Plastic-Free', 'Hair Type': 'Oily, Normal', 'Product Benefits': 'Moisturizing', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '2.91 x 2.76 x 1.14 inches; 1.9 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'B.O.B BARS OVER BOTTLES', 'Country of Origin': 'Brazil'}\nReview Text: This B.O.B. Bars Over Bottles Conditioner Bar Ultra Moisturizing is absolutely perfect for me. The packaging is simple and recyclable. A small cardboard box just large enough to hold the conditioner bar, and a simple paper wrapper around the bar inside. That's it. No bottle, no plastic, no waste. Love it. This bar works great for home or travel. Since there is no liquid for TSA to have to approve, I can keep this in my carry-on luggage if I'm flying somewhere. It's small size makes it easy to pack.  One of these bars lasts forever, so I can keep it in my travel kit and use it for multiple trips. It's also good for home use, taking up very little space in my shower caddy. The scent of this conditioner bar is very pleasant. This conditioner bar contains Pracaxi oil, which is a vitamin rich hair oil that hydrates, promotes hair growth, and strengthens damaged hair. This conditioner bar is also vegan and is cruelty free. That is an awful lot of good reasons for me to absolutely love this conditioner bar, and I am happy I ordered it.\nReview Title: Great for Home or Travel, Easy to Use\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: B.O.B BARS OVER BOTTLES Moisturizing Shampoo Bar | For Curly Hair | Hair Care, Ideal Ph Balance |Natural, Vegan | Eco-friendly, Sustainable, Plastic Free | Waterless & Zero Waste\nReview Date: 2022/01/28\nStore: B.O.B BARS OVER BOTTLES\nAverage Rating: 4.3\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'B.O.B BARS OVER BOTTLES', 'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy, Curly, Dry', 'Scent': 'Citric and Woody', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2.56 x 2.56 x 1.46 inches; 2.82 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'B.O.B BARS OVER BOTTLES', 'Country of Origin': 'Brazil'}\nReview Text: I like everything about this BOB Bars Over Bottles shampoo bar except the scent, which unfortunately is a major player with me. The shampoo bar is packaged in an environmentally beneficial way, with a recyclable cardboard box just large enough to contain the soap and its paper wrapping. It is plastic free, vegan, cruelty free, and it uses natural ingredients. The ingredients include green clay, lemongrass, rosemary, and peppermint. I truly enjoy the scents of lemongrass, rosemary, and peppermint, so I didn't give the green clay part any thought at all prior to ordering this bar. Unfortunately, the scent of the green clay overwhelms the other scents enormously, and I don't find the wet clay smell enjoyable at all. The soap lathers and cleans well, and rinses out nicely. However, I don't want to wash my hair with something that smells unpleasant to me, especially since there are so many competing shampoo bars that smell wonderful and are just as environmentally friendly.\nReview Title: Strong Clay Scent\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: SmoothSkin Pure FIT Intelligent Ultrafast IPL Permanent Hair Reduction for Women & Men - Body & Face \u2013 FDA Cleared\nReview Date: 2022/03/13\nStore: SMOOTHSKIN\nAverage Rating: 3.9\nProduct Details: {'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.6 x 2.5 x 7.2 inches; 2.62 Pounds', 'Manufacturer': 'Cyden Limited'}\nReview Text: I ordered this for my wife, and she is thrilled to have it so that she can be ready when shorts and swimsuit season arrives. Not having to shave every day will be an absolute blessing for her. This SmoothSkin Pure Fit Intelligent Ultrafast IPL Laser Hair removal device comes with the device itself, a power cord, an optional precision head for use on smaller areas, and a detailed instruction book. Since this device does not work if the skin is too dark or the hair is too light, it is important to check the online skin suitability chart before purchasing to make sure that this device will actually work for the user. My wife's skin and hair color fell within the effective range, so she was good to go when this arrived. Also, since this device can make the skin photosensitive during the course of treatment, winter is the best time to start the initial 12 week course of hair removal. For those who live in a place where there really isn't much of a winter, just be aware that skin needs to be protected from the sun during this treatment period. Since my wife is still in the early phases of this treatment and it's already mid-March, she'll be cutting it kind of close. Worse case scenario, though, she can at least get a month or so of treatments done and then resume and/or start her treatment over again when winter is back. This SmoothSkin device has two modes for treatments, Glide, which is just like it sounds and is a continuous firing as the device glides along the skin in a steady movement, or Stamp, which is a single controlled burst at a time, designed for areas where you want tighter control over when and where the light fires, such as on the upper lip. There are also three treatment intensities, Power, which is the highest setting and good for larger areas, Gentle, for sensitive areas (also recommended when first starting IPL and getting used to how it feels), and Speed, the fastest treatment mode, for quickly covering larger areas and for doing fast touch-ups. This sounds complicated, but after my wife began doing these treatments once a week, she found that it was actually fairly easy to do. Granted, she is just doing legs and underarms for now, which are fairly basic. My wife's initial opinion of this SmoothSkin Pure Fit IPL laser hair removal device is extremely positive. It's easy to learn, easy to do, can be done in the privacy of our own home and at a time that is convenient for her, and is far cheaper than having either IPL or laser hair removal treatments done in a shop. Not only that, but so far it's working.\nReview Title: Great for Legs and Underarms\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Auntie & Me Liquid Gold Organic Anti-Aging Face Serum for Dark Spots, Scars, Stretch Marks | Cruelty Free, Paraben Free, Vegan (Original, 66mL)\nReview Date: 2022/03/16\nStore: Auntie & Me\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'Auntie & Me', 'Material Feature': 'Organic, Natural, Vegan', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '12 x 9 x 6 inches; 12 Ounces', 'UPC': '618119720766'}\nReview Text: Even though I applied this Auntie & Me Liquid Gold Organic Anti-Aging Face Serum very lightly on my face, and even though my skin is very dry by nature, my face still felt very oily hours after applying this face serum. I tried massaging it in several times during that period, but it just never seemed to absorb very well. Since, as stated, my skin is normally very dry, feeling oily and greasy is very uncomfortable and undesirable to me. Based on the rave reviews, I had very high hopes for this serum, which is why I ordered the larger (and incredibly more expensive) 66 ml size. Lesson learned. I will pass this along to my sister, and maybe she will have the incredible results that seem to elude me. Based on my personal results, however, I'm rating this 3 stars.\nReview Title: Skin Still Felt Oily Hours after Applying this\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: 1oz.

The box is black trimmed in gold. On the cover there is a gold outline of a compact mirror.

All say in flowing script, \"Beautiful girl you can do fabulous things.\" The compact case has the same inscription on both the front and back cover, which is great. In its brand new state, the writing on the compact mirror doesn't show up well from a distance, but I think with use the engraved area will darken a bit and the writing will be better seen. The message is meant for the one holding the mirror, anyway, and not others nearby, so even if it doesn't darken, it still delivers inspiration where it's intended. The mirror quality is good.

This bar works great for home or travel. Since there is no liquid for TSA to have to approve, I can keep this in my carry-on luggage if I'm flying somewhere. It's small size makes it easy to pack.

The scent of this conditioner bar is very pleasant. This conditioner bar contains Pracaxi oil, which is a vitamin rich hair oil that hydrates, promotes hair growth, and strengthens damaged hair. This conditioner bar is also vegan and is cruelty free.

I truly enjoy the scents of lemongrass, rosemary, and peppermint, so I didn't give the green clay part any thought at all prior to ordering this bar. Unfortunately, the scent of the green clay overwhelms the other scents enormously, and I don't find the wet clay smell enjoyable at all. The soap lathers and cleans well, and rinses out nicely. However, I don't want to wash my hair with something that smells unpleasant to me, especially since there are so many competing shampoo bars that smell wonderful and are just as environmentally friendly.\nStrong Clay Scent\nSmoothSkin Pure FIT Intelligent Ultrafast IPL Permanent Hair Reduction for Women & Men - Body & Face \u2013 FDA Cleared\nSMOOTHSKIN\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.6 x 2.5 x 7.2 inches; 2.62 Pounds', 'Manufacturer': 'Cyden Limited'}\nI ordered this for my wife, and she is thrilled to have it so that she can be ready when shorts and swimsuit season arrives. Not having to shave every day will be an absolute blessing for her. This SmoothSkin Pure Fit Intelligent Ultrafast IPL Laser Hair removal device comes with the device itself, a power cord, an optional precision head for use on smaller areas, and a detailed instruction book. Since this device does not work if the skin is too dark or the hair is too light, it is important to check the online skin suitability chart before purchasing to make sure that this device will actually work for the user. My wife's skin and hair color fell within the effective range, so she was good to go when this arrived. Also, since this device can make the skin photosensitive during the course of treatment, winter is the best time to start the initial 12 week course of hair removal. For those who live in a place where there really isn't much of a winter, just be aware that skin needs to be protected from the sun during this treatment period. Since my wife is still in the early phases of this treatment and it's already mid-March, she'll be cutting it kind of close. Worse case scenario, though, she can at least get a month or so of treatments done and then resume and/or start her treatment over again when winter is back. This SmoothSkin device has two modes for treatments, Glide, which is just like it sounds and is a continuous firing as the device glides along the skin in a steady movement, or Stamp, which is a single controlled burst at a time, designed for areas where you want tighter control over when and where the light fires, such as on the upper lip. There are also three treatment intensities, Power, which is the highest setting and good for larger areas, Gentle, for sensitive areas (also recommended when first starting IPL and getting used to how it feels), and Speed, the fastest treatment mode, for quickly covering larger areas and for doing fast touch-ups. This sounds complicated, but after my wife began doing these treatments once a week, she found that it was actually fairly easy to do. Granted, she is just doing legs and underarms for now, which are fairly basic. My wife's initial opinion of this SmoothSkin Pure Fit IPL laser hair removal device is extremely positive. It's easy to learn, easy to do, can be done in the privacy of our own home and at a time that is convenient for her, and is far cheaper than having either IPL or laser hair removal treatments done in a shop. Not only that, but so far it's working.\nGreat for Legs and Underarms\nAuntie & Me Liquid Gold Organic Anti-Aging Face Serum for Dark Spots, Scars, Stretch Marks | Cruelty Free, Paraben Free, Vegan (Original, 66mL)\nAuntie & Me\n{'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'Auntie & Me', 'Material Feature': 'Organic, Natural, Vegan', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '12 x 9 x 6 inches; 12 Ounces', 'UPC': '618119720766'}\nEven though I applied this Auntie & Me Liquid Gold Organic Anti-Aging Face Serum very lightly on my face, and even though my skin is very dry by nature, my face still felt very oily hours after applying this face serum. I tried massaging it in several times during that period, but it just never seemed to absorb very well. Since, as stated, my skin is normally very dry, feeling oily and greasy is very uncomfortable and undesirable to me.

It measures 2 5/8 inches in diameter and about 7/8  inches deep. It fits easily into carry-on luggage, a shaving kit, or a backpack. To me the scent smelled more like chalk than coconut, but it lathers well, cleans thoroughly, and washes out well with no residual scent, so I'm not docking it any stars for the scent. I don't see myself reordering it at the current list price of $13.00 (13% off the original price of $15.00), because there are many other bars with a more pleasant fragrance that do just as good a job, but I will gladly use the rest of this bar without complaint. No matter what, shampoo bars are handy for traveling and are great for the environment, and I like the eco-friendly packaging of just a simply, recyclable cardboard box and no plastic wrapper.\nReview Title: Lathers Well, Cleans Well, Nice and Portable for Travel\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Hot Cream 2 Pack, Belly Fat Burner Sweat Cream for Women and Men, Fat Burning Slimming Cream, Slim Weight Loss Cream, Anti-Cellulite Massage Cream for Body Shaping Waist, Abdomen and Buttocks\nReview Date: 2021/09/01\nStore: Purvigor\nAverage Rating: 3.8\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Purvigor', 'Scent': 'Unscented', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Unit Count': '2.1164 Ounce', 'Package Dimensions': '5.59 x 4.96 x 1.73 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Purvigor'}\nReview Text: This order comes with two 60 ml tubes of slimming cream. I use a disposable glove to apply it, and that keeps me from accidentally getting it in my eyes or anywhere else I don't intend for it to be. My focus area with this cream is my abdomen, admittedly one of the hardest areas to lose belly fat regardless of method. The burn is delayed for about 10 minutes, but when it starts, I can definitely feel it. It's a strong sensation, but not painful, and it reassures me that the cream is activating. Like probably many other folks who use this cream, I am also doing other things at the same time to try and lose weight: watching what I eat, exercising more, drinking more water, etc. Therefore, even though I am very slowly seeing a reduction in my belly fat, it's difficult for me to say how much of that is from using this cream and how much is from the other measures that I am taking to produce the same result. I consider $12.98 for two tubes a reasonable price for adding this cream to my weight loss efforts, and will continue to use it as long as I continue to see results.\nReview Title: Can Definitely Feel the Heat\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Bath Bombs Gift Set, Bath Bomb Gift for Women with Rose Petals, Lavender Scent 5pc Handmade Bubble Bath Gift Box with Soap & Petals Mothers Day Gifts Ideas for Mom, New Mom, Wife Birthday Gift for Her\nReview Date: 2021/09/15\nStore: # BFFLOVE\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Brand': '# BFFLOVE', 'Scent': 'Lavender,Rose', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Benefits': 'Softening,Stress Relief,Moisturizing,Aromatherapy', 'Material Feature': 'Organic, Vegan', 'Product Dimensions': '7.65 x 1.85 x 5.35 inches; 13.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '810001817473', 'Manufacturer': '# BFFLOVE'}\nReview Text: This is an absolutely wonderful gift set that is even nicely pre-wrapped with colorful paper and a beige ribbon and bow. The back of the box has a label explaining what's inside, but because of the type of adhesive and the type of glossy wrapping used, this label can be easily peeled off with no sticky adhesive remnant on the wrapping paper (see my before and after photos). Inside the wrapper, is a plain white sturdy cardboard box. Inside, there is a wrapped square bar of scented soap, a box of dried rose petals that look and smell pretty, and three rose and lavender scented bath bombs that spell out the word \"MOM.\" The \"O\" in \"MOM\" is shaped like a pink heart. All these items are resting on a bed of white nesting paper. Both the wrapping paper for the soap and the cardboard of the box containing the rose petals have the same pattern as the outer wrapping paper. Among other ingredients, each bath bomb contains coconut oil, sea salt, and shea butter. For the dried rose petals, it says to place them in still, warm bath water. It also says to drain the bath as usual as the dried florals are biodegradable. This gift is not just for Mother's Day, it's for any mom, any day, who would enjoy a thoughtful gift and a relaxing bath with these lovely scented bath bombs.\nReview Title: Very Nice Pre-Wrapped Gift Set for Moms of All Ages\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Facial Cleansing Brush, Wireless Charging Base Soft Brush Set with 3 Brush Heads for Face Spa, Exfoliating, Massaging and Deep Cleansing\nReview Date: 2021/10/01\nStore: Syllable\nAverage Rating: 3.5\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Syllable', 'Power Source': 'electric', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '8.74 x 6.89 x 3.31 inches; 1.52 Pounds'}\nReview Text: When I first tried this facial cleansing brush I thought it was broken, the brushes would not spin they just vibrated.

There's also a wireless charging base that can hold one of the brush heads, a charging cable (USB to micro USB) and a \"user guide\" which is not very good (it states that there are two brushes, there are three, a number of other problems).  The guide also recommends replacing the brushes after using for 3 months but I couldn't find any replacement brushes.  May be a good facial cleaner but it just tickled my face and didn't feel like it was doing much else.\nReview Title: Brushes do not spin, they vibrate\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Not My Mama's Bubbling Girls Face Wash All Natural Daily Cleanser 6 oz.\nReview Date: 2021/10/22\nStore: Not My Mama's\nAverage Rating: 4.3\nProduct Details: {'Product Dimensions': '1.5 x 1.5 x 6.75 inches; 7.37 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I got this for my wife, and here is her review: I liked this Not My Mama's Bubbling Face Wash before I even received it, because I thought the name was cute. The plastic 6 oz bottle has an iridescent label that reflects light just like bubbles do, which is kind of cool. The ingredient list is full of natural components, which is good. The bottle has an inner safety seal, so there was no leakage during shipment. This also reassures me that the contents have not been tampered with. The wash itself applies smoothly. Best of all, though, are the results. This cleans my face thoroughly and gently, and shrinks my pores well. My skin feels smooth and fresh after using this. I have very sensitive skin, and it's extremely hard for me to find a face wash that cleans well without leaving my face feeling dry and irritated. This face wash does exactly what I need for it to do. It currently lists for $20, but it takes very little to clean my entire face, so I expect it to last a while. After trying so many disappointing facial cleansers, I am quite happy with this one and definitely consider it a good value.\nReview Title: Cleans Well and Shrinks Pores\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Gryph & IvyRose Coat of Arms Hydrating Lotion for Kids - Hydrating Moisturizer with Shea Butter & Coconut Oil - All Natural, Sustainable, Cruelty Free, No Parabens, No Sulfates, Vegan - USA Made - 8oz\nReview Date: 2021/11/27\nStore: Gryph & IvyRose\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Gryph & IvyRose', 'Scent': 'Coconut Shea', 'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Active Ingredients': 'Sweet Almond Oil', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '5.67 x 2.28 x 2.24 inches; 8 Ounces', 'UPC': '856991007210'}\nReview Text: This Gryph & IvyRose Coat of Arms Body Lotion smells so good that I can't seem to stop sniffing my hands once I've applied the lotion.

It was a tough assignment due to the natural curl in my facial hair and I had to use a heavy application to try to achieve my desired results.  Unfortunately the natural curl won out unless I used so much wax that my mustache took on an unnaturally stiff appearance.  Haven't found a product that produces the results I'm after just yet. Good if you don't mind a stiff appearance.\nReview Title: A bit too stiff for me\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n    Structure your response as:\n   \n    SUMMARY:\n    [Final synthesis of preferences and patterns]",

    "title": "So Nice Having Extra Roller for Each",
    "text": "This 2-pack of ice rollers has an extra roller for each, which is a very nice bonus. That way one roller can be getting cold while the other is in use. The green and blue colors are both attractive, and each roller glides smoothly. The cold therapy provided by each of these rollers works well not just for facial toning but also for cooling my forehead when I am hot, have a headache, or just want to relieve stress and relax a bit. These rollers also work well on sore muscles such as back, thighs, shoulders, and calves. There is a little sheet inside the package that explains what ice rollers are and how to use them. In addition to using them myself, I have also gifted ice rollers to family and friends in the past, and each person has been very vocal about how very much they enjoy using them and how wonderful they feel. This 2-pack is a good value, especially with the extra rollers, and I also consider this very giftable, either as a set or individually.",
