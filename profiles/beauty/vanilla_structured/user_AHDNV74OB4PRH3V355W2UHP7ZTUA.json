The cream has very small chunks in it that for me at least don't really dissolve on my skin even when wet. I have to wipe off the excess after using this. I do love the packaging though. It's very unique in many ways. It does soften my skin very well and the oil in it doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy at all. That part I like very much.

Tips for maintaining your Loofah Sponge: Like any other sponge, loofahs are meant to be used for a limited time before being replaced. However, if you follow these tips on cleaning your loofah, you will be able to a month of use out of a single loofah. Dry it daily: After using your loofah, remove it from the moist shower environment and leave it somewhere with enough airflow to completely dry it out between uses. If you want to be extra cautious, soap up the loofah and rinse it out on its own after washing yourself and before letting it hang to dry. Clean it: Your loofah should be cleaned once a week. Every few weeks, soak the loofah in a solution of 5 percent bleach and then rinse thoroughly. Avoid use after shaving: Bacteria can enter your skin through any sort of nick or cut, so you shouldn\u2019t use your loofah on the affected area for a couple of days after shaving.

The loofah back and body scrubber sponge has changed all that for me from the second I used it. They are so easy to use and comfortable to hold. The belt-like portion is long enough where I can hold both handles and not feel strained or awkward but relaxed as I loofah away. The handles are very soft and braided. The belt is about 28 inches long and 3 1/4 inches wide. The loofah makes up about 11 inches in the middle. It's soft and not paper thin but kind of squishy and padded if that makes sense. It's put together very well, feels and looks of high quality. I've used other loofahs in the past that were very hard and actually hurt to use. I've been pleasantly surprised by these in the fact that they truly do give a gentle exfoliation. They feel nice and never too rough or scratchy. I absolutely love that these don't hurt because I honestly used to be scared of most loofah products. I also love that there are three of them in this pack. Not that I want to share cause I like them a lot although you could share with a spouse if need be. I suggest keeping them all to your self though because, well, they are very nice quality.

    "title": "Shrinks my pores and smells wonderful.",
    "text": "The first thing I noticed about this product was the scent. One of the ingredients is orange blossom water so it has a very light, clean, floral type scent. The scent isn't strong but light and refreshing. I absolutely love the smell. The spray pump makes it easy to apply and the size is perfect to throw in my purse in case I need a little refreshing throughout the day. I don't have huge pores although in certain spots they are more noticeable like on the sides of my nose and upper cheek areas. I find this spray does a good job at making those pores look smaller and my skin look overall smoother. I was afraid this would make my skin appear shiny but it doesn't do that. It also isn't sticky at all. I have used it both under my makeup and over it. Both ways work just the same and just as well. The formula doesn't irritate my skin at all which is a huge plus. You do need to reapply this throughout the day but it does last for quite a few hours. I only applied it twice, once in the morning and once in the later afternoon to refresh it. Overall I really like this product. It smells great, is easy to use, and helps the texture/look of my skin. I did get this product with a discount/ promotion although my thoughts and opinions are always my own and unbiased.",
