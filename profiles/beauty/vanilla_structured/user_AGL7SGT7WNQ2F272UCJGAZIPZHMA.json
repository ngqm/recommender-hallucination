The word \"bubble\" is normally used for cleansing wipes. I received the product, tried it, then realized that it's basically an upgrade version of cotton pads. It's definitely not \"one-step\" if you need to use water of makeup remover with this pad.<br />Also it's quite expensive - $15 for 15 pieces. To me it cleans as good as regular cotton pads. There's nothing special about it other than the design where you can stick fingers into and hold it while wiping your face. Overall ok product. Definitely overpriced and need more instructions on the jar.
