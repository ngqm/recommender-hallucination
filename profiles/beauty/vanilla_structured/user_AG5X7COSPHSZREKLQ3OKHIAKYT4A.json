I have dry skin and powder often makes me look cakey, this sits on my skin nicely and doesn't look too thick or powdery. I would say this has light to medium coverage. The shade I received is 100 light, it pulls too yellow/orange on me, I wish it had a more neutral undertone. I like that it has SPF 30 and is water/sweat resistant, I will probably get a lot more use out of this in the summer than in the winter.

The blush is not super pigmented, but I prefer my blushes to be blendable so they look more natural. The gold highlighter is gorgeous, it is not glittery but more of a shimmer. It is buildable, so you can make it look natural or blinding. The contour/bronzer is probably my least favorite part of the palette but I still like it. It was a little difficult to blend, it blends out best with a big, fluffy brush. The shade is somewhere between a contour and bronzer, it\u2019s a little too warm for my skin to be used as a contour so I blend it out more like a bronzer.

Consistently high ratings reflect satisfaction, particularly for products that offer a healthy glow without excessive shimmer or heaviness. The tendency to favor mattifying and long-lasting formulations, especially for oily skin, is evident.\n\nCommon themes highlight a focus on summer-friendly, blendable products, suggesting an appreciation for versatile use cases that enhance skin appearance while maintaining comfort. Quality appears vital, with numerous high ratings for products that combine effective performance with appealing aesthetics, evidenced by favorable comments on packaging and fragrance.\n\nHowever, the individual is price-sensitive, shown by critical reviews of expensive items that do not significantly outperform more affordable alternatives. This sensitivity indicates a search for value and a comparative approach to product quality, particularly with foundations and powders.\n\nOverall, core preferences include a desire for natural, long-lasting makeup solutions, a penchant for elegant formulations that prioritize skin health, and a cautious approach to spending, seeking products that deliver both quality and value.",
