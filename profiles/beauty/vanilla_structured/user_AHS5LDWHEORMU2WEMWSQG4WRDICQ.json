I hope you all reading are having a nice day and will continue to do so, like I am :)<br /><br />Anyway,  let me start by saying. I have been wanting to do this review for a while just to give my honest thoughts on it. I have been having to make a couple of life changes. Including for my own hair and the hair I use do to career changes as well as just life changes.<br /><br />Lately, I haven't been able to really enjoy my 'inches' like I want to,  because of the many things I do that disables me from using them. They merely get in the way of the work I have to do, so I decided to go shorter for the meantime.<br /><br />Now let me start by saying, I usually don't purchase wigs, but considering the maintence is a lot less than doing bundles, I thought it was the best option for now. So after actively searching I stumbled across this hair and I thought it would be an okay buy so I purchased.<br /><br />Now, it came in a cute little box and as far as I saw, there was no damage. They sent me a perfectly, full wig.<br /><br />Though, there are a couple things i should mention about it.  From first impressions, the hair was very soft, basically like silk through my fingers. It felt softer than any other hair I have bought, so I considered that an overall major plus. As for the length, The ends are evenly curled and blunt cut in the back, but the front isn't so it can fall longer in the front. Though, you might have to curl it again or  even straighten it if you dont like two different styles all the way around for it to look right.<br /><br />As for the density and movement, it's very bouncy and weightless. It looks and feels like very healthy, shiny hair with no foul smells. As for the thickness, it feels very thick and very full. It seems like it's density is very thick all over. No wedges in-between just very wonderful hair.<br /><br />As for the wig accessories itself, The frontal piece goes very long from the front to the back, which is very great for a wig unlike standard ones. It was clear that they used a 13x4 unlike smaller 4x4's which can make the wig not only more fuller, but to give it a more realistic look.<br /><br />Though, they didn't pluck it much so you would have to lay your baby hairs for it to look right or pluck it a bit more. Though, the 13x4 looked like it was colored correctly so it should blend it very nicely with all hair types.<br /><br />It also came with clips and it fit nicely to the head. It wasn't too tight or too loose which is pretty good, considering I have a medium head size, so i think it should fit most average heads.<br /><br />Overall, I really love this hair. The texture is beautiful and amazingly soft, the size is very fitting, it looks very realistic, and the wig was very well put together. So, of course I would give it a 5/5. It's definitely worth my rating and if you decided to buy, it would be a very valuable purchase.<br /><br />PS: This is not promotional content and I was not endorsed nor paid by this review.

It can take off your edges and make a mess on your head when you sweat. I try to avoid it less and less due to this.<br /><br />I am a fan of wearing my wig naked because of those issues, but I am glad that there is a more natural alternative now. I never knew these existed or I would have tried them much sooner.<br /><br />This set came with a transparent clear wig band and a tan one. I mostly wear the tan one because it blends better with my lace. But, putting it on is very easy and it has a decent tightness. It grips well, but not enough to be super tight.<br /><br />The band is very stretchy and easy to maneuver. Yet, it has a decent thickness as well. The bubble like grips really help it do its job well. Very durable and strong plastic bands overall.<br /><br />The band, plus the combs in my wig makes my wig very secure and tight. I haven't had any issue with it slipping or sliding back without me having to move it no matter what I'm doing. When I'm sweating it doesn't move and it fits my head very well overall.<br /><br /> So, I am super glad to have found this.

It\u2019s hint of soft red is really gorgeous. It gives me supple lip looking vibes. Very seductive and alluring. As for the texture, I can say it does feel soft. I can\u2019t compare it to others because I don\u2019t really seek out this type.<br /><br />But, it spreads nicely and feels very soft on the lips, especially with a little layer of lip gloss, this just pops. But, it doesn\u2019t have lasting wear as much as I\u2019d hope. If you avoided eating, drinking, or even touching your lips, maybe it would stay longer, but it just doesn\u2019t.<br /><br />It\u2019s quite easy to rub off even after it sets to me. But, Top Tier Hazel is a gorgeous color, very bold and beautiful. It just doesn\u2019t last without reapplication. And for colors like these, it\u2019s very easy to notice smudges in your lipstick. Otherwise, not bad in the other areas. I still like it and will continue to wear it, But, They should really improve its lasting effect, though.<br /><br />P.S: No matter the nature, I only write honest, unbiased, and authentic reviews.

I hope you all reading are having a nice day and will continue to do so, like I am :)<br /><br />Anyway,  let me start by saying. I have been wanting to do this review for a while just to give my honest thoughts on it. I have been having to make a couple of life changes. Including for my own hair and the hair I use do to career changes as well as just life changes.<br /><br />Lately, I haven't been able to really enjoy my 'inches' like I want to,  because of the many things I do that disables me from using them. They merely get in the way of the work I have to do, so I decided to go shorter for the meantime.<br /><br />Now let me start by saying, I usually don't purchase wigs, but considering the maintence is a lot less than doing bundles, I thought it was the best option for now. So after actively searching I stumbled across this hair and I thought it would be an okay buy so I purchased.<br /><br />Now, it came in a cute little box and as far as I saw, there was no damage. They sent me a perfectly, full wig.<br /><br />Though, there are a couple things i should mention about it.  From first impressions, the hair was very soft, basically like silk through my fingers. It felt softer than any other hair I have bought, so I considered that an overall major plus. As for the length, The ends are evenly curled and blunt cut in the back, but the front isn't so it can fall longer in the front. Though, you might have to curl it again or  even straighten it if you dont like two different styles all the way around for it to look right.<br /><br />As for the density and movement, it's very bouncy and weightless. It looks and feels like very healthy, shiny hair with no foul smells. As for the thickness, it feels very thick and very full. It seems like it's density is very thick all over. No wedges in-between just very wonderful hair.<br /><br />As for the wig accessories itself, The frontal piece goes very long from the front to the back, which is very great for a wig unlike standard ones. It was clear that they used a 13x4 unlike smaller 4x4's which can make the wig not only more fuller, but to give it a more realistic look.<br /><br />Though, they didn't pluck it much so you would have to lay your baby hairs for it to look right or pluck it a bit more. Though, the 13x4 looked like it was colored correctly so it should blend it very nicely with all hair types.<br /><br />It also came with clips and it fit nicely to the head. It wasn't too tight or too loose which is pretty good, considering I have a medium head size, so i think it should fit most average heads.<br /><br />Overall, I really love this hair. The texture is beautiful and amazingly soft, the size is very fitting, it looks very realistic, and the wig was very well put together. So, of course I would give it a 5/5. It's definitely worth my rating and if you decided to buy, it would be a very valuable purchase.<br /><br />PS: This is not promotional content and I was not endorsed nor paid by this review. This is my unbiased, unfiltered review and all words remain my own only. Thanks for reading. :)<br /><br />Edit:  I am afraid that it was a bit too short for my head size, so i made a return for a 10' instead and they were very courteous and helpful.  Thanks, JaJa Hair :)\nReview Title: Very Beautiful and Full Hair!!!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Transparent Flexible Silicon Wig Grip Headband, 2Pcs Wig Bands for Making Wigs, Soft Drop-Shaped Wig Hair Bands Scarf, Elastic Grip Band For Wigs Running Sport Headband (Light Brown+Transparent)\nReview Date: 2020/11/09\nStore: YMSGIRL\nAverage Rating: 3.3\nProduct Details: {'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material': 'Silicone', 'Fabric Type': 'Elastic,Silicon', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Brand': 'YMSGIRL', 'Package Dimensions': '4.84 x 3.46 x 1.1 inches; 1.76 Ounces'}\nReview Text: Hi, it's Glamorous Gem,<br />Hope you all are having a wonderful day.<br /><br />Anyway, I have never been a major fan of wig glue. It can take off your edges and make a mess on your head when you sweat. I try to avoid it less and less due to this.<br /><br />I am a fan of wearing my wig naked because of those issues, but I am glad that there is a more natural alternative now. I never knew these existed or I would have tried them much sooner.<br /><br />This set came with a transparent clear wig band and a tan one. I mostly wear the tan one because it blends better with my lace. But, putting it on is very easy and it has a decent tightness. It grips well, but not enough to be super tight.<br /><br />The band is very stretchy and easy to maneuver. Yet, it has a decent thickness as well. The bubble like grips really help it do its job well. Very durable and strong plastic bands overall.<br /><br />The band, plus the combs in my wig makes my wig very secure and tight. I haven't had any issue with it slipping or sliding back without me having to move it no matter what I'm doing. When I'm sweating it doesn't move and it fits my head very well overall.<br /><br /> So, I am super glad to have found this. This was a great investment for those that don't prefer glue all the time<br /><br />PS: No matter the nature, I only write honest and unbiased reviews.

That seem to be firm but the bristles can be super hard and painful, really hard to find one that is soft.<br /><br />This one is the opposite. The handle is quite long about 16\u2019. It easily reaches to the middle of my back and easily hits any spots I need to get with a tad bit of stretching. The brush head is super soft, almost angelic. I\u2019m surprised the bristles was made of nylon, the texture reminds me of a soft and durable cotton. When wet, the brush acts as a gentle exfoliating sponge. With small nodules making slight caresses across your skin, getting it clean with little effort needed at all.<br /><br />It doesn\u2019t hurt at all, if anything it gives the sensation of a gentle massage and a polisher for your skin. Very soothing and really makes your skin shine in the best way possible. My skin didn\u2019t feel sore, worn or even stung after using this. It looked and felt very bright, relaxed and soothed.<br /><br />Definitely the best shower I had in a minute without having to rely on a loufa for any exfoliation.<br /><br />After all of it, it even has a string so it can be hung up anywhere you like either in your bedroom or bathroom. Very convenient storage and dries quite fast and easily as well.<br /><br />Either way, out of all the brushes I have tried this takes the cake as the most handiest and softest of them all. Everyone should have one, your skin would thank you for the extra TLC.<br /><br />I even included a picture of it when wet, it clumps making it better for scrubbing<br /><br />PS: No matter the nature, I only write honest, unbiased, and authentic reviews.

This would definitely complete any outfit with those attributes.<br /><br />I love the design. The silky texture is super cute and attractive, and the pearls really make these headbands pop. So elegant, smooth, and stylish.<br /><br />These are also quite thick. There is silky fabric on the outside and thicker fabric on the inside surrounded by a metal band. There\u2019s a single band on one side and three metal bars on the other lined with fabrics and pearls as well.<br /><br />This doesn\u2019t look or feel too cheap. They are above hair store quality and seem very sturdy. They fit on my medium sized head quite easily and with no slip. They also don\u2019t seem super uncomfortable when wearing as well.<br /><br />The only problem I had with these are that they are a bit smaller than I expected. I thought they would be wider to cover flyaways, but these are a bit slimmer than expected. But, they do seem cool and unique. And, these are perfect for those that like to show their edges with a fresh new hairstyle like me.<br /><br />So, all in all, these fit my recommendation for switching it up in spring. It\u2019s always good to try something new.<br /><br />PS: No matter the nature, I only write honest, unbiased, and authentic reviews.

It\u2019s hint of soft red is really gorgeous. It gives me supple lip looking vibes. Very seductive and alluring. As for the texture, I can say it does feel soft. I can\u2019t compare it to others because I don\u2019t really seek out this type.<br /><br />But, it spreads nicely and feels very soft on the lips, especially with a little layer of lip gloss, this just pops. But, it doesn\u2019t have lasting wear as much as I\u2019d hope. If you avoided eating, drinking, or even touching your lips, maybe it would stay longer, but it just doesn\u2019t.<br /><br />It\u2019s quite easy to rub off even after it sets to me. But, Top Tier Hazel is a gorgeous color, very bold and beautiful. It just doesn\u2019t last without reapplication. And for colors like these, it\u2019s very easy to notice smudges in your lipstick. Otherwise, not bad in the other areas. I still like it and will continue to wear it, But, They should really improve its lasting effect, though.<br /><br />P.S: No matter the nature, I only write honest, unbiased, and authentic reviews.

But, I have heard many things about Rice Water and I have used it before. I just wonder if this is better and easier than making it myself like I used to.<br /><br />Rice Water is supposed to have many benefits to hair. It Detoxifies, Moisturizes, Promotes Hair Growth and Make Your Strands Stronger. So, it's great for all hair types no matter what issues you have.<br /><br />What I like about this kind is that it doesn't have any tangle smell or smells bad in particular. It's very floral and fragrant, definitely would make your hair smell like it just had a wash.<br /><br />It comes in a spray bottle with two caps. (One regular cap and one spray cap) I can just change the caps so it doesn't leak when I store it, so that's a plus as well.<br /><br />It's easy to use. It's not super thick either, so it sprays well and has decent coverage. It also sinks in well and deeply, feels good in hair, and moisturizes pretty great.<br /><br />I don't have any complaints about it. It's good for your hair and feels great in it. Plus, it has many other great attributes such as Chemical Free, Preservative Free, Sulfate Free.<br /><br />Of course, growth is gonna take time, but I'm along for the ride.\ud83d\ude01<br /><br />PS: No matter the nature, I only write honest, unbiased, and authentic reviews.\nReview Title: Smells Really Good and Great For Hair\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n    Structure your response as:\n   \n    SUMMARY:\n    [Final synthesis of preferences and patterns]",

She doesn\u2019t usually like the large type, frilly shower caps. They are looser and just not her type.<br /><br />This one is different. It\u2019s very slimming to the head and the only ornament it has is the bow, which can be tucked away if need be.<br /><br />I like that it\u2019s double layer, thick, durable and very insulated. This is quite a great quality cap that fits her perfectly as well without it being too tight. Lastly, I just think it\u2019s very cute and stylish, so if she wants, it\u2019s a backup if she can\u2019t find her bonnet lol.
