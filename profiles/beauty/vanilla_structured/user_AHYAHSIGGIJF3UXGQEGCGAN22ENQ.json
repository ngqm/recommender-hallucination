However, I was not impressed with the container and/or applicator. It\u2019s a small tube similar to a thin mascara bottle and it has a black button on top to release the serum. The tip is like a thick wax that gets covered with the serum but it\u2019s difficult to use on the subtle lash line or eyes in general. I prefer the wand versions to apply the serum because they are simple and fast and easier to apply. This lash and brow pen does work though and only takes about two weeks to see a difference.\nReview Title: Works With Time And Patience\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: MBA Renewing Retinol Serum, 1.7 fl. oz, 0.5% Retinol Hydrates & Brightens Skin's Appearance by Diminishing the Look of Breakouts, Hyperpigmentation, and Signs of Aging by Higher Education Skincare\nReview Date: 2020/07/07\nStore: Higher Education\nAverage Rating: 2.8\nProduct Details: {'Skin Type': 'All', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'Higher Education', 'Item Form': 'Serum', 'Unit Count': '1.7 Fl Oz', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.5 x 3.4 x 1.5 inches; 3.99 Ounces', 'UPC': '811381034009'}\nReview Text: The Serum by Higher Education is very moisturizing and delicate on the skin.

It\u2019s not because my lashes grew into fake lash length, but the applicator is the best I\u2019ve seen. I love you can coat your lashes using the mascara wand and use the white fluff tip to apply it to corners and the lash line easier. Having said all that, my lashes are a bit longer since I started using it and they feel strong and well conditioned.

It helped my curls and hair feel silky smooth, less frizzy and soft so I was very happy with the results. It doesn't have a scent and is a thick white cream conditioner type product in a nice package. Overall, it's worth the investment for conditioning and softening your hair and is really impressive.

    "text": "This is a nice serum that I've been using for a few months now and I really like it. I love the dropper bottle because it's easy to control how much serum you use and helps it last for a nice long time. The smell of this serum is nice and subtle and it feels smooth and not greasy while applying. I believe this does help your skin feel a bit rehydrated and soft after using this serum for sometime. I'm happy overall with the product and think that N.M.F. makes a very nice product. This is certainly worth giving a try, even if you have sensitive skin like I do.",
