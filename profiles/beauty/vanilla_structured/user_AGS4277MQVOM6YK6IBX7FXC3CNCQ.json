  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe individual demonstrates a clear inclination towards skincare products that address specific beauty concerns, particularly related to acne management, anti-aging, and enhancing appearance (e.g., eyelash growth). Patterns in ratings reveal high satisfaction with effective results, notably 5-star ratings for products that led to visible improvements in skin clarity and texture, while mediocre ratings highlight frustration with less effective items. A consistent preference for multifunctionality is evident, as they favor products that serve multiple purposes, like a serum that tackles aging and acne simultaneously.\n\nThe person's purchase history indicates a strong focus on quality, favoring products with natural ingredients and effective results over average ratings. Price sensitivity appears moderate; they are willing to invest in quality items that deliver results rather than opting for the cheapest options. The presence of lifetime guarantees or satisfaction promises also suggests a desire for assurance when purchasing skincare. Additionally, they value products with practicality, appreciating items that are user-friendly and effective for their grooming routines.\n\nIn essence, this individual's core preferences center around effective, quality skincare solutions that promise visible results, with a particular emphasis on acne treatment and youthful appearance, underlined by a practical and experience-driven approach to beauty products.",

    "text": "I am totally obsessed with all 24 of the chialstar velvet matte lipstick. They come in a clear plastic tube, which makes it easy to pick a color without opening each lid to see what color I want to use. The colors are also labeled on the cap. This set comes with a pink bag with a string for storage or if you want to take a few on the go. The bag fits in my purse without taking up space.<br /><br />Using these are a tad sticky and long lasting also waterproof. The color dries in under 60 seconds. The only way to get it off is with makeup remover or I use coconut oil. These lasted me a whole day without reapplying.<br /><br />The best part about having all these colors is you can do an ombre look, have a color to match all outfits. Also with these 24 colors, they range from lite to dark , which makes it perfect for all seasons.<br /><br />When I apply for best results I use a lite  color liner, chapstick and then apply color. I typically do 2 coats of color.<br /><br />I highly recommend these if you are looking for a set of matte color lipstick. These are perfect if you are a makeup artist or a lipstick addict. The price is reasonable.<br /><br />For people using mattes for the first time, it is going to be sticky at first before drying , so don't be disappointed with the texture. Also when drying leave your lips separated and don't blot because you will mess it up n get tissue stuck to your lips.",
