  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe individual exhibits a strong preference for hair and beauty products, particularly focusing on both human and synthetic hair options, indicating a willingness to experiment with different styles. They consistently rate products highly when they meet their quality expectations, especially emphasizing natural looks and texture. Common themes include the desire for products that mimic natural hair aesthetics and manageability.\n\nQuality insights reveal that they prefer higher-density hair options and often seek reassurance about the product's realism. Sentiment analysis shows they value user-friendliness, as seen in their appreciation for ease of styling and wear. Price sensitivity is apparent; while they are open to investing in quality, they express dissatisfaction if the quantity doesn\u2019t meet expectations or if products lack essential features like combs.\n\nOverall, this individual seems to prioritize aesthetic appeal, natural appearance, and product functionality while being somewhat discerning about quality versus price. Their consistent positive sentiment toward products that fulfill these criteria underscores a genuine preference for well-made, visually appealing beauty items.",
