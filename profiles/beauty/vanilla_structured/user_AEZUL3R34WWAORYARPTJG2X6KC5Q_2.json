Im sort of obsessed with skincare and I have lots of it. Despite what you might think because of my 1 star review, I actually LOVE a lot of Caudalie products. In fact a few of them are staples that I always make sure I have at any given time. So why the one star review you might ask?<br /><br />This set is a complete and total rip off!!! I saw that they had beauty elixir in this and jumped on it without even looking at the sizes. I assumed since it said $106 value these were gonna be at the very least deluxe travel size. No these are legit sample size. Not to mention there radiance serum, Creme sorbet, and premier cru eye cream are terrible. The instant foaming cleanser is ok and I love the beauty elixir but the other 3 are so bad. The eye cream pills like crazy and makes you eyes legit drier. The radiance serum is sticky and does nothing. And the creme sorbet looks like cottage cheese and leave this like film over your face. Also if you apply the eye cream and the serum Sparingly once a day you might get 5 days use out of them. The creme sorbet maybe a week. I actually purchase a few items from Caudalie all the time and I get these 3 crappy samples like almost every time I order for FREE with purchase.<br /><br />So do i recommend this \u201cvalue\u201d set at $46 bucks? No freaking way.<br />Do I recommend other Caudalie products? Absolutely.<br />Go buy yourself from Caudalie:<br />\u2022The beauty elixer<br />\u2022detox mask<br />\u2022purifying clay mask<br />\u2022moisturizing mask<br />\u2022hand and nail cream<br />\u2022deep cleansing exfoliator<br />\u2022glycolic peel<br />Any of these listed are fantastic products that met or exceeded my expectations and most are staples in my collection that I use all the time.\nReview Title: Brand has some great products but this isn\u2019t it\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Rui Smiths Pro Stainless Steel 8-Piece Manicure Kit For Home And Salon With Professional Precision Cuticle Nipper And Metal Pusher Style No. 105\nReview Date: 2020/09/16\nStore: Rui Smiths\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Product Dimensions': '6.69 x 4.33 x 1.08 inches; 11.46 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'SK-02', 'UPC': '728614665797', 'Manufacturer': 'Rui Smiths', 'Country of Origin': 'China'}\nReview Text: I\u2019ve purchased a lot of nail care kits over the years like this one from tons of different brands, getting them everywhere from drug stores to Sephora and ranging in price from 10 bucks to nearly 100 bucks.

There all so ridiculously priced right now becuase if demand that I had a hard time finding one that wasn\u2019t insanely priced. So when I got the chance to try this Yapaspt brand automatic sanitizer dispenser kit I jumped on it.<br /><br />Setup was easy, it only took me a few minutes to do. You will need 4 size C batteries for this. I filled the included inner sanitizer holder bottle up with just some generic hand sanitizer I had gotten. Then I set it on a desk and we were good to go.<br /><br />Now I\u2019m not sure if I just got one that the sensor isn\u2019t very sensitive or if there\u2019s something wrong with it or what. But this only works as it should maybe 80% of the time. The rest of the time you have to move you hands around under it and pull them out and put them back multiple times for it to come out. Not only is this frustrating for the adults but it makes it so sometimes the kids have to do it and you have to stop what your doing and go help them try to get it out. Honestly for the price point of this it should work flawlessly, not only most of the time. So while it does look nice and sleek and the spray that comes out is a nice mist I can only give this 3 stars because of the issues we have had with it.\nReview Title: Works most of the time...\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: SupSilk 1 Inch Hair Straightener Flat Iron, Flat Iron for Hair Curler Iron with Ceramic Tourmaline Plates Adjustable Fast Heat to 250-450\u2109 for Black Curly | Women Girlfriend Gifts | Salon\nReview Date: 2021/02/13\nStore: SUPSILK\nAverage Rating: 3.3\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'SUPSILK', 'Hair Type': 'All,Thick', 'Material': 'Ceramic', 'Max Temperature Setting': '232.2 Degrees Celsius', 'Heater Surface Material': 'Ceramic', 'Product Dimensions': '10.8 x 1.2 x 1.4 inches; 1.25 Pounds', 'UPC': '661748801719', 'Manufacturer': 'SUPSILK'}\nReview Text: This is a pretty solid hair straightener considering the price point. One of my biggest pet peeves with cheaper hair straighteners is that the plates tend to not be smooth and you can feel it catching on your hair, basically a lot of times they don\u2019t glide through like they should. However I did not have that problem at all with this one and It easily glided though my hair.<br /><br />Holding it is easy and it feels comfortable in your hand. The temp adjusts from 300F-450F, and it heats up in about a minute. It has an auto shut off after 60 min, which is a pretty long shut off time but at least it has that built in. The button to control it is on the inside which I always prefer since that means I can\u2019t accidentally press the button as I\u2019m using it. The only downside with this is that it\u2019s not good for creating curls or waves like most straighteners are these days. The shape of it makes it incapable of doing this.

I have particularly been into the magnetic ones lately since they are insanely easy to use and don\u2019t require a lengthy process. These particular magnetic lashes intrigued me because they come with multiple different style lashes instead of a bunch of the same and I was excited to give them a try!<br /><br />The magnetic liner itself is pretty bad, Though that\u2019s not odd for the less expensive sets and I kind of expected it. It\u2019s just a bit to hard to work with and I had to go over the eyeliner line multiple times to get it how I wanted it. It\u2019s just a bit to runny. But I can just use a different liner so it\u2019s not a big deal.<br /><br />My biggest problem with this set, and the reason why I gave it only 3 stars, it the quality and look of the lashes themselves. There really plastic feeling. Plus the magnetic strip on all of them is ridiculously thick. I\u2019m not someone who likes that overly thick lash strip look, and much prefer a thinner band in my lashes. But these do stay on well and I had no issues with them applying to the liner and stating on throughout the day.

I was looking for a good shower cap to avoid wetting my hair daily and I am not at all disappointed by these.<br /><br />The adjustable string allows the cap to fit on any head. Additionally, there is a big slack in the fabric in the back which allows my very long hair to fit!<br /><br />It is nice that this comes in a two pack because you can alternated using them while the other is drying. I always let mine air dry - if you plan to use a dryer I would be sure to dry on no heat.<br /><br />The inner plastic feels comfortable on the head and isn't \"scratchy\" for the lack of a better work.

It doesn't irritate my scalp at all and does the job of keeping my hair dry.\nReview Title: The adjustable string is an awesome feature\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n    Structure your response as:\n   \n    SUMMARY:\n    [Final synthesis of preferences and patterns]",

    "title": "Don\u2019t smell before you brew it!",
    "text": "I\u2019m a huge tea drinker and was looking for something different to drink before bed instead of my usual chamomile blend. I had heard of this Welle co brand before, but had never personally tried it prior to this. So I was really excited to give it a go.<br /><br />First impressions, the box it comes in is super luxe looking and very giftable. And the container that holds the tea bags is a very pretty purple color and is glass, giving you that premium look. However once I opened the container I was highly disappointed. They didn\u2019t even splurge on the pyramid tea bags, they went with those cheap pouches. For this price point I expected much better if I\u2019m being honest!<br /><br />Scent wise this tea smells like sweaty socks, it is not a pleasant smell and I highly recommend not even smelling it before brewing because it can easily put you off to drinking it. But once brewing I was surprised that the scent was almost fruity, so much better than in the container! The directions say to steep one to two bags for 2-10 minutes, in very hot but not boiling water. I usually like stronger tea, but with this I just can\u2019t justify using 2 tea bags at that price point!<br /><br />Taste wise it actually has a very mild taste, and none of that sticky socks smell or taste at all. It\u2019s very mild tasting with a slightly fruity/berry taste to it. Is it amazing? No, but it\u2019s not bad. It\u2019s definitely an acquired taste! I will say though that I have been sleeping like a baby the last few nights I have drank this, so even though it\u2019s not my favorite tea it does seam to work, at least for me.",
