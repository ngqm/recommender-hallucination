It exfoliates well and isn\u2019t too rough. I use it with body wash and while the briststles sort of get pushed down/bent in different directions it still works wonderfully. The long handle back brush though I really don\u2019t like the hard nodule things in the brush. They\u2019re way to hard for me and so I\u2019ve kept it more for a household or outside cleaning brush unfortunately.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe individual displays a consistent preference for skincare products that focus on exfoliation, moisturizing, and anti-aging benefits. Sentiments indicate a mix of satisfaction and disappointment, often hinging on product scent and application texture. The reviews suggest a strong preference for gentle formulations, as evidenced by their positive feedback on soft, non-irritating brushes and oils. \n\nThere's a notable sensitivity to smells, with multiple mentions of unpleasant or overpowering scents detracting from the user experience, although they appreciate effective results from the products. Overall ratings hover around average to slightly above, indicating a critical eye towards quality.\n\nIn terms of usage, products are aimed at enhancing skin appearance and health, particularly targeting dark spots, hydration, and overall skin vitality. Sensitivities are pronounced in the choice of skincare, with a clear inclination towards natural and soothing ingredients.\n\nQuality over quantity is preferred, as the individual favors products that yield visible results without adverse effects, suggesting they may be less price-sensitive if the performance justifies the cost. The individual appears to value functionality alongside sensory experiences, preferring products that deliver on promised benefits while being considerate of their sensory needs.",
