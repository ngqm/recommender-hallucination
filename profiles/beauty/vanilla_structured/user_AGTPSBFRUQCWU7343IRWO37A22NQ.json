  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe individual demonstrates a clear preference for skincare products that emphasize sensitivity and natural ingredients, as seen in their high ratings for gentle products like clay masks and coconut scrubs. Most reviews reflect a focus on skin irritation concerns, highlighting a need for hypoallergenic formulations, especially given the individual's sensitive skin and proactive measures against environmental allergens. \n\nCommon themes include the use of moisturizing and nourishing properties, suggested by positive responses to products designed for scars and hydration. Contrarily, there is a notable rejection of unsuitable moisturizers, as indicated by a low rating for a product that caused a negative skin reaction.\n\nIn terms of quality preferences, the individual favors products that are gentle and effective, consistently mentioning satisfaction regarding the after-use feel or results. Price sensitivity appears moderate, as they express willingness to try various products as long as they perform well and provide desired results.\n\nOverall, their core preferences emphasize gentle, effective, and natural skincare solutions that accommodate sensitive skin, alongside a cautious approach to trying new products while maintaining watchfulness for skin reactions.",
