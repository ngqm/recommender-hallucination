  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:  \nThis individual displays a clear preference for unscented grooming products, particularly for beard care items, as highlighted by consistently high ratings for unscented options. They demonstrate a strong inclination for products that condition and soften their beard, emphasizing natural feel and effectiveness over scent. While they tolerate some scented variants, such as Campfire Cody, they rate these lower than unscented options, suggesting a sensitivity to overpowering fragrances. \n\nQuality is a significant factor in their purchasing decisions, as evidenced by perfect scores for products that meet their performance expectations, particularly regarding softness and manageability. Their review of a moustache wax further indicates a search for products with strong hold and pleasing scent, although it diverges slightly from the unscented preference. \n\nPrice sensitivity does not appear prevalent in this purchase history, as the focus leans more towards product effectiveness and satisfaction rather than cost. Overall, their core preferences revolve around effective, high-quality grooming solutions, with a strong bias towards unscented formulations and a keen eye for natural product benefits.",
