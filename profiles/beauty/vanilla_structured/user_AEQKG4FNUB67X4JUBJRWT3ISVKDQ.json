Last year my husband and son were in a fishing tournament and had forgotten to put on sunscreen. By the end of the day they both came home really burnt. My son got it really bad on his face and nose.  So I went to Walmart to buy something to help give them some relief. Everything was pretty much sold out  except one really small tube of the SunBurnt Gel. I almost didn't buy it because it was kind of pricey and pretty small. I decided though to give it a try since it was my only option. I put it on both my husband and son and immediately they felt a huge relief from the pain. They said the gel instantly took the heat out of the burn and cooled it down. Then by the next morning I was so shocked to see that they both looked like they never even got burned at all and neither of them were in pain. A few days later my son did start to peel a little on his face. So I used the rest of the sun burnt gel and it actually took the peeling away. His face looked normal again within minutes and didn't  peel again after that. My husband didn't even peel at all. I was thinking maybe we just got lucky because there was no way this product had those results in one day, but I found out this year that it definitely was the sunburnt gel that helped. This year, right before summer I found this one for a great deal. I remembered paying alot last year. I also wanted to try it again, so I decided to buy it and store it away until I needed it. Well last weekend my husband went fishing and forgot to put sunscreen on again. He came home burnt pretty bad. So we tried sunburnt gel again and the same thing as last year happened. By the next morning it was a huge improvement. This time he had to put it on twice, but we are still so amazed with how well this stuff works. For now on this is the only after sun care product that my family and I will buy.\nReview Title: The Best After Sun Care Product\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Detangling Brush for Curly Hair,Hair Brush Afro America Textured 3a to 4c Kinky Wavy for Wet/Dry/Long Thick Curly Hair for Beautiful and Shiny Curls (Black)\nReview Date: 2020/08/03\nStore: BROUYOUE\nAverage Rating: 4.3\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'BROUYOUE', 'Shape': 'Oblong', 'Product Benefits': 'Detangle', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy, Dry, Curly, Normal, Thick', 'Product Dimensions': '0.5 x 0.2 x 0.2 inches; 3.53 Ounces', 'UPC': '300692537076'}\nReview Text: I was really surprised with how much I really love this brush. I have owned many other types of detangling brushes, and this one is way better. It's was like magic.<br />It has a good weight to it and feels like a durable and great quality brush. The little black plastic piece that comes with the brush, clips onto the back side of the brush. There is two different spots that you can pick from to put the clip on piece.<br />I have 3A type of hair and this brush just rips right through the knots and tangles without causing pain. With my other brushes, the brush would be full of my hair after brushing all of the tangles out. With this brush there was very little hair left in the brush afterwards. Which was easy to clean off of the brush.<br />My daughter also doesn't run for the hills anymore when it comes time for me to brush her hair lol. Now she wants her own brush like this, so I will be buying another one soon.<br /><br />Great Tip For Others: No matter what type of hair you have, you should always start from the bottom and work your way upward when brushing. Take your free hand and hold the section of hair that you are brushing tightly enough so that there is less pulling of the hair from your scalp. I usually place my free hand a little above where the brush is going through the hair. I also find that when you come across an area that is pretty tangled or knotted, that it works better to hold the brush in a vertical position to brush that area.\nReview Title: Awesome Detangling Brush\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: DeepDream Portable Electric Nail Drill - Professional Efile Nail Drill Kit For Acrylic, Gel Nails, Manicure Pedicure Polishing Shape Tools with 11Pcs Nail Drill Bits and 36 Sanding Bands\nReview Date: 2020/08/08\nStore: Deep Dream\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Deep Dream', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Maximum Rotational Speed': '20000 RPM', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '8 x 4 x 2.6 inches; 10.41 Ounces', 'UPC': '191762584966', 'Manufacturer': 'Deep Dream'}\nReview Text: I am a newbie at learning to do nails, so this is actually my first electric nail drill kit.

You just soak your cotton ball/pad in pure acetone, and then put the cotton on your nail where it completely covers the nail. Then place the clip-on caps on your fingers to hold the cotton in place. They are comfortable to wear and don't hurt at all. Within 3-5 minutes the nail polish comes right off. It makes the process much easier and quicker. They are definitely worth buying, and they can be used for either at home use or for professional use.\nReview Title: Just As Described\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: 3 Packs Braiding Hair Extensions 165G Jumbo Braiding Hair High Temperature Synthetic Fiber Jumbo Braiding Hair Extensions ( Blue)\nReview Date: 2020/09/10\nStore: UHair\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'UHair', 'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Material Feature': 'Natural'}\nReview Text: The hair is as I expected it to be.

She has somewhat thick hair so I got her two different sets with multiple size curlers so that we would definitely have enough and have the right size. Neither set included any instructions, but it's common sense to know that the hair needed to be wet prior and it was easy enough to figure out how to apply the curlers. However, neither of us realized how time consuming the whole process would be. Half way through applying the curlers, my daughter started to get antsy and didn't want to sit there anymore. She also said that it hurt a little when pulling the hair through some of the curlers. We managed to finish getting the curlers in her hair, but by the time we were finally done she was just over it all. She was no longer willing to even wait for her hair to dry. So within about 10 minute she had starting pulling all of the curlers back out. Which that was another process. You have to be careful pulling each one out because if you start doing it too fast the hair will get tangled and stuck in the curler.<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  I still think these curlers are nice though and I do think they would have looked great if she would have waited long enough, but they just weren't for her. I would recommend them for someone who doesn't mind being patient for the end result. For my daughter though we learned that it's just better to use a more quicker / instant method to curl her hair.\nReview Title: Nice, But Time Consuming\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Mini Rubber Bands Soft Elastic Bands for Kids Hair Non-slip Rubber Hair Bands Soft Hair Elastics Ties Bands Braids Hair for Girls - STRONG - REUSEABLE (Colorful1000+Black1000)\nReview Date: 2020/10/10\nStore: OLEWELL\nAverage Rating: 3.7\nProduct Details: {'Material': 'Rubber', 'Item Form': 'Elastic', 'Brand': 'OLEWELL', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Number of Pieces': '2', 'Package Dimensions': '7 x 5 x 1 inches; 0.81 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'SML'}\nReview Text: These are awesome rubber bands and they are such a great deal for the money because you get alot of them. Altogether I got 1000 colorful ones and 1000 blacks ones. I got them for my 10 year old daughter and she loves them. They are more gently on the hair than most kinds , so they don't hurt as much to pull them out if we don't have scissors handy. They are also pretty durable. I seen other reviews saying that they break easily, but I literally tried to break one on purpose to see how far I could stretch it and it took alot to break it. Also, with the few that I stretched out, I thought that they would stay stretched out and that I would of had to throw them out. However,\u00a0 after I let each rubber band go, it actually snapped back to the original shape and size. Another positive is that since there are so many , I was able to fill up two snack size ziplock bags (one colorful & one black) for my daughter to have to play with her dolls and make her rubber band bracelets. She still has plenty left to last a while for her hair. The next time we need to get more, these will be the only kind that I buy.\nReview Title: Great Rubber Bands at a Great Deal\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Gel UV Nail Lamp, AsperX 150W LED Nail Dryer Gel Nail Polish Light Curing Lamp Kit Smart Auto-sensing with 10/30/60/99s Timer\nReview Date: 2020/10/20\nStore: AsperX\nAverage Rating: 4.3\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'AsperX', 'Material': 'Gel', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '8.9 x 8.03 x 4.33 inches', 'Product Dimensions': '8.9\"D x 8.03\"W x 4.33\"H'}\nReview Text: This is a nice nail lamp and it works great. My ten year old daughter and I are recently new to doing nails with Gel polish. We really enjoy practicing doing each others nails. However, the first LED/ UV lamp that we got would get too hot for my daughter to be able to stand on her hands. So I decided to look for a different lamp. I had seen many of the reviews on this lamp that had said it was great to use with children. Plus it had mentioned that it included some accessories. Which made it a great value for the money. So I decided to give it a try. Now we have had it for a little over two months and it has been great. We use it quite often and it's pretty simple to use. You just put your hand inside, and it turns on right away or you can select one of the timed buttons. It cures all gel polishes quickly. My daughter has also been just fine using it. It hasn't gotten too hot for her at all, even when it's been on for a while. It also included some extras. It came with some profesional quality files, a cuticle trimmer, a brush, and a really awesome scraper tool that works so good at scraping the gel polish off.<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, we are definitely happy with this lamp, and I don't think we will ever go back to regular nail polish that you have to wait for them to air dry.\u00a0 I also plan on buying another one so that my daughter and I don't have to share just the one.\nReview Title: Great LED/UV Lamp\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Also, with the few that I stretched out, I thought that they would stay stretched out and that I would of had to throw them out. However,\u00a0 after I let each rubber band go, it actually snapped back to the original shape and size. Another positive is that since there are so many , I was able to fill up two snack size ziplock bags (one colorful & one black) for my daughter to have to play with her dolls and make her rubber band bracelets. She still has plenty left to last a while for her hair. The next time we need to get more, these will be the only kind that I buy.\nGreat Rubber Bands at a Great Deal\nGel UV Nail Lamp, AsperX 150W LED Nail Dryer Gel Nail Polish Light Curing Lamp Kit Smart Auto-sensing with 10/30/60/99s Timer\nAsperX\n{'Brand': 'AsperX', 'Material': 'Gel', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '8.9 x 8.03 x 4.33 inches', 'Product Dimensions': '8.9\"D x 8.03\"W x 4.33\"H'}\nThis is a nice nail lamp and it works great. My ten year old daughter and I are recently new to doing nails with Gel polish. We really enjoy practicing doing each others nails. However, the first LED/ UV lamp that we got would get too hot for my daughter to be able to stand on her hands. So I decided to look for a different lamp. I had seen many of the reviews on this lamp that had said it was great to use with children. Plus it had mentioned that it included some accessories. Which made it a great value for the money. So I decided to give it a try. Now we have had it for a little over two months and it has been great. We use it quite often and it's pretty simple to use. You just put your hand inside, and it turns on right away or you can select one of the timed buttons. It cures all gel polishes quickly. My daughter has also been just fine using it. It hasn't gotten too hot for her at all, even when it's been on for a while. It also included some extras. It came with some profesional quality files, a cuticle trimmer, a brush, and a really awesome scraper tool that works so good at scraping the gel polish off.<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, we are definitely happy with this lamp, and I don't think we will ever go back to regular nail polish that you have to wait for them to air dry.\u00a0 I also plan on buying another one so that my daughter and I don't have to share just the one.\nGreat LED/UV Lamp",

Last year my husband and son were in a fishing tournament and had forgotten to put on sunscreen. By the end of the day they both came home really burnt. My son got it really bad on his face and nose.  So I went to Walmart to buy something to help give them some relief. Everything was pretty much sold out  except one really small tube of the SunBurnt Gel. I almost didn't buy it because it was kind of pricey and pretty small. I decided though to give it a try since it was my only option. I put it on both my husband and son and immediately they felt a huge relief from the pain. They said the gel instantly took the heat out of the burn and cooled it down. Then by the next morning I was so shocked to see that they both looked like they never even got burned at all and neither of them were in pain. A few days later my son did start to peel a little on his face. So I used the rest of the sun burnt gel and it actually took the peeling away. His face looked normal again within minutes and didn't  peel again after that. My husband didn't even peel at all. I was thinking maybe we just got lucky because there was no way this product had those results in one day, but I found out this year that it definitely was the sunburnt gel that helped. This year, right before summer I found this one for a great deal. I remembered paying alot last year. I also wanted to try it again, so I decided to buy it and store it away until I needed it. Well last weekend my husband went fishing and forgot to put sunscreen on again. He came home burnt pretty bad. So we tried sunburnt gel again and the same thing as last year happened. By the next morning it was a huge improvement. This time he had to put it on twice, but we are still so amazed with how well this stuff works. For now on this is the only after sun care product that my family and I will buy.\nReview Title: The Best After Sun Care Product\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Detangling Brush for Curly Hair,Hair Brush Afro America Textured 3a to 4c Kinky Wavy for Wet/Dry/Long Thick Curly Hair for Beautiful and Shiny Curls (Black)\nReview Date: 2020/08/03\nStore: BROUYOUE\nAverage Rating: 4.3\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'BROUYOUE', 'Shape': 'Oblong', 'Product Benefits': 'Detangle', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy, Dry, Curly, Normal, Thick', 'Product Dimensions': '0.5 x 0.2 x 0.2 inches; 3.53 Ounces', 'UPC': '300692537076'}\nReview Text: I was really surprised with how much I really love this brush. I have owned many other types of detangling brushes, and this one is way better. It's was like magic.<br />It has a good weight to it and feels like a durable and great quality brush. The little black plastic piece that comes with the brush, clips onto the back side of the brush. There is two different spots that you can pick from to put the clip on piece.<br />I have 3A type of hair and this brush just rips right through the knots and tangles without causing pain. With my other brushes, the brush would be full of my hair after brushing all of the tangles out. With this brush there was very little hair left in the brush afterwards. Which was easy to clean off of the brush.<br />My daughter also doesn't run for the hills anymore when it comes time for me to brush her hair lol. Now she wants her own brush like this, so I will be buying another one soon.<br /><br />Great Tip For Others: No matter what type of hair you have, you should always start from the bottom and work your way upward when brushing. Take your free hand and hold the section of hair that you are brushing tightly enough so that there is less pulling of the hair from your scalp. I usually place my free hand a little above where the brush is going through the hair. I also find that when you come across an area that is pretty tangled or knotted, that it works better to hold the brush in a vertical position to brush that area.\nReview Title: Awesome Detangling Brush\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: DeepDream Portable Electric Nail Drill - Professional Efile Nail Drill Kit For Acrylic, Gel Nails, Manicure Pedicure Polishing Shape Tools with 11Pcs Nail Drill Bits and 36 Sanding Bands\nReview Date: 2020/08/08\nStore: Deep Dream\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Deep Dream', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Maximum Rotational Speed': '20000 RPM', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '8 x 4 x 2.6 inches; 10.41 Ounces', 'UPC': '191762584966', 'Manufacturer': 'Deep Dream'}\nReview Text: I am a newbie at learning to do nails, so this is actually my first electric nail drill kit.

You just soak your cotton ball/pad in pure acetone, and then put the cotton on your nail where it completely covers the nail. Then place the clip-on caps on your fingers to hold the cotton in place. They are comfortable to wear and don't hurt at all. Within 3-5 minutes the nail polish comes right off. It makes the process much easier and quicker. They are definitely worth buying, and they can be used for either at home use or for professional use.\nReview Title: Just As Described\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: 3 Packs Braiding Hair Extensions 165G Jumbo Braiding Hair High Temperature Synthetic Fiber Jumbo Braiding Hair Extensions ( Blue)\nReview Date: 2020/09/10\nStore: UHair\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'UHair', 'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Material Feature': 'Natural'}\nReview Text: The hair is as I expected it to be. For the great low price and quantity of hair received , the quality is good. It came with 3 big packages of the hair and two small bonus hair clips. I picked the blue color and it is beautiful and vibrant. I originally got the hair to make hair extensions for my daughter, but I found it a little difficult because the hair is a little frizzy and does tangle easily. So we ended up just doing braids and some of the blue hair added into each braid.<br /><br />PROS: Good value for your money. Comes with plenty of hair to work with. It's a beautiful and vibrant color. Works really well with braids.<br /><br />CONS: The hair has a little bit of frizz.

She has somewhat thick hair so I got her two different sets with multiple size curlers so that we would definitely have enough and have the right size. Neither set included any instructions, but it's common sense to know that the hair needed to be wet prior and it was easy enough to figure out how to apply the curlers. However, neither of us realized how time consuming the whole process would be. Half way through applying the curlers, my daughter started to get antsy and didn't want to sit there anymore. She also said that it hurt a little when pulling the hair through some of the curlers. We managed to finish getting the curlers in her hair, but by the time we were finally done she was just over it all. She was no longer willing to even wait for her hair to dry. So within about 10 minute she had starting pulling all of the curlers back out. Which that was another process. You have to be careful pulling each one out because if you start doing it too fast the hair will get tangled and stuck in the curler.<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  I still think these curlers are nice though and I do think they would have looked great if she would have waited long enough, but they just weren't for her. I would recommend them for someone who doesn't mind being patient for the end result. For my daughter though we learned that it's just better to use a more quicker / instant method to curl her hair.\nReview Title: Nice, But Time Consuming\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Mini Rubber Bands Soft Elastic Bands for Kids Hair Non-slip Rubber Hair Bands Soft Hair Elastics Ties Bands Braids Hair for Girls - STRONG - REUSEABLE (Colorful1000+Black1000)\nReview Date: 2020/10/10\nStore: OLEWELL\nAverage Rating: 3.7\nProduct Details: {'Material': 'Rubber', 'Item Form': 'Elastic', 'Brand': 'OLEWELL', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Number of Pieces': '2', 'Package Dimensions': '7 x 5 x 1 inches; 0.81 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'SML'}\nReview Text: These are awesome rubber bands and they are such a great deal for the money because you get alot of them.

    "text": "This was an ok set of headbands for the money and at a good value. The set came with 10 hairbands, which equaled out to be cheaper than buying them individually. I got them to split up as gifts between my daughter and my nieces.<br /><br />My daughter and I love all of the colors and think the knot style is really cute, but I feel that the quality is not the same for all of the headbands. Some are perfect, but some are not. The knots were not in the same spots on all of them. Some had knots on the top in the middle and then some of the knots were slightly off to the side. Also the fabric on some are glued on slightly crooked and some are a smaller size then the others.\u00a0 So a couple of them were too small for my daughters head. Even though some have a few minor issues, she says she still loves the ones I gave her. So I am at least happy about that. She does wear them all the time and they do look flattering on her. The only thing is the flower print ones she has a harder time matching to her outfits, so she usually wears those ones with a solid color shirt. My nieces are also happy with theirs. The ones that were actually too small for my daughter were the ones that I gifted to my nieces, which turned out great because they fit both of my nieces good.\u00a0<br /><br />Overall I am ok with this set. They were a great money saver and great for gifting. The hairbands are cute and little girls love them. Even with the few minor flaws I would still get them again.",
