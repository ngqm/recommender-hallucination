  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe analysis of the purchase history reveals a strong inclination towards cosmetics, particularly focusing on makeup application tools and highlighting products. Consistent ratings suggest a preference for products that blend well and offer buildable coverage, with an average rating of around 4.3. Sentiment is mixed, particularly regarding product longevity and shade suitability, as the buyer often expresses dissatisfaction with certain shades or performance durability.\n\nCommon themes in product use cases indicate a focus on enhancing skin tone and applying makeup effectively, with a notable preference for multifunctional tools. Quality preferences lean towards synthetic and soft materials that provide a pleasant experience; however, concerns regarding durability and performance longevity frequently arise.\n\nPrice sensitivity appears moderate; the buyer values quality but also seeks gifts at reasonable price points, suggesting a balance between performance and value. \n\nIn essence, core preferences emphasize a desire for versatile, quality makeup tools and products that complement skin tones, alongside a preference for soft finishes and reasonable longevity, reflecting both enjoyment in cosmetics and practical concerns about product lifespan.",
