The strong reactions to scent\u2014both positive and negative\u2014serve as a critical factor in product satisfaction. However, a notable price sensitivity is evident; despite being willing to spend on favored items, dissatisfaction leads to immediate dismissal, suggesting higher expectations for value.\n\nOverall, this person shows a core preference for quality, nostalgic scents, and effective products, demonstrating a mix of emotional attachment and practical criteria in their shopping behavior.",

    "text": "I used gel polish WITHOUT a foundation base coat (I did have a top coat) and that stuffed allowed me to peel my gel polish off in just about 3 to 5 minutes! I used it on polish WITH a foundation base coat and it took way longer, about as long as acetone would. Again this was with gel polish, not gel nail builder/sculpter/overlay. Also, scuffing up the top layer coat of polish DOES make all the difference and allows it to work fast. Also, I can see why they don't want people to get it on their skin: it has a slight tightening sensation. Not painful for me personally or anything like that - just a feeling that something is on there.",
