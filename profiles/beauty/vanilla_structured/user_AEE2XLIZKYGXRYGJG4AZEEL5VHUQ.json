You only need to use a small amount of the face wash for your whole face and it lathers up really well. My only issue is, it is 5 ounces, so for the price it is a little bit more expensive and although you will not use very much it probably still will not last very long especially if you are washing your face twice a day.

It comes with 4 brush heads so you can change them whenever you need to which is a perk. It also has a timer on it to let you know when to switch brushing the different sides of your teeth and then turns off after 2 minutes. The buttons are very easy to push and its not confusing to use, I really like it, its also not heavy.
