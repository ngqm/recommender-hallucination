I was initially worried that the antennae on top would easily break off but the are made of a flexible rubber.  The bristles are made of a durable metal with a white coating on the tips so they're not so sharp.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great first pet brush, or a great addition to the supplies you already have.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe individual displays a strong preference for grooming products, particularly those designed for pets, reflecting a significant focus on pet care. Their reviews consistently highlight convenience, efficiency, and durability, with high ratings averaging above 4.3 for pet brushes, indicating satisfaction with user-friendly features such as self-cleaning mechanisms and effective de-shedding capabilities. The usage of brushes for both indoor and outdoor environments suggests a versatile approach to pet grooming.\n\nIn contrast, their interest in hair care items reveals a more discerning attitude toward quality and value. The negative sentiment regarding the small size and high cost of a frizz-control gel implies notable price sensitivity, leading to a preference for economical, larger alternatives. Yet, the desire for soft, non-damaging hair accessories is confirmed by a positive appraisal of silk scrunchies, albeit complicated by delivery expectations concerning product freshness.\n\nOverall, core preferences center on practicality and effective results, with a tendency to favor well-constructed, easy-to-clean products in the grooming category while exhibiting a cautious approach to spending in hair care, searching for optimal quality at a reasonable price.",

After hearing everyone talk so great about mustache wax and it benefits, I had to tr some.<br /><br />This mustache wax holds really, really well.  I use this when I am going out to eat or someplace like that to keep my mustache under control.  This wax holds really well, I should've listened to people sooner when they said I need to get some.  It really does help and this wax works perfectly.<br /><br />I don't use too much because I do still like more of a natural look, but this wax keeps the flyaways under control and also the tips nice and stiff.<br /><br />This comes in a nice tin with a sticker.  The wax is also stamped on the inside, which is a nice touch.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy with this mustache wax.  I am definitely going to get some of this again when tis is gone.",
