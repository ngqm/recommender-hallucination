I have noticed a little growth in my lashes. The most noticeable thing that has got me hooked on this is the fact that I don't lose as many lashes as I normally used to. Every time I would wash my eye makeup off, no matter how gentle, a few lashes always came out. While putting on mascara a lash or two would come out.

The color payoff for this eyeliner is very impressive. It glided on so smoothly and was very easy to apply. I only needed to go over a spot one time and didn't need to go back and touch it up. I love that it's 70% organic because there are way too many cosmetics out there with harmful ingredients in them. This is perfect for someone who wears contacts! It's also vegan and gluten free. It stays put just as long as many other eyeliners I have tried. It even has coconut oil, vitamin E, and grape seed oil, which are all great conditioners for your lashes.

The ferrules are strong on them and are not loose at all. I love every single brush in this set. I can easily create an every day eye look or a more drastic smokey eye with the brushes included. I love the tapered blending brush in this set. It is the perfect size. The angled contour brush is perfect for applying blush, highlight, or contouring. The brushes all pick up a good amount of powder and don't waste much or create a lot of unnecessary fallout. While washing the brushes I didn't lose tons of hairs either which was great. The brushes cleaned very well and maintained their normal shape and softness after drying. So far I am very happy with this brush set and highly recommend it.

I don't have to dig around for a nail file, cuticle nippers, or nail trimmers when I need them quickly. The set includes everything I need to give myself a nice and clean manicure too. It includes big nail clippers, scissors, cuticle nippers, a nail file, tweezers, ear pick, and cuticle pusher, The cuticle nippers are nice and sharp which I was very happy about. They get hang nails and little pieces of cuticle very easily with no pain. The tweezers are great for doing my eye brows. The scissors are also great for trimming up my eye brows on the go or at home. Everything is sharp, everything is easy to grip and comfortable to hold. The tweezers grab little hairs that I used to have trouble grabbing with my other tweezers. This set is great for travel or home use. I'm definitely happy to have it with me now! *discount received for testing and review*",
