When I first put it on I was expecting a more tea tree scent but didn't really get that. It says that it also has peppermint in it but that is not what I smell I put it on. I don't know how I would describe it but my particular ol factories just don't care for it too much. And I really didn't care too much for their citrus sent either. But I really LOVE their Bold Forest scent, but for some reason they are out of stock or not making it or something. It is unavailable here on Amazon and it is also unavailable at their official website. When and if it becomes available I would recommend getting that one instead or just buy the uncensored version. As far as the oil itself you will not find a better one because it is nice and light and non-greasy yet makes your beard soft and shine.\nReview Title: I LOVE Beardsmen's Bold Forest scent\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Beard Oil - Rousing Citrus Scent - Huge Man-Sized 4 oz Bottle - 100% Natural - Softens Your Beard and Stops Itching - Scent Women Love - Best Beard Oil And Conditioner For Men\nReview Date: 2016/11/10\nStore: BEARDSMEN SPIRIT\nAverage Rating: 3.3\nProduct Details: {'Scent': 'Citrus', 'Liquid Volume': '4 Fluid Ounces', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Brand': 'BEARDSMEN SPIRIT', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Package Dimensions': '4.1 x 2 x 1.8 inches; 8 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I like Beardsmen's Bold Forest the best, but to change it up a little bit I bought the Rousing Citrus. The Rousing Citrus isn't what you might expect. It is not that bright refreshing Citrus smell that you might be anticipating. It is more of a clove with citrus in the background. When you put it in your hands and onto your beard you smell the Citrus right away. But just as soon as you put it on your beard and rub it in the Citrus dissipate and there is a rather strong close scent. If you like the smell of clothes like I do then you will love it. If you don't then you will not like this sense at all. To be honest I had to use it about 3 or 4 times to really decide if I like it or not. So if you buy it and you used it for the first time and don't like it try it for another 3 or 4 days and see if you still don't like it. I think you'll find that it is a pretty good scent after all.\nReview Title: I like Beardsmen's Bold Forest the best\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Keledz Hair Straightener Brush, Ionic Ceramic Fast Hair Straightening Comb with 5 Heating Setting Heating Function and LED Display, Anti Scald Ionic Brush (Black)\nReview Date: 2019/06/15\nStore: Keledz\nAverage Rating: 4.0\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Keledz', 'Material': 'Ceramic', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Heater Surface Material': 'Ceramic', 'Package Dimensions': '13 x 3.8 x 2 inches; 13.62 Ounces', 'UPC': '712424116822', 'Manufacturer': 'kele'}\nReview Text: truth be told I have only used one but this is the only one I need to use from the performance that it is all really giving me a few times.

The guys who run it are great guys and they have a great brotherhood going but I just honestly don't like their products very much. the oils and the butters are nice but I just don't really like the smell anymore. Just a personal preference is all but the great thing about them is that if you buy from them you can always get a money back guarantee or a switch for something you think you might like.
