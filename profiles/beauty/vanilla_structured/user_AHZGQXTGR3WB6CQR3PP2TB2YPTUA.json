It cures evenly and it\u2019s base is large enough to take hand or foot without the danger of damaging polish while putting it in. It came with the fingerless glove for hand protection and I thought that was pretty neat. It\u2019s supposed to protect the skin from tanning. I never had a glove before. It also came with the 2 nail files. It\u2019s a smart lamp, when the temperature gets high, it will turn to low-power mode to protect the hand, light kinda dims. When temperature gets down, the lamp goes back to normal work mode. When you out your hand in it automatically goes for 120sec, other presets are 39/60/90  sec. Instruction manual is pretty good.<br />Overall it\u2019s a good lamp and I recommend.

Before trying these I tried lashes with glue and that was a disaster. Then ai tried magnetic ones and that was a good experience. When these came up for the review I honestly didn\u2019t understand how different it is then a glue? Well, it\u2019s the application process that\u2019s different. With glue you have to squeeze it out and make sure not to put  too much, then you have to make sure to place the lash correctly on the first attempt or you might have glue on your eye lid. This liner serves as a glue! It\u2019s just like regular liner, has that sharpie tip and works like a pen. You draw your line over the eye lid and then place the lashes and they will stick to it perfectly. If you need to reposition the lash there is no mees and glue residue, you just pull and place it back accordingly. I only wish these would be more natural style but for the ladies that like their lashes little more dramatic this is perfect choice.\nReview Title: Beginner friendly application\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Emilia Hypoallergenic Bath Oil for Babies - Paraben-Free Natural Baby Wash Enriched With Natural Oat Extract, Sunflower, Sweet Almond, Sesame, Calendula, and Chamomile 8.5 fl.oz.\nReview Date: 2020/09/01\nStore: Emilia\nAverage Rating: 3.6\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Emilia', 'Scent': 'Chamomile', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Unit Count': '8.5 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.81 x 2.05 x 1.85 inches; 8.78 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I love the natural ingredients and the mild and pleasant scent, I also love how the skin feels after this bath oil.

Usually Vit C is thin almost like water but this variety by MD is oil based. It works great for my skin giving it a bit extra hydration it needs.

One box contains pointy nails and other box comes with more oval shaped ones. They come in many sizes and I was able to get appropriate size for all of my fingers. I didn\u2019t use the glue stickers they included, I used liquid nail glue from another brand. Also pointy nails were a little too pointy for me and the tips needed a little filing.

I didn\u2019t use the glue stickers they included, I used liquid nail glue from another brand. Also pointy nails were a little too pointy for me and the tips needed a little filing. Quantity is great, well there is abundance of nails so it\u2019s easy to replace when one breaks. Because they\u2019re so many I will rate this 5 stars but otherwise would probably be 4.\nReview Title: Excellent value - good quality (not excellent)\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: MilyBest Fluffy Lashes False Eyelashes Natural Look Cat Eye Lashes, Dramatic Faux Mink Lashes 3D Effect 18mm D Curl Volume Extension Reusable Wispy Lashes Pack 10 Pairs\nReview Date: 2022/08/25\nStore: MilyBest\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Color': 'B-Sweet Date | 18MM', 'Brand': 'MilyBest', 'Material': 'Faux Mink, Plastic, Cotton', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '7.44 x 4.02 x 0.69 inches', 'Material Feature': 'Cruelty Free', 'Product Dimensions': '7.44 x 4.02 x 0.69 inches; 0.32 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'QC10-T02', 'Manufacturer': 'MilyBest', 'Country of Origin': 'China'}\nReview Text: These lashes are so gorgeous!

    "text": "One of the shocking and least expected causes of wrinkles is your side-sleeping habit. However, it's impossible to quit when you are habituated with such sleeping habits. This is where these face wrinkle pads come to the rescue. These anti-wrinkle pads can be used on the chest and neck to gain smoother and younger skin, free from wrinkles. The whole pack comes with 11 sets, with each set containing a cleavage pad and a neck pad to reduce and prevent wrinkles and lines from the skin.<br />The cleavage and check is considered the most critical area that people often overlook. This area is susceptible to side sleeping, gravity, and UV radiation. These pads work great for preventing and reducing wrinkles and lines in this area. They help increase the blood circulation and stimulate collagen production to improve skin elasticity and make skin firmer and smoother. The best thing is these pads are reusable up to 15 times, so one pack will easily last for 4-5 months.",
