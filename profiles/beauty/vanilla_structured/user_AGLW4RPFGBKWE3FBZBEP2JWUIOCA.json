I am not a beginner, but I was excited to have everything in a tiny package- something easy to pull out with friends but with high quality results.<br /><br />I got a friend, we opened the box and assumed I'd be ready to do her nails without getting my nail kit.<br /><br />Nope.<br /><br />The first sept (as it always is) was to clean buff and shape the nail- nothing included to do that.<br /><br />I thought- okay- no big deal.<br /><br />I got my stuff out and took care of it. I then applied their prep product- Nail dehydrator- all good.<br /><br />I started to plug in the nail light, so I\u2019d be ready after we apply the first coat- but this kit didn't include a plug- just a usb cord. (sigh) I got up again- and got an extra usb plug I had. Now slightly annoyed because this is supposed to be a ready kit-<br /><br />but hey-- really-- not a huge deal.<br /><br />Then I applied the base coat. Whew- runny. I wasn\u2019t impressed with it\u2019s consentaneity. But maybe it\u2019d perform well?<br /><br />Then I tried to cure it. Cue the light--<br /><br />Oh, my word their nail lamp is horrible.<br /><br />It\u2019s very cheap looking- only fits four fingers- not the thumb at the same time, and really feels off- like the break into shards plastic, not the bendy kind. (I was still trying to accept this as a no big deal point but the red flags were slapping me in the face.)<br /><br />I read the pamphlet to see how long it needed to cure- the pamphlet said \"cure for the appropriate time\" or something just a vague. I read the nail polish, to find the appropriate time- nope. I looed over the box- nothing.<br /><br />We used the lamp like 5 times and finally got her base coat cured. Then we had to do the same with just her thumb. I have nail lights that cost three bucks that work better than this thing. I\u2019m not kidding.  In fact- I use single nail lights that only cure one nail at a time\u2014and this was SLOWER!<br /><br />Okay- that was over.<br /><br />Where is the red polish?<br /><br />The box says: \u201cStep two apply polish\u201d and it has a picture of the polish- a red polish, they name it like it\u2019s included.<br /><br />It\u2019s not.<br /><br />This starter kit isn\u2019t much of a START without a polish-<br /><br />but Okay- my nail kit to save the day.<br /><br />I pulled out a blush pink gel that always does me right.<br /><br />But the base coat is weird.

Some kits try to force a look, but this one was open to play with. Maybe not the best idea for a beginner kit- but I enjoyed that.<br /><br />First the good:<br />I like this type of lamp when I'm doing gel- it's easy together both my hands in to hold the nail down when I first start, then I usually pick up the light and rotate it to get a full cure. Yes I have to restart the lamp a few times, but this isn't an expensive lamp so I don't mind.<br /><br />I liked the little box they came in- sure it's cheep, but it was a nice tough to have (almost) everything in once place.<br /><br />Then the annoying:<br /><br />There are a lot of odd little problems, like the Gel itself, two are jelly clear and one is opaque. Opaque gel takes a little longer to cure because the light works a bit harder to travel though the nail. It would have been helpful if they mentioned that, OR only gave you one type of gel-so it doesn't confuse you-- but they didn't.<br /><br />The nail forms were a bad fir for my hand. Thats just an unlucky break- all hands are diffrent- so im not including that in my rating, just something to mention in case they don't work for you too.<br /><br />The colors were a little annoying to use, no color indicator on the bottle. this is common with cheeper sets, but I thought I'd mention it anyway- It can make doing your nails just a little bothersome.<br /><br />The ugly-<br />they don't include slip solution-I ended up using my own from my nail kit, so I didn't have any problems, but that's a huge mistake on their part-- if you're just starting out you'll think gel nails are a sticky mess. Slip solution makes them manageable.<br /><br />Overall- I feel like there are better kits that will give you a cleaner start over this one--<br /><br />I hope this review was helpful!\nReview Title: I wouldn't start with this--\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: EMMOR Long Ash Blonde Wig for Women - Natural Straight Hair With Air Bang Wigs, Party Cosplay Daily Use\nReview Date: 2020/08/16\nStore: EMMOR\nAverage Rating: 3.3\nProduct Details: {'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Brand': 'EMMOR', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '13.19 x 9.29 x 2.72 inches; 10.62 Ounces'}\nReview Text: This is a true costume wig- that\u2019s sad because the color is such a beautiful honey ash-<br /><br />We\u2019re talking- about tangle city- pure shine- and straw hair.

Also- I try to update my reviews, so they may change over time.<br /><br />My experience:<br />I'm not a makeup expert-- but when magnetic eyelashes first came out, I was a customer- so I\u2019ve watched the market change over the years. At the time of this review you\u2019ll finally find different styles of lashes, but all of them will be a bit stiff, and thick. Not many options for soft natural looking lashes in with magnetic application.<br /><br />The lashes styles:<br />These lashes have a decent range as magnetic lashes go with a few of the wispier, natural-ish options. So far though I haven\u2019t seen any magnetic lashes on the market that look natural.<br /><br />Liner applicator:<br />This isn\u2019t THE best liner applicator I\u2019ve tried, but it is comparable to the best. In my experience the liner is the most important part of the lash set- not just because it\u2019s the \u201cglue\u201d but it\u2019s the item that makes the most difference on ease of application and finished look. Some liners are thick no matter what you do, this one allows a thinner line. (BUT magnetic lashes don\u2019t do well with a pin line application, meaning you must add enough for the lash to grab on to) this made a thinner line work for me., (please note I have wrinkled and hooded eyelids, so everything I do is a little bumpy/ big)<br /><br />FIRST TIME USERS: these work best if you do ONE eye at a time. The lashes apply best when the liner is still a bit wet. NOT fully wet- but given a little time to START to dry. Think of the liner like glue- perfectly wet glue doesn\u2019t hold paper together, and dry glue doesn\u2019t stick.<br /><br />I recommend testing this liner on the back of your hand before your eyes, so you don\u2019t end up looking like a panda as you practice\u2014and the skin on your hand isn\u2019t as sensitive as your eyelid. As you practice, remember that the lashes are reusable BUT can break easily --so practice with the set you like LEAST and be careful as you apply and remove.)<br /><br />Overall-<br />I recommend this set. There are MANY magnetic eylashe sets on the market, and this is one of the good ones.<br /><br />I\u2019ll update this post with eye looks as I use each lash set and change my review if I see anything that should be mentioned.<br /><br />I hope this was helpful!!\nReview Title: The magnetic eyeliner perfected--\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I am not a beginner, but I was excited to have everything in a tiny package- something easy to pull out with friends but with high quality results.<br /><br />I got a friend, we opened the box and assumed I'd be ready to do her nails without getting my nail kit.<br /><br />Nope.<br /><br />The first sept (as it always is) was to clean buff and shape the nail- nothing included to do that.<br /><br />I thought- okay- no big deal.<br /><br />I got my stuff out and took care of it. I then applied their prep product- Nail dehydrator- all good.<br /><br />I started to plug in the nail light, so I\u2019d be ready after we apply the first coat- but this kit didn't include a plug- just a usb cord. (sigh) I got up again- and got an extra usb plug I had. Now slightly annoyed because this is supposed to be a ready kit-<br /><br />but hey-- really-- not a huge deal.<br /><br />Then I applied the base coat. Whew- runny. I wasn\u2019t impressed with it\u2019s consentaneity. But maybe it\u2019d perform well?<br /><br />Then I tried to cure it. Cue the light--<br /><br />Oh, my word their nail lamp is horrible.<br /><br />It\u2019s very cheap looking- only fits four fingers- not the thumb at the same time, and really feels off- like the break into shards plastic, not the bendy kind. (I was still trying to accept this as a no big deal point but the red flags were slapping me in the face.)<br /><br />I read the pamphlet to see how long it needed to cure- the pamphlet said \"cure for the appropriate time\" or something just a vague. I read the nail polish, to find the appropriate time- nope. I looed over the box- nothing.<br /><br />We used the lamp like 5 times and finally got her base coat cured. Then we had to do the same with just her thumb. I have nail lights that cost three bucks that work better than this thing. I\u2019m not kidding.  In fact- I use single nail lights that only cure one nail at a time\u2014and this was SLOWER!<br /><br />Okay- that was over.<br /><br />Where is the red polish?<br /><br />The box says: \u201cStep two apply polish\u201d and it has a picture of the polish- a red polish, they name it like it\u2019s included.<br /><br />It\u2019s not.<br /><br />This starter kit isn\u2019t much of a START without a polish-<br /><br />but Okay- my nail kit to save the day.<br /><br />I pulled out a blush pink gel that always does me right.<br /><br />But the base coat is weird. The polish is almost clumping on the nail. It applies a tad bit patchy. I get that not all formulas work together\u2014but they DIDN\u2019T GIVE ME a polish to work with so theirs- in theory- should be mostly universal. I didn\u2019t know I was intended to buy-one polishe- AND their kit to make this happen.<br /><br />I try to cure MY gel polish tin their lamp.<br />(thank goodness my friend is a very laid-back person- she was amazing about this, laughing with me--) I was itching to pull out a good lamp but I didn\u2019t, so I\u2019d give this a true test.<br />(Or because I wanted to test my patience. Two birds one stone)<br /><br />Now\u2014here is the saving grace\u2014<br /><br />the top coat is wonderful.<br /><br />It works like some of my best top coats- it leaves that perfect glassy look and it applies like a dream.<br /><br />Later I used the same top coat on my nails- and it worked just as well without the weird base coat and the horrible lamp and a totally different brand of nail polish.<br /><br />THIS WHOLE KIT AND THE ONLY THING THEY HAVE GOING FOR IT IS THE TOP COAT!<br />Now I get why this has good reviews\u2014it\u2019s the gel top coat.<br /><br />No wonder it lasts- I can only guess Red Carpet knows their top coat is fantastic, so they threw a bunch of bad apples in here \u2013aware beginners won\u2019t know any better.<br /><br />Please. You can buy wonderful topcoats for 10-20 bucks NOT 50 OF YOUR HARD-EARNED DOLLARS- This is such a sad waste- and they don\u2019t even throw in a file, or a plug in or red polish?<br /><br />I have more stuff coming from this brand\u2014things I got before I tried this-- that I\u2019m going to be trying-<br />I really hope this is their only issue... we shall see. \uf04c<br /><br />I hope this review was helpful because I don\u2019t want your money wasted. :(\nReview Title: Please - just go buy a topcoat.\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: lorelo 4 Pieces Nail Dotting Pen, Dual-ended Nail Dotting Pen Liner Brush Nail Art Point Drill Drawing Tools Set Nail Art DIY Decoration Tool\nReview Date: 2020/08/09\nStore: lorelo\nAverage Rating: 3.7\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '7.3 x 4.2 x 0.6 inches; 1.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '619156572950'}\nReview Text: These do the job.<br /><br />There are a lot of these on the market- nothing wrong with this set.<br />They didn't do anything extra- like throw in a few extra wax heads like some companies do- but they didn't need to.<br /><br />Really- the reason to get these is if you like the colors-- the way they look.<br /><br />If you like em- then this is the set for you.<br /><br />If you've never had one of these for placing bling and glitter flakes-- they are so helpful-- the wax keeps picking things up over and over and the other side helps you position things instead of poking them endlessly with an orange sick.

Some kits try to force a look, but this one was open to play with. Maybe not the best idea for a beginner kit- but I enjoyed that.<br /><br />First the good:<br />I like this type of lamp when I'm doing gel- it's easy together both my hands in to hold the nail down when I first start, then I usually pick up the light and rotate it to get a full cure. Yes I have to restart the lamp a few times, but this isn't an expensive lamp so I don't mind.<br /><br />I liked the little box they came in- sure it's cheep, but it was a nice tough to have (almost) everything in once place.<br /><br />Then the annoying:<br /><br />There are a lot of odd little problems, like the Gel itself, two are jelly clear and one is opaque. Opaque gel takes a little longer to cure because the light works a bit harder to travel though the nail. It would have been helpful if they mentioned that, OR only gave you one type of gel-so it doesn't confuse you-- but they didn't.<br /><br />The nail forms were a bad fir for my hand. Thats just an unlucky break- all hands are diffrent- so im not including that in my rating, just something to mention in case they don't work for you too.<br /><br />The colors were a little annoying to use, no color indicator on the bottle. this is common with cheeper sets, but I thought I'd mention it anyway- It can make doing your nails just a little bothersome.<br /><br />The ugly-<br />they don't include slip solution-I ended up using my own from my nail kit, so I didn't have any problems, but that's a huge mistake on their part-- if you're just starting out you'll think gel nails are a sticky mess. Slip solution makes them manageable.<br /><br />Overall- I feel like there are better kits that will give you a cleaner start over this one--<br /><br />I hope this review was helpful!\nReview Title: I wouldn't start with this--\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: EMMOR Long Ash Blonde Wig for Women - Natural Straight Hair With Air Bang Wigs, Party Cosplay Daily Use\nReview Date: 2020/08/16\nStore: EMMOR\nAverage Rating: 3.3\nProduct Details: {'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Brand': 'EMMOR', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '13.19 x 9.29 x 2.72 inches; 10.62 Ounces'}\nReview Text: This is a true costume wig- that\u2019s sad because the color is such a beautiful honey ash-<br /><br />We\u2019re talking- about tangle city- pure shine- and straw hair.

Also- I try to update my reviews, so they may change over time.<br /><br />My experience:<br />I'm not a makeup expert-- but when magnetic eyelashes first came out, I was a customer- so I\u2019ve watched the market change over the years. At the time of this review you\u2019ll finally find different styles of lashes, but all of them will be a bit stiff, and thick. Not many options for soft natural looking lashes in with magnetic application.<br /><br />The lashes styles:<br />These lashes have a decent range as magnetic lashes go with a few of the wispier, natural-ish options. So far though I haven\u2019t seen any magnetic lashes on the market that look natural.<br /><br />Liner applicator:<br />This isn\u2019t THE best liner applicator I\u2019ve tried, but it is comparable to the best. In my experience the liner is the most important part of the lash set- not just because it\u2019s the \u201cglue\u201d but it\u2019s the item that makes the most difference on ease of application and finished look. Some liners are thick no matter what you do, this one allows a thinner line. (BUT magnetic lashes don\u2019t do well with a pin line application, meaning you must add enough for the lash to grab on to) this made a thinner line work for me., (please note I have wrinkled and hooded eyelids, so everything I do is a little bumpy/ big)<br /><br />FIRST TIME USERS: these work best if you do ONE eye at a time. The lashes apply best when the liner is still a bit wet. NOT fully wet- but given a little time to START to dry. Think of the liner like glue- perfectly wet glue doesn\u2019t hold paper together, and dry glue doesn\u2019t stick.<br /><br />I recommend testing this liner on the back of your hand before your eyes, so you don\u2019t end up looking like a panda as you practice\u2014and the skin on your hand isn\u2019t as sensitive as your eyelid. As you practice, remember that the lashes are reusable BUT can break easily --so practice with the set you like LEAST and be careful as you apply and remove.)<br /><br />Overall-<br />I recommend this set. There are MANY magnetic eylashe sets on the market, and this is one of the good ones.<br /><br />I\u2019ll update this post with eye looks as I use each lash set and change my review if I see anything that should be mentioned.<br /><br />I hope this was helpful!!\nReview Title: The magnetic eyeliner perfected--\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n    Structure your response as:\n   \n    SUMMARY:\n    [Final synthesis of preferences and patterns]",

First, there is a consistent tendency to favor products that provide value, with ratings reflecting a blend of satisfaction and price sensitivity; items are often evaluated against perceived worth.

Also-I try to update my reviews, so they may change over time.<br /><br />My nail experience:<br />I am currently NOT a nail tech but I am practicing to become licensed. It\u2019s something I enjoy\u2014but is still a hobby.  I practice weekly, if not daily- on myself, hand mannequins, and other people. Sometimes I\u2019m told to hurry up getting licensed- that I\u2019m \"good enough\"\u2014but I\u2019m in no hurry, busy trying out as many products as I can, watching nail content on YouTube and SkillShare.<br />SO--Though I am knowledgeable, I recommend you always trust licensed nail teaches over me.<br /><br />Art liner brushes-- overall look:<br />I'm a sucker for the embedded crystals look that these brushes have. Its a common look for nail brushes- this style is everywhere, but I always find it pretty. The crystals are loose, wiggling around in the open center- sometimes making a faint clicking noise. This style always looks bougie to me.<br /><br />The brush tips:<br />these preform fine- had a few brush hairs I had to get wet and smooth-- nothing bad. after a little forming they do what they are intended to do. If you're new to brushes like these, the long fine lines help create smoother thin lines and the stubby brushes are good for more precise detail.<br /><br />Cost:<br />At the time of this review these brushes cost 6.99. for five brushes that's roughly 1.25 for each brush. Not a bad cost. You can get better brushes- they'll have less imperfections and will cost more-- but these do fine.<br /><br />I see these brushes everywhere-- and the'll randomly pop up at different price points- sometimes even as a free bonus for a more expensive nail kit. So if you want to shop around you may be able to find them cheeper-- but I still think this is a good price.<br /><br />Overall:<br />They are what they say they are.  If you like the look on the page- I don't think they will disappoint.<br /><br />I hope this was helpful!",
