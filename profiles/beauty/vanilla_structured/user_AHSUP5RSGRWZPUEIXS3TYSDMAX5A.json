The brushes I've been seeing look flimsy and painful with their wire tips. I liked the rubber tips on this so took the chance. It's working great so far. I can tell it doesn't hurt my cat...although she still doesn't love what's happening. It smoothed their hair without pulling it all out. The bristles kept their shape. The button pushed all the hair up, so I could cleanly and easily pull it all off. It's more comfortable to hold, and the cover is actually helpful to keep the bristles clean and protected from being bent. It's a little large for even my large cats but totally doable. It would definitely work for larger dogs as well. The price is reasonable and considering so many other similar brushes received poor reviews, I'm especially happy with this for the price.\nReview Title: Working well\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: LOVE CINEMA Mascara 222\nReview Date: 2022/06/12\nStore: LOVE CINEMA\nAverage Rating: 3.9\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'LOVE CINEMA', 'Item Volume': '0.24 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Information': 'Tube', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Water Resistance Level': 'Waterproof'}\nReview Text: Reviews when I ordered this were raving about it.

I'm not wearing much makeup these days, but based on reviews, I got this with the hope it will work for maturing skin. I can see this also washing you out a bit as another reviewer mentioned. It's white, and even though I'm fair, I felt this needed a very light application. The good news is if such a thin dusting can live up to the reviews, it makes the price a little better.

The color is beautiful and not too orange. While I like the gold too, the specks of glitter are larger and more obvious than I would like. Some gold is really fine and distributes as an even shimmer across your lips. With this, you can see the glitter speck here, the glitter speck there, the glitter speck falling a little outside your lip line that will probably end up somewhere else on your face. It has more of a youthful, party feel. I agree it's a color reminiscent of sunsets, suited for summer and fall. The case is possibly the most sophisticated I own though. It has a nice weight, and the magnetic closure feels good. It came in a box and in a sealed bag. I don't mind wearing this color, but I wouldn't buy it again. I think I like the case the best, but I'm not convinced the color or feel add up to make it worth $38.\nReview Title: Very glittery\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Pineapple Gommage Peeling Gel by Vitamasques - Gentle Botanical Cellulose Exfoliator for Sensitive Skin - De-Clogs Pores & Eliminates Dead Skin - Vegan, Free from Parabens & Gluten\nReview Date: 2022/07/30\nStore: Vitamasques\nAverage Rating: 4.2\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Vitamasques', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Material Feature': 'Cruelty Free, Vegan', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Scent': 'Pineapple', 'Package Dimensions': '4.92 x 2.2 x 1.38 inches; 2.08 Ounces', 'UPC': '750258970371'}\nReview Text: The tube had a foil seal. There is a pineapple scent. You're supposed to massage the gel on dry skin for 2 minutes. As soon as you start, it starts to pill. I feel like most of it immediately dries up and falls off though I'm sure it's grabbing dead skin too. While it's gentle in that it's not using coarse particles, I didn't enjoy the dry rubbing and tugging at my skin. You can only avoid that over 2 minutes by applying a generous amount of gel, but it's a small tube. My skin looked a little brightened afterwards but not as soft and bright as many other exfoliators (scrubs, peels, masks, serums, etc). This is $12.99, which doesn't seem like as great of a value after seeing how much you need to use. I didn't like the application, results, or price enough to reorder this.\nReview Title: Dry rub\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Everyday Beauty Radiance Cleanser, Rejuvenating Antioxidant Gel Cleanser with Rose Hip Seed Oil, Vitamin A, C, and E for All Skin Types to Soothe and Nourish Dry Damaged Skin, 4fl oz.

The sealed tub also had a plastic cover under the the lid and was boxed. The scrub had a little brown in it like what you might see when fruit starts to rot or in yogurt, but it's dated good until 9/14/2023, so I felt okay using it. The red particles made my husband and I realize we didn't confidently know the color of strawberry seeds, but I think they are. They feel kind of squishy, and the scrub feels more like a creamy moisturizing lotion. It does smell like strawberries and makes skin soft. This is a different scrub that feels gentle. I personally prefer one that feels like it's polishing and cleaning more than moisturizing though. This is currently $12.\nReview Title: Gentle exfoliator\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Everyday Beauty Renewal Night Cream Nourishing Facial Moisturizer with Brown Algae Extract, Squalene, Hyaluronic Acid and Glycerin to Moisturize and Protect Skin, Reduce Signs of Aging, 1 oz.

It feels like Vaseline on the skin, which is okay for a sleeping mask. It made me feel like it was  certainly locking in moisture, but the next day, I didn't really notice anything different in my skin. I like sleeping masks but don't expect I would order this again.

The brushes I've been seeing look flimsy and painful with their wire tips. I liked the rubber tips on this so took the chance. It's working great so far. I can tell it doesn't hurt my cat...although she still doesn't love what's happening. It smoothed their hair without pulling it all out. The bristles kept their shape. The button pushed all the hair up, so I could cleanly and easily pull it all off. It's more comfortable to hold, and the cover is actually helpful to keep the bristles clean and protected from being bent. It's a little large for even my large cats but totally doable. It would definitely work for larger dogs as well. The price is reasonable and considering so many other similar brushes received poor reviews, I'm especially happy with this for the price.\nReview Title: Working well\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: LOVE CINEMA Mascara 222\nReview Date: 2022/06/12\nStore: LOVE CINEMA\nAverage Rating: 3.9\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'LOVE CINEMA', 'Item Volume': '0.24 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Information': 'Tube', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Water Resistance Level': 'Waterproof'}\nReview Text: Reviews when I ordered this were raving about it.

I can't say I was especially impressed by this. HOWEVER, I'm getting to the age where I'm starting to notice my makeup can look dry and accentuate lines I didn't even think I had. I'm not wearing much makeup these days, but based on reviews, I got this with the hope it will work for maturing skin. I can see this also washing you out a bit as another reviewer mentioned. It's white, and even though I'm fair, I felt this needed a very light application. The good news is if such a thin dusting can live up to the reviews, it makes the price a little better. I was surprised how low quality the puff felt. It's very thin and almost felt rough.\nReview Title: Maybe better for older skin?\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: EMILIE HEATHE - Lip Atelier Lip Color | Sustainable, Cruelty-Free, Clean Beauty (Public)\nReview Date: 2022/07/09\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Finish Type': 'Shimmery, Natural', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Smoothening,Moisturizing,Clean', 'Material Type Free': 'Paraben Free', 'Coverage': 'Buildable', 'Specialty': 'Cruelty-free,Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '7.2 x 2.13 x 1.5 inches; 1.45 Ounces', 'UPC': '810033380181'}\nReview Text: I have a lot of orange-gold lip colors because I find them very flattering on me, so I was pretty confident I would like this. The color is beautiful and not too orange. While I like the gold too, the specks of glitter are larger and more obvious than I would like. Some gold is really fine and distributes as an even shimmer across your lips. With this, you can see the glitter speck here, the glitter speck there, the glitter speck falling a little outside your lip line that will probably end up somewhere else on your face. It has more of a youthful, party feel. I agree it's a color reminiscent of sunsets, suited for summer and fall. The case is possibly the most sophisticated I own though. It has a nice weight, and the magnetic closure feels good. It came in a box and in a sealed bag. I don't mind wearing this color, but I wouldn't buy it again. I think I like the case the best, but I'm not convinced the color or feel add up to make it worth $38.\nReview Title: Very glittery\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Pineapple Gommage Peeling Gel by Vitamasques - Gentle Botanical Cellulose Exfoliator for Sensitive Skin - De-Clogs Pores & Eliminates Dead Skin - Vegan, Free from Parabens & Gluten\nReview Date: 2022/07/30\nStore: Vitamasques\nAverage Rating: 4.2\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Vitamasques', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Material Feature': 'Cruelty Free, Vegan', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Scent': 'Pineapple', 'Package Dimensions': '4.92 x 2.2 x 1.38 inches; 2.08 Ounces', 'UPC': '750258970371'}\nReview Text: The tube had a foil seal. There is a pineapple scent. You're supposed to massage the gel on dry skin for 2 minutes. As soon as you start, it starts to pill. I feel like most of it immediately dries up and falls off though I'm sure it's grabbing dead skin too. While it's gentle in that it's not using coarse particles, I didn't enjoy the dry rubbing and tugging at my skin. You can only avoid that over 2 minutes by applying a generous amount of gel, but it's a small tube. My skin looked a little brightened afterwards but not as soft and bright as many other exfoliators (scrubs, peels, masks, serums, etc). This is $12.99, which doesn't seem like as great of a value after seeing how much you need to use. I didn't like the application, results, or price enough to reorder this.\nReview Title: Dry rub\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Everyday Beauty Radiance Cleanser, Rejuvenating Antioxidant Gel Cleanser with Rose Hip Seed Oil, Vitamin A, C, and E for All Skin Types to Soothe and Nourish Dry Damaged Skin, 4fl oz.

The sealed tub also had a plastic cover under the the lid and was boxed. The scrub had a little brown in it like what you might see when fruit starts to rot or in yogurt, but it's dated good until 9/14/2023, so I felt okay using it. The red particles made my husband and I realize we didn't confidently know the color of strawberry seeds, but I think they are. They feel kind of squishy, and the scrub feels more like a creamy moisturizing lotion. It does smell like strawberries and makes skin soft. This is a different scrub that feels gentle. I personally prefer one that feels like it's polishing and cleaning more than moisturizing though. This is currently $12.\nReview Title: Gentle exfoliator\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Everyday Beauty Renewal Night Cream Nourishing Facial Moisturizer with Brown Algae Extract, Squalene, Hyaluronic Acid and Glycerin to Moisturize and Protect Skin, Reduce Signs of Aging, 1 oz.

It didn't seem to leave my skin quite as velvety soft or last as many hours, yet the Night Cream is more expensive at $38/1 fl oz. The Mask is $22/1.7 fl oz and can be used overnight as often as needed. I use it as the last step in my skincare routine.

No lingering irritation or redness from the derma roller. I'm not sure if it was this serum alone or how it worked in conjunction with my other skin care products, but my skin felt velvety soft afterwards.

It came in an unsealed box. There's a plastic cover under the lid, but there was a mess of cream all around the rim and threads. Maybe it was used? It smells like lotion and salad dressing. It feels like Vaseline on the skin, which is okay for a sleeping mask. It made me feel like it was  certainly locking in moisture, but the next day, I didn't really notice anything different in my skin. I like sleeping masks but don't expect I would order this again. I definitely find it overpriced ($44) for the packaging, experience, and results - or lack thereof.\nReview Title: Smells like salad dressing and feels like petroleum jelly\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n    Structure your response as:\n   \n    SUMMARY:\n    [Final synthesis of preferences and patterns]",
