It blends easily into the skin, and I did not need to use very much.  I like that you can also use it on your entire face if needed.  I tried that also, and found that while it brightens my face a bit, I do still need to apply a moisturizer over it to get proper hydration for my dry skin.  This serum has a very subtle, barely noticeable scent which is pleasant.<br /><br />Sadly, the pump dispenser on the bottle I received does not work at all. It does turn to lock and unlock, but no matter what I did the pump did not work.  So in order for me to use it I have to unscrew the cap every time, pull the pump tube out, and wipe some product from the pump tube.  This serum is very thick and more like a gel, so it is way too thick to tilt the bottle and expect a drop to come out.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThis individual displays a consistent preference for skincare and personal care products that prioritize natural ingredients. Their purchase history reflects a notable inclination towards moisturizers, serums, and lip products that provide hydration and gentle care for dry or sensitive skin. High ratings, particularly above 4.5, indicate a satisfaction with products that effectively enhance skin texture and appearance, emphasizing moisturizing qualities.\n\nTheme-wise, they gravitate towards multifunctional products, like eye serums that can also be applied to the face, highlighting a tendency for practicality in their skincare routine. Additionally, there is an evident appreciation for subtle, refreshing scents, as noted in their enjoyment of cucumber and coconut aromas.\n\nQuality preferences indicate that this shopper favors products with proven efficacy but remains critical of packaging issues, as seen with the eye serum's pump dispenser. Price sensitivity is less apparent, but the ratings suggest they are willing to invest in higher-quality items, seeking value for performance rather than simply seeking the lowest price.\n\nOverall, the core preferences reveal a consumer dedicated to effective, hydrating solutions for skincare and lip care, with a desire for pleasant sensory experiences and ease of use.",
