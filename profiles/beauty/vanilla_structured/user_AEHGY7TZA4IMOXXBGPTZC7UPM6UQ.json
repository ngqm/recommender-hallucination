It doesn\u2019t provide \u201cintensive plumping\u201d or\u201dimprove skin elasticity\u201d which are just ridiculous claims, particularly when you consider this used for one week and the first two ingredients are water and glycerine. I have pure glycerine and  after mixing it with water in various percentages, I\u2019d be comfortable betting that this product is at least 70% water.<br /><br />I was able to cleanly snap all seven ampoules using the plastic topper provided. Even though my snaps were clean the edges of both pieces are sharp and you shouldn\u2019t touch them. It took me several tries to figure out how to get all the serum out of the ampoules. For three days I was tapping the opening on my palm which didn\u2019t feel great, but I just couldn\u2019t get it to pour out cleanly.<br /><br />Although it is almost as liquid as water, if you get the opening of the ampoules covered with the liquid it won\u2019t come out because of surface tension. If this happens just turn the bottle open side up and blow on the liquid until the opening is clear and you\u2019re good to go.<br /><br />If you can tilt the bottle just right you can get the serum to pour out. It\u2019s tricky, but spend the time doing it that way and you\u2019ll save yourself a lot of frustration. You see me getting it right in the video, but even then I had to blow the ampoule open once.<br /><br />There is also the cost. $50.00 for one week of use. That\u2019s about $200 a month and $1250 a year although it does specify that you should use this daily for six weeks, maximum. Why? Is that concerning to anyone else?

The sheet masks never get right under my eyes or lips so the ones this kit supplies that target those areas are perfect! they supply are great! I\u2019m still getting used to wearing the lip one because I\u2019d never used one before, but there not uncomfortable and they do leave my lips feeling softer. I love that the foot ones aren\u2019t exfoliating, just pure moisture. I put them on and cover them with socks, then inevitably fall asleep wearing them.

It would be easy to split them in half before mixing and get eight masks out of this instead of four. You could also apply it to your face and neck and still have enough!<br /><br />I stirred it thoroughly with the wooden spreader included, and it got more and more gummy as I stirred. I chose to apply it with a silicone spatula tool I have for the purpose and it was\u2026messy! If you put it on too early or too thickly all in one go, it drips down your face and looks like your skin is melting (according to my spouse.) You can apply it in thinner layers, but you don\u2019t want to go too slowly either because it\u2019ll turn gummy and unspreadable. I found this to be entertaining rather than problematic. I accidentally got it on my lips so I just went with it and sealed my mouth shut.

I came to this conclusion when I tried to remove the nails. Non MMA monomer nails come off easily after soaking in acetone. You need to file the surface, then soak them for 10-20 minutes. You then scrape it off and it comes off in flakes and bits and pieces. You may need to do this more than once. With MMA, you use the same process, but once you start scraping it is a sticky, messy process and as soon as the nail is out of the acetone, it immediately starts to solidify so you really have to do it over and over again, or do the scraping while the nails are in the acetone.<br /><br />This monomer works well, doesn\u2019t cause my white to yellow at all, but it reeks! Just opening the box I was overwhelmed by the smell. It only got worse once I opened it.

It would be easy to split them in half before mixing and get eight masks out of this instead of four. You could also apply it to your face and neck and still have enough!<br /><br />I stirred it thoroughly with the wooden spreader included, and it got more and more gummy as I stirred. I chose to apply it with a silicone spatula tool I have for the purpose and it was\u2026messy! If you put it on too early or too thickly all in one go, it drips down your face and looks like your skin is melting (according to my spouse.) You can apply it in thinner layers, but you don\u2019t want to go too slowly either because it\u2019ll turn gummy and unspreadable. I found this to be entertaining rather than problematic. I accidentally got it on my lips so I just went with it and sealed my mouth shut. Blessed silence for half an hour!<br /><br />After peeling it off (which was also totally fun and kind of gross) my skin felt softer than before I used it and I\u2019d thoroughly enjoyed 45 minutes of my life.

I came to this conclusion when I tried to remove the nails. Non MMA monomer nails come off easily after soaking in acetone. You need to file the surface, then soak them for 10-20 minutes. You then scrape it off and it comes off in flakes and bits and pieces. You may need to do this more than once. With MMA, you use the same process, but once you start scraping it is a sticky, messy process and as soon as the nail is out of the acetone, it immediately starts to solidify so you really have to do it over and over again, or do the scraping while the nails are in the acetone.<br /><br />This monomer works well, doesn\u2019t cause my white to yellow at all, but it reeks! Just opening the box I was overwhelmed by the smell. It only got worse once I opened it. After using it for a while I went nose blind, which happens with all sorts of smells, but when my husband got home from work he told me to go outside to use it, lol!\nUPDATE!

It doesn\u2019t provide \u201cintensive plumping\u201d or\u201dimprove skin elasticity\u201d which are just ridiculous claims, particularly when you consider this used for one week and the first two ingredients are water and glycerine. I have pure glycerine and  after mixing it with water in various percentages, I\u2019d be comfortable betting that this product is at least 70% water.<br /><br />I was able to cleanly snap all seven ampoules using the plastic topper provided. Even though my snaps were clean the edges of both pieces are sharp and you shouldn\u2019t touch them. It took me several tries to figure out how to get all the serum out of the ampoules. For three days I was tapping the opening on my palm which didn\u2019t feel great, but I just couldn\u2019t get it to pour out cleanly.<br /><br />Although it is almost as liquid as water, if you get the opening of the ampoules covered with the liquid it won\u2019t come out because of surface tension. If this happens just turn the bottle open side up and blow on the liquid until the opening is clear and you\u2019re good to go.<br /><br />If you can tilt the bottle just right you can get the serum to pour out. It\u2019s tricky, but spend the time doing it that way and you\u2019ll save yourself a lot of frustration. You see me getting it right in the video, but even then I had to blow the ampoule open once.<br /><br />There is also the cost. $50.00 for one week of use. That\u2019s about $200 a month and $1250 a year although it does specify that you should use this daily for six weeks, maximum. Why? Is that concerning to anyone else?

They did leave my skin feeling softer for a while after using them, and that\u2019s pretty much what I expect from these so I\u2019m happy.<br /><br />I have to say that thinking that they\u2019re going to so something special for your skin because they\u2019re gold colored is ridiculous.\nReview Title: My skin did feel softer for a while after using them, and they are $1.00 a pair right now.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: ANGNYA Acrylic Nail Art Brush Kolinsky Sable Hair Brush For Acrylic Application With Black Marble Acrylic Handle Professional Manicure Pedicure for DIY Home Salon(size8)\nReview Date: 2021/05/30\nStore: ANGNYA\nAverage Rating: 3.6\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'ANGNYA', 'Handle Material': 'Acrylic', 'Head Material': 'Kolinsky', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Shape': 'Oval', 'Package Dimensions': '8.46 x 3.82 x 0.55 inches; 0.63 Ounces'}\nReview Text: [[VIDEOID:b1af0a4132e86e40bd26b1a1ed9da1b0]] This is a very nice brush for acrylic nails and not bad for watercolors either!<br /><br />I really like this brush. From the very start all I\u2019ve seen is quality. There have been no loose bristles, it holds the amount of liquid I would expect from a brush this size, and will come to a point when wet. I am really surprised that it\u2019s so inexpensive. I think the low cost will show in quality over time...I just don\u2019t expect it to hold up as well as some of my more expensive brushes.

It would be easy to split them in half before mixing and get eight masks out of this instead of four. You could also apply it to your face and neck and still have enough!<br /><br />I stirred it thoroughly with the wooden spreader included, and it got more and more gummy as I stirred. I chose to apply it with a silicone spatula tool I have for the purpose and it was\u2026messy! If you put it on too early or too thickly all in one go, it drips down your face and looks like your skin is melting (according to my spouse.) You can apply it in thinner layers, but you don\u2019t want to go too slowly either because it\u2019ll turn gummy and unspreadable. I found this to be entertaining rather than problematic. I accidentally got it on my lips so I just went with it and sealed my mouth shut. Blessed silence for half an hour!<br /><br />After peeling it off (which was also totally fun and kind of gross) my skin felt softer than before I used it and I\u2019d thoroughly enjoyed 45 minutes of my life. YES!

I came to this conclusion when I tried to remove the nails. Non MMA monomer nails come off easily after soaking in acetone. You need to file the surface, then soak them for 10-20 minutes. You then scrape it off and it comes off in flakes and bits and pieces. You may need to do this more than once. With MMA, you use the same process, but once you start scraping it is a sticky, messy process and as soon as the nail is out of the acetone, it immediately starts to solidify so you really have to do it over and over again, or do the scraping while the nails are in the acetone.<br /><br />This monomer works well, doesn\u2019t cause my white to yellow at all, but it reeks! Just opening the box I was overwhelmed by the smell. It only got worse once I opened it. After using it for a while I went nose blind, which happens with all sorts of smells, but when my husband got home from work he told me to go outside to use it, lol!\nReview Title: UPDATE!

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe individual displays a preference for skincare and beauty products, particularly those focused on hydration and moisturizing benefits, as evidenced by multiple purchases of facial masks and treatments. Their sentiment towards these products varies, with high ratings for effective, enjoyable items, whereas poorly performing products receive low ratings, highlighting sensitivity to efficacy and results.\n\nThey consistently prefer products that are affordable and suitable for regular use, indicating price sensitivity and a desire for value. The need for quality is reflected in their ratings, as products that fall short of expectations, both in performance and results, receive negative feedback. Notably, products claiming luxurious or advanced benefits often receive skepticism, especially regarding their formulation and ingredients.\n\nThere is also a recurring interest in self-care routines, as seen in their engagement with spa-like experiences at home, alongside a mix of pragmatic choices like extracting value from tools and equipment, such as nail care items and pet grooming supplies.\n\nOverall, core preferences include a focus on efficiency, affordability, enjoyment in beauty routines, quality, and skepticism regarding price versus perceived value. Their feedback suggests a keen interest in finding effective products that fit into an enjoyable self-care regimen without overspending.",
