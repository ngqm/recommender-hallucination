  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe individual's purchase history reveals a strong preference for high-quality, natural human hair extensions, predominantly Brazilian and Malaysian varieties. Consistent ratings indicate a fluctuating sentiment, with peak satisfaction reflected in a 5.0 rating for a full and thick product, whereas lower satisfaction arises from tangling and poor quality closures in other purchases. \n\nCommon themes emerge around the desired hair styles\u2014wavy, straight, and loose deep curls. However, the quality of closures remains a significant concern, as highlighted by multiple negative reviews regarding their attributes, such as pre-plucking and color consistency. Price sensitivity is implied but varies, with positive purchasing experiences linked to moderately priced products from reputable vendors.\n\nRecurring preferences emphasize the buyer's inclination towards fuller, thicker hair and a keen eye for reliable product sources. They exhibit a critical stance on quality, especially regarding the texture and longevity of the hair, indicating that their loyalty likely lies with brands ensuring consistent standards. Consequently, the core preference centers around high-quality hair extensions that maintain aesthetic appeal over time, coupled with functional closures that meet aesthetic and practical needs.",
