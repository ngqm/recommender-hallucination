This product is just as effective as traditional nail polish removers, but without the toxic smell.

MY face felt very refreshed after using the product and this product left my skin feeling clean and hydrated. I am very impressed with the fact that this face wash did not irritate the skin in anyway. Many over the counter fast wash have harmful chemicals that not only dry the skin out, but irritate the skin and rob the skin of essential natural oils. My daughter has used this product several times now and she loves it. Although marketed to male teens girls also find the name of the product appealing and the design unique.

This is an excellent shampoo that should be utilized to repair damaged hair by replacing essential oils due to over washing of the air. Over washing of the hair happens to many of us, especially if we work outside or use the gym frequently. What we do not realize is that we are stripping our hair of the natural oils we need to keep out hair healthy, bouncy and naturally shiny. I have used this product for a month and I have seen a major improvement in how my hair looks and the ease of styling it.
