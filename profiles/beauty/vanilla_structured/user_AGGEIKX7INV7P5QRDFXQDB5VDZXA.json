  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:  \nThe individual demonstrates a strong preference for high-quality synthetic wigs, particularly favoring natural-looking textures and colors that lean towards blonde and brown shades. Key patterns indicate a distinct appreciation for vibrant color options but a tendency towards disappointment when products fail to meet these expectations; reviews often reflect frustration with color inconsistencies and quality changes over time. There is a clear enjoyment of wavy styles and curls, contrasting with a lesser appreciation for straight wigs, which are frequently criticized for lackluster color options.\n\nPrice sensitivity is notable, as the consumer frequently praises affordability, suggesting a strong desire for value without sacrificing aesthetics or comfort. This is supported by positive commentary on wigs that deliver good quality at low prices. \n\nLastly, reviews often emphasize wearability and comfort, indicating that prolonged use is important. The customer is dissatisfied with wigs that tangle or shed excessively but appreciates products that maintain their form and style over time. Overall, the core preferences highlight a focus on color vibrancy, natural appearance, competitive pricing, and reliability in product quality.",

Many browns in wigs are either too dark or greenish tint or zero Dimension and come off as \u201c wiggy\u201d Not this one! It\u2019s a gorgeous color: a lighter auburn brown but not too red( important to me) The hairline must be the best for a straight front lace wig. Truly a cinch to make look believable right out of the box. It doesn\u2019t require glue at all and is very comfortable to your head and is the right size. Hair quality is supreme, soft, doesn\u2019t tangle easily. I am trying out more of this brsnd\u2019s wigs as I\u2019ve been impressed so far!",
