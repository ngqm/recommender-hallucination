Despite recognizing some stiffness or costs, they still value overall effectiveness.\n\nThis person tends to choose items with functional and aesthetic appeal, suggesting a balanced approach to beauty routines that prioritize both efficiency and experience. Their purchasing behavior reflects a commitment to products that provide both practicality in daily life and a small luxury in self-care practices.",
