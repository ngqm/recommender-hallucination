  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe purchasing behavior reveals a consistent pattern of dissatisfaction with hair products, especially wigs and hair extensions, indicating a strong preference for quality and appearance. Ratings across multiple interactions are often low, particularly for items that are either described as lacking volume (\"thin\" or \"sparse\") or not meeting expectations in terms of color and texture (\"brassy\" or \"course\"). The consumer displays frustration with products not living up to their convenience or aesthetic promises, as evidenced by comments about inadequate amounts of hair and poor quality after minimal use.\n\nThe recurring themes suggest a strong focus on hair beauty enhancements, yet poor execution leads to negative sentiments. The individual appears willing to experiment with products, but consistent disappointments point to a desire for higher-quality materials and more realistic portrayals in advertising. Price sensitivity is indicated as failures in performance (even at lower price points) lead to returns and lack of repeat purchases. Overall, the core preferences center around high-quality hair products that deliver on their promises, fit well, and maintain their integrity over time, reflecting a need for reliability rather than just novelty in beauty enhancements.",
