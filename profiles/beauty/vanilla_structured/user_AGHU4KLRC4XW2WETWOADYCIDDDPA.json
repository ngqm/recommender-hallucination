  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe analyzed purchase history reveals an individual focused on natural and effective skincare and haircare products, showing a clear preference for items containing beneficial ingredients like Vitamin C and essential oils. Ratings indicate a tendency toward moderate satisfaction, often highlighting the importance of natural formulations, particularly for sensitive skin. Products aimed at enhancing moisture and addressing dryness are favored, with a consistent sentiment of seeking visible results over time.\n\nThemes around product purpose suggest a strong inclination towards cosmetic and wellness solutions that improve appearance and health, particularly in relation to skin texture and hair condition. The individual seems to appreciate versatility in products, as evidenced by the multiple uses of items like coconut oil.\n\nQuality is a recurring theme, with a preference for high-quality, effective products; however, the sentiment indicates some disappointment when results are not immediately apparent, particularly in skin enhancement products. Price sensitivity appears to lean towards seeking value in discounts and perceived performance.\n\nOverall, the core preferences indicate a health-conscious consumer who prioritizes natural ingredients, quality, and multi-functionality while exhibiting a moderate level of patience for results, reflective of their approach to personal care and self-improvement.",
