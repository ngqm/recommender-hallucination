I will also mention that when I made my purchase, it was sold as one cover for $8.50. It is a very long lasting cover! Not only did it survive 7 months of use in school, it has been part of my cover collection used for almost 2 years in my practice. It has been laundered and has held up beautifully - no rips, tears, fading or loss of softness. I am considering purchasing more now as my clientele has grown. With the current offer of $32 for a pack of 6, that makes each cover only a little over $5 each.

There was NO scent (THANK YOU!), my sensitive skin had no negative reactions at all and I was pleased with the thickness. It didn't completely absorb into my skin.. I had a few pieces of pillow lint (flannel sheets) stuck to my cheeks the next morning. I can't say how well it works long term yet, but I have high hopes as my skin was more supple the next am.

My cuticles (both on my feet and hands) are always dry and cracked and this oil really helped them not only look better but feel so much better! I appreciated the easy roll-on applicator too. The body lotion is a decent lotion. I wouldn't say it is earth-shattering or mind-blowing.. but it does smell really good and the scent isn't too overwhelming or powerful. My grandma is sensitive to powerful scents and she didn't turn her nose up at it so there's that. It is a decent thickness (not too runny or too thick), it absorbed relatively quickly and it makes my skin feel soft. The packaging is over the top, in a bad way. As a eco-minded person, the amount of packaging used was just ridiculous and unnecessary, IMO. My experience doesn't justify the price.. for the amounts you get and the average results are not equal to the price paid.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe analysis of this purchase history reveals a consumer with a strong preference for practicality, durability, and effectiveness in personal care and beauty products. The individual repeatedly prioritizes products that cater to sensitive skin and dry conditions, indicating an inclination towards items designed for moisture retention and repair. This is evident from the consistent selection of hydrating and moisturizing solutions in their skincare routine.\n\nThe consumer demonstrates a critical approach towards product packaging and pricing, often expressing concerns about excessive packaging and perceived value versus price. Despite a willingness to invest in products that deliver long-term benefits, they remain hesitant when initial experiences do not meet expectations, as shown by the varied ratings.\n\nQuality is paramount, with a notable bias towards high-rated items, especially those with good customer feedback regarding ease of use and effectiveness. However, dissatisfaction arises with products that fail to perform as expected, particularly when they are overpriced or inadequately designed for thicker hair.\n\nOverall, this individual values high-quality, considerate design, and reliable performance in beauty and personal care products while maintaining sensitivity to pricing and packaging choices.",
