I happened to look over and see my Dermabraze MD unit on my vanity and thought, I wonder if their company makes other products? So when I Google'd the company one of the first things I saw was a &#34;Fakespot&#34; link, and having only ever seen products with an F rating I thought I'd check this one because I expected it to have rave reviews like mine. I was FLOORED when I saw the grade F! That simply cannot be accurate! I purchased mine in November of 2016, and nearly 6 months later I still regard it as the best money I've ever spent on skincare, PERIOD. I used it on my full face just last night! It gets a regular workout too, between myself, my mother and my daughter. Even my son has used it! I just had to come update my review when I saw that deceitful grade but in a way I'm thankful because I know now that Fakespot can't be trusted. I KNOW THIS DEVICE WORKS AND WORKS FANTASTICALLY!<br /><br />I'm fortunate to have had a great example when I was a child. My mother always took very good care of her skin. Until I reached my teen years I literally believed that all women used peel off masks, apricot scrub, Noxema and Oil of Olay, lol. Skin care has come a long way, and when I started working in the beauty industry I was introduced to higher quality products and left my mother's favorites in the dust, haha. As far as exfoliating, before trying this machine I'd always stuck with scrubs, chemical exfoliants and microdermabrasion crystal creams. Now I feel like a need a good kick in the rear for not investing in real microdermabrasion years ago! I absolutely love this machine ... it is an investment, but the effectiveness and sheer convenience of it make it more than worth the money. You just can't get results like this with any other method. My favorite thing about it is the suction. Sure, you can use products to manually exfoliate skin, but vacuuming the oil and dead cells that collect inside and clog pores combined with abrasion literally and immediately take years off the skin's appearance. It also allows the high dollar serums and moisturizers we apply to do a much better job. Again, to me this totally justifies the investment. If you're serious about skin care and spend good money on expensive products, you owe it to yourself to prep your skin so your products can do their jobs!<br /><br />Pros of the Bright Therapy unit:<br /><br />Rechargeable<br />Strong, adjustable suction<br />Different attachments for heavy, light and acute abrasion.<br />Comfortable to hold, fit's easily in the hand<br />Has disposable filters allowing you to see exactly what the machine removes every time you use it.<br /><br />If you're looking for a great quality microdermabrasion system I think you'll be pleased with this one, I can't find a single con to owning it.
