Hair gets down the top of it and they're just as itchy as if they weren't wearing anything.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:  \nThe analyzed purchase history reveals a consumer primarily focused on home grooming and personal care, exhibiting a mix of parental practicality and a desire for effective, functional products. Consistent low ratings (2.0 - 2.5) for hair removal strips and a hair cutting cape indicate a strong sentiment towards ineffective products that do not meet expectations for their stated purposes, reflecting a clear preference for efficiency and satisfaction in at-home grooming tools. However, positive ratings (4.3 - 4.5) for items like a durable glass spray bottle and a soothing aloe vera gel highlight an appreciation for quality and reliability, particularly in household and skincare products. \n\nThe recurring themes involve products meant for personal grooming and home maintenance. Additionally, the consumer shows a sensitivity to cost-effectiveness, leaning toward functional items that justify their prices through performance. Quality is clearly valued, as evidenced by their willingness to extensively trial different products and satisfaction with those that perform reliably. Overall, the core preferences suggest a need for effective, durable, and easy-to-use products that comply with the demands of managing both personal care and family life.",

    "text": "Around 6 months ago, we adopted our first goldendoodle. I had heard that their fur was higher maintenance so I researched what we would need to best take care of him. I ended up ordering a big slicker style brush and this one. When we first got him, his fur was badly matted and he wasn't used to being brushed at all. We slowly got him used to being brushed and now we regularly use the slicker brush on him. This brush however, really pulls at his fur. I might have been tempted to think that it was just not the right brush for his fur, but on a recent attempt to trim his fur myself (rather than take him to the groomers) I found that I really needed this brush to get his curls combed out enough for the clippers to easily get through. It is incredibly slow going to even get through a small patch of his fur using this, let alone his entire body (he's medium/large). I'm thinking that we may just need to stick to the professional groomer for most haircuts and I'll just stick to the in-between appointment trims. So maybe it's me or maybe it's this comb or? The other issue I have with this comb is that the actual comb part comes apart from the wood handle. It's not ideal, but it does go back together and it's able to be used, so...?",
