It comes with a top portion and a bottom portion...which didn't stay in place on my face very well...and was just too much packaging for a face mask.  This is also different in that it is an actual cream, rather than the clear gel type or watery type mask.  I did like the cream ok, but I use these masks when I am bathing, and the 2 part design just does not stay in place properly and drove me crazy.\nReview Title: This is a 2 part mask\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Shakira Perfumes - Dance for Women - Long Lasting - Femenine, Charming and Modern Perfume - Fruity Floral Notes - Ideal for Day Wear - 1.7 Fl Oz\nReview Date: 2020/08/04\nStore: Shakira\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Shakira', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Item Volume': '50 Milliliters', 'Scent': 'Dance', 'Special Feature': 'Long Lasting', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Language': 'English', 'Product Dimensions': '2.64 x 2.05 x 5.63 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'Item model number': '8411061823033'}\nReview Text: ***Edited to add that this kept reminding me of something else I'd worn and now I'm thinking it is very similar to BBW Into the Night.***.  I was very pleasantly surprised by this scent....I like dark orientals and even though this is listed as floral gourmand, it fits the bill as a dark oriental for me.  I definitely get the base notes of vanilla, cocoa, tonka and benzoin....it is very reminiscent of a scent I used to wear a long time ago, but can't quite place it?  Maybe Euphoria?  Not sure, but this is a really nice rich dark scent that is heavier on the gourmand side than floral.  This is for sure a date night scent.\nReview Title: A Rich Gourmand\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Bath Bombs, SAZEN Bath Bomb with Natural & Organic Essential Oils, Shea Coconut Butter for Skin Moisturize, Bubble Spa Bath, Birthday Mothers Day Christmas Handmade Gift Set for Women Kids Her Him\nReview Date: 2020/08/22\nStore: SAZEN\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'SAZEN', 'Scent': 'Coconut', 'Material Feature': 'Organic Ingredients', 'Unit Count': '24.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '24', 'Package Dimensions': '12.17 x 6.26 x 2.24 inches; 2.65 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'SAZEN 01', 'UPC': '745103723622', 'Manufacturer': 'SAZEN'}\nReview Text: These are a good set of bath bombs....that do add oils and scent to my bath.  I like the selection of scents in this set and the fizz is pretty good.  I did take off one star due to size as these are on the small to medium in size and I have a very large tub, so I need to use 2 of these to get enough moisturizing product in my tub.\nReview Title: Nice set of bath bombs\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: invisibobble Sprunchie Spiral Hair Ring - True Black - Scrunchie Stylish Bracelet, Strong Elastic Grip Coil Accessories for Women - Gentle for Girls Teens and Thick Hair\nReview Date: 2020/12/10\nStore: invisibobble\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Item Form': 'Scrunchie', 'Brand': 'invisibobble', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Item Weight': '2 Grams', 'Number of Pieces': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '2.83 x 2.8 x 0.87 inches; 0.07 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'IB-SP-HP10001'}\nReview Text: I didn't even know that Invisibobble made this combo hair scrunchie with the coil inside.  I think it is great.  Holds well and looks nice with the velour type fabric.  The only thing is this size might not work well for someone with really thick hair?  Not sure, but my hair is pretty fine and this only wrapped around it 3 times.  So for someone with thick hair it might not work?  This scrunchie really holds well...I wear it all day and overnight and it doesn't budge and feels very comfortable,  not too tight.\nReview Title: Nice combo!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Claireceuticals Sweet Almond Oil for Hair, Face & Skin - Organic Almond Oil for Skin - Pure Almond Oil Moisturizer for Dry Skin - Facial Moisturizer for Women - Ideal Dandruff Remover - 1.69 Fl Oz\nReview Date: 2021/06/19\nStore: CLAIRECEUTICALS\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'CLAIRECEUTICALS', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Unit Count': '1.7 Fl Oz', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Item Volume': '100 Milliliters'}\nReview Text: I like it to use on my hair (just a couple of drops) keeps ends looking nice....and also my skin.

I am very lazy when it comes to doing my nails and this is the perfect product for me.  It is fast and easy...don't have to worry about waiting for polish to dry, which is a pet peeve of mine.  These looked pretty nice and lasted a little better than polish for me, but not as long as I'd hoped and for that I did take off.  But for quick and easy, these do the trick!  I did notice that the photo shows them sparkly and mine were not?  These lasted about 4-5 days, but I am also in water a lot and pretty rough on my nails.\nReview Title: Nice and quick\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: HOMOST Starry Magnetic Cat Eye Gel Nail Polish Set, 6PCS Galactic Auroras Chameleon Gel Nail Polish Kit With Magnet\nReview Date: 2021/09/07\nStore: Homost\nAverage Rating: 3.7\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Homost', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Color': 'Black', 'Type': 'gel', 'Finish Type': 'Glossy', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Natural', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Number of Items': '6', 'Package Dimensions': '7.48 x 3.23 x 1.18 inches; 6.7 Ounces'}\nReview Text: Soo easy to use and so pretty!!
