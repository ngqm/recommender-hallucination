The instructions say to use a piece size amount. I didn\u2019t read that at first and applied too much making the smell over powering. If you use the appropriate amount, the smell is not too strong. It helps keep you fresh smelling all day! Keep in mind this does not have anti-perspirant in it so it will allow you to sweat. However, it should help prevent odor. I like the fact that this is aluminum free, paraben free, toxin free and petroleum free. it is also free of imitation perfumes.<br /><br />So far, I like using this product but need to put it to a test on a hot humid day while exercising! If that does the trick, I will update my review to five stars. The weather in my area is very stormy, so I am unable to give this a full testing!

It\u2019s giftable and is believed that the microneedling treatment and pink jade roller is supposed to stimulate collagen. I\u2019ve only used both for a few days so I can\u2019t say effective this product will be, but I\u2019m willing to give it a try. The jade roller is great to use when applying your favorite face serum. It glides and rolls smoothly. The microneedling treatment is not too painful when you simply apply a little bit of pressure. It did not cause bleeding because I used it gently as directed. You do need to be sure to only use it on clean skin and wash it after each use.

The mascara is not a super \u201cwet\u201d formula - its a bit on the dry side which has its pros and cons. Pros: Will not weigh fine/thin lashes down or flatten them like some super wet mascaras will do. It is also buildable. Cons:  If takes multiple applications to add real volume and thickness to your lashes.<br /><br />This mascara did not cause any irritation or sensitivity and it stayed put all day long (even when sweating). It\u2019s also easy to remove with a waterproof eye makeup remover.<br /><br />I didn\u2019t notice this mascara helping curl my lashes. I still had to use an eyelash curler to give my lashes curl.<br /><br />Overall, this is a pretty good mascara.

The formula advertises to be sweat proof/waterproof, but that is definitely not the case. I wore this and sweated when I wrote my initial review, but after getting wet in the rain, this product seemed to disappear (my reason for removing a star). It has a natural look to it with a 4-fork tip head that lets you create more realistic looking brows. This gets 3 stars for its wearability and durability and application. The formula goes on quite dry so you really have to work in applying yet so it looks even on both brows. However, I like the color and the fork applicator.

It helps keep you fresh smelling all day! Keep in mind this does not have anti-perspirant in it so it will allow you to sweat. However, it should help prevent odor. I like the fact that this is aluminum free, paraben free, toxin free and petroleum free. it is also free of imitation perfumes.<br /><br />So far, I like using this product but need to put it to a test on a hot humid day while exercising! If that does the trick, I will update my review to five stars. The weather in my area is very stormy, so I am unable to give this a full testing!

The jade roller is great to use when applying your favorite face serum. It glides and rolls smoothly. The microneedling treatment is not too painful when you simply apply a little bit of pressure. It did not cause bleeding because I used it gently as directed. You do need to be sure to only use it on clean skin and wash it after each use.

The individual favors products that enhance appearance while being non-irritating and moisturizing. Consistently positive ratings accompany items like hairbrushes, skincare serums, and hand sanitizers, suggesting an appreciation for effectiveness and ease of use. Notable dissatisfaction with anti-aging products and brow pens points to a heightened sensitivity to quality and performance, especially for mature or sensitive skin.\n\nCommon themes include an inclination towards natural ingredients and features that promote skin health, reflected in purchases of body bronzers, moisturizers, and natural deodorants. Price sensitivity is evident, particularly with items perceived as over-priced relative to their effectiveness, as seen with the Cica cream and eyebrow pen. \n\nOverall, the individual exhibits a preference for products that deliver reliable, practical results while aligning with a health-conscious and natural approach to beauty.
