  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe purchase history reveals a consumer with a strong preference for human hair wigs, particularly enjoying various styles and textures such as curly and wavy, while expressing disappointment with construction quality. Ratings indicate a notable contrast in sentiment: high ratings (5.0) for certain styles with quality curl patterns versus significantly low ratings (1.0) for poorly constructed wigs. Clearly, this individual values aesthetic appeal and workable designs but is increasingly critical of product integrity, resulting in a pattern of returning items that do not meet expectations.\n\nIn terms of themes, the emphasis is largely on wigs as a primary use case, reflecting a focus on personal grooming and style enhancement. Price sensitivity is evident; while there is a willingness to invest in premium grades of hair, dissatisfaction arises when the quality does not align with costs, as seen in two low-rated purchases from the same brand. This highlights a buyer who is discerning and expects value for money.\n\nFinally, the customer seems to appreciate additional beauty products, such as faux mink eyelashes, with a distinct preference for dramatic looks that yield favorable ratings. Overall, their core preferences lean towards high-quality, aesthetically pleasing hair products paired with a cautious approach to brand loyalty given previous negative experiences.",
