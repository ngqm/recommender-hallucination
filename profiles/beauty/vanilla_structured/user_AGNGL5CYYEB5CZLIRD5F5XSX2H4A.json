It performs like a very expensive mascara at a drugstore price. No smudging, flaking or clumping. Washes off with pure water and a bit of rubbing. Add some cleanser and it's effortless to remove. I can fall asleep with it on and no black eyes in the morning, just a few flakes from sleeping. It offers full volume and lengthens well. If you use a curler, you can get a very dramatic effect. It's buildable for more false eyelash looks without being clumpy. The wand is not straight. It is like a smiley face curve. But with a twist of the end, it curves into a \"u\" shape to get different angles. I would love this even with a normal straight brush.<br />The only complaint is that it dries out faster than others I've used, but is about the same as tarte waterproof in this regard. My favorite mascara so far! I will be ordering extras in case it's discontinued.\nReview Title: Yes To This One\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: MOSTORY Cloud Volume Lash Mascara Black - Lash Mascara Black Volume Length Smudgeproof Curl Eyelash Lifted Thick Long Lasting Volumious 4D Silk No Flicks No Clumps Bristle Brush (0.3 oz)\nReview Date: 2020/09/20\nStore: MOSTORY\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Product Benefits': 'Long Lasting, Curling', 'Special Feature': 'Smudge Proof', 'Brand': 'MOSTORY', 'Item Form': 'OIL', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '4.96 x 1.1 x 1.06 inches; 1.45 Ounces'}\nReview Text: Did not like. It added thickness and darkened my lashes. But it was really clumpy. It went on like a mousse, kind of fluffy. I think thats what made it clump. It also clumped the lashes together besides leaving balls of mascara clumps on the lashes. I hoped for better based on the reviews, but it didn't go on nicely at all. It was sweatproof, yet it did smear over night just a bit. Honestly, it looked exactly the same in the morning as it did when I first applied it, besides the slight smudge under one eye. So I have to say, that's pretty bad to look like you slept in your mascara when it's been freshly applied.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe analysis reveals a clear preference for effective and user-friendly makeup tools, particularly mascara. The individual exhibits a pattern of seeking products that enhance lash appearance through curling and volumizing effects, with a notable focus on waterproof features. Ratings indicate a significant appreciation for products that provide dramatic results, particularly those that lengthen without clumping, as seen in high ratings for some mascara purchases.\n\nConsistent complaints about clumping, chemical smells, and difficulty in removal suggest a low tolerance for mascara that performs poorly in these areas. This user values products that offer performance comparable to high-end options but at a reasonable price, showcasing sensitivity to value for money. The inclination towards special occasion use rather than daily application signals a preference for versatility in makeup tools, favoring products that can achieve professional looks with ease.\n\nOverall, the core preferences reflect a desire for efficacy, ease of use, and reliability in performance, steering clear of products that do not uphold these standards, while also demonstrating a cautionary approach to trying new items influenced by prior experiences.",
