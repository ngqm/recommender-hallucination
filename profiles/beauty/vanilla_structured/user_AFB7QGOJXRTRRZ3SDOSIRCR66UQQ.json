I liked that there was a lot of serum in the small bottle (other serums I've tried always seems like there's not much serum in the bottle), however, a lot of serum gets wasted on the wand because the bottle hole doesn't help to keep any excess inside (see my video for better explanation). still, the bottom line is that this didn't work for me.\nReview Title: no improvement for me\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: NVTED 2 PCS Pet Bath Brush, 2 in 1 Dog Cat Double-Sided Massage Grooming Sponge Bath Shampoo Brushes Soft Silicone Bristles Give Pet Gentle Massage\nReview Date: 2021/08/09\nStore: NVTED\nAverage Rating: 3.9\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'NVTED', 'Shape': 'Oblong', 'Bristle Material': 'Silicone', 'Unit Count': '2.00 Count', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '8.58 x 6.97 x 2.36 inches; 6.38 Ounces', 'UPC': '711796999392'}\nReview Text: we use both brushes to bathe two different breeds, one on a maltese/shitzu and the other on a short haired terrier mix. they both work great and help with the scrubbing. much more effective than just using your hands. the silicone is soft and not rough on their skin. seems very durable and i expect it will last a long time. easy to hold.\nReview Title: great brushes for dog bath\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: COLORGRAM Artist Formula Auto Brow Pencil 0.25g- True Beauty K-Drama Makeup, Built-in-Spoolie, Clump-Free Formula, Softly Glides, Natural Look (05 Gray Brown)\nReview Date: 2021/09/25\nStore: COLORGRAM\nAverage Rating: 3.7\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'COLORGRAM', 'Item Form': 'Pencil', 'Finish Type': 'Natural', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Product Benefits': 'Softening'}\nReview Text: i have very dark brows, but black colored pencils just looks too harsh on me. this gray brown color is a perfect match, to fill in the sparse areas of my brows.  the pencil shape is not a pointy tip, so it\u2019s not really for precision penciling, but more for \u201cfilling in\u201d.  i prefer a natural look, so this works great for my needs.  it\u2019s a twist pencil (no sharpening), and you get about 1\u201d of pencil in the tube.\nReview Title: perfect color match; natural looking\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: ROSEGEMM Birthday Gifts For Women- Your Best Friend, Sister, Mom, Wife, Or Any Female!

Not sure if all the items are worth $49, but again, if you need it quick and don't want to put much thought into a personal gift, then this is for you. the rose gold necklace is pretty, and I like that the tumbler is blank with no branding or decorations on it. the bath bombs are mediocre and the candle and body scrub have a light vanilla scent to them. the gift box itself is nice and well packaged. definitely giftable.\nReview Title: nice gift set with various items\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n    Structure your response as:\n   \n    SUMMARY:\n    [Final synthesis of preferences and patterns]",
