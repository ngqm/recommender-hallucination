    "text": "Slot of these Chinese machines are made in one factory & distributed to numerous Chinese tattoo companies. You don't need to look around for long to see, but I'll give an example with this machine here. If you check, Hawink & Dragonhawk also have this SAME machine. They all just change the outer appearance, but the inside is EXACTLY the same. So if you're on a budget, your best bet is the Dragonhawk Mast Sai. Same machine for under eighty bucks. Just got one myself & it runs like a champ. So they're ALL good machines. You can just find the same thing way cheaper if you shop around here on Amazon. Sorry Mummy, but if Mast can sell theirs for cheaper & still make profits, so can you.",
