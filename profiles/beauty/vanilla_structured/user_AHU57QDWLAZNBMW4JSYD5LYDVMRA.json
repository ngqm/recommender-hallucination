Okay so where do I start? I will be honest, I am a human hair wig girl normally. I haven\u2019t worn a synthetic in years. That being said, trying new styles with expensive hair is hard because who wants to spend so much money just to see the hairstyle doesn\u2019t look as good as they hoped? That\u2019s why I tried this hair, it\u2019s beautiful and affordable. I still had my concerns with it though. When I got it however, all those concerns went away. Not only is this hair soooo beautiful, it is so SOFT and BEYOND worth the price. You can run your fingers through it easily and there\u2019s no tangling (which I was nervous about but was pleasantly surprised!) and also this hair looks exactly like human hair! If not better, because it retains it style easier and although the curls are so pretty and stay well, you can still run your fingers through them without even needing hairspray. I\u2019ve only worn it a few times and already I have received so many compliments. There was also no weird smell or anything like some hair comes with which I was nervous about. If you\u2019re unsure about this hair, do yourself a favor and BUY IT! You will love it!\nReview Title: GET THIS WIG! \ud83d\udd25\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: K'ryssma Hair\nReview Date: 2021/09/04\nStore: MOVEQUICK K'ryssma Hair\nAverage Rating: 3.7\nProduct Details: {'Material': 'synthetic', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Brand': \"MOVEQUICK K'ryssma Hair\", 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '10.63 x 8.19 x 2.44 inches; 10.19 Ounces', 'UPC': '663376594810 663376594834'}\nReview Text: [[VIDEOID:538cc7523b782bb372de832e6eaa7368]] Okay so I have to go ahead and say, get this wig right off the bat. I always wear human hair, usually custom wigs, but I decided to branch out and try something new (inspired by Tiktok girls slaying the synthetic wigs). I am so glad that I did! I wasn\u2019t sure how the frontal would look without being able to bleach the knots but it turned out. They aren\u2019t bad like most synthetic units I\u2019ve seen, and they\u2019re easily plucked out. Especially if you can sit down and style this hair, it\u2019s going to look amazing. I was super busy and didn\u2019t get to do as much as I normally would so I wasn\u2019t sure how it would look on, but it is so pretty! The hair feels just like human, and it\u2019s a soft human texture at that. It looks very natural on, and it\u2019s easy to get down with just some Got2B spray and an elastic band to tie it down. It took no time and it was ready to go. I can\u2019t recommend this unit enough.
