Each brow pen has a black liquid liner on the other end. I would have liked for the pens to have included a different color liquid liner instead of having them all be black since the pens had different color brow colors, but I see why they all had black - black is a universal color that everyone usually likes. It just looks a bit harsh on me and I would have liked to have another eye liner color to choose from.

    "text": "This fiber lash mascara set is fantastic and the effects is creates are so beautiful. It has been one of the best mascaras I have ever used, from purchasing on Amazon or anywhere. The set includes a fiber building wand and a mascara wand. Both have color in them, which is different from what I have found in other sets! I love this, because you can technically use the fiber wand on its own if you want a less built up lash look, or you can use it with color mascaras from other sets as well. I guess you could do that with other fiber wands, but I have found that they are usually white, and this one is a soft black. It\u2019s so, so pretty. The mascara is also black and it makes lashes beautifully long, separated, and offers a dramatic finish. There are no clumps or flakes though, and the mascara lasts through any amount of crying (I can be a cryer!) or water. The waterproof-ness of this set is excellent. You can also build the mascara with more coats if you want a thicker effect, but something I really like is that the mascara isn\u2019t super thick on the first coat, so it allows that option. Overall, I can\u2019t recommend this set enough. If you are caught between different sets and not sure which one is for you, this is the one! Highly recommend.",
