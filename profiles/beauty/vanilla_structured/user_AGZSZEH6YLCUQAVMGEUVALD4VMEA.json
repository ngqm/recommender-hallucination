The shipping is very fast!The item specs read- 20 inches, body wave 4x4 closure wig with 150%density. I am always very cautious when I read reviews. Though skeptical, but i still decided to take a chance on the 4x4, as opposed to the 13x4 body wave version. Both were similar with the only exception being 4x4 vs 13x4. At least 75% of the feeback and detailed reviews on the  13x4 unit were negative and less than stellar. So I was more than happy to stay clear of that version of the body wave unit.In contrast, the unit I received; I was able to tinker, manipulate, and try to customized it to my liking. Given my age, I am not the baby hair type, neither am I a stylist, just your average joe looking for a versatile unit.The Pros- I bleached the knots and it handled well. I was able to color the unit using Jet Black Tintation. The unit is also true to length, versatile, and beginner-friendly.The Cons- The unit seemed somewhat resistant to color, as I had to color twice. to obtain the dark color posted in my images. Conclusion- This is an entry-level body wave unit. If I am in a pinch, I would perhaps purchase it again. Especial at this special and hard time,ppl shouldn't wast money on bad quality hair. Our money and coins aren't mediocre, so we should never settle.\nReview Title: Will Be Buying Again!!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Faux Locs Crochet Hair - 18 Inch Soft Locs 7 Packs Pre Looped Crochet Hair New Faux Locs 21strands/Pack Crochet Hair for Black Women (18inch, 7packs, T30\uff09\nReview Date: 2022/03/07\nStore: Aliyesy\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Aliyesy', 'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Extension Length': '18 Inches', 'Product Dimensions': '17.99 x 3.94 x 0.39 inches; 1.37 Pounds', 'UPC': '745551500004'}\nReview Text: I decided to put these in my by myself and I'm glad I did.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThis individual's purchase history reflects a preference for quality, versatile hair products, particularly those that are beginner-friendly and suitable for various styling needs. They consistently express sentiment towards products being easy to manipulate and customize, valuing practicality and craftsmanship, as observed from their positive feedback on wigs and crochet hair.\n\nThere\u2019s a trend of selecting products that enhance personal appearance or provide convenience, with a notable inclination towards human hair and synthetic options. However, they exhibit caution in their purchases, highlighted by their hesitation regarding more expensive options and a strong aversion to poor quality, as evidenced by discontent with ineffective beauty products.\n\nQuality is consistently prioritized, with a clear dissatisfaction toward overpriced items lacking performance, such as certain hair tools and teeth whitening products. While price sensitivity is present, the willingness to invest in quality is apparent, particularly when perceived value aligns with expectations. \n\nOverall, their core preferences center on affordability balanced with quality, robust functionality, and versatility in beauty products, alongside a desire for products that contribute to enhancing their personal style and confidence.",
