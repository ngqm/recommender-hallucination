Owing to improved light technology, hand held devices that can provide the requisite intensity light to perform IPL at home and at an affordable price are now available.<br /><br />I've tried a number of these IPL (Intense Pulsed Light) devices for hair removal. Compared to the others I've tried, this one is bargain-priced, and seems to offer similar functionality. About the only thing you give up is a LCD counter of the number of flashes. Since this thing is rated to half a million flashes--more than enough for pretty much anyone's lifetime--an LCD counter of the number you've used is pretty pointless.<br /><br />Operation is pretty trivial: You plug in the power supply, (the hair removal tool is NOT battery operated; you must have it plugged in), you choose the power level (five settings, chosen by rapidly pushing the power button)) and then you aim it at a body area with hair you'd like to remove. It is recommended that your body is freshly cleaned and that the hair be shaved before starting. You can choose either on-demand flashing (via the button on the side) or else continuous flashing when skin contacted is detected. Switching between the modes is accoplished by a long press of the button on the side.<br /><br />The light is extremely powerful and could damage your eyes with continued direct exposure. Therefore, you should never look directly into the light and a cheap pair of folding protective eyeglasses are included in the box.<br /><br />The light is triggered by a touch-sensitive metal area in the front of the device. Using very slow-motion photography, I was able to capture a snapshot of the light (see photos). But the light duration is extremely short.<br /><br />You run the tool over the area where you want to remove hair, and make sure you exposure all the hair follicles in that region. You will not see any immediate results. The light signals your hair to stop growing, but it requires multiple treatments over several weeks before you will be expected to see results. Eventually, you should find a substantial reduction in the hair in the treated areas.<br /><br />In the box, you get the tool, a power adapter, a cheap pair of sunglasses, and an inexpensive disposable shaver.<br /><br />This device only offers one mode: Hair removal. Other IPL devices offer other modes (skin rejuvenation and acne treatment). Whether that's a loss depends on whether you believe those other modes really work anyhow. The jury is out.<br /><br />One thing you don't get with this tool is any attachments that can make it easier to address certain body areas. Some IPL removal tools include these. The actual value of such tools is subject to debate and the fundamental functionality (which is a flash of high-intensity light) does not change.<br /><br />On the whole, this device promises acceptable IPL hair removal at a bargain price. Compared to other devices that promise the same functionality, it costs as much as 80% less (at time of writing). Assuming it works equally well, it represents major value.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />** Hair removal IPL, simple to use<br />** Extremely inexpensive relative to the competition<br /><br />Cons:<br />** No digital counter of the number of uses on LCD<br />** Mediocre aesthetics<br />** The wall plug is wide and the plug direction is such that it will take up multiple spaces on some extension arrays<br /><br />Note that the model of this device is Ai05.

I got this, and the women in my life rolled their eyes at first. Once they saw it and thought about it, they were arguing over who gets to keep it.<br /><br />This portable women's touchup shaver is perfect for touchups that you decide you need when you're at work, under harsh light--or else before you leave work for a night out.<br /><br />At the time I'm writing this review, the listing provides very little detail. So I'll provide some here and in the pictures. This is a Dooper brand women's portable shaver. It consists of an AA-battery-operated shaver with four interchangeable attachments (foil shaver, rotary shaver, mini clipper and rotary nose hair remover). The attachments easily twist off the end of the Dooper.<br /><br />The Dooper runs on one standard AA-battery, which is NOT included. (Boo). Once you have installed the battery, you simply twist the bottom of the Dooper clockwise (relative to the top) and the attachment spins. The Dooper is IPX6 rated, so you can use it in the shower, as it's rated to be waterproof.<br /><br />The design is cute, and the women in my life both wanted this when they saw it--especially when they realized what it could do.<br /><br />In terms of the quality of the attachment, the rotary head and the nose hair trimmer work pretty well. The foil trimmer is not great, nor is the bikimi trimmer. There are much better-dedicated devices for those purposes.<br /><br />A nice little gizmo.<br /><br />Included in kit:<br /><br />Battery operated Dooper handle (AA battery, not included)<br />Four interchangeable attachments: Bikini trimmer, rotary shaver, foil shaver, nose/ear hair trimmer<br />Two cheap cleaning brushes<br />Protective cap for bikini trimmer<br />Protective cap for nose hair remover<br />Cheap plastic bag to hold Dooper<br /><br />Shop around, as this device is available under multiple listings on Amazon.

I don't have a bald head (yet, anyway), so that isn't my focus.<br /><br />I have used rotary floating blade shavers for decades (usually Norelco). They work best on my face, especially for the neck region. These shavers have always featured three heads.<br /><br />Well, here we have seven heads. Seven heads!! I have used very similar shavers to this one with five and six-head shaver attachments. This is one more. The question is: Why do the high-quality venerable brands stick to three heads, and these shavers use so many more?<br /><br />The answer isn't quality of shave. In fact, I was impressed at how well this shaver cleared the stubble on my face at the end of the day. It was comfortable, and managed to navigate the nooks and crannies of my face and neck as well as my low-end Norelco (if not better). But it's no match--not even remotely close--to my top-of-the-line Norelco (though that costs about 4x as much, so that's probably not a fair comparison). But--and this is huge--the ergonomics of the shaving heads leave something to desire. First off, there's very little reservoir under the cutting heads for shaved hair (see photos). This means you'll need/want to wash the head (it's water immersible) after each shave. Second, the middle head of the seven doesn't pop up. To remove it, you have to twist it off. It's a bit of a pain--and there's even less room under this head for hair than any of the others.<br /><br />The third issue I have with the cutting heads is that there's no obvious way to replace them without simply replacing the entire shaving head assembly. Based on my experience with other shavers quite similar to this, expect the blades to get dull after a bit of use, and factor in the cost of an entire replacement head unit when they do.<br /><br />In terms of seven vs six vs five heads? Well, the motors in these shavers are effectively the same. So if you have seven heads, the amount of power you provide to each head is less than it is in a five head design. That's going to affect the maximum speed and also the ability to easily tackle heavy stubble. Given that I don't sense a huge amount of improvement with seven vs five (or six) heads, I'd be inclined to veer towards fewer heads.<br /><br />In general, I'd suggest that you can interchange the 7/6/5 head assemblies if you want to get a replacement.<br /><br />In the kit you get:<br /><br />Seven head cordless shaver with LCD readout of charge remaining<br />Waterproof (IPX level not indicated)<br />Nose hair trimmer attachment<br />Hair clipper attachment<br />Two face cleaning attachments<br />Three length guides for the hair clipper attachment<br />Charging cable (requires USB-A power source). The charge port on the shaver is a standard USB-C port.<br />Small cleaning brush<br /><br />Shave is controlled via a simple on/off button on the back. Given how you would normally hold this--palmed (see photo)--I found it annoyingly easy to accidentally push the power button when I was using it.<br /><br />The non-shaver attachments are a mixed bag. On the plus side, the nose hair trimmer works very well. This is in contrast with the nose hair trimmers that come with clippers, which are worthless. The nose hair clipper here works as well as the dedicated nose hair clippers I've used. On the minus side, the hair clipper is quite mediocre--it operates at a low speed and struggles with any amount of hair. It's about as good/useful as the clipper that's integrated into some shaver handles. Those can clip a bit of trim hair, but they are an exercise in frustration for any serious hair removal. Same here. The face cleaner attachments are probably OK, but I can't imagine using them.<br /><br />On the whole, I'd consider this a decent little kit useful for shaving your face and for nose hair removal. The remaining attachments are, in my opinion, not very useful. While it does a good job of shaving out of the box, my experience is that the heads get dull somewhat quickly, and you need to buy a not-inexpensive replacement assembly. Also, cleaning the assembly is a nuisance.<br /><br />Pros:<br />** 7 head shaver does a good job on face<br />** Waterproof (IPX level not indicated)<br />** Nose hair clipper works well<br />** Li-Ion battery: 2 hours charge for 90 minutes use<br />** Charge port on shaver is standard USB-C, so you can use charge cables you have at home<br />** Can lock the power button for travel (by holding for 3 seconds)<br /><br />Cons:<br />** Too easy to push the power button when palming the shaver in the hand during use<br />** Hair trimmer has limited usefulness<br />** Face cleaning attachments not very significant<br />** Shaver head assembly doesn't provide much room for hair and will need to be cleaned after each shave<br />** Middle head of shaver attachment difficult to remove for cleaning<br />** Must replace entire shaving head unit when one/more blades get dull<br />** 7th head in shaver assembly does not float like outer heads<br /><br />Note that there is a dizzying number of similar 5/6/7 head shavers sold on Amazon. As far as I can tell, having reviewed many of them, they are all made by a handful of companies and work pretty much equivalently well. The snap-in attachments even work across different models and brands. There are variances in features like level of waterproof and how the power switch works (and the body shape), but the function is pretty similar. So shop around for price.\nReview Title: 7 head shaver. Waterproof.

If you are looking for hair removal, then the most significant differences mostly amount to ergonomics (shape of the device and positions of the buttons) and whether it integrates \"ICE\" functionality to actively cool the region to which you're applying the light.<br /><br />This is a mid-priced unit that adds ICE Cooling functionality and works reasonably well.<br /><br />Specifics of this IPL device:<br /><br />** Only performs hair removal<br />** Includes ICE skin cooling functionality<br />** LCD screen shows the number of flashes left and power level (1-5), plus whether ICE auto modes are on/off<br />** Rated for 36W (low end of power for a home IPL)<br />** Oblong shape<br />** Rated for 999,999 flashes<br /><br />Operation is pretty trivial:<br /><br />1) Attach the power cord to the IPL device (the device is NOT battery operated--you must have it plugged in).<br />2) Turn on the device via the power button, which is a button in the middle of the top of the device.<br />3) Choose the power level to use (you have five levels, and you cycle through them using short pushes of the power button). The level will be indicated on the LCD screen.<br />4) Place the front end of the device against the skin you are trying to treat and push the flash button (big button on the top of the IPL). There is a ~1s  refractory period after flashing before you can flash again.<br />5) Ice technology, which actively cools the metal region that comes in contact with your skin.<br /><br />The light is extremely powerful and could damage your eyes with continued direct exposure. Therefore, you should never look directly into the light and a cheap pair of folding protective eyeglasses are included in the box. The light is triggered by sensors in the front of the device. Using very slow-motion photography, I was able to capture a ~1/100th split-second snapshot of the light (see photos). But the light duration is extremely short.<br /><br />You run the tool over the area where you want to remove hair and make sure you expose all the hair follicles in that region. You will not see any immediate results. The light signals your hair to stop growing, but it requires multiple treatments over several weeks before you will be expected to see results. Eventually, you should find a substantial reduction in the hair in the treated areas.<br /><br />In the box, you get the tool, a power cord, a pair of eye protection glasses, a cheap disposable razor, plus instructions.<br /><br />A word about the \"ice\" functionality, because this listing provides almost no detail (nor do those for other IPL devices):<br /><br />Ice functionality is another term for \"Local epidermal cooling.\"<br /><br />This is given various names in listings, one of the most common is \"ice function\" or \"ice-cooling\". This is local cooling of the epidermal region (surface skin) in the region where the IPL light pulse is being applied. The high-powered light can be irritating to some people, and cooling the skin in that region can reduce the immediate irritation. (It does not improve/decrease the efficacy of the treatment). This cooling effect is achieved via a Peltier junction semiconductor and a good thermoconducting material at the head of the IPL device (frequently sapphire or aluminum) that transmits the cold that the semiconductor generates to the skin. (A heatsink and fan inside the IPL device remove the heat that the Peltier junction also produces).<br /><br />Epidermal cooling is not required for efficient use, but it may make it less unpleasant to use the device for some users.<br /><br />This IPL device is lower-mid-priced relative to other IPL devices on Amazon, but it does add the \"ICE\" cooling functionality. The rated power is 36W, which is on the low end of the range of power you typically see for these home IPL devices (between 30W and 60W).<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Pros:<br />** Integrates epidermal cooling (ICE)<br />** LCD readout<br /><br />Cons:<br />** Not the cheapest IPL device you can buy<br />** 36W rating is at the lower end for these types of devices\nReview Title: IPL hair removal tool adds active cooling (ICE).

I don't have a bald head (yet, anyway), so that isn't my focus.<br /><br />I have used rotary floating blade shavers for decades (usually Norelco). They work best on my face, especially for the neck region. These shavers have always featured three heads.<br /><br />Well, here we have seven heads. Seven heads!! I have used very similar shavers to this one with five and six-head shaver attachments. This is one more. The question is: Why do the high-quality venerable brands stick to three heads, and these shavers use so many more?<br /><br />The answer isn't quality of shave. In fact, I was impressed at how well this shaver cleared the stubble on my face at the end of the day. It was comfortable, and managed to navigate the nooks and crannies of my face and neck as well as my low-end Norelco (if not better). But it's no match--not even remotely close--to my top-of-the-line Norelco (though that costs about 4x as much, so that's probably not a fair comparison). But--and this is huge--the ergonomics of the shaving heads leave something to desire. First off, there's very little reservoir under the cutting heads for shaved hair (see photos). This means you'll need/want to wash the head (it's water immersible) after each shave. Second, the middle head of the seven doesn't pop up. To remove it, you have to twist it off. It's a bit of a pain--and there's even less room under this head for hair than any of the others.<br /><br />The third issue I have with the cutting heads is that there's no obvious way to replace them without simply replacing the entire shaving head assembly. Based on my experience with other shavers quite similar to this, expect the blades to get dull after a bit of use, and factor in the cost of an entire replacement head unit when they do.<br /><br />In terms of seven vs six vs five heads? Well, the motors in these shavers are effectively the same. So if you have seven heads, the amount of power you provide to each head is less than it is in a five head design. That's going to affect the maximum speed and also the ability to easily tackle heavy stubble. Given that I don't sense a huge amount of improvement with seven vs five (or six) heads, I'd be inclined to veer towards fewer heads.<br /><br />In general, I'd suggest that you can interchange the 7/6/5 head assemblies if you want to get a replacement.<br /><br />In the kit you get:<br /><br />Seven head cordless shaver with LCD readout of charge remaining<br />Waterproof (IPX level not indicated)<br />Nose hair trimmer attachment<br />Hair clipper attachment<br />Two face cleaning attachments<br />Three length guides for the hair clipper attachment<br />Charging cable (requires USB-A power source). The charge port on the shaver is a standard USB-C port.<br />Small cleaning brush<br /><br />Shave is controlled via a simple on/off button on the back. Given how you would normally hold this--palmed (see photo)--I found it annoyingly easy to accidentally push the power button when I was using it.<br /><br />The non-shaver attachments are a mixed bag. On the plus side, the nose hair trimmer works very well. This is in contrast with the nose hair trimmers that come with clippers, which are worthless. The nose hair clipper here works as well as the dedicated nose hair clippers I've used. On the minus side, the hair clipper is quite mediocre--it operates at a low speed and struggles with any amount of hair. It's about as good/useful as the clipper that's integrated into some shaver handles. Those can clip a bit of trim hair, but they are an exercise in frustration for any serious hair removal. Same here. The face cleaner attachments are probably OK, but I can't imagine using them.<br /><br />On the whole, I'd consider this a decent little kit useful for shaving your face and for nose hair removal. The remaining attachments are, in my opinion, not very useful. While it does a good job of shaving out of the box, my experience is that the heads get dull somewhat quickly, and you need to buy a not-inexpensive replacement assembly. Also, cleaning the assembly is a nuisance.<br /><br />Pros:<br />** 7 head shaver does a good job on face<br />** Waterproof (IPX level not indicated)<br />** Nose hair clipper works well<br />** Li-Ion battery: 2 hours charge for 90 minutes use<br />** Charge port on shaver is standard USB-C, so you can use charge cables you have at home<br />** Can lock the power button for travel (by holding for 3 seconds)<br /><br />Cons:<br />** Too easy to push the power button when palming the shaver in the hand during use<br />** Hair trimmer has limited usefulness<br />** Face cleaning attachments not very significant<br />** Shaver head assembly doesn't provide much room for hair and will need to be cleaned after each shave<br />** Middle head of shaver attachment difficult to remove for cleaning<br />** Must replace entire shaving head unit when one/more blades get dull<br />** 7th head in shaver assembly does not float like outer heads<br /><br />Note that there is a dizzying number of similar 5/6/7 head shavers sold on Amazon. As far as I can tell, having reviewed many of them, they are all made by a handful of companies and work pretty much equivalently well. The snap-in attachments even work across different models and brands. There are variances in features like level of waterproof and how the power switch works (and the body shape), but the function is pretty similar. So shop around for price.\n7 head shaver. Waterproof.

If you are looking for hair removal, then the most significant differences mostly amount to ergonomics (shape of the device and positions of the buttons) and whether it integrates \"ICE\" functionality to actively cool the region to which you're applying the light.<br /><br />This is a mid-priced unit that adds ICE Cooling functionality and works reasonably well.<br /><br />Specifics of this IPL device:<br /><br />** Only performs hair removal<br />** Includes ICE skin cooling functionality<br />** LCD screen shows the number of flashes left and power level (1-5), plus whether ICE auto modes are on/off<br />** Rated for 36W (low end of power for a home IPL)<br />** Oblong shape<br />** Rated for 999,999 flashes<br /><br />Operation is pretty trivial:<br /><br />1) Attach the power cord to the IPL device (the device is NOT battery operated--you must have it plugged in).<br />2) Turn on the device via the power button, which is a button in the middle of the top of the device.<br />3) Choose the power level to use (you have five levels, and you cycle through them using short pushes of the power button). The level will be indicated on the LCD screen.<br />4) Place the front end of the device against the skin you are trying to treat and push the flash button (big button on the top of the IPL). There is a ~1s  refractory period after flashing before you can flash again.<br />5) Ice technology, which actively cools the metal region that comes in contact with your skin.<br /><br />The light is extremely powerful and could damage your eyes with continued direct exposure. Therefore, you should never look directly into the light and a cheap pair of folding protective eyeglasses are included in the box. The light is triggered by sensors in the front of the device. Using very slow-motion photography, I was able to capture a ~1/100th split-second snapshot of the light (see photos). But the light duration is extremely short.<br /><br />You run the tool over the area where you want to remove hair and make sure you expose all the hair follicles in that region. You will not see any immediate results. The light signals your hair to stop growing, but it requires multiple treatments over several weeks before you will be expected to see results. Eventually, you should find a substantial reduction in the hair in the treated areas.<br /><br />In the box, you get the tool, a power cord, a pair of eye protection glasses, a cheap disposable razor, plus instructions.<br /><br />A word about the \"ice\" functionality, because this listing provides almost no detail (nor do those for other IPL devices):<br /><br />Ice functionality is another term for \"Local epidermal cooling.\"<br /><br />This is given various names in listings, one of the most common is \"ice function\" or \"ice-cooling\". This is local cooling of the epidermal region (surface skin) in the region where the IPL light pulse is being applied. The high-powered light can be irritating to some people, and cooling the skin in that region can reduce the immediate irritation. (It does not improve/decrease the efficacy of the treatment). This cooling effect is achieved via a Peltier junction semiconductor and a good thermoconducting material at the head of the IPL device (frequently sapphire or aluminum) that transmits the cold that the semiconductor generates to the skin. (A heatsink and fan inside the IPL device remove the heat that the Peltier junction also produces).<br /><br />Epidermal cooling is not required for efficient use, but it may make it less unpleasant to use the device for some users.<br /><br />This IPL device is lower-mid-priced relative to other IPL devices on Amazon, but it does add the \"ICE\" cooling functionality. The rated power is 36W, which is on the low end of the range of power you typically see for these home IPL devices (between 30W and 60W).<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Pros:<br />** Integrates epidermal cooling (ICE)<br />** LCD readout<br /><br />Cons:<br />** Not the cheapest IPL device you can buy<br />** 36W rating is at the lower end for these types of devices\nIPL hair removal tool adds active cooling (ICE).

Owing to improved light technology, hand held devices that can provide the requisite intensity light to perform IPL at home and at an affordable price are now available.<br /><br />I've tried a number of these IPL (Intense Pulsed Light) devices for hair removal. Compared to the others I've tried, this one is bargain-priced, and seems to offer similar functionality. About the only thing you give up is a LCD counter of the number of flashes. Since this thing is rated to half a million flashes--more than enough for pretty much anyone's lifetime--an LCD counter of the number you've used is pretty pointless.<br /><br />Operation is pretty trivial: You plug in the power supply, (the hair removal tool is NOT battery operated; you must have it plugged in), you choose the power level (five settings, chosen by rapidly pushing the power button)) and then you aim it at a body area with hair you'd like to remove. It is recommended that your body is freshly cleaned and that the hair be shaved before starting. You can choose either on-demand flashing (via the button on the side) or else continuous flashing when skin contacted is detected. Switching between the modes is accoplished by a long press of the button on the side.<br /><br />The light is extremely powerful and could damage your eyes with continued direct exposure. Therefore, you should never look directly into the light and a cheap pair of folding protective eyeglasses are included in the box.<br /><br />The light is triggered by a touch-sensitive metal area in the front of the device. Using very slow-motion photography, I was able to capture a snapshot of the light (see photos). But the light duration is extremely short.<br /><br />You run the tool over the area where you want to remove hair, and make sure you exposure all the hair follicles in that region.

Eventually, you should find a substantial reduction in the hair in the treated areas.<br /><br />In the box, you get the tool, a power adapter, a cheap pair of sunglasses, and an inexpensive disposable shaver.<br /><br />This device only offers one mode: Hair removal. Other IPL devices offer other modes (skin rejuvenation and acne treatment). Whether that's a loss depends on whether you believe those other modes really work anyhow. The jury is out.<br /><br />One thing you don't get with this tool is any attachments that can make it easier to address certain body areas. Some IPL removal tools include these. The actual value of such tools is subject to debate and the fundamental functionality (which is a flash of high-intensity light) does not change.<br /><br />On the whole, this device promises acceptable IPL hair removal at a bargain price. Compared to other devices that promise the same functionality, it costs as much as 80% less (at time of writing). Assuming it works equally well, it represents major value.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />** Hair removal IPL, simple to use<br />** Extremely inexpensive relative to the competition<br /><br />Cons:<br />** No digital counter of the number of uses on LCD<br />** Mediocre aesthetics<br />** The wall plug is wide and the plug direction is such that it will take up multiple spaces on some extension arrays<br /><br />Note that the model of this device is Ai05. This model (and others from the same manufacturer) are available from multiple brands on Amazon, so you may want to shop around.\nReview Title: Bargain priced, easy-to-use IPL hair removal\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: BESUNTEK IPL Hair Removal, 500000 Flashes Permanent Laser Women & Men Hair Removal Device at-Home Painless Hair Remover with 5 Adjustable Energy Levels for Armpits Back Legs Arms Face\nReview Date: 2021/07/20\nStore: BESUNTEK\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '15.27 x 10 x 5.35 inches; 2.23 Pounds', 'UPC': '723509384128'}\nReview Text: The latest craze in hair removal is IPL: Intense Pulsed Light.

It's about as good/useful as the clipper that's integrated into some shaver handles. Those can clip a bit of trim hair, but they are an exercise in frustration for any serious hair removal. Same here. The face cleaner attachments are probably OK, but I can't imagine using them.<br /><br />On the whole, I'd consider this a decent little kit useful for shaving your face and for nose hair removal. The remaining attachments are, in my opinion, not very useful. While it does a good job of shaving out of the box, my experience is that the heads get dull somewhat quickly, and you need to buy a not-inexpensive replacement assembly. Also, cleaning the assembly is a nuisance.<br /><br />Pros:<br />** 7 head shaver does a good job on face<br />** Waterproof (IPX level not indicated)<br />** Nose hair clipper works well<br />** Li-Ion battery: 2 hours charge for 90 minutes use<br />** Charge port on shaver is standard USB-C, so you can use charge cables you have at home<br />** Can lock the power button for travel (by holding for 3 seconds)<br /><br />Cons:<br />** Too easy to push the power button when palming the shaver in the hand during use<br />** Hair trimmer has limited usefulness<br />** Face cleaning attachments not very significant<br />** Shaver head assembly doesn't provide much room for hair and will need to be cleaned after each shave<br />** Middle head of shaver attachment difficult to remove for cleaning<br />** Must replace entire shaving head unit when one/more blades get dull<br />** 7th head in shaver assembly does not float like outer heads<br /><br />Note that there is a dizzying number of similar 5/6/7 head shavers sold on Amazon. As far as I can tell, having reviewed many of them, they are all made by a handful of companies and work pretty much equivalently well. The snap-in attachments even work across different models and brands. There are variances in features like level of waterproof and how the power switch works (and the body shape), but the function is pretty similar. So shop around for price.\nReview Title: 7 head shaver. Waterproof.

If you are looking for hair removal, then the most significant differences mostly amount to ergonomics (shape of the device and positions of the buttons) and whether it integrates \"ICE\" functionality to actively cool the region to which you're applying the light.<br /><br />This is a mid-priced unit that adds ICE Cooling functionality and works reasonably well.<br /><br />Specifics of this IPL device:<br /><br />** Only performs hair removal<br />** Includes ICE skin cooling functionality<br />** LCD screen shows the number of flashes left and power level (1-5), plus whether ICE auto modes are on/off<br />** Rated for 36W (low end of power for a home IPL)<br />** Oblong shape<br />** Rated for 999,999 flashes<br /><br />Operation is pretty trivial:<br /><br />1) Attach the power cord to the IPL device (the device is NOT battery operated--you must have it plugged in).<br />2) Turn on the device via the power button, which is a button in the middle of the top of the device.<br />3) Choose the power level to use (you have five levels, and you cycle through them using short pushes of the power button). The level will be indicated on the LCD screen.<br />4) Place the front end of the device against the skin you are trying to treat and push the flash button (big button on the top of the IPL). There is a ~1s  refractory period after flashing before you can flash again.<br />5) Ice technology, which actively cools the metal region that comes in contact with your skin.<br /><br />The light is extremely powerful and could damage your eyes with continued direct exposure. Therefore, you should never look directly into the light and a cheap pair of folding protective eyeglasses are included in the box. The light is triggered by sensors in the front of the device. Using very slow-motion photography, I was able to capture a ~1/100th split-second snapshot of the light (see photos). But the light duration is extremely short.<br /><br />You run the tool over the area where you want to remove hair and make sure you expose all the hair follicles in that region. You will not see any immediate results. The light signals your hair to stop growing, but it requires multiple treatments over several weeks before you will be expected to see results. Eventually, you should find a substantial reduction in the hair in the treated areas.<br /><br />In the box, you get the tool, a power cord, a pair of eye protection glasses, a cheap disposable razor, plus instructions.<br /><br />A word about the \"ice\" functionality, because this listing provides almost no detail (nor do those for other IPL devices):<br /><br />Ice functionality is another term for \"Local epidermal cooling.\"<br /><br />This is given various names in listings, one of the most common is \"ice function\" or \"ice-cooling\". This is local cooling of the epidermal region (surface skin) in the region where the IPL light pulse is being applied. The high-powered light can be irritating to some people, and cooling the skin in that region can reduce the immediate irritation. (It does not improve/decrease the efficacy of the treatment). This cooling effect is achieved via a Peltier junction semiconductor and a good thermoconducting material at the head of the IPL device (frequently sapphire or aluminum) that transmits the cold that the semiconductor generates to the skin. (A heatsink and fan inside the IPL device remove the heat that the Peltier junction also produces).<br /><br />Epidermal cooling is not required for efficient use, but it may make it less unpleasant to use the device for some users.<br /><br />This IPL device is lower-mid-priced relative to other IPL devices on Amazon, but it does add the \"ICE\" cooling functionality. The rated power is 36W, which is on the low end of the range of power you typically see for these home IPL devices (between 30W and 60W).<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Pros:<br />** Integrates epidermal cooling (ICE)<br />** LCD readout<br /><br />Cons:<br />** Not the cheapest IPL device you can buy<br />** 36W rating is at the lower end for these types of devices\nReview Title: IPL hair removal tool adds active cooling (ICE).

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe individual demonstrates a clear preference for hair removal devices, particularly IPL (Intense Pulsed Light) technology that promises permanent hair reduction. Consistent patterns emerge in their ratings, revealing a tendency to favor products that combine functionality with affordability, often rating lower-cost items favorably when they perform adequately. \n\nCommon themes in their reviews highlight a desire for simplicity and ease of use in hair removal processes, often favoring devices that require minimal setup or operation complexity. A notable interest in ergonomic designs is also evident, as they seem to prioritize comfort and practicality over additional features. \n\nRecurring quality preferences indicate a willingness to accept basic aesthetics and reduced functionalities (like the absence of an LCD counter) if the core purpose of effective hair removal is met efficiently. The individual exhibits price sensitivity, favoring mid- to low-priced devices while acknowledging that they often sacrifice luxury attributes for substantial savings.\n\nOverall, this consumer leans towards cost-effective hair removal solutions that deliver reliable performance, combining essential features with simple usability and ergonomic comfort over premium enhancements or aesthetics.",

    "title": "Adorable, well-made, compact and portable device for face cleaning/massaging. Pricey though.",
    "text": "This is a silicone face pusator/massager. One side features soft silicone bristles that are useful for working any topical application into your face. The other side features a few ribs and can be used for simple face massage (no creams/topicals).<br /><br />You turn it on by pressing the power button on the back (massage side). You turn it off the same way. There's a travel lock you enable by pressing the + and - buttons simultaneously for three seconds. You disable the lock the same way.<br /><br />The device integrates a 300 mAh LithiumIon battery. That's not huge, but it's big enough to give a rated 300 minutes of run time. So it's enough to throw into your travel bag or purse (after a full charge) and not worry about running out of juice.<br /><br />It fits reasonably well in the hand. The vibration intensity can be adjusted in 8 levels using the + and - buttons. Personally, if I'm gonna use this, I'll be using the highest level, and at that level it dusts up a good amount of lather (if the topical you're using can lather). If you have sensitive skin, the lowest level is quite low--just a low hum of buzzing.<br /><br />Honestly, this is a sweet face cleaner. There is a caveat here, though. And that is that this device is quite pricey for what it is (silicone with a moderate-sized battery and a small buzzing/vibrating unit inside). So whether it's worth the price will be a matter of personal preference. It's perhaps closing with a note that this comes with a two year warranty, unlike cheap similar devices, which usually with a blink and you'll miss it warranty.<br /><br />Pros:<br />** Cute and stylish<br />** 300 minutes run time on a full charge<br />** At highest level, capable of a getting a topical (or soap) lathering well<br />** Lowest level is low enough to satisfy those with sensitive skin<br />** Travel lock-out mode<br />** Two year warranty<br /><br />Cons:<br />** Expensive",
