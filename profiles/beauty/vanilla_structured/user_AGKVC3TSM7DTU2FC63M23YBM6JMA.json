In the summer the light begins to pour in before 5 AM and, being a light sleeper, I would wake up and have a difficult time getting back to sleep afterwards, which eventually, led me to search for a sleep mask.<br /><br />I purchased these masks and another, molded one that came with earplugs.  This is my very favorite and I shared the second of the set with my night-shift working daughter, as I felt it might help her get more rest during the day as well.  I've been using mine for a few months now and absolutely love it.<br /><br />It does take a little bit of getting used to, just to the feel of something on your face and around your head.  I've felt a little irritation on my ears occasionally but can easily adjust it to relieve that.  It fits my face and stays in place quite well without having the band on tightly.  I am a \"tummy sleeper\", and this mask is so soft that it doesn't feel uncomfortable against my pillow.  It's just wonderful!<br /><br />I have not noticed any scent on the ones that I received, and I checked because of the other reviewers comments.  I've hand-washed it numerous times now, then let it air dry and it's ready to go again.  If anything, it's just become softer but has not shown any signs of wear beyond that.  I'm now looking to order more, just to have on hand when this one is ready to be replaced.<br /><br />The other, molded one seems a bit bigger but sits off your eyes, if that sensation would bother you.  I have a little more difficulty getting it to block all the light as well as this one, but it could be more attractive for larger faces or folks that are bothered by having something constantly touching their eyes like this one does.  Just my thoughts on that. . .<br /><br />I've read many articles recently on the importance of getting adequate sleep for your mental and physical health.  If you are looking at sleep masks, you're probably wanting to improve your rest for some reason.  I'd recommend you give this mask a try.  I don't understand why some seem scented and some aren't, but I am 100% pleased with the masks I received.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThis individual demonstrates a strong preference for high-quality, effective personal care products that enhance comfort and well-being. Consistently high ratings (mostly above 4.0) indicate satisfaction with functionality, durability, and user experience. The user often seeks products that address specific needs, particularly in sleep improvement, grooming, and skin care, showing a pattern of prioritizing comfort and effectiveness.\n\nCommon themes include an emphasis on soft materials and soothing properties\u2014evident in the choices of sleep masks and moisturizing creams. The user values utility in products designed for personal grooming, as seen with the shears, indicating a desire for precision and reliability over time, coupled with care in maintenance.\n\nPrice sensitivity is suggested by the pursuit of sets or bundles that offer savings while ensuring quality, as in the lip balm purchase, reflecting a balance between personal care and budget consciousness. Furthermore, the user appears to appreciate eco-friendliness and conscientiousness in product selection, highlighted in the purchase of a moisturizer that emphasizes natural ingredients.\n\nOverall, the core preferences reflect an inclination towards well-crafted, practical items that facilitate a holistic lifestyle focused on self-care and comfort, while being mindful of environmental considerations and cost-efficiency.",
