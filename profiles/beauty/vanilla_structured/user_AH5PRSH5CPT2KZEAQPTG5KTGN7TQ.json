  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\n\nThe individual demonstrates a clear preference for high-quality makeup tools, notably eye makeup brushes, which consistently receive high ratings (4.0 to 5.0) and positive reviews highlighting their effectiveness in blending. The repeated purchases and positive feedback on similar products indicate a strong inclination toward reliable performance and ease of use, especially for eyeshadow application.\n\nIn addition to makeup brushes, there is an evident importance placed on cleaning tools, showcasing a focus on hygiene and maintenance of beauty tools, as reflected in the exceptional ratings for makeup brush cleaners and the clear sentiment of appreciation for their functionality and protection of brush integrity.\n\nConversely, there is a marked dissatisfaction regarding lower-quality tools, as shown by the negative review of a blackhead tweezer, where performance and durability were significant concerns. This suggests a critical stance toward quality not being met, impacting overall satisfaction and willingness to recommend.\n\nOverall, this consumer favors effective, durable, and user-friendly makeup and cleaning products while exhibiting sensitivity to quality, as evidenced by the variation in ratings across different tools. The core preference centers around reliable and high-performing beauty products that enhance the makeup experience.",
