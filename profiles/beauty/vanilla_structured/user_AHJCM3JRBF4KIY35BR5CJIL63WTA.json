  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:  \nThe purchase history reveals a consistent preference for human hair products, particularly those with wavy textures. The individual shows a notable sensitivity to quality and performance, with dissatisfaction expressed towards items that do not maintain curl patterns or quality after short-term use. Ratings average around 3.5 to 4.0, indicating moderate satisfaction but highlighting frustrations with specific aspects, such as durability and visual appeal post-wash. \n\nCommon themes include a necessity for bundled products alongside closures, suggesting a practical use for weaving rather than just extension applications. The buyer demonstrates a desire for dense volume, hinting at possible price sensitivity, as thin bundles do not meet their aesthetic expectations. Despite initial excitement over product quality, negative outcomes typically overshadow positive experiences, indicating a critical eye for potential misrepresentation in advertising.\n\nOverall, the core preferences suggest a buyer who values high-quality, voluminous human hair with lasting characteristics, coupled with a pragmatic approach to purchasing. However, past experiences indicate a need for improved consistency across different product lines in texture and durability.",

    "text": "The price is honestly good.  We all know these products are called Human Hair and they\u2019re clearly not literally human hair.  The hair did melt when I tried to curl it, but I\u2019ve kept it in a whole month with the help of hair serums and braiding it at night.  The curls were really pretty and it looks like Yaki hair now, it tangles a bit, but it is fine by me.  It doesn\u2019t frizz or anything, once you brush the knots out and use serum, you\u2019re good.",
