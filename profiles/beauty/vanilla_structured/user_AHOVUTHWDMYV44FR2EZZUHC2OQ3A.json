I personally use it once a week after cleansing followed by the face mask that disco provides. I put a smudge on both sides of my cheeks and my forehead and slowly but gently rub it in. This particular product hurts a bit if you rub it in hard in my experience so I go nice and easy on my face while rubbing it in to stop any irritation from occurring.
