The silicone bottle is durable and thick, but so easy to squeeze. It isn't going to break and crack like a hard plastic bottle. The cap fits securely and the snap-top stays in place. The carabiner is small, but it's strong enough to keep the bottle where it needs to be as long as there isn't serious weight constantly pulling on it. So far, so good.<br /><br />The thing I worry about most with a little bottle like this is what happens if you put a lot of pressure on it (sit on it, lean against the wall when it's in a pocket or on a belt loop, etc). I was concerned that the flip top would pop open and I'd end up with hand sanitizer all over the place, but I tested these little guys full of liquid before filling with sanitizer. The pliability of the silicone doesn't allow a burst of pressure to push off the flip top-- not even close. Plus, the top screws tightly into place. It's not going anywhere.<br /><br />I've been using one of these hanging from my purse strap for the last few days and it is super easy to flip the cap, squeeze out product, and flip the cap closed with one hand. Wish there were other color options, but the functionality and design of these override any concerns about color. I'm so glad I ordered these!

I started using Liquid Gold almost two weeks ago (just in time for a cold front and a huge snow storm) and I don't recognize my skin. I use Liquid Gold in the morning and right before bed every day. A little of it sits on the surface of my skin, but it never offsets on my pillow or clothing. After a half hour or so, it's completely absorbed. I'm 56, so I've been watching my skin go through all kinds of hormonal acrobatics, from rosacea to acne to uneven texture and coloring. Does Liquid Gold eliminate all of these flaws? No. But it DOES alleviate them and help improve my skin texture (no painfully dry papery skin! Blast the heater in the car-- I don't care!). The proof that this stuff works for me, though, is that I feel comfortable enough in my own skin to go out without makeup on most days. I'm not afraid of getting older and I'm not looking for a miracle cure, I just want my skin to look happy and healthy. It does.<br /><br />The packaging is simple yet effective to prevent breakage during storage and transport. The bottle is in a muslin bag, which is nestled inside a thick cardboard cylindrical box with a snug lid, which is also nestled inside a cardboard box. A lot of care was taken with the package design to reflect the organic, down-to-earth approach that Auntie and Me takes with their products, and it is effective in preventing breakage.<br /><br />If I'm being critical, I have to say that I really dislike the bottle itself. The glass bottle with a slick label and a dropper than dribbles and leaks is a disaster story in the making. The very first time I used the product, the dropper spilled a little on the outside of the bottle and it has been slick and hard to hold ever since. Some sort of texture on the bottle or label would be a very nice addition to prevent dropping an eighty-dollar bottle of oil.<br /><br />I was brave and ordered the original scented version and I love it. I immediately picked up the camphory notes of the lavender with the resinous after notes of frankincense coming along afterwards. It's nothing overwhelming. Unfortunately, while I happen to love the smell of this version, one of my dogs won't come near me. She actually stopped sleeping in my room once I started using it. If I buy another bottle, I will go with the unscented version, unless I can get her to appreciate how good it smells.\nReview Title: Whose skin is this?\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

The bristles are stiff, yet have a bit softness to them. I have had no breakage or shedding of bristles at all with this brush. The arrangement of the bristles also allows for easy cleaning of the brush as well. The tapered handle makes parting and sectioning the hair easy, and the brush as a whole is well-balanced and easy to work with. I think the price is terrific for the quality of this brush, which I use on my natural hair and on wigs. I highly recommend it!\nReview Title: Just a great brush!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: 10pcs Nail Tips Clips for Quick Building Polygel Nail Forms Nail Tips Clip for Finger Nail Extension DIY Manicure Nail Art Tool\nReview Date: 2021/05/02\nStore: tiggell\nAverage Rating: 3.8\nProduct Details: {'Size': '10 Count (Pack of 1)', 'Brand': 'tiggell', 'Style': 'French', 'Coverage': 'Full Well Tips', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Package Dimensions': '7.64 x 5.24 x 1.61 inches; 2.08 Ounces'}\nReview Text: These clips are great! I can never get my nail forms to lie flat and these clips give just enough resistance to prevent the forms from lifting, but not enough to pinch my finger uncomfortably. The inside of the clip is curved to accommodate the shape of the finger and the clear plastic allows penetration of UV or LED lights to cure the polygel. They are lightweight but not flimsy at all, so I imagine that if you take care with them they will last a good long time. For the price, you can't beat these!\nReview Title: Lightweight and pinchless\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Auntie & Me Liquid Gold Organic Anti-Aging Face Serum for Dark Spots, Scars, Stretch Marks | Cruelty Free, Paraben Free, Vegan (Original, 66mL)\nReview Date: 2022/01/20\nStore: Auntie & Me\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'Auntie & Me', 'Material Feature': 'Organic, Natural, Vegan', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '12 x 9 x 6 inches; 12 Ounces', 'UPC': '618119720766'}\nReview Text: In the winter, my skin turns in to scaly, flaky paper. I started using Liquid Gold almost two weeks ago (just in time for a cold front and a huge snow storm) and I don't recognize my skin. I use Liquid Gold in the morning and right before bed every day. A little of it sits on the surface of my skin, but it never offsets on my pillow or clothing. After a half hour or so, it's completely absorbed. I'm 56, so I've been watching my skin go through all kinds of hormonal acrobatics, from rosacea to acne to uneven texture and coloring. Does Liquid Gold eliminate all of these flaws? No. But it DOES alleviate them and help improve my skin texture (no painfully dry papery skin! Blast the heater in the car-- I don't care!). The proof that this stuff works for me, though, is that I feel comfortable enough in my own skin to go out without makeup on most days. I'm not afraid of getting older and I'm not looking for a miracle cure, I just want my skin to look happy and healthy. It does.<br /><br />The packaging is simple yet effective to prevent breakage during storage and transport. The bottle is in a muslin bag, which is nestled inside a thick cardboard cylindrical box with a snug lid, which is also nestled inside a cardboard box. A lot of care was taken with the package design to reflect the organic, down-to-earth approach that Auntie and Me takes with their products, and it is effective in preventing breakage.<br /><br />If I'm being critical, I have to say that I really dislike the bottle itself. The glass bottle with a slick label and a dropper than dribbles and leaks is a disaster story in the making. The very first time I used the product, the dropper spilled a little on the outside of the bottle and it has been slick and hard to hold ever since. Some sort of texture on the bottle or label would be a very nice addition to prevent dropping an eighty-dollar bottle of oil.<br /><br />I was brave and ordered the original scented version and I love it. I immediately picked up the camphory notes of the lavender with the resinous after notes of frankincense coming along afterwards. It's nothing overwhelming. Unfortunately, while I happen to love the smell of this version, one of my dogs won't come near me. She actually stopped sleeping in my room once I started using it. If I buy another bottle, I will go with the unscented version, unless I can get her to appreciate how good it smells.\nReview Title: Whose skin is this?\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n    Structure your response as:\n   \n    SUMMARY:\n    [Final synthesis of preferences and patterns]",

    "text": "What a gorgeous color! This is a true metallic in a gorgeous, rich coppery bronze, not a wimpy little watered down frosty lipstick your gran would wear. The quality is on par with other brands of liquid lipstick like KvD and Black Moon. I find the formula and staying power similar to Black Moon, as KvD always tends to dry a little gummy on me and starts to flake the minute my lips move. Beauty Bakerie's liquid lip is unnervingly sticky for a few minutes while it sets, then it is very dry. If you wear a lot of liquid lipsticks, you know this is par for the course. If it really bothers you, add a tiny bit of balm or gloss (just a touch of Aquaphore will do the trick), but it will affect the longevity. There is no flavor (hooray!) to this lipstick and the split doe's foot (can I call it a cloven hoof?) applicator is super easy to control. And as someone else mentioned, with a color this bold, control is key. Despite it being a dry formula, it doesn't collect in your lip cracks and make your mouth look dry like an old fashioned matte lipstick does. I'm a pasty white middle-aged woman and this color looks awesome on me. I don't have any feathering or running of color, I don't need a lipliner, and the dry formula doesn't bother me because I've been wearing matte lipsticks for years. The price is right in line with similar products by other indie brands. I am so happy with this color and this formula, I can't wait to order Royal Tea. Would love to see this in a ruby slipper red!",
