I can not compare to other systems, but I love it! I use the 3 pair from the top. The look was pretty normal. I had to cut a little of them because it was too long for me.<br />The set comes with 2 eye liner, tweezer and 5 pairs of lashes.<br />The liner was easy to apply and then the lashes were stuck on it fast and easy.<br />I went to a barbecue with them and they stay in the entire time.<br />After, they go out without any pain. The eye liner was a little hard to take off. I use my makeup wipes in a hard way. Haha.<br />It did not make my sensitive skin hurt or burn.<br />I love it!\nReview Title: Big difference!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Argan Magic 100% Pure Argan Oil \u2013 Moisturizing Oil that Infuses Skin with Enriched Hydration | Leaves Skin Restored & Refreshed | Non-Greasy | Rich in Vitamin E | Made in USA | Cruelty Free (2 oz)\nReview Date: 2020/07/28\nStore: Argan Magic\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Argan Magic', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Active Ingredients': 'Vitamin e', 'Unit Count': '2 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.2 x 1.1 x 1.1 inches; 2 Ounces', 'UPC': '605923474046'}\nReview Text: I was hoping more of this oil.<br />First it does not have any \u00e1rgan type of scent... on the contrary it smells like fried oil. Not good. It is not super strong scent, but definitely you can smell it.<br />Second, it does not absorbe fast. I was oily until I fell asleep.<br />It was lightweight.<br />I did felt my skin hidrates the next day, but not quite sure if this is better than other oils that I use.<br />Definitely, I won\u2019t use it, because mainly of the French fries smell.\nReview Title: Mmmmm Im not sure...\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Claw Hair Clips, IKOCO 6 Pack Jaw Clips Stylish Matte Plastic Strong Hold Hair Clamps Box Packaged for Thin Fine Hair with 10Pcs Black Hair ties (2.4Inch)\nReview Date: 2020/12/24\nStore: IKOCO\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'IKOCO', 'Hair Type': 'Fine', 'Color': 'Green,Grey', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material': 'Plastic, Metal, Acrylic', 'Product Dimensions': '6.25 x 4.25 x 2 inches; 5.89 Ounces'}\nReview Text: This set comes in a plastic box, nice detail because you can use it for storage.<br />The clips are bigger than I was expecting, but they are perfect. I have very thin hair and medium length.<br />I like that they lie flat on my head. So they don\u2019t hurt me if I\u2019m using them for long periods of time.<br />Lightweight and well made. They feel sturdy.<br />The set also comes with hair ties, love them! Very soft.

You don\u2019t need too much of it for the entire face. My skin did feel moisturized after using it BUT i just can\u2019t stand the stickiness!!!! I tried with several amounts of it and i could not sleep at all because of the sticky feeling. It was too much. It did not absorb into my skin. Obviously every skin is different, mine is sensitive and dry.<br />The consistency is like a heavy gel.<br />So, for me is a BIG no, but i will use it during summer after sun tanning, before shower. I can see that would be best for me....i even think it will work great if i storage it in the fridge before using it... just like a cooling gel.\nReview Title: Definitely not for every night\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Veencys - Hair Straightening Treatment - Brazilian Keratin - Chocolate Treatment -Maximum Strength-Ideal for Moisturizing Eliminates Frizzy Hairs Smooth Hair 32oz (946 ml)\nReview Date: 2021/09/07\nStore: Veencys\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '9.84 x 3.15 x 3.11 inches; 2.34 Pounds'}\nReview Text: First, this treatment is profesional use\u2026 I can seee that because definitely I couldn\u2019t do it by myself! It is not a simple or fast process.<br />The liquid has a very strong chocolate scent which I prefer over any more chemical scent.<br />You need to follow the instructions very well.<br />I have very thin, short natural wavy hair and I think we did something wrong along the way\u2026 hahaha\u2026<br />Although my hair does feel softer and shinier. But I don\u2019t have a \u201cBrazilian straight\u201d.<br />The liquid is chocolate also in color but I did not see any difference in my own hair.

It hold very good straightening or curling iron.<br />The weft has clippers so it can be more secure to the head. And the wire is adjustable to the size and shape of your head.<br />It is not extremely heavy, but you can feel it when you first put it on, but after a couple of hours you don\u2019t even remember is there.<br />I saw quite a few videos to install it correctly and that made the difference so it can be completely invisible.<br />Comfortable to wear, the weft is not itchy.<br />The pack comes with the hair in a dust bag, a comb and a hair pin.<br />Recommended.\nReview Title: Super soft and shinny hair\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n    Structure your response as:\n   \n    SUMMARY:\n    [Final synthesis of preferences and patterns]",
