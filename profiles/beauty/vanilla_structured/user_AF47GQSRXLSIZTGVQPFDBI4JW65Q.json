After a weeklong dive into Civil War fashions, I wanted a snood! I picked this one. The net part presumably should expand to accommodate one's vhair, but my hair, which reaches my shoulder blades, was far too much, and too thick, for the not-very-stretchy capacity of the net bag part. Also, there was hot glue slopped across the bow part. If you have shorter or fine hair, this might work, as you can always remove strands of hot glue (though you shouldn't have to), but this is definitely not what I was hoping for.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe purchase history indicates a consumer with specific fashion accessory preferences, particularly regarding hair embellishments and jewelry. Consistent patterns reveal dissatisfaction with quality, as evidenced by multiple low ratings (1.0) for items perceived as fragile or poorly constructed. Common themes include a desire for trendy, decorative pieces but an emphasis on durability and functionality, as demonstrated by the juxtaposition of extreme disappointment with a broken ring against praise for a well-made headband.\n\nPrice sensitivity is noted through complaints about low-quality materials in cheap items, suggesting the individual seeks good value for their purchases but may be willing to pay more for superior quality. Their choice of products often centers around aesthetic appeal, with a noted appreciation for unique designs and substantial embellishments, such as rhinestones and velvet.\n\nCore preferences suggest a consumer who favors fashionable hair accessories that make a statement yet also prioritizes overall quality. A tendency to express strong sentiments\u2014both positive and negative\u2014highlights a clear expectation for products that meet their stylish aspirations while remaining durable and comfortable for regular use.",

    "text": "This is a pretty headband, although the stripes of colored beads are not as varied or as bright on the piece I received. It still matches many different garments, so that's fine. And it's comfortable to wear.<br /><br />I was disappointed, though, to see that it's not an oversized, puffy, baroque headband of the type that are suggested alongside it. It's maybe an inch thick, or just a hair more. It's not going to be a big statement headpiece, which is what I was looking for. I'm not sending it back, but I'll probably give it to my 5-year-old niece - it's the perfect size for her lollipop head and she'll think it's beautiful.",
