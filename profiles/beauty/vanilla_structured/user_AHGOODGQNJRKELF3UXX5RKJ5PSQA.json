First, I absolutely love the color of these brushes.  Pink is my favorite color so I couldn\u2019t resist this set of brushes.  Not only do these come in a super cute pink case, but they have adorable pink handles and quite a few of the brushes actually have pink bristles.<br /><br />There are 24 brushes included in this set so there are a wide variety of brushes.  This is a great starter or supplementary set of brushes.  The great thing about makeup brushes is you can use them however you want to use them, so this set of brushes will really cover any use.  I personally love the wide variety of brushes that are great for eye makeup.  I\u2019ve really gotten into eye shadow and creating fun looks and having the right tools is extremely important and this set has pretty much every brush you could possibly need.<br /><br /> Each brush has a practical use, and there are four or five brushes that are great for face makeup as well. I really like the fan brush for highlighting and contouring.  There\u2019s actually a smaller fan brush and a larger fan brush and both are great tools.<br /><br />The quality of these brushes is phenomenal.  I always wash my brushes as soon as I get them and I\u2019ve gotten a few sets of poor quality brushes where as soon as you wash them the handles become loose and come apart due to poor quality, but these held up very well even when fully submerged in water.

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:e8796d02751b17a70fc78f2ff47dcd94]] I\u2019ve used beauty sponges for a long time now and there are A LOT of sponges out there that are just awful.  They\u2019re nothing like the \u201creal\u201d beauty blender and they\u2019re just an absolutely waste of money.  I will be 100% honest, I did not have high hopes for these sponges, BUT I wanted the little stands and two stands at this price would still be a great deal.  You get three different products and I\u2019m going to break down the quality of each product for you.<br /><br />First up is the actual sponges.  I have tried several off-brands of these and this is literally the closest thing I\u2019ve ever bought to the \u201creal\u201d beauty blender, without the super spendy price tag.  This is sponge is amazing!  I gave the 2nd sponge to a friend who didn\u2019t have the money to get a new one and she referred to this sponge as \u201clife\u201d and all I can say is my foundation has literally never looked better. I don\u2019t believe you can currently buy just the sponges, but I\u2019m hoping that will change!<br /><br />Next you have the holders themselves. These are fantastic! Before I got this I would just store mine in a drawer and I know it probably wasn\u2019t the most sanitary practice for something you use to apply face makeup and this is literally so much better.<br /><br />You also get a little pad that\u2019s great for cleaning your brushes.  I think you can also use it for your face, but I prefer to use it for cleaning my brushes as it works great.  Overall this set is just fantastic and well worth the price.  I cannot say enough how much I love the sponges and the holders.  I *thought* I had a fairly decent sponge before I received this one and I was so wrong.<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.",
