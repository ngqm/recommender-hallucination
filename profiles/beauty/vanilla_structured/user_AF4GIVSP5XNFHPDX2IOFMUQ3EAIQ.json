  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe individual displays a strong inclination towards personal care and skincare products, often favoring options that promote skin health, hydration, and overall wellness. Consistent positive ratings indicate a preference for quality items, particularly those that are gentle and effective, marked by frequent mentions of durability, manageability, and softness. \n\nCommon themes reveal an interest in multifunctional products, such as those aimed at exfoliation, relaxation, and hair grooming, with particular attention to ease of use and comfort. Additionally, the buyer tends to favor unscented or fragrance-free formulations, indicating sensitivity or preference for minimalistic products that accommodate sensitive skin. \n\nQuality is deemed more important than price, as shown by the willingness to invest in higher-rated products despite expressing concern about costs; the negative experience with a defective item illustrates a lower tolerance for poor quality. The person also values feedback on performance, as seen in their responses related to effectiveness over time. \n\nOverall, core preferences encompass a focus on skincare and wellness that emphasizes quality, multifunctionality, gentleness, and a positive sensory experience, while also exhibiting some price consciousness when quality is perceived to suffer.",
