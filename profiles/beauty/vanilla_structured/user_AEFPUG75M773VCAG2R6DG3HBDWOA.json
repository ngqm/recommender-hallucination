I love the powerful effects of retinol; less lines, no more eyebrow wrinkles, firmer skin with a softer texture!! You just can't go wrong. I use it daily followed by a gentle moisturizer or vitamin C serum with jojoba oil! My pores are smaller. My acne has basically ceased (other than that time of the month when my hormones go crazy and even then it's still way better than it normally used to be!) I have even started using this on the back of my hands, ankles, knees, and chest to keep those areas hydrated and hopefully keep them from getting old looking!! I'm only 33 so my skin care journey is just starting to kick into full swing and now I'm really trying to keep ahead of the aging curve!! I know from my mom how quickly life can creep up on you before you know it! Plus, I currently smoke cigs so I need all the hydration I can get!! I think this retinol is doing an amazing job of holding off the signs of aging and I definitely plan to continue buying this serum!

I don't have very dark circles but I do have them a little bit. I haven't noticed any change in the appearance of those dark spots but I have noticed that my puffiness and fine lines have been responding well to this cream. I can feel my eyes tightening up as the cream dries. I have noticed my skin feels more hydrated and looks and feels more firm! It's very easy to use and doesn't have a bad smell!! All I do is getting a very small amount on the tip of my middle finger then very gently tap it into the skin all around that area until it's absorbed. It takes a good few minutes but I try to be very gentle so I don't make that area look worse!! I use it in the morning as part of my moisturizing routine and then at night in my bedtime routine. This is a very great product! I do have one purple blood vein that runs down from my right eye that has recently popped up and this cream seems to be helping to make that less visible to me!! I love that!! Luckily, I found this product in time to hopefully keep that at bay!

My mom and I like to make organic foundations as part of our products for sale at craft booths. These containers were too small to use for selling our product but they work very well as samples so we can let people try before they buy! It came with a bunch of labels that fit perfectly on the lids so we printed our contact info on them and hand them out when we're just walking around trying to drum up business! They are small but very handy! As far as the amount I really do not know the exact measurements but it is basically big enough to hold enough foundation for about 5-7 applications. The jar itself is about the size of a quarter and about half an inch tall. I am so happy we found these!! They are such a great marketing tool! And they are really excellent quality, I was so worried about the lids coming off but every single one has stayed tight!
