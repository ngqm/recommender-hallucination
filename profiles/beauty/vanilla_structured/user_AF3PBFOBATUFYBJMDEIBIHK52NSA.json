    "text": "My wife has been curious about gentle exfoliating products, so when I saw this hydration kit I decided to get it for her to try. It's turned out to be mostly a great product.<br /><br />It comes in a lovely package. The minimalist package coloring, as well as the design of the dispensers, makes a very attractive presentation. The dispensers are also easy to use, and pleasant to hold. It would make a lovely gift.<br /><br />This product is very effective. My wife has now used the entire supply. She says that the wash is smooth to apply, easy to cover her face with it. It washes off quickly, resulting in what she calls a \"renewed\" sensation. Following the wash, she uses the moisturizer, and says it soaks into her skin naturally, leaving a very nice, non-oily feeling. However, my wife does not like the strong scent. She has experimented with the moisturizing oils that come with this. She says they definitely moisturize nicely, and she only needs a couple of dabs of the oils for nice effect. They do better than the scented cream in many ways, but she says they would not be great every day. The best combination would be the exfoliating element, followed by the moisturizing cream, but with no scent. If you don't mind strongly-scented creams, this might be different for you!<br /><br />Overall, this is a terrific set. Except for the strong scent of the moisturizer, I highly recommend it.",
