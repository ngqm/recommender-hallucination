Really. We call that a \"glow\" in the south, but it's just plain sweat, and it runs into my eyes, and then my eyes are stinging, my glasses get fogged and wet, and I'm just one huge, damp, panicky  blind mess.<br /><br />Which may be normal when you're working out, but when you're, say, touring the greenhouse or strolling the beach, I'm pretty sure it's unattractive.

The headband gets damp; my face stays dry. I normally wear a ball cap when I garden - hoping I won't burn my head while basically risking heat exhaustion - and I put this on first, then the cap.  The headband is a little bit bulky, being double thickness, but not too much so; wonder of wonders, wearing it, my face has stayed dry for the entire time I've been outside. No sweaty face, no drippy mess, no glasses I can't see through (or gnats interested in this new swampy damp visitor). I would wear these if they were hideous, they're so effective, but they're not - navy with flowers or white with flowers - I could wear them as a fashion statement.

It's like clear mascara, so it helps to brush - and hold - each existing hair.  It does have an expiration date, so make sure the product you're using isn't past the date.<br /><br />I have to admit I'm not a fan of the \"feathery\" eyebrow look, but I am a fan of ensuring that what eyebrow you have stays in place and provides a good base to build on, which this product supports.<br /><br />Once you use this gel, you can augment your shaped eyebrows with eyebrow shadow, which can provide a light shaping line, and help fill your brow in with consistent shading.  You can build on that, or use by itself a pencil, to add additional depth or go for that vintage look. This gel just gives you another tool to make your brows more defined.\nReview Title: Shape Eyebrows, Shape Face!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Lip Liner Set 12 Colors Natural Lip Liner Makeup Pencil Long Lasting Matte Velvet Lip Liner\nReview Date: 2021/05/13\nStore: Marine Forest\nAverage Rating: 3.8\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Marine Forest', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Item Form': 'Pencil', 'Finish Type': 'Matte,Velvet', 'Product Benefits': 'Smoothening', 'Package Dimensions': '6.42 x 2.28 x 0.94 inches; 2.24 Ounces', 'UPC': '729843697955'}\nReview Text: Like most reviewers, the prospect of 12 lip liners was too tempting to pass up. I use soft crayon liners, or a brush of my lipstick, to create an one-the-spot liner all the time - so this seemed like a great buy.<br /><br />These are clearly imported. The good news is the manufacturer actually lists the ingredients on the box;  I've taken a photo of the box so you can see the ingredients - personally, I don't recommend using products where you can't see the ingredients before you order.<br /><br />The pencils you get are an interesting range, and seem to vary from package to package. Mine were in a variety of colors; the one color I was looking for - a basic nude - was not in my package - but I got a range of plums (which I never wear) and pinks (which I rarely wear).<br /><br />If you've used any of your mom's pencils, you're familiar with carmine, which can flake. You have to be careful with the pressure used to avoid application debris, but it's the best to stop lipstick from bleeding or feathering. Since none of the colors were perfect, I used a lighter pink with my lipstick so it wasn't noticeable, and it worked fine.\nReview Title: Cost Effecctive Mixed Bag\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: CELIMAX The Real Sedum Aqua Boosting Essence - with 65.33% Sedum Extract, Hyaluronic Acid Complex, 150ml\nReview Date: 2021/06/08\nStore: CELIMAX\nAverage Rating: 4.6\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'CELIMAX', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Active Ingredients': 'Hyaluronic acid', 'Unit Count': '5.07 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '9 x 3 x 2.25 inches; 9.59 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I really love this hydrating and moisturizing product.<br /><br />I wasn't sure I would at first. Although the box is in English, and has clear instructions and ingredients, the product itself lacks those things. Celimax comes in a streamlined bottle that looks like mineral water. Aside from the general disaster that could pose with small children, the FDA requires cosmetic products sold in the USA list their ingredients on the bottle in English.<br /><br />The ingredients, by the way, which I wish Amazon would leave a spot for cosmetic vendors to include in their listings, so we would know before we order in case of allergies, are Sedum Sarmentosum, Butylene Glycol, Water, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Glycereth-26, Polyglutamic Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramide NP, Xylityglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Dipotassium Glycrrhizate, Citrus Tangerina Peel Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia Oil, Glucose, Phospholifpids, Diethoxyethyl Succinate, Caprylic/Capric Triclyceride, Ammonium Acryloylidimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Hydrogenated Lecithin, C12-13 Pareth-9, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin.<br /><br />Having said that, I poured a little bit of the product onto a cotton pad in the evening and dabbed it onto my face, and onto the back of my hands. It initially felt just  a bit tacky, but almost immediately absorbed. I followed up on my face with my nightly cream. My face this morning feels AMAZING. The moisture level is through the roof.<br /><br />I also want to mention fragrance. Like 95% of chronic migraine headache sufferers, I have a sensitive sense of smell. Anything cosmetic that has perfume (think lip smackers) or added scent has the potential to make me nauseous and bring on a migraine. This had just a faint authentic citrus smell, vaguely pleasant, which thankfully disappeared within a few seconds of hitting the cotton ball. That kind of fragrance is ideal.<br /><br />And the effects are just amazing. I don't see my face all day, but I can sure see my hands on the keyboard. My hands are visibly more plumper, less dry, and  more hydrated. I am loving this product. Hopefully they're in process with getting their bottle properly labelled and safe for distribution in the United States, because this is my new routine.

And I don't get to say that very often.  My experience with serums, toners, and lotions is mainly one of \"I hope they don't.\"<br /><br />As in, I hope they don't have \"fragrance,\" because invariably, that gives me a horrific headache and I have to wash the stuff off within minutes of application. As in, I hope they're not \"sticky,\" because for some reason, that means they stay on the surface of my skin all night long, sticking to the pillow or my pajamas (or worse, the hubs). As in, I hope they don't do something \"creative with ingredients\" because my skin is pretty tolerant, but can only take so much.<br /><br />This serum has no fragrance, doesn't cause endless stickiness on the surface of my skin, doesn't do anything scary with the ingredients - and smooths over the problem spots on my face. I love that the ingredients are organic (on the box as well as on the site - I'm assuming \"certified organic\" is the same in the U.S. as it is in France) and I like the way the lotion feels. Recognizing, of course, that we all have individual skin that reacts differently, this is certainly a winner for me.\nReview Title: Not Sticky, No Smell - Smooths Winkles\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: QTMY Wide Headbands Fashion Women Baroque Crystal Gemstone Hair Accessories Head Band Fashion Headwear Hairbands for Women\nReview Date: 2021/06/21\nStore: QTMY\nAverage Rating: 3.6\nProduct Details: {'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Occasion': 'Wedding, Birthday', 'Material': 'Plastic', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Brand': 'QTMY', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.5 x 5.94 x 1.97 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'ZJ'}\nReview Text: I have a major weakness for rhinestones. And this headband is just chock full of them. And when the headband arrived, they were all firmly affixed, ready to wear, not a flaw in sight...and SO attractive.<br /><br />I have short hair, so I can't do the major flip or wrap-around hairdo that perhaps others have tried, and  I haven't experienced the hair catching in the headband at all. The band is not tight, which is generally -my- major complaint. It's a little large, but rests comfortably behind my ears.<br /><br />And it's SO glittery! the rhinestones are just lovely. Couldn't be happier. My model (the Otter) is quite taken with the look. I plan on wearing the headband regularly. I will be the envy of all, I'm sure.\nReview Title: Awesome Glitter!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Burt's Bees Baby Bath Time Kit with Ultra Gentle Lotion, Bubble Bath, Foaming Shampoo & Wash, Nourishing Baby Oil, and Face & Hand Cloths\nReview Date: 2021/06/26\nStore: Burt's Bees\nProduct Description: ['Babies deserve a fresh start in life with ingredients from nature that are gentle for their delicate skin.

I'm not sharing them generously with anyone - they're all for me, me, me.<br /><br />First of all, I like that the products are designed for sensitive skin. Like most people, I have a mix of really delicate skin and skin on which I could get a tattoo and not notice. So I love that these products support my delicate skin areas.<br /><br />And I like that Burt's uses natural origin ingredients - and no synthetic fragrances. I feel like I type this in every review: like 1B (in 2021) people, 3:1 of which are women, I suffer from chronic migraines. And like 95% of those sufferers, I have a sensitive sense of smell, and for me, artificial fragrances are dreadful. (I've found artificially made \"Honey\" to be one of the worst.) Burt's Bees products consistently have mild, unobtrusive natural scents.<br /><br />That's not to say I like every single Burt's Bees product, but their baby skin care products leave my adult skin feeling baby soft. I especially like the apricot baby oil, which is extra softening, smells faintly of apricot and leaves my skin feeling wonderful.  And I'm so happy that they have the ingredients not just on the products, but listed on Amazon as well, so we know in advance what we're getting. Awesome. Yes, I'm the baby here, and happy to be one if that means I get to use these great products.\nReview Title: LOVE This Burt's Bees Package!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Silicone Facial Cleansing Brush, Three-sided Facial Lip Scrubber Brush Face Massager for Men and Women, 2PCS\nReview Date: 2021/07/05\nStore: BONLY\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '7.99 x 2.83 x 2.8 inches; 3.53 Ounces', 'UPC': '661918753152'}\nReview Text: I have a bunch of these little brushes. I love the feel of the silicone \"bristles.\" So I have some for lip exfoliation, a few for facial massages, and even separate ones for facial cleansing. They're easy to clean and so soft.<br /><br />What I haven't had is a single brush that does it all. And when you travel, it's just ridiculous to be carrying not only a toothbrush, a sponge blender, and two makeup brushes, but three additional silicon brushes. You end up with a makeup tote instead of a makeup case, and suddenly you're checking a bag just because of your annoyingly overstuffed makeup bag.<br /><br />Not me, because now I have one, and a spare, silicon brush that does it all. One side for massage (which, by the way, if I am so lacking in good taste, I can do in the comfort of my seat on the plane), one side for cleaning, and one appropriately small-sized area for exfoliating lip and/or nose. And that lip exfoliation is one of my favorites - back in college, we used to grab a towel and do a quick scrub before putting on lipstick, but this is so much nicer to your lips.<br /><br />And these two brushes are so much more efficient and space saving for me.\nReview Title: Massages, Cleans, Exfoliates Lips\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Eyebrow Pencil 2 Pcs Waterproof Dark Brown and Light Brown Long Lasting Eyebrow Makeup Pen with 4 Fork Tips Head Upgrade Design\nReview Date: 2021/07/15\nStore: Marine Forest\nAverage Rating: 2.7\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Marine Forest', 'Item Form': 'Pencil', 'Finish Type': 'Natural', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Product Benefits': 'Long Lasting', 'Product Dimensions': '4.92 x 0.71 x 0.71 inches; 1.12 Ounces', 'UPC': '729843788950'}\nReview Text: I'm an eyebrow fanatic, and I've used eyebrow wax, powder, pencils and stencils. I'm a huge fan of shaping and powder - that seems to work best for me - but I've never seen applicators like these so I thought I would give them a try.<br /><br />Mine didn't arrive overly wet like those of other reviewers; they just seemed to be like normal pens. But the application was uneven and I did have to press hard to get any color other than simply a dark shading (like the side of a lead pencil).<br /><br />Once I did use firm pressure, it was a little like using an old eyebrow pencil - but less forgiving with the multi-levels. Be sure to shape your eyebrow first, then apply the pen; don't expect the pen to comb as well as draw. The pen can provide the dramatically even look, or, with a lot of manipulation, a more natural look (which I prefer).<br /><br />I didn't find the pen to be as long-lasting as expected.  I try to be really careful in application, as I don't like to abuse my eyebrows or skin, and remove product only using makeup remover.  However, I do perspire on my t-zones  and that perspiration completely defeated the eyebrow pencil.<br /><br />This is an interesting innovation with the four-tier brush - and it may work well for others, just not for me. Ingredients, which I so appreciate being noted on the box: water, acrylic ester copolymer, propylene glycol, hydroxyethyl cellulose, c177491, c177492.\nReview Title: Like a Less Forgiving Old-Style Pencil\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: YNN Y-Not-Natural Organic Kakadu Plum Extract Anti-Aging Moisturizer by Jillaroo \u2013 100g | Vitamins E, C, A | Fragrance Free Advanced Skin Care and Wrinkle Removal (Kakadu Plum)\u2026\nReview Date: 2021/08/07\nStore: YNN Y-Not-Natural\nAverage Rating: 4.2\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'YNN Y-Not-Natural', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '3.5274 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Package Dimensions': '6.54 x 1.85 x 1.81 inches; 3.53 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Y-Not Natural Aust Pty Ltd'}\nReview Text: I constantly use moisturizer, both on my face and all over. Huge fan of keeping my skin moist and soft. This product had all the right ingredients, plus that enticing \"fragrance free.\"<br /><br />But this product definitely has a scent to it; perhaps they just mean there's no added fragrance when they designate the product as \"fragrance free.\" That scent might be due to the plum extract, but I'm a plum fan, and the smell was a bit dank and musty for that (although this is my super-sensitive sense of smell doing an interpretation).<br /><br />Like 2 billion people (in 2021), I suffer from chronic migraine headaches, and like 95% of those, I'm sensitive to smells. Very sensitive. Too much laundry soap is untenable. I can handle most essential oils, but manufactured scents may actually trigger a migraine. I can't have such a smell anywhere close to my nose, like, say, on my skin (or especially on my face).<br /><br />Although the initial application felt wonderful on my arm, where I test products, the smell was intolerable for me, and I had to wipe it off. I'm really bummed - it felt exceptionally good, but I just couldn't cope with the scent. That's definitely a me thing - not everyone is so scent-sensitive, and it may work great for you...just not for me.\nReview Title: NOT Unscented.\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Bridal Hair Comb, Wekin Wedding Hair Comb Wedding Hair Accessories for Brides, Handmade Floral Hair Piece for Wedding(Silver 4.8\")\nReview Date: 2021/08/07\nStore: JOMOQ\nAverage Rating: 4.3\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'JOMOQ', 'Hair Type': 'Damaged', 'Color': 'Silver', 'Power Source': 'Manual', 'Unit Count': '2.7161 Ounce', 'Package Dimensions': '4.96 x 4.17 x 0.75 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '756588246476'}\nReview Text: This silver metal comb, on which two large, and three small, metal flowers are secured, is 1.5 x 1.5 inches. Each flower has a crystal center; the large flowers have an additional five crystals around the center and two hanging crystals. There are four metal leaf fronds with pearl 'fronds' attached.<br /><br />The wire is delicate, so the comb is not designed for rough treatment (definitely not for children). But you can carefully shape both the brooch, and the comb tines - which are integrated - to hold it in place. My hair is thick, but short, and it works fine with my current styling. When I had long hair, I wore combs a lot, and if I still had that length, I'd probably wear this comb as a decoration, rather than to secure my hair in a certain way. The comb is somewhat fragile - and if you want to reuse it, you have to be careful.<br /><br />It arrived in a jewelry-size box with a seal, and padding - great for a gift. Just lovely. (Although the photo, on my screen, makes the flowers look slightly gold, they are a more wedding silver/white.

And it's one of the best I've received. It arrived in a sealed box, with a pull out drawer rather than just a lift-off lid - nice presentation.<br /><br />The comb is metal, two inches long and an 1.25 inches wide. The teeth are close together, so it worked well on the short area of my hair as well as long. Because it is a shorter comb, though, I'm not sure it could hold a large amount of hair in a style; it's more of a post-style add-on. The comb is soldered to the decoration in two places so it seems securely put together.<br /><br />The decoration itself is just amazing sparkle, with three small crystals used to make each leaf, larger crystals for drops, and small flower designs made up of crystals.  The decoration is about four inches at the widest point. It seems sturdy enough to last longer than one event - unlike most - and is really just lovely.

After two squeezes. You get three little dots on the brush with each squeeze, brush those on with the applicator, and wow.<br /><br />Having said that, it is a primer - so it doesn't provide all over color. It does brighten your skin - because it's white - and it does tighten. And you have to be careful (or at least, I have to be careful) not to get it near your eyes or mouth, where lots of lines are, because it tastes dreadful and I'm sure it's not designed for eyes.

Even though it's not like he's using it regularly - actually, he uses it whenever I'm allowed to spray it on him after his shower and before he goes to bed. I'd say I manage to get to him about three times a week.

It's like clear mascara, so it helps to brush - and hold - each existing hair.  It does have an expiration date, so make sure the product you're using isn't past the date.<br /><br />I have to admit I'm not a fan of the \"feathery\" eyebrow look, but I am a fan of ensuring that what eyebrow you have stays in place and provides a good base to build on, which this product supports.<br /><br />Once you use this gel, you can augment your shaped eyebrows with eyebrow shadow, which can provide a light shaping line, and help fill your brow in with consistent shading.  You can build on that, or use by itself a pencil, to add additional depth or go for that vintage look. This gel just gives you another tool to make your brows more defined.\nShape Eyebrows, Shape Face!\nLip Liner Set 12 Colors Natural Lip Liner Makeup Pencil Long Lasting Matte Velvet Lip Liner\nMarine Forest\n{'Brand': 'Marine Forest', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Item Form': 'Pencil', 'Finish Type': 'Matte,Velvet', 'Product Benefits': 'Smoothening', 'Package Dimensions': '6.42 x 2.28 x 0.94 inches; 2.24 Ounces', 'UPC': '729843697955'}\nLike most reviewers, the prospect of 12 lip liners was too tempting to pass up. I use soft crayon liners, or a brush of my lipstick, to create an one-the-spot liner all the time - so this seemed like a great buy.<br /><br />These are clearly imported. The good news is the manufacturer actually lists the ingredients on the box;  I've taken a photo of the box so you can see the ingredients - personally, I don't recommend using products where you can't see the ingredients before you order.<br /><br />The pencils you get are an interesting range, and seem to vary from package to package. Mine were in a variety of colors; the one color I was looking for - a basic nude - was not in my package - but I got a range of plums (which I never wear) and pinks (which I rarely wear).<br /><br />If you've used any of your mom's pencils, you're familiar with carmine, which can flake. You have to be careful with the pressure used to avoid application debris, but it's the best to stop lipstick from bleeding or feathering. Since none of the colors were perfect, I used a lighter pink with my lipstick so it wasn't noticeable, and it worked fine.\nCost Effecctive Mixed Bag\nCELIMAX The Real Sedum Aqua Boosting Essence - with 65.33% Sedum Extract, Hyaluronic Acid Complex, 150ml\nCELIMAX\n{'Brand': 'CELIMAX', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Active Ingredients': 'Hyaluronic acid', 'Unit Count': '5.07 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '9 x 3 x 2.25 inches; 9.59 Ounces'}\nI really love this hydrating and moisturizing product.<br /><br />I wasn't sure I would at first. Although the box is in English, and has clear instructions and ingredients, the product itself lacks those things. Celimax comes in a streamlined bottle that looks like mineral water. Aside from the general disaster that could pose with small children, the FDA requires cosmetic products sold in the USA list their ingredients on the bottle in English.<br /><br />The ingredients, by the way, which I wish Amazon would leave a spot for cosmetic vendors to include in their listings, so we would know before we order in case of allergies, are Sedum Sarmentosum, Butylene Glycol, Water, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Glycereth-26, Polyglutamic Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramide NP, Xylityglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Dipotassium Glycrrhizate, Citrus Tangerina Peel Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia Oil, Glucose, Phospholifpids, Diethoxyethyl Succinate, Caprylic/Capric Triclyceride, Ammonium Acryloylidimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Hydrogenated Lecithin, C12-13 Pareth-9, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin.<br /><br />Having said that, I poured a little bit of the product onto a cotton pad in the evening and dabbed it onto my face, and onto the back of my hands. It initially felt just  a bit tacky, but almost immediately absorbed. I followed up on my face with my nightly cream. My face this morning feels AMAZING. The moisture level is through the roof.<br /><br />I also want to mention fragrance. Like 95% of chronic migraine headache sufferers, I have a sensitive sense of smell. Anything cosmetic that has perfume (think lip smackers) or added scent has the potential to make me nauseous and bring on a migraine. This had just a faint authentic citrus smell, vaguely pleasant, which thankfully disappeared within a few seconds of hitting the cotton ball. That kind of fragrance is ideal.<br /><br />And the effects are just amazing. I don't see my face all day, but I can sure see my hands on the keyboard. My hands are visibly more plumper, less dry, and  more hydrated. I am loving this product. Hopefully they're in process with getting their bottle properly labelled and safe for distribution in the United States, because this is my new routine. Such results!\nLove this Hydration!\n100% Organic Vitamin E Serum Face Oil \u2013 Premium 2 oz. by Cutis Sanus \u2013 Natural Advanced Hair, Nails, Skin Care Face Serum, For Reducing Scars & Stretch Marks, Wrinkles & Fine Lines\nCutis Sanus\n{'Product Benefits': 'Nourishing, Moisturize', 'Use for': 'Face', 'Brand': 'Cutis Sanus', 'Material Feature': 'Organic, Natural, Vegan', 'Active Ingredients': 'argan_oil', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.65 x 2.68 x 1.57 inches; 2.2 Pounds', 'Item model number': '627843597940', 'UPC': '627843597940'}\nI really like this Vitamin E Serum. And I don't get to say that very often.  My experience with serums, toners, and lotions is mainly one of \"I hope they don't.\"<br /><br />As in, I hope they don't have \"fragrance,\" because invariably, that gives me a horrific headache and I have to wash the stuff off within minutes of application. As in, I hope they're not \"sticky,\" because for some reason, that means they stay on the surface of my skin all night long, sticking to the pillow or my pajamas (or worse, the hubs). As in, I hope they don't do something \"creative with ingredients\" because my skin is pretty tolerant, but can only take so much.<br /><br />This serum has no fragrance, doesn't cause endless stickiness on the surface of my skin, doesn't do anything scary with the ingredients - and smooths over the problem spots on my face. I love that the ingredients are organic (on the box as well as on the site - I'm assuming \"certified organic\" is the same in the U.S. as it is in France) and I like the way the lotion feels. Recognizing, of course, that we all have individual skin that reacts differently, this is certainly a winner for me.\nNot Sticky, No Smell - Smooths Winkles\nQTMY Wide Headbands Fashion Women Baroque Crystal Gemstone Hair Accessories Head Band Fashion Headwear Hairbands for Women\nQTMY\n{'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Occasion': 'Wedding, Birthday', 'Material': 'Plastic', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Brand': 'QTMY', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.5 x 5.94 x 1.97 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'ZJ'}\nI have a major weakness for rhinestones. And this headband is just chock full of them. And when the headband arrived, they were all firmly affixed, ready to wear, not a flaw in sight...and SO attractive.<br /><br />I have short hair, so I can't do the major flip or wrap-around hairdo that perhaps others have tried, and  I haven't experienced the hair catching in the headband at all. The band is not tight, which is generally -my- major complaint. It's a little large, but rests comfortably behind my ears.<br /><br />And it's SO glittery! the rhinestones are just lovely. Couldn't be happier. My model (the Otter) is quite taken with the look. I plan on wearing the headband regularly. I will be the envy of all, I'm sure.\nAwesome Glitter!\nBurt's Bees Baby Bath Time Kit with Ultra Gentle Lotion, Bubble Bath, Foaming Shampoo & Wash, Nourishing Baby Oil, and Face & Hand Cloths\nBurt's Bees\n['Babies deserve a fresh start in life with ingredients from nature that are gentle for their delicate skin.

I'm not sharing them generously with anyone - they're all for me, me, me.<br /><br />First of all, I like that the products are designed for sensitive skin. Like most people, I have a mix of really delicate skin and skin on which I could get a tattoo and not notice. So I love that these products support my delicate skin areas.<br /><br />And I like that Burt's uses natural origin ingredients - and no synthetic fragrances. I feel like I type this in every review: like 1B (in 2021) people, 3:1 of which are women, I suffer from chronic migraines. And like 95% of those sufferers, I have a sensitive sense of smell, and for me, artificial fragrances are dreadful. (I've found artificially made \"Honey\" to be one of the worst.) Burt's Bees products consistently have mild, unobtrusive natural scents.<br /><br />That's not to say I like every single Burt's Bees product, but their baby skin care products leave my adult skin feeling baby soft. I especially like the apricot baby oil, which is extra softening, smells faintly of apricot and leaves my skin feeling wonderful.  And I'm so happy that they have the ingredients not just on the products, but listed on Amazon as well, so we know in advance what we're getting. Awesome. Yes, I'm the baby here, and happy to be one if that means I get to use these great products.\nLOVE This Burt's Bees Package!\nSilicone Facial Cleansing Brush, Three-sided Facial Lip Scrubber Brush Face Massager for Men and Women, 2PCS\nBONLY\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.99 x 2.83 x 2.8 inches; 3.53 Ounces', 'UPC': '661918753152'}\nI have a bunch of these little brushes. I love the feel of the silicone \"bristles.\" So I have some for lip exfoliation, a few for facial massages, and even separate ones for facial cleansing. They're easy to clean and so soft.<br /><br />What I haven't had is a single brush that does it all. And when you travel, it's just ridiculous to be carrying not only a toothbrush, a sponge blender, and two makeup brushes, but three additional silicon brushes. You end up with a makeup tote instead of a makeup case, and suddenly you're checking a bag just because of your annoyingly overstuffed makeup bag.<br /><br />Not me, because now I have one, and a spare, silicon brush that does it all. One side for massage (which, by the way, if I am so lacking in good taste, I can do in the comfort of my seat on the plane), one side for cleaning, and one appropriately small-sized area for exfoliating lip and/or nose. And that lip exfoliation is one of my favorites - back in college, we used to grab a towel and do a quick scrub before putting on lipstick, but this is so much nicer to your lips.<br /><br />And these two brushes are so much more efficient and space saving for me.\nMassages, Cleans, Exfoliates Lips\nEyebrow Pencil 2 Pcs Waterproof Dark Brown and Light Brown Long Lasting Eyebrow Makeup Pen with 4 Fork Tips Head Upgrade Design\nMarine Forest\n{'Brand': 'Marine Forest', 'Item Form': 'Pencil', 'Finish Type': 'Natural', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Product Benefits': 'Long Lasting', 'Product Dimensions': '4.92 x 0.71 x 0.71 inches; 1.12 Ounces', 'UPC': '729843788950'}\nI'm an eyebrow fanatic, and I've used eyebrow wax, powder, pencils and stencils. I'm a huge fan of shaping and powder - that seems to work best for me - but I've never seen applicators like these so I thought I would give them a try.<br /><br />Mine didn't arrive overly wet like those of other reviewers; they just seemed to be like normal pens. But the application was uneven and I did have to press hard to get any color other than simply a dark shading (like the side of a lead pencil).<br /><br />Once I did use firm pressure, it was a little like using an old eyebrow pencil - but less forgiving with the multi-levels. Be sure to shape your eyebrow first, then apply the pen; don't expect the pen to comb as well as draw. The pen can provide the dramatically even look, or, with a lot of manipulation, a more natural look (which I prefer).<br /><br />I didn't find the pen to be as long-lasting as expected.  I try to be really careful in application, as I don't like to abuse my eyebrows or skin, and remove product only using makeup remover.  However, I do perspire on my t-zones  and that perspiration completely defeated the eyebrow pencil.<br /><br />This is an interesting innovation with the four-tier brush - and it may work well for others, just not for me. Ingredients, which I so appreciate being noted on the box: water, acrylic ester copolymer, propylene glycol, hydroxyethyl cellulose, c177491, c177492.\nLike a Less Forgiving Old-Style Pencil\nYNN Y-Not-Natural Organic Kakadu Plum Extract Anti-Aging Moisturizer by Jillaroo \u2013 100g | Vitamins E, C, A | Fragrance Free Advanced Skin Care and Wrinkle Removal (Kakadu Plum)\u2026\nYNN Y-Not-Natural\n{'Brand': 'YNN Y-Not-Natural', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '3.5274 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Package Dimensions': '6.54 x 1.85 x 1.81 inches; 3.53 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Y-Not Natural Aust Pty Ltd'}\nI constantly use moisturizer, both on my face and all over. Huge fan of keeping my skin moist and soft. This product had all the right ingredients, plus that enticing \"fragrance free.\"<br /><br />But this product definitely has a scent to it; perhaps they just mean there's no added fragrance when they designate the product as \"fragrance free.\" That scent might be due to the plum extract, but I'm a plum fan, and the smell was a bit dank and musty for that (although this is my super-sensitive sense of smell doing an interpretation).<br /><br />Like 2 billion people (in 2021), I suffer from chronic migraine headaches, and like 95% of those, I'm sensitive to smells. Very sensitive. Too much laundry soap is untenable. I can handle most essential oils, but manufactured scents may actually trigger a migraine. I can't have such a smell anywhere close to my nose, like, say, on my skin (or especially on my face).<br /><br />Although the initial application felt wonderful on my arm, where I test products, the smell was intolerable for me, and I had to wipe it off. I'm really bummed - it felt exceptionally good, but I just couldn't cope with the scent. That's definitely a me thing - not everyone is so scent-sensitive, and it may work great for you...just not for me.\nNOT Unscented.\nBridal Hair Comb, Wekin Wedding Hair Comb Wedding Hair Accessories for Brides, Handmade Floral Hair Piece for Wedding(Silver 4.8\")\nJOMOQ\n{'Brand': 'JOMOQ', 'Hair Type': 'Damaged', 'Color': 'Silver', 'Power Source': 'Manual', 'Unit Count': '2.7161 Ounce', 'Package Dimensions': '4.96 x 4.17 x 0.75 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '756588246476'}\nThis silver metal comb, on which two large, and three small, metal flowers are secured, is 1.5 x 1.5 inches. Each flower has a crystal center; the large flowers have an additional five crystals around the center and two hanging crystals. There are four metal leaf fronds with pearl 'fronds' attached.<br /><br />The wire is delicate, so the comb is not designed for rough treatment (definitely not for children). But you can carefully shape both the brooch, and the comb tines - which are integrated - to hold it in place. My hair is thick, but short, and it works fine with my current styling. When I had long hair, I wore combs a lot, and if I still had that length, I'd probably wear this comb as a decoration, rather than to secure my hair in a certain way. The comb is somewhat fragile - and if you want to reuse it, you have to be careful.<br /><br />It arrived in a jewelry-size box with a seal, and padding - great for a gift. Just lovely. (Although the photo, on my screen, makes the flowers look slightly gold, they are a more wedding silver/white. Perhaps they show up properly on your screen!)\nBeautiful Silver Floral Comb\nBEHPAY Rhinestone Crystal Wedding Hair Side Comb Bridal Hair Accessories Bride Hair Piece for Women and Girl Sliver Color\nBEHPAY\n{'Brand': 'BEHPAY', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Power Source': 'Manual', 'Unit Count': '2.4692 Ounce', 'Package Dimensions': '3.58 x 3.5 x 1.26 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '735209301749'}\nI just can't have enough sparkle in my life, so this comb seemed tailor-made for me. And it's one of the best I've received. It arrived in a sealed box, with a pull out drawer rather than just a lift-off lid - nice presentation.<br /><br />The comb is metal, two inches long and an 1.25 inches wide. The teeth are close together, so it worked well on the short area of my hair as well as long. Because it is a shorter comb, though, I'm not sure it could hold a large amount of hair in a style; it's more of a post-style add-on. The comb is soldered to the decoration in two places so it seems securely put together.<br /><br />The decoration itself is just amazing sparkle, with three small crystals used to make each leaf, larger crystals for drops, and small flower designs made up of crystals.  The decoration is about four inches at the widest point. It seems sturdy enough to last longer than one event - unlike most - and is really just lovely. I'm quite happy with it and may have to wear it around the house. Every day. It's just that perfect.\nBeautiful Comb\nYERMA Makeup Face Primer with Brush - Instant Brightening and Whitening, Minimize Pores and Fine Lines, Natural Ingredients Moisturizing Primer for All Skin Types, Illuminate and smooth skin surface\nYerma\n{'Brand': 'Yerma', 'Product Benefits': 'Whitening', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Package Information': 'Tube', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '6.34 x 5.08 x 1.14 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '728886787418'}\nIn this world of hyperbole, particularly in the cosmetic industry, it's rare that you find something that does exactly what it says. And when I tried this product I stood in the mirror looking at my laugh lines with a particularly jaundiced view. Only to be proven wrong.<br /><br />This product minimized my laugh lines. After two squeezes. You get three little dots on the brush with each squeeze, brush those on with the applicator, and wow.<br /><br />Having said that, it is a primer - so it doesn't provide all over color. It does brighten your skin - because it's white - and it does tighten. And you have to be careful (or at least, I have to be careful) not to get it near your eyes or mouth, where lots of lines are, because it tastes dreadful and I'm sure it's not designed for eyes. But it certainly works a miracle.<br /><br />In the past, I've used a clear primer with a bit of a tan color. No more. This is my new daily. I'm hooked.\nDoes What It Says.\nBAWYU | All is Made of Bamboo Sustainable Gifts | Toothbrush, Body Brush, Bamboo Fiber Towel, Comb, Storage bag | Guest Room Essentials Bathroom, Home Preparation Products | Shower Wash Kit \uff086 Pack\uff09\nBAWYU\n{'Package Dimensions': '8.03 x 5.24 x 2.2 inches; 10.05 Ounces', 'UPC': '723890958878'}\nThis is a lovely set of bamboo elements. I love the toothbrushes, which have different colored bristles and trim at the bottom so you don't get them mixed up - and the comb, with the wide teeth, perfect for after a shower. The brush is ideal for dry brushing, of which I'm a huge fan - great for removing dry skin prior to a shower or bath. The whole kit comes with a washcloth, and a carrying bag.<br /><br />It's depicted on the Amazon site with a tray, which is not included, unfortunately - that would have been extra lovely - but as is, this is a nice set to keep in your guest room, to take with you when traveling, or as a gift. It's nicely put together.\nHarmonious Bamboo Set\nBack Acne Treatment Spray | Bacne Cure Treatment Spray | Clears Back Acne, Body Acne, Chest Acne, Butt Acne, Ingrown Hairs & Razor Bumps | Formulated with Natural Ingredients, Cruelty-free | 5.1 oz\nPROOT\n{'Item Form': 'mist', 'Brand': 'PROOT', 'Skin Type': 'Oily, Combination, Dry, Normal', 'Use for': 'Whole Body', 'Item Volume': '5.1 Fluid Ounces', 'Product Dimensions': '1.7 x 1.7 x 7 inches; 7.48 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Choice Cosmetics Co.,Ltd'}\nMy husband was an acne sufferer before I knew him, and still gets some problem areas on his back from sitting and getting all sweaty in his office chair. I thought maybe this would help. His skin does seem to bring out the big guns when it comes to attacking ingrown hairs and any other perceived foreign substance.<br /><br />And I have to say, upon the two-minute inspection I was allowed, it actually does seem to be helping. Even though it's not like he's using it regularly - actually, he uses it whenever I'm allowed to spray it on him after his shower and before he goes to bed. I'd say I manage to get to him about three times a week. And the impact appears, to me, to be noticeable, and beneficial - there are several problem areas that are now looking quite subdued and normal.<br /><br />I can only imagine what his overall back might look like, if he would just let me do it twice a day every day.\nSeems to Help",

Really. We call that a \"glow\" in the south, but it's just plain sweat, and it runs into my eyes, and then my eyes are stinging, my glasses get fogged and wet, and I'm just one huge, damp, panicky  blind mess.<br /><br />Which may be normal when you're working out, but when you're, say, touring the greenhouse or strolling the beach, I'm pretty sure it's unattractive. When you add sunscreen to the mix, dripping down my face, I've actually attracted a concerned crowd in the past, which makes me nervous, and then you can add clammy hands to the list of woes.<br /><br />You wouldn't think a seemingly simple headband like this would do the trick, but it actually has. The headband gets damp; my face stays dry. I normally wear a ball cap when I garden - hoping I won't burn my head while basically risking heat exhaustion - and I put this on first, then the cap.  The headband is a little bit bulky, being double thickness, but not too much so; wonder of wonders, wearing it, my face has stayed dry for the entire time I've been outside. No sweaty face, no drippy mess, no glasses I can't see through (or gnats interested in this new swampy damp visitor). I would wear these if they were hideous, they're so effective, but they're not - navy with flowers or white with flowers - I could wear them as a fashion statement. And so effective.<br /><br />Suddenly I can be outside without causing a shower on my face. It's a miracle.

Mine were in a variety of colors; the one color I was looking for - a basic nude - was not in my package - but I got a range of plums (which I never wear) and pinks (which I rarely wear).<br /><br />If you've used any of your mom's pencils, you're familiar with carmine, which can flake.

Aside from the general disaster that could pose with small children, the FDA requires cosmetic products sold in the USA list their ingredients on the bottle in English.<br /><br />The ingredients, by the way, which I wish Amazon would leave a spot for cosmetic vendors to include in their listings, so we would know before we order in case of allergies, are Sedum Sarmentosum, Butylene Glycol, Water, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Glycereth-26, Polyglutamic Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramide NP, Xylityglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Dipotassium Glycrrhizate, Citrus Tangerina Peel Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia Oil, Glucose, Phospholifpids, Diethoxyethyl Succinate, Caprylic/Capric Triclyceride, Ammonium Acryloylidimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Hydrogenated Lecithin, C12-13 Pareth-9, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin.<br /><br />Having said that, I poured a little bit of the product onto a cotton pad in the evening and dabbed it onto my face, and onto the back of my hands. It initially felt just  a bit tacky, but almost immediately absorbed. I followed up on my face with my nightly cream. My face this morning feels AMAZING. The moisture level is through the roof.<br /><br />I also want to mention fragrance. Like 95% of chronic migraine headache sufferers, I have a sensitive sense of smell. Anything cosmetic that has perfume (think lip smackers) or added scent has the potential to make me nauseous and bring on a migraine. This had just a faint authentic citrus smell, vaguely pleasant, which thankfully disappeared within a few seconds of hitting the cotton ball. That kind of fragrance is ideal.<br /><br />And the effects are just amazing. I don't see my face all day, but I can sure see my hands on the keyboard. My hands are visibly more plumper, less dry, and  more hydrated. I am loving this product. Hopefully they're in process with getting their bottle properly labelled and safe for distribution in the United States, because this is my new routine.

And I don't get to say that very often.  My experience with serums, toners, and lotions is mainly one of \"I hope they don't.\"<br /><br />As in, I hope they don't have \"fragrance,\" because invariably, that gives me a horrific headache and I have to wash the stuff off within minutes of application. As in, I hope they're not \"sticky,\" because for some reason, that means they stay on the surface of my skin all night long, sticking to the pillow or my pajamas (or worse, the hubs). As in, I hope they don't do something \"creative with ingredients\" because my skin is pretty tolerant, but can only take so much.<br /><br />This serum has no fragrance, doesn't cause endless stickiness on the surface of my skin, doesn't do anything scary with the ingredients - and smooths over the problem spots on my face. I love that the ingredients are organic (on the box as well as on the site - I'm assuming \"certified organic\" is the same in the U.S. as it is in France) and I like the way the lotion feels. Recognizing, of course, that we all have individual skin that reacts differently, this is certainly a winner for me.\nReview Title: Not Sticky, No Smell - Smooths Winkles\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: QTMY Wide Headbands Fashion Women Baroque Crystal Gemstone Hair Accessories Head Band Fashion Headwear Hairbands for Women\nReview Date: 2021/06/21\nStore: QTMY\nAverage Rating: 3.6\nProduct Details: {'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Occasion': 'Wedding, Birthday', 'Material': 'Plastic', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Brand': 'QTMY', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.5 x 5.94 x 1.97 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'ZJ'}\nReview Text: I have a major weakness for rhinestones.

I'm not sharing them generously with anyone - they're all for me, me, me.<br /><br />First of all, I like that the products are designed for sensitive skin. Like most people, I have a mix of really delicate skin and skin on which I could get a tattoo and not notice. So I love that these products support my delicate skin areas.<br /><br />And I like that Burt's uses natural origin ingredients - and no synthetic fragrances. I feel like I type this in every review: like 1B (in 2021) people, 3:1 of which are women, I suffer from chronic migraines. And like 95% of those sufferers, I have a sensitive sense of smell, and for me, artificial fragrances are dreadful. (I've found artificially made \"Honey\" to be one of the worst.) Burt's Bees products consistently have mild, unobtrusive natural scents.<br /><br />That's not to say I like every single Burt's Bees product, but their baby skin care products leave my adult skin feeling baby soft. I especially like the apricot baby oil, which is extra softening, smells faintly of apricot and leaves my skin feeling wonderful.  And I'm so happy that they have the ingredients not just on the products, but listed on Amazon as well, so we know in advance what we're getting. Awesome. Yes, I'm the baby here, and happy to be one if that means I get to use these great products.\nReview Title: LOVE This Burt's Bees Package!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Silicone Facial Cleansing Brush, Three-sided Facial Lip Scrubber Brush Face Massager for Men and Women, 2PCS\nReview Date: 2021/07/05\nStore: BONLY\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '7.99 x 2.83 x 2.8 inches; 3.53 Ounces', 'UPC': '661918753152'}\nReview Text: I have a bunch of these little brushes. I love the feel of the silicone \"bristles.\" So I have some for lip exfoliation, a few for facial massages, and even separate ones for facial cleansing. They're easy to clean and so soft.<br /><br />What I haven't had is a single brush that does it all. And when you travel, it's just ridiculous to be carrying not only a toothbrush, a sponge blender, and two makeup brushes, but three additional silicon brushes. You end up with a makeup tote instead of a makeup case, and suddenly you're checking a bag just because of your annoyingly overstuffed makeup bag.<br /><br />Not me, because now I have one, and a spare, silicon brush that does it all. One side for massage (which, by the way, if I am so lacking in good taste, I can do in the comfort of my seat on the plane), one side for cleaning, and one appropriately small-sized area for exfoliating lip and/or nose. And that lip exfoliation is one of my favorites - back in college, we used to grab a towel and do a quick scrub before putting on lipstick, but this is so much nicer to your lips.<br /><br />And these two brushes are so much more efficient and space saving for me.\nReview Title: Massages, Cleans, Exfoliates Lips\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Eyebrow Pencil 2 Pcs Waterproof Dark Brown and Light Brown Long Lasting Eyebrow Makeup Pen with 4 Fork Tips Head Upgrade Design\nReview Date: 2021/07/15\nStore: Marine Forest\nAverage Rating: 2.7\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Marine Forest', 'Item Form': 'Pencil', 'Finish Type': 'Natural', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Product Benefits': 'Long Lasting', 'Product Dimensions': '4.92 x 0.71 x 0.71 inches; 1.12 Ounces', 'UPC': '729843788950'}\nReview Text: I'm an eyebrow fanatic, and I've used eyebrow wax, powder, pencils and stencils. I'm a huge fan of shaping and powder - that seems to work best for me - but I've never seen applicators like these so I thought I would give them a try.<br /><br />Mine didn't arrive overly wet like those of other reviewers; they just seemed to be like normal pens. But the application was uneven and I did have to press hard to get any color other than simply a dark shading (like the side of a lead pencil).<br /><br />Once I did use firm pressure, it was a little like using an old eyebrow pencil - but less forgiving with the multi-levels. Be sure to shape your eyebrow first, then apply the pen; don't expect the pen to comb as well as draw. The pen can provide the dramatically even look, or, with a lot of manipulation, a more natural look (which I prefer).<br /><br />I didn't find the pen to be as long-lasting as expected.  I try to be really careful in application, as I don't like to abuse my eyebrows or skin, and remove product only using makeup remover.  However, I do perspire on my t-zones  and that perspiration completely defeated the eyebrow pencil.<br /><br />This is an interesting innovation with the four-tier brush - and it may work well for others, just not for me. Ingredients, which I so appreciate being noted on the box: water, acrylic ester copolymer, propylene glycol, hydroxyethyl cellulose, c177491, c177492.\nReview Title: Like a Less Forgiving Old-Style Pencil\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: YNN Y-Not-Natural Organic Kakadu Plum Extract Anti-Aging Moisturizer by Jillaroo \u2013 100g | Vitamins E, C, A | Fragrance Free Advanced Skin Care and Wrinkle Removal (Kakadu Plum)\u2026\nReview Date: 2021/08/07\nStore: YNN Y-Not-Natural\nAverage Rating: 4.2\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'YNN Y-Not-Natural', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '3.5274 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Package Dimensions': '6.54 x 1.85 x 1.81 inches; 3.53 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Y-Not Natural Aust Pty Ltd'}\nReview Text: I constantly use moisturizer, both on my face and all over. Huge fan of keeping my skin moist and soft. This product had all the right ingredients, plus that enticing \"fragrance free.\"<br /><br />But this product definitely has a scent to it; perhaps they just mean there's no added fragrance when they designate the product as \"fragrance free.\" That scent might be due to the plum extract, but I'm a plum fan, and the smell was a bit dank and musty for that (although this is my super-sensitive sense of smell doing an interpretation).<br /><br />Like 2 billion people (in 2021), I suffer from chronic migraine headaches, and like 95% of those, I'm sensitive to smells. Very sensitive. Too much laundry soap is untenable. I can handle most essential oils, but manufactured scents may actually trigger a migraine. I can't have such a smell anywhere close to my nose, like, say, on my skin (or especially on my face).<br /><br />Although the initial application felt wonderful on my arm, where I test products, the smell was intolerable for me, and I had to wipe it off. I'm really bummed - it felt exceptionally good, but I just couldn't cope with the scent.

Each flower has a crystal center; the large flowers have an additional five crystals around the center and two hanging crystals. There are four metal leaf fronds with pearl 'fronds' attached.<br /><br />The wire is delicate, so the comb is not designed for rough treatment (definitely not for children). But you can carefully shape both the brooch, and the comb tines - which are integrated - to hold it in place. My hair is thick, but short, and it works fine with my current styling. When I had long hair, I wore combs a lot, and if I still had that length, I'd probably wear this comb as a decoration, rather than to secure my hair in a certain way. The comb is somewhat fragile - and if you want to reuse it, you have to be careful.<br /><br />It arrived in a jewelry-size box with a seal, and padding - great for a gift. Just lovely.

And it's one of the best I've received. It arrived in a sealed box, with a pull out drawer rather than just a lift-off lid - nice presentation.<br /><br />The comb is metal, two inches long and an 1.25 inches wide. The teeth are close together, so it worked well on the short area of my hair as well as long. Because it is a shorter comb, though, I'm not sure it could hold a large amount of hair in a style; it's more of a post-style add-on. The comb is soldered to the decoration in two places so it seems securely put together.<br /><br />The decoration itself is just amazing sparkle, with three small crystals used to make each leaf, larger crystals for drops, and small flower designs made up of crystals.  The decoration is about four inches at the widest point. It seems sturdy enough to last longer than one event - unlike most - and is really just lovely.

After two squeezes. You get three little dots on the brush with each squeeze, brush those on with the applicator, and wow.<br /><br />Having said that, it is a primer - so it doesn't provide all over color. It does brighten your skin - because it's white - and it does tighten. And you have to be careful (or at least, I have to be careful) not to get it near your eyes or mouth, where lots of lines are, because it tastes dreadful and I'm sure it's not designed for eyes.

    "text": "I tried this specifically because of the name, but was prepared to be disappointed. \"Citrus Souffle\" sounds almost too good to be true.<br /><br />But it's not. First, the scent. I get migraines, and scents are a trigger. Citrus, eucalyptus, and peppermint are OK - perfumes or manufactured fragrances have become a big \"no\" for me. Since a side effect is an extra sensitive sense of smell (which means things I put on my face have to be tolerated), I gravitate towards those I can tolerate. Sometimes even scents I usually like go awry in plastic containers or in a specific cosmetic mix. But this citrus is lovely. Limes, oranges, lemons, all rolled into one. A veritable orchard from this single cream. Wonderful.<br /><br />And the cream? So light, silky smooth, and creamy. From trying other creams, I know that if there's any chance the product will be slow to absorb, that will happen with my skin. This cream was quick to absorb, not heavy or weighing down, and left my skin feeling moisturized, refreshed, and as velvety soft as the cream itself.<br /><br />I'm also delighted that this product complies with the Australian SafeCosmetics Toxic Free Campaign and is listed as a participating vendor. Safer for me, safer for the environment in which we live. Great product, one I enjoy using.",
