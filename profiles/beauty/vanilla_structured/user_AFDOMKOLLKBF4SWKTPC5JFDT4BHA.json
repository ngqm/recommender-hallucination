  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe individual demonstrates a clear preference for beauty products that prioritize natural and organic ingredients, as evidenced by their consistent purchases from brands specializing in non-toxic formulations and enriched components. They favor products that offer dual functionality, evident from their acquisition of both base/topcoat and colored nail polishes, indicating a desire for efficiency and convenience in their beauty routine. \n\nThe reviewer rates products highly, particularly those associated with nail care, highlighting a favorable sentiment towards efficacy and smooth application. However, there are instances of mixed feelings regarding specific items, as illustrated by the lower rating of the body scrub, pointing to occasional dissatisfaction with usability rather than product quality. \n\nQuality emerges as a significant preference, particularly for long-lasting and effective solutions, but there is a noted sensitivity to pricing, acknowledging the higher costs associated with preferred brands while justifying the expense based on perceived value. \n\nOverall, the key preferences center around natural ingredients, multipurpose functionality, smooth application experience, and a willingness to invest in quality, reflecting a discerning approach to beauty and self-care purchases.",
