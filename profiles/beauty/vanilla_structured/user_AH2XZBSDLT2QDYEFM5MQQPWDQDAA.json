This product was an adventure. First off, it is literally dry, not in an aerosol type of container.  You screw open the top (like and elmers glue bottle) and shake onto your head. Well. The little safety piece of cardboard was not attached to the bottle but stuck in the lid.  I did not know this until I tried to use it to no avail. And when you open the bottle be prepared for stuff to fly out. When I did get to the point I could use it, it turned out to be so light colored and obvious on my head I had to work it well into my hair, brush and shake my head so it was not such a glaring product. I will admit it did a great job in \"thickening\" my very fine hair, but it really needs to come in colors; blonde, brunette, etc. so it is not so obvious.  Will I buy it again?

The sanitizer I have hooked to my purse now is actually in a little rubber \"holster\". I am constantly snagging it on things that make the bottle fall out. This product will take care of that problem, hands down. These would also be great for hiking/camping. Perfect size for hand soap, shampoo, etc, that can be hooked to a backpack and not weigh down the user.\nReview Title: Great multi use bottles\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Organic Dry Shampoo Light - Dry Shampoo Travel Size, Hair Powder Dry Shampoo for Women and Men, Volumizing Powder for Hair and Texture Powder, Hair Volume Powder for Blonde Hair\nReview Date: 2021/03/21\nStore: Beauty by Earth\nAverage Rating: 3.7\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Beauty by Earth', 'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Unit Count': '1.5 Ounce', 'Package Dimensions': '5.5 x 1.3 x 1.3 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '850003968254'}\nReview Text: I have tried many brands of dry shampoo, most I have liked.  This product was an adventure. First off, it is literally dry, not in an aerosol type of container.  You screw open the top (like and elmers glue bottle) and shake onto your head. Well. The little safety piece of cardboard was not attached to the bottle but stuck in the lid.  I did not know this until I tried to use it to no avail. And when you open the bottle be prepared for stuff to fly out. When I did get to the point I could use it, it turned out to be so light colored and obvious on my head I had to work it well into my hair, brush and shake my head so it was not such a glaring product. I will admit it did a great job in \"thickening\" my very fine hair, but it really needs to come in colors; blonde, brunette, etc. so it is not so obvious.  Will I buy it again? Probably not, but it will go into my travel bag for emergency use if I have the time to shake, rattle and roll my head.\nReview Title: Decent product but has some issues\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: BeautyGARDE MAGIC Charcoal Facial Cleanser - detoxifying and anti-pollution face cleanser, Nonie Creme\nReview Date: 2021/09/11\nStore: BeautyGARDE\nAverage Rating: 2.9\nProduct Details: {'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.5 x 2.13 x 7.75 inches; 4.8 Ounces', 'Item model number': '1201', 'UPC': '856365007242'}\nReview Text: My son really liked this cleanser. He is a bearded fellow to sometimes cleansers can be problematic when trying to rinse out. This product works really well for him and his girlfriend. I have used many charcoal products and have always been pleased with the outcome. This cleanser is easy to use and leaves the skin feeling smooth and refreshed.\nReview Title: works well, a hit with my adult son\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: MIRACLE Gold Straight Razor, Straight Edge Razor Non-Slip Sustainable Metal Handle, Black Cutthroat Barber Razor Holder, Disposable Straight Razor Blades Kit\nReview Date: 2021/10/03\nStore: Miracle\nAverage Rating: 2.5\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Miracle', 'Number of Blades': '1', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Handle Material': 'Stainless,Stainless Steel,Metal Handle,Aluminium,Metal,Steel', 'Color': 'Gold'}\nReview Text: My son tried this out on his beard to shape it up. It didn't work well on the beard part, but was okay in taking off the fine hairs on his cheeks. The whole set up is very flimsy, feels cheap with just a so so outcome after use. This might be good for anyone just starting to shave that might want to graduate to a straight edge down the road. Just don't expect professional results if you have an established beard you want to maintain. My son's beard is not particularly dense but enough so that this is a no go for him. Maintaining a light beard or the 5 oclock shadow look might be possible.\nReview Title: definitely not professional tool\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Birthday Gift, Yachyee hair removal device\nReview Date: 2021/12/12\nStore: Yachyee\nProduct Description: [\"What's in Yachyee Relaxing Gifts for Women:\", '--- 12 oz Rose Gold insulated stainless steel tumbler with a reusable straw and cleaning brush, with the words \"\"Beauty begins the moment you love yourself\"\". --- Flower Petal Bath Bombs, drop them into the tub to relax among the delicate aromas of vanilla and lavender petals. --- Scented Candle, made of 100% soy wax, luxurious and all-natural, can immediately turn your space into a little serene and peaceful flower garden. --- Rose Bar Soap, made with natural flower essential oil to bring you to a dreamland of lavender cloud. --- Beautiful Key Bottle Opener and heart shape Wine Bottle Stopper --- Greeting Card, you can write your special blessing to her. \ud83c\udf88 DON\\'T FORGET TO SELECT \"\"THIS ORDER CONTAINS A GIFT\"\" AT CHECKOUT TO ADD YOUR FREE PERSONALIZED MESSAGE THROUGH AMAZON.\ud83c\udf88 50th 60th 40th birthday gifts for women 30th birthday gifts for her get well soon gift basket gifts for women gift basket for women self care gifts for women sister birthday gifts from sister']\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Item Form': 'Variety', 'Material Feature': 'Organic Ingredients, Vegan', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'Yachyee', 'Number of Items': '4', 'Product Dimensions': '7.7 x 6.8 x 3.5 inches; 12 Ounces', 'UPC': '697478889727', 'Manufacturer': 'Yachyee'}\nReview Text: This box has everything you or a best bud needs for some r & r at home.

Thought I would give this a shot. Washed and dried my hair, it was looking good. One BLAST of this stuff totally destroyed my do, leaving me with a mess of hair that I couldn't do anything with. Too sticky for a dry shampoo that others said it was a family member of, no hold like a traditional hair spray. Into the trash it goes. It does spell good, though. :)\nReview Title: I was thinking \"hair spray\".
