I am a sucker for packaging. I am guilty of buying something simply because it comes wrapped in a pretty package. Crave is so clever in their packaging it makes me want every product they have to offer.<br />Guess what? Their products are just as awesome as what they come in.  Last time, I got the Whip Lash Eye Lash curler, you can read my review here. This time I received their eyebrow kit!<br />It comes with two awesome tools to help me maintain my sorry excuse for eyebrows. The first tool has a comb to help me separate my clumpy ass eye lashes. Even with the best mascara you can get, it's always a good idea to keep a tool to separate your eyelashes. No one wants to see your spider lashes!! On the other side of the comb is a little brush you can use on your lashes, or your eyebrows.<br />The second tool, my favorite, has a mascara type applicator on one end, this applicator is great for grooming your eyebrows before you put on your makeup. It gets them looking even and neat, or to help accentuate your arch. The other end is an eyebrow makeup applicator brush. This small brush helps you apply  your eyebrow makeup with precision. I highly recommend this product! Look at the cute tube it comes in!

This is my 7th brush set and the ONLY one that actually showed what they are used for. I was pretty clueless and had to look them up online.<br />As for the use of the brushes, they work wonderful. It have yet to experience a single brush hair fall out. As I stated before they are so soft and feel so nice when I use them on my face. I love the fact that it comes with a small thin brush that I can use for my gel eyeliner. This set contains a brush for all of your makeup needs.<br />I highly recommend this as a present to  yourself or for any makeup lover in your life. You will fall in love with them as much as I did!

I fully believe this works, after using this for a couple of months my lashes have grown longer and even thicker. This is a more affordable option to other higher end brands. It is super easy to apply, you just swipe it above your lashes as if you were putting on eyeliner. It doesn't run into your eye (just make sure you apply correctly or it may cause slight irritation)<br />** I received this product at discount in exchange for an honest review.\nReview Title: I saw results after about 6 weeks. This REALLY works.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n    Structure your response as:\n   \n    SUMMARY:\n    [Final synthesis of preferences and patterns]",
