  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe purchase history indicates a clear preference for synthetic wigs, particularly in modern, curly, and blonde styles, though the individual often encounters disappointment with their quality. Consistent low ratings reveal dissatisfaction primarily with product accuracy compared to images and overall quality, as evidenced by multiple complaints regarding confusion between expected and received styles. \n\nIn terms of use, these wigs appear primarily for casual and party wear, yet even with intended versatility, many products fall short of expectations, leading to a pattern of frustration. Quality concerns dominate feedback, with frequent mentions of shedding, tangling, and inconsistency in fullness and styling\u2014suggesting a desire for better construction without higher pricing.\n\nPrice sensitivity can be inferred, given a tendency to express disappointment with affordability not meeting quality standards. A noted appreciation for certain products arises, particularly when style and compliment reception align positively, emphasizing the importance of aesthetic appeal alongside quality. \n\nOverall, this shopper is inclined towards trendy and versatile wig options but simultaneously values product quality, accurate representation in marketing, and an overall satisfying experience relative to cost.",
