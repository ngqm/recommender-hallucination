I have been using jergens for years, but this seems to pack a better punch and works quickly and seems to be cumulative. I didn\u2019t find it to be orangey, but was conscious to not put too much around my knees, elbows and ankles since these types of products tend to get a little darker in those areas and can kind of go orangey quickly.\nReview Title: Love the tanner!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Foot Peel Mask Coconut - For Cracked Heels, Dead Skin Calluses - Removes & Repairs Rough Heels, Dry Feet, Make Your Feet Baby Soft - Natural Exfoliating Peeling Foot Mask 3 Pairs\nReview Date: 2021/09/16\nStore: HUALIJIA\nAverage Rating: 3.7\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'HUALIJIA', 'Scent': 'Coconut', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Unit Count': '3.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '6', 'Package Dimensions': '6.69 x 4.92 x 1.22 inches; 6.38 Ounces'}\nReview Text: Reviewed by spouse:<br /><br />I have used these peels before so I\u2019m familiar with the peeling process.

I never wear fake lashes because I don\u2019t wanna deal with the glue I can never get the right amount on there and it just looks terrible so I never wear them. I had heard about these and thought I would give them a shot and they are amazing. I think you can get multiple wears out of each set because they seem pretty sticky. I think I might trim mine down like by a couple of lashes (width lengthwise) but I do have kind of smaller eyes.

I think it\u2019s actually making a difference I have been waiting at least four weeks between each time I use it on my legs and the hair on my legs is definitely coming in less and less. If you have done hair removal procedures in the past, you know that it takes a lot of time and you must follow the hair growth process and this could take up to six months to a year to get the results that you want.
