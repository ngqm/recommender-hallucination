Which takes some of the beauty away.  I'd get these again if I want long nails or if the dont have glitter nails so it's easy to cut and file.  Over all they're not too bad.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:  \nThe individual demonstrates a mixed but generally positive sentiment towards hair and beauty products, with a preference for vibrant colors and styles. Consistent ratings reflect a tendency to be critical when product quality diverges from expectations. While they express satisfaction and a potential for repeat purchases with softer, more user-friendly items (e.g., twist hair extensions with added accessories), they report dissatisfaction when products do not deliver on quality claims (e.g., hair that tangles or does not retain a desired finish).\n\nCommon themes indicate a focus on practicality and aesthetic appeal, with a notable openness to trying different styles, but a clear need for assurance regarding texture and longevity. Metal accessories and anti-odor features are appreciated, enhancing usability. Notably, there is a fluctuating sensitivity to price, as they highlight affordability positively. The individual has shown a balance of wanting unique, eye-catching designs while demanding performance reliability, especially in textured hair products. Overall, their core preferences center on quality, ease of use, and vibrancy in hair and nail products, with a cautious approach toward products of uncertain quality.",
