I took it off and inspected it and found some weird really short hairs sticking in the lumpy spot, like someone had chopped off a clump of hair.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe individual's purchase history reveals a distinct pattern of mixed sentiment regarding synthetic wigs, particularly a preference for vivid colors and styles such as wavy and curly. They consistently express disappointment in product quality, particularly fit and construction, indicating a significant expectation for realistic, flattering hair options. Most ratings for wigs fall below average (1.0 to 3.5), suggesting frustration with the perceived value and quality versus cost. \n\nIn contrast, the purchase of holographic nail polish showcases a positive experience with a higher rating (4.0), indicating an appreciation for vibrant aesthetics and satisfying product performance in cosmetics. This suggests a tendency to favor visually appealing products that deliver good quality, particularly in lower price ranges, but with a growing dissatisfaction in the wig category overall.\n\nThe analysis reflects a core preference for colorful, stylish products but a recurring discontent with the quality and fit of synthetic hairpieces, pointing towards a price sensitivity where cheap, poor-quality items fall short of expectations. Thus, this shopper seeks well-constructed, aesthetically pleasing options that justify their expenses, favoring cosmetics over wigs which have consistently disappointed.",
