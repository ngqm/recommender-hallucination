I tried to remedy the overall result somewhat by adding my own liner, and that example is on the second photo, bottom right corner (photo with eyeshadow applied).<br /><br />The lashes themselves were the quality you\u2019d expect from a multi pack at this price. Some of the individual lashes had fallen out as I opened the package as well.<br /><br />Final thoughts: just use eyelash glue and get quality lashes.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:  \nThe individual demonstrates a preference for beauty products that emphasize quality and ease of application, as indicated by consistently high ratings for wigs and makeup items. They notably favor products that are long-lasting, user-friendly, and well-packaged, reflecting an appreciation for aesthetic appeal and functionality. \n\nThemes suggest a strong inclination towards products that enhance appearance with minimal hassle, such as self-adhesive beauty items. However, they also exhibit a degree of price sensitivity, preferring items that offer good value for money, particularly in the wig category. Although they have a varied taste in shades and finishes, there are concerns regarding product efficacy and component quality, especially when it comes to attachments and adhesives. \n\nQuality matters significantly; the individual expresses disappointment with products that fared poorly in function, like the eyeliner's failure to adhere properly, contrasting with high satisfaction for well-performing items. In sum, their core preference leans towards vegan-friendly, effective cosmetics, and user-friendly hair treatments at a reasonable price without compromising on quality.",
