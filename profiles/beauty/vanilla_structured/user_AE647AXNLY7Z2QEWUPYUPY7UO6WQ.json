  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:  \nThis individual exhibits a clear preference for beauty and personal care products, particularly those related to hair, makeup, and skincare. Consistently high ratings (mostly 4.0 and above) indicate satisfaction with quality, especially regarding realistic appearance and functionality in beauty applications. Themes in their purchases highlight versatility\u2014favoring items suitable for both everyday use and special occasions, such as wigs for cosplay and beauty tools for self-care.\n\nQuality appears to be crucial, with positive sentiments focusing on effective design and user experience, as seen in their responses to facial massagers and beauty kits. However, a notable exception is the dissatisfaction expressed with microblading needles, suggesting that they prioritize reliability and performance in tools directly related to beauty application.\n\nPrice sensitivity seems balanced; while they appreciate good deals, their consistent willingness to invest in high-quality items reflects a commitment to quality over budget. Overall, core preferences identify a strong gravitation towards innovative and practical beauty solutions that deliver reliable performance and enhanced self-care experiences.",
