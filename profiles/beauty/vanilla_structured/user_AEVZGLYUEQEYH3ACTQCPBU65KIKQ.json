The way the jar is made was definitely intentional to cut down on the product you receive. So a more accurate amount for the size of the jar would be great.  I have used this for 11 days and my face has never felt or looked better. Even my husband noticed and he never notices anything. It is a paste consistency with little beads to help exfoliate. I covered my whole face, left on for 2 minutes and it easily washed off with warm water. My skin felt amazing afterwards and not tight or sticky like other products I have used before. All in all, I am happy with this product. Just fix the jar issue that gives you less than you are expecting of product and this stuff would be great.\nReview Title: Leaves Your Skin Feeling Wonderful\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: 14pcs Nail Drill Bits Set,3/32 Inch Acrylic Nail Drill Bits with Case,Quartz Pointed Nail Bits for Nails,Cuticle Remover Bits, Manicure Tools\nReview Date: 2022/11/19\nStore: Bouttarro\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '3.82 x 2.48 x 0.47 inches; 1.45 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'YSDMT014', 'UPC': '759060964790'}\nReview Text: This is a nice set to add to my already existing drill bit set.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe purchase history reveals a clear inclination towards high-quality skincare and beauty tools, evidenced by consistently positive ratings (averaging 4.0+) for effective products that deliver visible benefits. Key themes include a preference for natural, chemical-free formulations that align with the user\u2019s health-conscious values, particularly noted in facial care products. \n\nThe buyer demonstrates a demand for functionality and convenience, valuing products that enhance skincare routines while also expressing sensitivity to packaging and quantity discrepancies. This is seen in the critique of product packaging that misrepresents content amount, suggesting an expectation for transparency.\n\nQuality is paramount; the individual is willing to invest in items perceived as durable and effective, such as manicure tools that boast longevity. However, they also display moderate price sensitivity, choosing products that appear value-driven, with mixed reactions about product efficacy indicating their expectations for reasonable performance relative to cost. \n\nFurther, the mixed sentiment regarding a hair care set and varying experiences with moisturizers signal a quest for optimal results, with a likelihood of continued trial and error. Overall, this person values well-designed, sustainable products that complement a natural beauty regimen, while being discerning about quality and transparency in their purchases.",
