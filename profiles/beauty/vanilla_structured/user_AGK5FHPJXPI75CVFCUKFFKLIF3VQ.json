I have long thick coarse curly hair that fizzes very easily and immediately after every shower if I dont use a product in it. I used this before I used any other products but it did not detangle my hair very much compared to how it normally is. I still had to pull through quite a few knots but it didnt seem to take as many pulls to get through them as it normslly does. So I guess that would be considered an improvement. I feel like my hair is volumized and softer with about 5-7 sprays throughout my entire head of hair. This is a thin spray so it is very lightweight and has the consistency similar to water so I dont feel like my hair is at all greasy from this. I used a curl definer like I always do after showers that helps deter the frizz and keep my curls bouncy and it worked well with it.

Because of the benefits of argan oil with hair, I decided to use this as a mask/soak on my hair from root to tip. I have very thick and pretty long hair and I used the entire bottle to cover my head. I covered my head with a plastic shower cap and sat with it on for over an hour. I showered, shampooed twice and conditioned per usual. I really expected a big difference in the amount of frizz, softness, and shininess of my hair.. and I was highly disappointed.

Normally masks claim to do a lot and often I'm left let down, that was not the case with this mask. These have a TON of moisture/liquid/balm whatever youd like to call it. I was able to apply it to my face, and it was completely saturated so I decided to rub a good amount on my neck, and then once getting it in place I rubbed it into my hands. The serum I rubbed down my neck did dry a lot faster and got sticky in the crease of my neck. I left it on for 25 minutes and it absorbed extremely well. My face is so hydrated without feeling oily. It was so refreshing while I had it on, it was cooling and helped me relax. The directions say to rub the remaining serum in after you take the mask off, which I did. But it was too much serum to leave on and I felt sticky. So I wet my face and wiped the excess with a towel. The only complaint I have is that the mask is weirdly thin and I had a hard time placing it on my face correctly. The eye holes were hardly big enough and it got my lips wet. I think this has to do with how I put it on but I think they could still be a little bit larger in diameter.\nReview Title: A new favorite!\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Womens\u2019 Metallic Finish Non Slip Grip 48 Counts 2 Inches Hair Bobby Pins Gray\nReview Date: 2020/11/23\nStore: DARONGFENG\nAverage Rating: 3.6\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'DARONGFENG', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Color': 'Gray', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material': 'Metal, Rubber', 'Package Dimensions': '4.61 x 2.52 x 0.35 inches; 1.13 Ounces', 'UPC': '788465401296'}\nReview Text: Came as described and shipped quickly.

The fabric holders are great and thick, and I think they will hold up for quite a while. The caribeaners they come with are really flimsy and cheap but I think it was a luxury that they even came with the set. As for the bottles themselves, they do hold hand sanitizer well, the lids and cap functions well and doesnt cause me any problems. I do think they're a little smaller than I expected and wish they held more sanitizer because right now I would probably go through one of these tiny bottles in a week. But that's okay as I'm fine with refilling but may be a problem for others. I wish the plastic was thicker and better quality.

If I didnt go back and look at the amazon listing I wouldnt have known that these can be used in 2 majorly different ways. With the gel by itself, no black underneath, these are very bright and vibrant colors. When the black is underneath them, boy are they worth every penny. They really do come out beautiful with the sparkles and shine, it is almost like a galaxy in each one of your finger nails. It does take a lot of work, but it is worth it. One thing worth mentioning is that you really need to have a solid black coat in order for the color to look good, 2+ coats for black needed!\nReview Title: Beautiful\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Velvet Women Headband with Buttons,YANJIE 6 Pcs Hair Band Ear Protection Holder for Nurses Doctors Non Slip,Stretchy Leopard Head Bands Fashion Unisex Hair Accessories Head Wrap 20inch\nReview Date: 2021/01/22\nStore: YanJie\nAverage Rating: 3.9\nProduct Details: {'Material': 'Velvet', 'Fabric Type': 'Velvet', 'Brand': 'YanJie', 'Item Form': 'Wrap', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '9.25 x 5.98 x 1.81 inches; 1.06 Ounces', 'UPC': '792119595057', 'Manufacturer': 'YANJIE'}\nReview Text: These have me conflicted on whether I like them or not. They are pretty (at least the darker solids, I threw the other ones away as I'll never use them) and they are a soft velvet and do have button for your mask loops to hook on to. That was the main reason I ordered these because I'm tired of my ears getting sore being in the medical field having to wear a mask for over 8 hours at a time. I do feel lole the velvet helps it stay in place more than the regular cotton or polyester ones but velvet is thick and makes me sweat. Not only that but the way the headband is designed there isnt much stitching to hold the buttons in the position you need them to be in order to hook your mask on. It rolls back on my scalp and then the buttons can get caught in my hair so I have to slide it forward and fidget with it a bit to get it right but for the entirety of my shift I did keep it on and it kept my mask in place comfortably with no problem. I wish the design was a bit different and the velvet maybe a little bit thinner but overall I like these.\nReview Title: Overall I like these\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Nxconsu 12Pcs Headbands for Women Girls Teens Elastic Hair Bands Silky Solid Colors Pleated Crinkle Head Band Fashion Trendy Outfit Colorful Thin Comfortable Hair Accessories for Home Work Gym Casual\nReview Date: 2021/04/19\nStore: Nxconsu\nAverage Rating: 4.6\nProduct Details: {'Material': 'Plastic', 'Fabric Type': 'elastic', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Brand': 'Nxconsu', 'Size': '12 Count (Pack of 1)', 'Package Dimensions': '11.06 x 9.76 x 1.46 inches; 6.38 Ounces'}\nReview Text: My 3 year old niece has baby hairs that drive her crazy and I wanted to get something to help combat the dreaded tint hairs in the front of her face.

I have to start off by mentioning that it took me quite a while to get them on, not even to my satisfactio. But to simply get them on my nail bed and not sticking elsewhere. Unfortunately I dont know if it is due to lack of practice or shaky hands but these were not professional looking by any means, as they either had tint gaps, slightly crooked, overlapped my cuticle, or something else. I kept them on for a little over 24 hours before I popped them all off due to OCD and aggravation of looking at them all messed up. For reference I can never keep artificial nails from the salon on for more than a week. I just dont like the feeling of fake nails especially when they hurt. Not sure I would recommend these for anyone who isnt going to have someone do them for them or take time to practice and have patience.\nReview Title: Too difficult for me\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Headband of Women , 3 Packs Wide Edge Velvet Twist Braided Hair Band , Solid Color Fashion Hair Bands.

I noticed while the nails were still in the package that they had odd chinese like symbols in the glue. I figured it might go away once I put them on but for some of them it didnt. It actually made it look worse and scratchy/bubbly underneath. These \"symbols\" should definitely get removed. I'm not one who does my nails often at all so I'm pretty critical of these. I included pictures of the flaws for others to see.<br /><br />Edit: I peeled these off the next day because of how bubbly and gross they looked underneath. They never dried overnight even after sleeping and still moved around when I tried to move them up and down and back and forth.

I have long thick coarse curly hair that fizzes very easily and immediately after every shower if I dont use a product in it. I used this before I used any other products but it did not detangle my hair very much compared to how it normally is. I still had to pull through quite a few knots but it didnt seem to take as many pulls to get through them as it normslly does. So I guess that would be considered an improvement. I feel like my hair is volumized and softer with about 5-7 sprays throughout my entire head of hair. This is a thin spray so it is very lightweight and has the consistency similar to water so I dont feel like my hair is at all greasy from this. I used a curl definer like I always do after showers that helps deter the frizz and keep my curls bouncy and it worked well with it. I dont think this product is worth the money for what little it does do.

They wrap it in a plastic bag for this reason to prevent the oil from leaking out but it still leaked through anyhow. There was at least half an inch of oil missing from the top of the bottle from leakage during commute/delivery. Second complaint is the fact that it really didnt work. Because of the benefits of argan oil with hair, I decided to use this as a mask/soak on my hair from root to tip. I have very thick and pretty long hair and I used the entire bottle to cover my head. I covered my head with a plastic shower cap and sat with it on for over an hour. I showered, shampooed twice and conditioned per usual. I really expected a big difference in the amount of frizz, softness, and shininess of my hair.. and I was highly disappointed. It really didnt tame my frizz at all, made it a slight bit softer and isnt shiny at all.

My boyfriend says this is nowhere near as smooth as a regular shave but then again not as irritating using this shaver. It is far too expensive for a shave that isnt as satisfactory as a $10-15 high quality razor blade (4/5blade gilette for example). This is a simple shave but not a close shave. Maybe use when you dont have much time in the morning or wherever you have to go, need to save time, or want a new easier experience than a regular razor blade.

Normally masks claim to do a lot and often I'm left let down, that was not the case with this mask. These have a TON of moisture/liquid/balm whatever youd like to call it. I was able to apply it to my face, and it was completely saturated so I decided to rub a good amount on my neck, and then once getting it in place I rubbed it into my hands. The serum I rubbed down my neck did dry a lot faster and got sticky in the crease of my neck. I left it on for 25 minutes and it absorbed extremely well. My face is so hydrated without feeling oily. It was so refreshing while I had it on, it was cooling and helped me relax. The directions say to rub the remaining serum in after you take the mask off, which I did. But it was too much serum to leave on and I felt sticky. So I wet my face and wiped the excess with a towel. The only complaint I have is that the mask is weirdly thin and I had a hard time placing it on my face correctly. The eye holes were hardly big enough and it got my lips wet.

(Green/Yellow/Rose red)\nReview Date: 2021/09/20\nStore: SportMore\nAverage Rating: 3.5\nProduct Details: {'Color': 'Yellow,Green,Red,Rose', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material': 'Plastic', 'Fabric Type': 'Velvet', 'Number of Items': '3', 'Package Dimensions': '8.23 x 7.6 x 2.24 inches; 6.74 Ounces', 'UPC': '781509879037'}\nReview Text: These made me look like a fool, like a medieval woman from the past. They are way too thick of a material and it stands probably an inch and a half almost 2 inches off of the top of your head when you put it on. Unless these are for lounging around the house where nobody will see you, I wouldnt wear them.\nReview Title: Um, what?\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n    Structure your response as:\n   \n    SUMMARY:\n    [Final synthesis of preferences and patterns]",
  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe buyer demonstrates a tendency toward beauty and personal care products, reflecting a moderate level of interest but varied satisfaction. They often express disappointment regarding product effectiveness, especially with nail and hair care items, indicating a preference for quality and functionality over mere aesthetics. Criticism of items usually relates to product durability, ease of use, and value for price, suggesting price sensitivity. \n\nCommon themes emerge around skincare and haircare needs, particularly for curly or coarse hair, where they seek moisturizing and detangling solutions but frequently find them lacking. The buyer seems particularly drawn to items that promise convenience but shows frustration when the results do not meet expectations, revealing a practical approach to beauty routines. \n\nAdditionally, they favor products that are cruelty-free and paraben-free, suggesting eco-consciousness in purchasing habits. Despite enjoying attractive packaging or design, they prefer functional items that deliver solid performance. There is a notable issue with fitting, shown in headwear purchases, indicating a need for better sizing options. Overall, their core preferences encompass high-quality, effective beauty solutions at a reasonable price, with a strong emphasis on functionality over decoration.",
