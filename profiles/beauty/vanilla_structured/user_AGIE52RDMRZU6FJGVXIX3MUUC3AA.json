The texture is nice and not too thick. Lathers up my hair nicely with a quarter size. Since I have a lot of hair, I have to use a quarter size or more. I scratch and rub my scalp for about 30-50 seconds before I rinse in a bucket. This helps me to clean my hair even better. Instead of just rinse form the shower, which dandruff can still stick in my hair.<br />I am quite impressed with the result. My hair is not too dry not oily at all but moisturized. It feels silky with some volume and smells great.\nReview Title: It's hard to manage sometimes because I don't like shampoo that weighs my hair down or make them ...\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Seya Beauty Pro Makeup Train Case with Dual Tray Removable & Adjustable Plastic Dividers (Black with Silver Trim)\nReview Date: 2018/10/30\nStore: Seya\nAverage Rating: 4.3\nProduct Details: {'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '15.3 x 9.5 x 9 inches; 6.05 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'TS04SBKF', 'UPC': '784190959972'}\nReview Text: This case is extremely sturdy with a downfall: it's too heavy.<br />It has these two closures but there is no security because there is no code pad or lock.
