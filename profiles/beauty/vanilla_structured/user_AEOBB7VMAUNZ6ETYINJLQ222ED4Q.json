I noticed a significant difference after the first use, and my teeth are already pretty white and bright! I love that this comes with a case for the trays, my old kit did not have one and I had to use a plastic bag. This kit is way more organized than most, I really like the design it is simple and doesn't contribute a lot to clutter. I have included a photo from my I boxing of the whitener kit. Very happy with this product!<br />Disclaimer: The coupon code for this product was provided to me for evaluation purposes.

This is such a great value, this is a huge amount of African black soap. African black soap is always pretty pricey where I live so I'm very glad I can buy such a good amount here from Cleopatra's choice! I use African black soap as a facial and all over cleanser. Another thing I use African black soap for is cleaning my makeup brushes and sponges. I find that African black soap cleans even better than cleansers I have purchased specifically for cleaning make up brushes. I know it works well because it makes white makeup sponges look brand new! The only issue I had with this product is that the packaging didn't really hold up in transit, it arrived with a huge dent on it, though it may have happened before transit because nothing in the package could have made this mark. I have included a photo of the damage below. This in no way changes or reduces the products effectiveness.

The gel has a nice light texture and isn't sticky at all. My eye area is soothed after I use this ( I use it morning and night). I apply the gel to my clean eye area daily and follow with a denser eye cream at night. I'm a college student that experiences many late nights. These late nights have a habit of causing me dark circles ( so not cute, haha! Makes it very obvious I stayed up all night to write that last minute paper) this has certainly been helping lighten and brighten my under eye area! It disappears into the skin almost instantly, so applying eye makeup and foundation over it is no problem. I actually think it makes my make up look better, it acts as sort of an eye primer. Loving this eye gel so far, will revise if anything changes!<br />Disclaimer: The coupon code for this product was provided to me for evaluation purposes.

The biggest problems I have with with this scrub are the unnatural dyes, they could've been left out there is no need for them. In my opinion the dye almost cheapens the perceived value of the product as the color is very bright and unnatural. It exfoliates very lightly. All in all I would not consider buying this product for myself again.<br />Disclaimer: The coupon code for this product was provided to me for evaluation purposes.
