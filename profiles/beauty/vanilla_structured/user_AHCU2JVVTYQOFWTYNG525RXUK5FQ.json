When I first opened the box, I was happy to see beautiful, soft hair! Nice and long, a little thin, but there are 3 bundles so you get quite a bit of hair.  I usually have it put in by the sew in weave but I sewed clips on some of the pieces to try it first. It is thin, so I had to put 3 pieces on the clips. But very soft and silky! I tested some pieces by coloring, they got ratty very fast. The other pieces stayed fine for about 5-6 wearings, then also started to get tangled and bunched up. I never used shampoo to clean them, only lukewarm water with a heavy conditioner. I always took them out at night.  Price was right but not sure about the quality.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThis shopper demonstrates a consistent preference for human hair extensions, particularly in lighter shades like blonde and ombre styles. The average ratings across purchases reveal a sentiment leaning towards dissatisfaction regarding quality and longevity. Common themes include challenges with thinness, tangling, and overall durability of the hair. Critically, multiple reviews indicate a tendency toward purchasing clip-in and tape-in extensions, suggesting a preference for temporary, easy-to-manage styling options. \n\nQuality preferences emphasize the desire for softness and natural appearance; however, the shopper often notes that products fail to maintain these qualities post-use, indicating a significant concern regarding how well the extensions hold up over time. Price sensitivity is evident, with feedback reflecting a belief that while prices were reasonable, the quality did not justify the cost for several purchases. The shopper ultimately expresses disappointment when the products do not meet expectations, leading to high variability in ratings. Overall, the shopper's core preferences align with a need for affordable, visually appealing extensions, but they struggle to find products that withstand regular use without compromising on quality.",
