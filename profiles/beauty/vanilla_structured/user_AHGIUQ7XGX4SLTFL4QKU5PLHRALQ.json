I was tempted to buy 3 and get 1 free but am glad I didn't now. I bought a lighter color that turns a darker sparkly pink outdoors. If you apply it indoors you can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s going on neatly.<br /><br />The Good: It does change color in the sun - the colors are nice<br />The Bad:  It doesn't go on evenly. It tends to streak and is difficult to apply.  I didn't find it to be quick-drying.<br /><br />I applied it indoors then went outside and could see how it had gone out of the nail line all over my toes and I had to use a Q-tip w/nail polish remover to clean up around the nail. It wasn't easy to do that and not remove polish that was already on there, even when waiting a few minutes for it to dry. I applied a couple more coats but still had to clean up.<br /><br />The final look is ok but doesn't look like a professional pedicure that's for sure. I'm not sure my nail-tech would appreciate having to apply this. Perhaps if I had purchased one without glitter it would have been easier to apply. I think the concept is great, and glad I tried it but also glad I didn't buy for gifts.<br /><br />The 3-star average rating this has been getting is fair.\nReview Title: Apply it outdoors\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: 10 Pcs Brown and 10 Pcs Black Wig Grip Headband for women\nReview Date: 2019/04/29\nStore: Aksice\nAverage Rating: 4.0\nProduct Details: {'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material': 'Cotton', 'Number of Items': '10', 'Item Weight': '0.04 Pounds', 'Brand': 'Aksice', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '9.29 x 3.5 x 0.39 inches; 0.64 Ounces', 'UPC': '755101763483', 'Manufacturer': 'Sekass'}\nReview Text: It is open at two ends.

The individual shows a tendency to seek value in products, opting for items with added features\u2014such as replacement pads in curlers or multifunctional makeup removers\u2014suggesting a desire for longevity and efficiency in use. \n\nRatings reveal a consistent pursuit of quality, evidenced by highly rated items and dissatisfaction with those that perform poorly or are difficult to apply. The reviewer demonstrates discernment regarding price sensitivity, as noted with repeated comments about perceived overpricing, yet a willingness to pay more for superior quality or effective results.\n\nCommon themes include an appreciation for functionality (e.g., easy-to-use applicators, effective results) and a respectful caution towards hype (brands must deliver real value). The reviewer\u2019s sentiments indicate that their expectations rise with product claims\u2014indicating they value both effectiveness and the user experience.\n\nOverall, the core preferences suggest a consumer who prioritizes efficient, high-quality beauty solutions with a keen eye for value and performance, reflecting both practical and aesthetic needs.",

I prefer a lightweight sleep mask, so I felt a bit smothered by this, lol.<br /><br />It stretches but has to be broken in as it is quite tight in the first few uses and hard to get long hair into it.
