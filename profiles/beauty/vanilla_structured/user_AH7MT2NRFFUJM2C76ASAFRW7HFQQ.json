This small thing works great on my particular length, thickness and curliness of hair. You just twiddle the bobbles around each other, and it makes my hair look classier than i thought it would. It works very well because of my curls. I did used to used the bigger spiral hair ties from this brand when I had thicker, longer hair, but those are too big for the amount of hair i have now.

In fact the human hair wig looked very synthetic, whereas this looks quite natural on.<br /><br />I always feel as though it looks noticeable at the front, but my neighbour told me it looked great, and not as noticeable as i was feeling it looked.<br /><br />The thing is, for the most part, 99% of a wig is the hair part, with 1% for the hairline, and what are most people looking at? I\u2019d say the hair.<br /><br />So, while you can successfully lay down and hide, the lace front on a human hair wig, if the hair on that wig looks fake and artificial, then it makes no difference that you\u2019ve successfully blended the hairline, if you\u2019ve got brassy yellow doll\u2019s hair on your head.<br /><br />On this wig, that 1% hairline that i felt was so noticeable, is overshadowed by the really pretty 99% hair. and you could wear a hat or scarf on the hairline if you\u2019re that bothered by it.<br /><br />I had my husband try it on lol, he looked like a rockstar, and that\u2019s when i noticed that the hairline is not nearly as noticeable as i thought, when it was on me.<br /><br />So, I\u2019m thrilled with this wig.\nReview Title: Better than some of the \u201chuman\u201d hair wigs\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: YouClean 300 Antibacterial Travel Hand Soap Sheets - Pocket/Purse/Wallet/Backpack -Great for Outdoor Camping or Daily Use (Tea Party) (Tea Party)\nReview Date: 2022/07/14\nStore: YouClean\nProduct Description: ['Brand:', 'YouClean', 'Item Form:', 'Sheet', 'Formulation:', 'Concentrated plant-based soap', 'Scent:', 'Tea Party (Chamomile, Green Tea, Tea Tree)', 'Package Box Size:', '2 x 1 x 1.5 inch', 'www.shopyouclean.com', \"We are changing our packaging.

I\u2019ve paid $5 for one filled dispenser, with a generic scent one time, and i still thought that was a great thing to have. With this pack of 8 different scents, for less than $16, you\u2019re getting a package for less than $2.<br />To say they are handy is an understatement. They are a Godsend. I don\u2019t know how often I\u2019ve gone into a bathroom, and the soap dispenser is empty. I was recently camping, and their soap dispenser in the toilets was empty during our whole stay. One thoughtful camper, left a bar of soap in a clear plastic cup, but it was a bit grimy with hairs on it, and i didn\u2019t want to use that. With these handy pocket, or purse sized dispensers, you have a fresh sheet of soap each time. And they lather up very easily, as soon as they get wet.<br />They are small enough to put into the smallest purse, even your wallet, or pocket, and you\u2019ll never be caught it out the ability to wash your hands.<br />These will last a while, as I\u2019m not planning on giving any away. I might offer a sheet here and there, but not a whole dispenser for goodness sake. I\u2019ll tell them where they can get their own.<br />I\u2019m currently using the Tea Tree and it\u2019s very fresh. I do feel very clean after using these, and will continue to recommend them to my friends.<br />Great value pack.\nReview Title: I\u2019d give these 10 \u2b50\ufe0f if i could\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Beauty Bakerie Lip Whip Liquid Metallic Lipstick, Long Lasting Lip Color, Smudge Proof Makeup, Berried, 3.5 mL\nReview Date: 2022/08/09\nStore: Beauty Bakerie\nProduct Description: ['Beauty Bakerie Berried metallic Lip whip is a metallic red liquid lipstick with hints of deep purple.

(I love Jeffree Star\u2019s formula best) and I exclusively wear them because of the longevity, i do not like to have to keep putting lipstick on. If you\u2019ve tried a lot of liquid lipsticks, you\u2019ll know that formulas can be hit and miss. Some are very flaky when they dry, some smudge. Some are a perfect consistency, and i can\u2019t say I\u2019ve found many of those. But this is one of them.<br /><br />The colour is fantastic and looks amazing on my 56 year old freckly face. It\u2019s a doe foot applicator, and is fairly easy to apply if you're confident with liquid lipstick. It\u2019s richly pigmented, and one coat was enough.<br /><br />I did not find this to be flaky when it dried. It did take marginally longer than some other brands, but once it dried, it\u2019s properly smudge proof. It looks great as is, or with a gloss on top if you like that look. I have Beauty Bakerie\u2019s Enchanted Jelly gloss, which is shimmering with iridescent fine glitter, and it looks awesome.<br /><br />And now that Fall is coming, this is going to be worn a lot. I love it. I see more tubes of this colour coming my way. I\u2019ll get anxious when my tube starts to run low.<br />And as with all Beauty Bakerie products, it\u2019s beautifully presented, and makes your heart race just to receive it lol.\nReview Title: Probably my new favourite lippie\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: L\u2019ange Argan-Infused Round Brush | Lightweight & Ergonomic Design | 43MM Tourmaline Ceramic Barrel\nReview Date: 2022/08/12\nStore: L'ANGE HAIR\nAverage Rating: 4.3\nProduct Details: {'Brand': \"L'ANGE HAIR\", 'Color': 'Rose Gold, Black', 'Shape': 'Round', 'Product Benefits': 'Smoothing', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '10.51 x 2.64 x 2.56 inches; 3.84 Ounces', 'UPC': '810108191223'}\nReview Text: I\u2019ve had many of these types of brush (with holes in the barrel) over the years.

It\u2019s the perfect size to blow dry my bangs/fringe smooth and silky looking, and give it an impressive curl. I don\u2019t blow dry the rest of my hair with a brush as it\u2019s curly (i use a diffuser on it.) I have a longer section at the back that requires blow drying with a brush, to curl it under a little bit, and because I\u2019ve just recently freshly dyed my hair red, the shine is superb with this.<br /><br />It\u2019s excellent quality, and yes it may cost a little more than your average barrel brush with holes, but in my opinion, the results are worth it.<br /><br />It\u2019s such a pretty colour, and very ergonomic and lightweight in your hand, and comes in a nice box, that it would make a nice Gift.\nReview Title: Beautiful brush\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

(I love Jeffree Star\u2019s formula best) and I exclusively wear them because of the longevity, i do not like to have to keep putting lipstick on. If you\u2019ve tried a lot of liquid lipsticks, you\u2019ll know that formulas can be hit and miss. Some are very flaky when they dry, some smudge. Some are a perfect consistency, and i can\u2019t say I\u2019ve found many of those. But this is one of them.<br /><br />The colour is fantastic and looks amazing on my 56 year old freckly face. It\u2019s a doe foot applicator, and is fairly easy to apply if you're confident with liquid lipstick. It\u2019s richly pigmented, and one coat was enough.<br /><br />I did not find this to be flaky when it dried. It did take marginally longer than some other brands, but once it dried, it\u2019s properly smudge proof. It looks great as is, or with a gloss on top if you like that look. I have Beauty Bakerie\u2019s Enchanted Jelly gloss, which is shimmering with iridescent fine glitter, and it looks awesome.<br /><br />And now that Fall is coming, this is going to be worn a lot. I love it. I see more tubes of this colour coming my way. I\u2019ll get anxious when my tube starts to run low.<br />And as with all Beauty Bakerie products, it\u2019s beautifully presented, and makes your heart race just to receive it lol.\nProbably my new favourite lippie\nL\u2019ange Argan-Infused Round Brush | Lightweight & Ergonomic Design | 43MM Tourmaline Ceramic Barrel\nL'ANGE HAIR\n{'Brand': \"L'ANGE HAIR\", 'Color': 'Rose Gold, Black', 'Shape': 'Round', 'Product Benefits': 'Smoothing', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '10.51 x 2.64 x 2.56 inches; 3.84 Ounces', 'UPC': '810108191223'}\nI\u2019ve had many of these types of brush (with holes in the barrel) over the years. They really do help with air flow when your are blow drying your hair. I wouldn\u2019t use any other kind of brush actually.<br /><br />But this is my first experience with an Argan Oil Infused Brush, and i am impressed. It\u2019s the perfect size to blow dry my bangs/fringe smooth and silky looking, and give it an impressive curl. I don\u2019t blow dry the rest of my hair with a brush as it\u2019s curly (i use a diffuser on it.) I have a longer section at the back that requires blow drying with a brush, to curl it under a little bit, and because I\u2019ve just recently freshly dyed my hair red, the shine is superb with this.<br /><br />It\u2019s excellent quality, and yes it may cost a little more than your average barrel brush with holes, but in my opinion, the results are worth it.<br /><br />It\u2019s such a pretty colour, and very ergonomic and lightweight in your hand, and comes in a nice box, that it would make a nice Gift.\nBeautiful brush",

This small thing works great on my particular length, thickness and curliness of hair. You just twiddle the bobbles around each other, and it makes my hair look classier than i thought it would. It works very well because of my curls. I did used to used the bigger spiral hair ties from this brand when I had thicker, longer hair, but those are too big for the amount of hair i have now.

Which is impossible for me anyway, with my layered curly thinning hair. In fact the only way for to achieve a smooth head of hair is to use a flatiron and a ton of product, and i just don\u2019t do that. It looks unnatural on me. I like these for the ability to look casual and unstructured. When i had longer thicker hair,i used the original invisibobble spirals, which were a game changer.

It makes my skin feel great, and ml for ml works out cheaper than Benefit\u2019s, so that\u2019s a win win situation.<br /><br />And whether i apply foundation or just a powder on top, both go on super smoothly, and nothing settles into the cracks.<br /><br />I\u2019m very much enjoying this primer.\nReview Title: Great texture\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Kopari Bubblegum Lip Gloss Kit | Strawberry, Grape, and Bubble Gum Flavors | Hydrating Blend of Shea Butter and Coconut Oil to Nourish and Soothe Chapped Lips | Vegan and Cruelty-Free\nReview Date: 2022/04/24\nStore: Kopari\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Kopari', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Sheer', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Smoothening,Soothing,Shine,Nourishing', 'Package Dimensions': '4.69 x 3.19 x 1.34 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '850036833345'}\nReview Text: Kopari, you have done it again.<br />Fabulous little set of Lip Glosses, super moisturizing and contain Coconut Oil, Shea Butter and Squalane for those dry peely cracked lips.<br /><br />They go on nice and smooth, just gently squeeze the tube, and a little bit comes out, but don\u2019t press too hard.

Normally i like a creme finish, because for lighter colours that have a frost or shimmer, it feels old fashioned to me. Still doesn\u2019t stop me hoarding them though lol.<br />I find this leans very golden on me, and less pink, and does look pretty metallic.<br />It stays on well, which is exactly why i got it. I hate re-applying lipstick.<br />This colour for me, is more of a summery colour, and goes well with the light golden and freckly look I\u2019ve managed to acquire this year.<br /><br />It\u2019s pretty, long lasting, looks good with a gloss on top, i do recommend it.\nReview Title: Very pretty colour\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Beauty Bakerie Lip Whip Liquid Metallic Lipstick, Long Lasting Lip Color, Smudge Proof Makeup, Berried, 3.5 mL\nReview Date: 2022/08/09\nStore: Beauty Bakerie\nProduct Description: ['Beauty Bakerie Berried metallic Lip whip is a metallic red liquid lipstick with hints of deep purple.

(I love Jeffree Star\u2019s formula best) and I exclusively wear them because of the longevity, i do not like to have to keep putting lipstick on. If you\u2019ve tried a lot of liquid lipsticks, you\u2019ll know that formulas can be hit and miss. Some are very flaky when they dry, some smudge. Some are a perfect consistency, and i can\u2019t say I\u2019ve found many of those. But this is one of them.<br /><br />The colour is fantastic and looks amazing on my 56 year old freckly face. It\u2019s a doe foot applicator, and is fairly easy to apply if you're confident with liquid lipstick. It\u2019s richly pigmented, and one coat was enough.<br /><br />I did not find this to be flaky when it dried. It did take marginally longer than some other brands, but once it dried, it\u2019s properly smudge proof. It looks great as is, or with a gloss on top if you like that look. I have Beauty Bakerie\u2019s Enchanted Jelly gloss, which is shimmering with iridescent fine glitter, and it looks awesome.<br /><br />And now that Fall is coming, this is going to be worn a lot. I love it. I see more tubes of this colour coming my way. I\u2019ll get anxious when my tube starts to run low.<br />And as with all Beauty Bakerie products, it\u2019s beautifully presented, and makes your heart race just to receive it lol.\nReview Title: Probably my new favourite lippie\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: L\u2019ange Argan-Infused Round Brush | Lightweight & Ergonomic Design | 43MM Tourmaline Ceramic Barrel\nReview Date: 2022/08/12\nStore: L'ANGE HAIR\nAverage Rating: 4.3\nProduct Details: {'Brand': \"L'ANGE HAIR\", 'Color': 'Rose Gold, Black', 'Shape': 'Round', 'Product Benefits': 'Smoothing', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '10.51 x 2.64 x 2.56 inches; 3.84 Ounces', 'UPC': '810108191223'}\nReview Text: I\u2019ve had many of these types of brush (with holes in the barrel) over the years. They really do help with air flow when your are blow drying your hair. I wouldn\u2019t use any other kind of brush actually.<br /><br />But this is my first experience with an Argan Oil Infused Brush, and i am impressed. It\u2019s the perfect size to blow dry my bangs/fringe smooth and silky looking, and give it an impressive curl. I don\u2019t blow dry the rest of my hair with a brush as it\u2019s curly (i use a diffuser on it.) I have a longer section at the back that requires blow drying with a brush, to curl it under a little bit, and because I\u2019ve just recently freshly dyed my hair red, the shine is superb with this.<br /><br />It\u2019s excellent quality, and yes it may cost a little more than your average barrel brush with holes, but in my opinion, the results are worth it.<br /><br />It\u2019s such a pretty colour, and very ergonomic and lightweight in your hand, and comes in a nice box, that it would make a nice Gift.\nReview Title: Beautiful brush\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n    Structure your response as:\n   \n    SUMMARY:\n    [Final synthesis of preferences and patterns]",

    "text": "This is a pretty little palette, small enough to use for traveling. Contains 12 pans of both shimmer and matte shades. Doesn\u2019t come with a brush, but no matter, i have plenty of those. It does have a mirror though. The packaging is reminiscent of London, with the Phonebox, and Big Ben printed on the front.<br /><br />The texture is very blendable, and the shades are very wearable. I\u2019m not a fan of the \u201cnatural look\u201d makeup, i like a bold eye, and you can have that with this palette. I particularly love the Red, Dark Blue, Gray and Black shades. And if you find that you want the red to look darker, you can add a bit of black into the crease, and deepen it. I always want palettes to have a black pan - it\u2019s useful for other things like lining, and smoking out.<br /><br /> If you choose to use an eyeshadow primer (or even just a concealer or foundation) then the colour payoff is more intense. If you don\u2019t wear a primer, you might need to add more on top. I always wear a primer, because it makes sure the eyeshadow stays on longer, and prevents it settling into my crease.<br /><br />Essence have some very good products, i first bought their products way back in 2007, in a bricks and mortar store, and they were so affordable, and such good quality. And they have really upped their game, and expanded their range of products over the years. To be honest, i don\u2019t really often buy drugstore brands any more, and it is a long whole since i shopped Essence, but when this popped up, i was drawn to it, like a moth to a flame, as i love eyeshadow palettes almost as much as i love shoes and bags.<br /><br />I am not at all disappointed with the quality of the product, the price, and the cute packaging.",
