I am wearing it to a friends costume party and I wanted to change my hair color.  I received this wig and love the grayish color wig.  I was surprised at the quality and the extras they give with the wig.  I received a hair net, Bobby pens, and pony tail holder, which is something I have not received with other wigs.  The wig is synthetic and does shed a bit.  But it is not a big deal while wearing it. The flow of the wig is nice and your hair blows in the wind like your real hair.  It also stayed in place-  I clamped the wig in place and was good to go.  The wig offers a nice cut and the style will look nice on many people.<br /><br />Item was purchased with a promotion for free in exchange for testing and giving my honest unbiased opinion of this product.

Old makeup on your makeup brushes harbor bacteria and can reap havac on your face.  Washing my makeup brushes has been a chore and gets very messy at times.  This set of makeup brush cleaner does a good job cleaning my brushes.  The set comes with three pieces... The large mat, has suction cups on the bottom to help keep it secured while you clean your brushes.  Each section of the mat targets different types of brushes.  The small heart shaped brush cleaner had a pocket to hold mat to deep scub brushes, and a makeup blender.  The mats are easy to use and does a good job of giving my brushes a good cleaning.  My brushes has natural hairs and it is hard to get deep down in the brissels to get all the makeup out.  The mat helps and eliminates the need for me to use my hands to scrub.  This mat got my brushes really clean.  The makeup blender works good as well.  Using this set you will not be disappointed.
