I wasnt expecting that but super happy as I knew I'd be using more than needed and wasting if I were just pouring straight from the bottle/s. Which leads me to my second point- I still think I used more than needed, particularly the conditioner. My hair is thin & rather short now so I don't need much as is, but because it's so dry & brittle the conditioner seemed to have a bit of difficulty actually saturating and smoothing out so I kept pumping more out and adding it. Well I ended up just clipping it back to sit for a bit like usual & let me tell you...when I took it out it was so silky smooth I was surprised it didnt fall out of the clip on it's own. The smell is a rather strong floral scent, I've noticed all my Korean hair products have a strong floral scent to them tho & personally I dont mind it.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:  \nThe shopping behavior reveals a strong preference for skincare and hair care products, particularly those marketed for exfoliating and moisturizing benefits. Consistent high ratings (around 5.0) for product bundles indicate appreciation for perceived value and convenience. Sentiments across reviews emphasize satisfaction with product functionality and design, specifically packaging with pumps as a notable plus, which suggests a proclivity towards user-friendly products. \n\nThemes of product purpose show a keen interest in addressing concerns like dry or itchy scalp and maintaining overall hair health, indicating that hair condition significantly influences purchasing decisions. \n\nQuality preferences lean towards all-natural, sulfate-free ingredients, often with a floral scent, reflecting an inclination towards both gentle and enjoyable sensory experiences. The user demonstrates moderate price sensitivity\u2014valuing bundles that deliver good quality at competitive prices, yet also willing to invest in potentially more expensive, high-quality items when they promise effective results.\n\nUltimately, this person\u2019s core preferences center around high-value, well-packaged, quality skincare and haircare products that promise not only functionality but also a pleasant user experience.",
