Consistently high ratings suggest a favorable sentiment towards exfoliating and moisturizing items, although experiences vary based on product texture and scent. The person is cautious with products that are overpoweringly scented or greasy, as seen in the negative review for a tinted moisturizer.\n\nCommon themes in their selections include items intended for specific beauty purposes, such as toning, moisturizing, and skin repair, signaling an interest in maintaining a healthy complexion. The use of products for nail care also indicates an emphasis on self-care routines.\n\nQuality plays a crucial role in their purchasing behavior\u2014they express appreciation for well-made, durable items, as evidenced by the positive sentiment toward the nail curing lamp. Price sensitivity appears moderate, with higher value placed on performance and user experience rather than mere cost.\n\nOverall, this consumer values effective skincare solutions that enhance their beauty routine without compromising on quality, with a specific wariness towards scents and textures that are unappealing.",

I found the ampules ready to open with scissors and the product was really easy to apply.  It made me break out soon after using it probably the fragrance they used in it.
