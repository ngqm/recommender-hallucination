I just had to try it on myself because I have eczema and they said it is hypoallergenic. I can tell you that it doesn't irritate my skin ad the softness is really noticeable...and that you might not be able to notice on your baby because a babies skin is (usually) already soft. I am an adult that has allergies to a lot of things that show up in skin irritations, and I do not think that you can go wrong with buying this lotion. This is a great one for your newborn, baby, and the whole family. The only con would be if you don't like the smell of baby powder.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThis individual showcases a strong preference for personal care products focusing on skin sensitivity, effectiveness, and family suitability. They rate hypoallergenic and gentle formulations highly, indicating a need for products that cater to delicate skin, especially for both themselves and family members, with a notable focus on moisturizing efficacy.\n\nIn addition to skincare, there is a distinctly practical interest in reusable and eco-friendly items, as evidenced by their purchase of makeup remover cloths. These products resonate with their values on sustainability while also highlighting a desire for efficiency and ease in daily routines.\n\nQuality is consistently prioritized, with high ratings for softness, effectiveness, and performance across diverse categories, though there is a clear sensitivity to pricing; they express concern over price versus value in a couple of reviews. This suggests they are willing to invest in quality but seek confirmation that products deliver on promised benefits.\n\nOverall, the core preferences center around gentle, effective personal care, an inclination towards sustainable practices, emphasis on quality and performance, and a cautious approach to pricing. This user appears to be a thoughtful shopper, carefully balancing quality, family needs, and cost-effectiveness in their purchases.",

They are crafted well with a good choice of soft fabric for the covering.<br /><br />CONSTRUCTION: Inside of the fabric there is a skinny headband that can stretch to a huge width without breaking, and it goes right back into the shape that it came in. The skinny headbands have a semi-stiff, but flexible piece (like thick stiff felt) around them to support the fabric to the width that is shown in the photos.<br /><br />Please watch the video that I uploaded to see the flexibility and the other things that I mentioned that is not written here. These are a really good product! As I am writing this we are still wearing masks due to the covid-19 pandemic. These headbands are really helpful in keeping my hair out of my face and off of my mask when shopping. Having a comfortable headband is important to me when I also wear glasses and a mask.",
