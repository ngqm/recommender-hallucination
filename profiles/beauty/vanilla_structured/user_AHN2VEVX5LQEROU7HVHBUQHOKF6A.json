  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:  \nThis individual demonstrates a clear preference for beauty and personal care products, particularly those related to makeup and temporary body art. Consistently high ratings reflect satisfaction with ease of use, durability, and versatility. There is a notable inclination towards products that enhance appearance, such as skin-moisturizing oils and hair styling tools, indicating a desire for practical and aesthetic improvements.\n\nRecurring themes in their purchases include temporary applications, such as tattoos and hair curling without heat, suggesting a preference for non-permanent solutions. Quality returns as a priority, as the customer shares experiences with product longevity and effectiveness, while also voicing caution for sensitive hair types.\n\nPrice sensitivity appears moderate, with some emphasis on value-for-money, especially in products requiring multiple uses or offering a full kit. Products encompassing skin hydration and hair care are favored, although there is critical awareness of specific needs, as seen in product tool compatibility with hair types. Overall, the buyer leans towards high-functionality cosmetics that provide reliable results, utilized for both personal and artistic expression.",
