  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe individual demonstrates a diverse range of interests, particularly in personal care and beauty products, with a notable emphasis on skin and hair treatments. There are consistent patterns of disappointment with product performance, particularly regarding ease of use and effectiveness, as reflected in lower ratings for items like nail clips and eyeliners that have specific application challenges. Common themes indicate a preference for moisturizing and nourishing attributes in skincare formulations, as there is a recurrent focus on hydration and skin health. \n\nThis person's quality expectations are moderate, as they tend to rate products from 1 to 5 in a narrow range, reflecting some price sensitivity; likely indicating budget-conscious choices primarily for frequently used beauty and skincare items. While they value aesthetics (e.g., eye liner colors and wig appearance), functionality seems crucial, as demonstrated by their dissatisfaction when products fail to meet practical application expectations. \n\nOverall, the core preferences center on high-quality, effective personal care products that provide nourishing qualities, combined with a sensitivity to user-friendly design and efficacy.",
