But what I disliked about this flat iron is that the on/off switch in inside. They are push button too and not just a click/slide. Thought this was strange. While it's no unusual to have the switches inside, I found them more difficult to access on this iron. It's not uncommon to have the on/off on the outside and the heat control on the inside. I like the thinness of it though and it heats up fast enough. No issues there. It does its job. It just didn't hit my favorite flat iron list.\nReview Title: Great Color\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: 2 in 1 Hair Straightener and Curler Travel Curling Flat Iron Wand Crimper, Dual Voltage 110V-240V Ceramic Tourmaline 1 1/4 inch Portable\nReview Date: 2019/02/14\nStore: Madenia\nAverage Rating: 3.8\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Madenia', 'Material': 'Ceramic', 'Size': '14 Inch (Pack of 1)', 'Item Weight': '0.9 Pounds', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '15.7 x 3.3 x 2.4 inches; 14.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '781573208030'}\nReview Text: The size of this is great for me to do big fold unders or uppers. I have more of a pixie cut. It was nice and hot within a minute or so.  It has automatic shutoff, a must IMO, and you can adjust the temperature easily with a wee switch. You merely push a button on the side--one to use the curler, the other one to use the flat iron. It comes with a travel bag/pouch. I think it's a great deal for the price. I like that I only have to plug ONE appliance in to do my hair instead of plugging in both a curler and straightener.\nReview Title: Curls very well\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: FAELBATY 2 Pack Shower Caps for Women Waterproof and Reusable Elastic Printed Shower Cap Beauty Salon Spa Shower Caps (leopard)\nReview Date: 2020/11/23\nStore: FAELBATY\nAverage Rating: 4.0\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'FAELBATY', 'Material': 'Ethylene Vinyl Acetate (EVA)', 'Pattern': 'Leopard', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Number of Pieces': '2', 'Package Dimensions': '8.9 x 6.65 x 1.06 inches; 1.41 Ounces'}\nReview Text: It works.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe individual's purchasing behavior reveals a pragmatic approach to beauty products, with a focus on functionality and convenience. Consistent moderate ratings (3.0 - 4.3) indicate a balanced satisfaction, often tempered by usability concerns. Key themes include a preference for multi-functional products, as seen in the choice of a dual-purpose hair straightener/curler, underscoring a desire for efficiency.\n\nQuality considerations are evident, particularly in hair tools; features like heat control and automatic shutoff are valued, while the accessibility of design elements (like switch placement) is critiqued. In beauty items such as lip products, effectiveness and comfort are essential; dissatisfaction arises from products that require frequent reapplication or lack moisture.\n\nPrice sensitivity emerges, with a noted reluctance to overpay for less durable or lower-quality items, particularly shower caps described as flimsy but workable. Overall, the individual's core preferences reflect a strong emphasis on practicality, usability, and durability, coupled with a cautious approach to spending on beauty and personal care items. This suggests a discerning consumer who prioritizes both value and performance in their purchases.",

I found that to get the best instant results, three drops per leg were the best. but that's also when you may get some minor streaking, but nothing compared to other self tanners I've used. I also used this on my tan lines to fade them. it works, but it also fades fast. Plan to use it every day.<br /><br />I like that you mix it with your own lotion, so you can control the scent.<br /><br />Very good price. Can't beat that.",
