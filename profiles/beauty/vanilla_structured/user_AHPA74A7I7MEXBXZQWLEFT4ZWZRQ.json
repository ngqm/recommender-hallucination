  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe individual exhibits a clear pattern of dissatisfaction with hair products, particularly those related to wigs and extensions, highlighting issues of shedding, tangling, and reported inaccuracies in density and length. Recurring sentiments reveal frustration with hair quality, often deeming products as \"thin\" or \"fake,\" pointing to a strong preference for genuine, high-density human hair.\n\nCommon themes indicate a focus on hair extensions and wigs aimed at enhancing personal style for various occasions, albeit with a palpable caution against investing in lower-quality products. The negative experiences suggest a desire for durability and reliability in product performance, especially given the tendency for promotional claims to fall short.\n\nQuality preferences lean towards unprocessed virgin human hair that feels authentic and withstands daily use, reflecting an inherent value placed on craftsmanship and material integrity. Price sensitivity is evident in repeated admonishments to \u201csave your money,\u201d indicating a reluctance to overspend on products that do not meet expectations, even as the average ratings hover around mediocre values.\n\nOverall, core preferences center on a demand for reliable, high-quality hair products that align with advertised attributes and maintain performance over time, alongside a cautious approach towards spending. The overall impression suggests a consumer who appreciates value but feels compelled to scrutinize prior to purchasing due to repeated dissatisfaction.",
