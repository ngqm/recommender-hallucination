  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe individual displays a strong preference for high-quality human hair products, particularly closures and extensions, which have received consistently positive feedback. Their ratings trend towards the higher end (4-5 stars), indicating satisfaction with products that feel soft, maintain their quality over time, and require minimal shedding. \n\nA common theme emerges around the use case of creating wigs rather than sew-in styles, reflecting a distinct interest in versatile and easily manageable hair solutions. This preference for wig-centric products indicates a desire for flexibility in styling while maintaining natural aesthetics.\n\nQuality consistently takes precedence over price; although they exhibit some price sensitivity\u2014expressing skepticism about low-cost options\u2014they ultimately report satisfaction with budget-friendly purchases that deliver quality results. The buyer favors products that are easy to care for, as evidenced by positive remarks on items that remain soft and vibrant after coloring and treatment.\n\nOverall, this analysis reveals a clear affinity for versatile, high-quality hair products that allow for creative expression, alongside a practical approach to maintenance and care.",

The texture of the hair was great and the bundles have a great luster. The bundles have thin ends and that's the only thing I disliked. But for the price of the bundles I expected that. No tangling, shedding, the color is even and the wig turned out great a pop with the peek a boo color underneath. I wore it to a concert and was asked 3 times about my hair. Good Buy!",
