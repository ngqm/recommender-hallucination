I wish it wasn't fragrance free though. I personally like a little fragrance with my shampoo experience. I also love the way my hair smells afterwards. It's nice and it does clean well but I wish they'd consider making a similar product that's scented with jasmine or lavender.\nReview Title: Nice Product, No smell\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: ViviDreamore Satin Bonnet Silk Bonnet for Sleeping Silk Sleep Cap Hair Bonnet for Sleeping Bonnets for Women Curly Natural Braid Hair Bonnet for Men Adjustable Wide Band Double Layer(Brown)\nReview Date: 2022/10/08\nStore: ViviDreamore\nAverage Rating: 3.6\nProduct Details: {}\nReview Text: This review is for ViviDreamore Satin Bonnet Silk Bonnet for Sleeping Silk Sleep Cap Hair Bonnet for Sleeping.<br /><br />This is the perfect bonnet because unlike the others it's adjustable. There's a big black belt sewn inside that you use to adjust it to whatever size you want. It can be loose and comfortable if that's the way you adjust it and it won't slip off, even while you're sleeping, it's still the perfect fit. I have a million of these bonnets and they're now way too loose after minimal wear only because you can't adjust them the way you can this one.\nReview Title: Perfect adjustable bonnet\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: LA MAXIME chemical free, natural organic vegan best body oil after shower for glowing skin, anti-aging with vitamins A C E for wrinkle repair & soothing hydrating body oil for extremely dry aging, mature, sensitive atopic eczema skin conditions for women and men over 30 40 50 60 (3.4 fl oz)\nReview Date: 2022/11/09\nStore: LA MAXIME\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'LA MAXIME', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Active Ingredients': 'coconut oil,sunflower seed oil,vitamin a,watermelon', 'Unit Count': '3.40 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.94 x 2.24 x 2.13 inches; 10.58 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'HGRBO-100', 'UPC': '611138337502'}\nReview Text: This review is for LA MAXIME Heavenly Glow Regenerating Body Oil.<br /><br />I love this product.
