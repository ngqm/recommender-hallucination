  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:  \nThe individual's shopping behavior reveals a consistent preference for wigs, particularly headband styles, with an emphasis on synthetic and human hair materials. Ratings indicate a mixed sentiment toward product quality; while ratings like 4.0 suggest satisfaction with appearance and functionality, lower ratings highlight issues, particularly with tangling and quality control.\n\nCommon themes suggest the wigs are intended for daily use, focusing on aesthetic appeal rather than natural texture. The user expresses a specific interest in modern styles, catering to fashion rather than traditional authenticity. Notably, a recurring issue with one product indicated potential health concerns, affecting sentiment negatively.\n\nQuality preferences lean toward softness and ease of styling, notably with added conditioning. However, a notable price sensitivity is observed, as some comments reflect an adjustment strategy (e.g., adding hair bundles to enhance thickness). Despite being willing to spend on quality, dissatisfaction arises when expectations are not met, particularly regarding product integrity.\n\nIn summary, the core preferences indicate a strong interest in practical yet stylish wigs, with a balanced approach to quality and price. However, the experience with specific sellers emphasizes a need for thorough quality assurance, impacting future purchasing decisions.",
