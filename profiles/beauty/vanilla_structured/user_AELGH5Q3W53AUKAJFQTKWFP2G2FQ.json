So, I use hair Kleeva conditioner first, then  in a few minutes I wash it with Kleeva shampoo. Works much better than doing it other way. My family and I use more conditioner then we do shampoo in winter time. We use it to not only moisturize our hair but make it silky smooth so that there are no tangles and brushes slide right through. The first thing I noticed about our new conditioner was the nice bottle and great smell. Even though the ingredient list was confusing, I really liked the quality of the conditioner.<br /><br />  This conditioner  helps to restore your hairs strength.

Pure body have a nice line of products. I love scrubs with different ingredients, I use grapefrut scent in the morning. The scent is all natural, which is a huge deal for me because any chemical scent gives me a headache. I have enjoyed every single product from them I have bought and I use them every day. I love that this body scrub exfoliates my skin without removing all the moisture. It lives my skin very smooth , like after day at the spa. What is does for me is helps me with exfoliating my skin. Here how I work with it: I scrub my cellulite areas with this product. I also add some body wash to the scrub in order for me to make my job of ''scrubbing'' easier. Then I use cellulite cream. Then, I apply a homemade wrap with grocery bags on top. Then, heating pad on the low settings, then, my waist trimmer on top. Have it for an hour. While that time I study or sleep. I also drink detoxifying tea during the procedure. After that I wash it all off, then scrub it again with this scrub and apply cellulite cream. I try to eat healthy, too. That's how I get result. Usually, it does not come just from one product alone. This scrub have such a great smell!!! it has a nice jar, too, so you can buy it for a present.<br />I was provided this product at a reduced price to complete and post a factual review without compensation.

I chose the scent because citrus helps me wake up in the morning.\nReview Title: Wake up and smell the grapefruit\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

If you don't believe me, then literally look it up. WebMD will state that it helps with joint disorders, eye surgeries, and healing wounds/burns and more.<br /><br />The big statement here really is that it's very effective for any sort of regenerative properties. The serum is a very good moisturizer, and don't let the word &#34;acid&#34; turn you off of it. It's actually found in high quantities in the skin of a baby, which everyone knows is incredibly soft.<br /><br />This product, applied to your face, will protect it from UV damage, improve elasticity, make your face feel softer, and properly moisturize it.<br /><br />I have ben using products by Derma- nu for a while and this is my second buy of this serum. Do proper research before you buy products that you're going to put on your face to be seen everyday. I did, and I found this reliable product. The greatest thing is that it works with almost every skin type be it oily, dry, or combination. This is terrific because my skin is very, very combination and while parts of my face are dry, some are a little more oily. This balanced everything out very nicely , that's why I am getting the second bottle of the same one.<br />As they stated  that &#34;This Formula Has Been Infused with Vitamin C + Vitamin E + Green Tea Extract For Their Superior Anti Aging Benefits&#34;. I used to make my own masks with vitamin E, green tea and many other ingredients but it just takes too much time to mix it yourself. I alternate this serum with Derma-nu other serum to balance it. My skin is visibly better now.<br /><br />If you're on the fence, just buy it anyway. It's not expensive for what it does, and if you don't like it just get your money back with the 100% guarantee. You probably won't just like it...you'll love it.
