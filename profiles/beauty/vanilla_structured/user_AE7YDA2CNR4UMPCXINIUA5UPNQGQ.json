Suction up into the dropper and apply manually to areas of your beard with a few more drops in thicker areas. Then use a comb to spread (while working out any tangles).<br /><br />The sheen and pop was immediate and it takes a little bit for the oils to soak in.<br /><br />The scent is fantastic.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThis individual demonstrates a notable preference for products with specific scents and functionalities, while also revealing some sensitivity to quality and performance. The varying ratings suggest a discerning attitude towards products, with a tendency to favor those that meet high aesthetic and functional standards but expressing disappointment when expectations are not met, particularly regarding fragrance authenticity and product efficacy.\n\nCommon themes include a focus on skincare and grooming products, indicating an interest in personal care routines. Scents like lavender and cedarwood seem to resonate positively when accurately presented, but mismatched expectations lead to dissatisfaction. Their reviews highlight a need for effective hydration and enhancement in beauty products, suggesting a prioritization of functionality alongside sensory experience.\n\nQuality is a recurring concern; items rated poorly tend to be those that feel inadequate or irritating, while higher ratings correlate with products that deliver on promised benefits and application experiences. Additionally, the analysis reveals a moderate price sensitivity; they seem willing to invest in higher-quality items, yet they clearly expect value commensurate with their investment.\n\nIn conclusion, the core preferences reflect a desire for authentic scents, high-quality grooming and skincare products, effective performance, and an overall rewarding user experience, paired with a reasonable approach to pricing.",
