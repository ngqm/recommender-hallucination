This one for dry and damaged hair and a keratin one. First, I want to say my hair is very damaged. The top of my hair seems oily but the bottom is super dry. I buy regular conditioner from just any store and they never detangle my hair. My niece told me I needed to try a \"hair mask.\" I had never heard of it but she swears by it. So I decided to give it a try. You guys, it really works. You have to follow the directions though and put it on your hair longer than what the bottle says. The more damaged your hair is, the longer you should keep it on. I left mine on for a long while.. I cant even remember how long. I think maybe 30 minutes? Anyhow, when I washed it off, my hair actually was actually easier to comb through. I wish I could find conditioners like this though b/c I don't want to spend so much washing my hair!\nReview Title: leave on longer and it will be smoother\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: PARWIN BEAUTY Curling Wand 5 in 1 Curling Iron Set with 5 Interchangeable Ceramic Barrels 0.5\u201d to 1.25\u201d Hair Curling Wand Set, Rose Gold\nReview Date: 2020/07/21\nStore: PARWIN PRO BEAUTY\nAverage Rating: 4.2\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'PARWIN PRO BEAUTY', 'Hair Type': 'All, Curly, Fine, Normal', 'Material': 'Ceramic', 'Size': '1 Count (Pack of 1)', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Package Dimensions': '10.1 x 4.8 x 3.2 inches; 2.55 Pounds', 'UPC': '658709253601', 'Manufacturer': 'PARWIN BEAUTY'}\nReview Text: I returned this.

But I ended up keeping it for myself!! The moisturizer is so nice. In the cold season, I have real bad dry skin on my face. Ira horrible. Or gets flaky at this. I have used some moisturizer that felt too thin (but great for  summer).  It seemed like it was doing a good job then then the flakes came right  back so it was very surface  and didn\u2019t penetrate. Then I\u2019ve had very thick moisturizer  like the one you use at night. The problem with this is sometimes it made like little balls. I\u2019m not sure how to describe it but it kind of made a layer and then peeled  off. So I needed something in between. This wa a perfect. It is actually thick but liquidy. In other words it is very moisturizing. After you put it on, you need to let it soak in and dry a little. But it works great. Normally  I have combo skin. I use deep moisturizer only in the winter.\nReview Title: Not too thick and not too thin\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Natwag Makeup Remover Pads,18 Pack 3.74 Inch Reusable Microfiber Cleansing Pad with Laundry Bag Suitable for All Skin Types,3 Color Facial Cleansing Pad Set.\nReview Date: 2020/11/19\nStore: Natwag\nAverage Rating: 4.6\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Natwag', 'Skin Type': 'All Skin,Dry', 'Material Feature': 'Reusable', 'Unit Count': '18.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '18', 'Package Dimensions': '4.4 x 4.37 x 2.59 inches; 3.84 Ounces', 'UPC': '745103569701'}\nReview Text: These pads are very soft. So I do like that about the pads. However, they are also thin. My concern is that I'm not sure how often I can use them. The good thing also is that you get a lot. So I don't think it really is intended to be used indefinitely. I love these to bring to travel. They are small and super handy. I used to bring some face wipes but I find that those dont actually take off all your makeup! I was watching a tutorial in which they said to actually used different type of remover so you would need a cloth. So this is ideal. Also it saves from wash if you use a cotton wipe instead!\nReview Title: soft, great for travel, and good for environment\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: C'est Moi Gentle Cleansing Water | Gentle, Fragrance-Free Cleanser Removes Makeup and Refreshes Skin, Made with Cornflower Water, Aloe Vera, and Strawberry, Kiwi, and Apple Extracts | 5.9 fl oz.\nReview Date: 2020/11/25\nStore: C'est Moi\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Skin Type': 'Acne Prone,Sensitive', 'Brand': \"C'est Moi\", 'Scent': 'Kiwi, Strawberry, Unscented, Aloe Vera', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '1.84 x 1.84 x 6.06 inches; 7.69 Ounces', 'UPC': '039897626055'}\nReview Text: I love that this product is make of a bunch of natural items. I've been concern lately of these items with ingredients that are bad for us and we don't even know! So I dont actually use this alone. I use a makeup remover wipe first and then I use this also to catch what is left. What i noticed is that this isn't the type of remover where you just used it and then can walk away. You do have to use water to clean off your face after. I also have sensitive skin and I will say it did not irritate my skin at all. I didn't think it had any smell to it really. I do like it but I wouldn't give it a full 5 star because of the fact that you do have to do an extra step to be clean after.\nReview Title: removes makeup well but have to wash aftewards\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: [the SAEM] Derma Plan Cleansing Bubble Pad 15pcs - One Step Gentle Makeup Cleansing Wipes Produce Fine & Dense Bubbles, Hypoallergenic Formula, Pore Clean, Mild Exfoliation\nReview Date: 2020/11/25\nStore: THESAEM\nAverage Rating: 3.6\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'THESAEM', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Unit Count': '15.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '3.9 x 3.9 x 1.8 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nReview Text: Overall, this is a pretty fair item depending on your need. For a daily item, this would not rank high for me (due to the cons listed below). However, for traveling, this is amazing as it comes dry and is in a convenient container. You can take it anywhere easily.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- I like the packaging but wonder if this made it more dry?<br />- the size is nice to travel with and convenient<br />- it is refreshing<br />- theres a hole where you put your finger in to use it so that was really neat<br /><br />Cons:<br />- is thin<br />- instructions are not in english<br />- not enough pads in the container<br />- you have to wet it first to use it and it does get kind of messy\nReview Title: great for travel but not for every day use\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n    Structure your response as:\n   \n    SUMMARY:\n    [Final synthesis of preferences and patterns]",
  "raw_response": "**SUMMARY:**\n\nThe purchase data reveals a strong preference for hair care products, especially those that address damage and tangling. This individual prioritizes effectiveness, as evidenced by the high ratings for products that provide hydration and detangling benefits, particularly for colored or damaged hair. A notable pattern is the willingness to invest time and effort into hair treatment processes, with recommendations to leave products on longer indicating a commitment to achieving optimal results.\n\nIn terms of product types, the buyer shows interest in multifunctional items such as detanglers and deep conditioners that serve dual purposes (hydration and damage repair). There is a recurring theme of seeking convenience and practicality, illustrated by the purchase of mini elastic bands for easier hairstyles and travel-friendly containers for personal care products.\n\nQuality is critical; the customer exhibits higher satisfaction with well-reviewed, effective products, despite expressing price sensitivity, shown by frustration over product disappointments and returns related to perceived value. \n\nOverall, the core preferences are for effective, high-quality hair care solutions that cater to specific needs (hydration and damage repair), alongside practical, multifunctional products that are travel-friendly and convenient for daily use.",

    "text": "I have an aunt in another state who is a hair dresser. Years ago, she asked me if I wanted to perm my lashes when she came down to visit. I thought she was crazy! This was like 10 years ago. I never heard of such a thing and I didn't do it. Well I don't know what happened recently for this to suddenly now become popular. One of my friends and I were talking about lash extensions and lattisse. I was telling her how my eye lids turn red when i try to use lattisse. I even tried the RF brand and same thing! Anyhows, then i've been doing exentions for about a year now but I am finding that my lash is getting worst and worst.. like when my extensions fall out, I barely have lashes! I used to have average lash that  I could curl. But now it seems like I barely have anything. So this is why I decided to finally consider perming my lash. So perming the did not make it longer by any means! What it did though is made it look like I had lashes that were longer but it curved up! My lash tends to grow straight. It may have have to do with the fact that I have asian eyes. So the curling has always been important when I used to wear mascara. The thing is I hate that sometimes it poked at me and the curler would yank some lashes out!  Also I just hate it doing it every day. With perm lashes, you don't have to do this. However, I don't know if I could have done this alone. I had to get a friend to help me. She said it was pretty easy. What took the longest is us reading things over and over to make sure we weren't going to make me blind! I think it took about an hour or so? I can't recall exactly as we didn't time it.  The reason I am giving it 4 stars is that you really cannot do this by yourself.  Now it may not look drastic to most people bc they don't usually notice your lashes. But you would b/c you know how they look before. Then add mascara and you can definitely tell.",
