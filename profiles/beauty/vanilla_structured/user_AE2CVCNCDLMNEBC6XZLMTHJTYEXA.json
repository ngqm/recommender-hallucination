  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe purchase history reveals a strong preference for hair-related products, particularly crochet braids and hair styling aids, but showcases significant dissatisfaction with product consistency and quality. Multiple purchases from the same brands initially led to positive experiences, but recent interactions highlighted critical issues, particularly with product usability and effectiveness, resulting in low ratings and a shift in brand loyalty.\n\nCommon themes suggest a need for dependable quality in hair products, as inconsistency in performance led to negative sentiments. Price sensitivity appears moderate; while some products were deemed too cheap and of low quality, the customer is willing to invest in higher-rated options if they meet expectations.\n\nAdditionally, recurring quality preferences indicate a demand for functional designs\u2014especially concerning closures and usability in hair styling accessories\u2014implying that even well-designed products may falter if they lack practical functionality. Overall, the individual values high quality and reliability over price, signifying a clear pivot towards seeking out brands that guarantee consistent quality before making future purchases.",
