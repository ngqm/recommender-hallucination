    "text": "Evolve Boar Bristle Purse Size Brush<br />  I needed a new brush for my purse & now I have one!  Just the perfect size & weight for my purse.  Lightweight yet sturdy.  No plastic!  This brush would also be perfect for a toddler's hair or an elderly person's thin hair. No sharp edges to poke you!<br />  I have never had a boar's hair brush so I suppose there is a bald boar running around somewhere!  Not in my neighborhood, I hope!!<br />  I just hope I don't lose this brush!  I have a hard time keeping brushes.  Usually, I lose them.  Sometimes my cat decides he likes my brush, so I give in.  He needs to stay out of my purse!<br />  I'm hoping this brush works out.  Then I will graduate up to the larger sizes.  I think the plastic brushes are rough on my hair & pull some hair out.<br />  So far, I'm loving this brush.  It really smooths & tames my hair down  If you want a natural soft brush, this is the one for you.  I don't use this brush on wet hair.  I switched over to a wide tooth comb.  My plastic brushes are in the trash!!<br />  I did receive this brush at a reduced cost for an honest opinion.  I love it!  Thank You!!",
