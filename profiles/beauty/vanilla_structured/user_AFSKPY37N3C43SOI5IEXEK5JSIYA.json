As was mentioned in other reviews, it is smaller and more lightweight than other rechargeable toothbrushes. But, beyond that, I just don't get i. I stopped using my older Phillips Sonicare to use this for the past two+ weeks. The vibrations on this brush are very small and I find myself pushing the toothbrush into my teeth and scrubbing to be sure they are getting clean. Maybe there is some secret sonic vibration thing going on, but it didn't happen for me. If I didn't actually have to still 'brush my teeth' manually with this electric toothbrush, maybe it would be fine. However, it's not the case. Without manual intervention, my teeth did not feel clean. As an fyi, I stopped using it this morning and went back to my Phillips.\nReview Title: I just don't get it\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Philips Sonicare Essence+ Gum Health & Airfloss Rechargeable Electric Flosser, Bundle Value Pack, HX8218/02\nReview Date: 2017/10/23\nStore: Philips Sonicare\nProduct Description: ['Improve your oral health with the new Philips Sonicare Essence+ Gum Health & Airfloss Rechargeable Electric Flosser Value Bundle.

This makes a great gift package for someone you love, giving them everything they need to keep their mouth/gum health optimal. I have had issues (particularly gums) for the past 5 years. No ones fault but my own for not taking care of my mouth the way I should have all these years. This flosser is great. I fill it with Act Restoring mouthwash and use it after brushing. It amazes me how much stuff this flosser removes with a simple puff of air. Of course, you can purchase both these items separately, but you save in getting them together. Sonicare  makes the best tooth/gum care products on the market bar none!\nReview Title: Great combo pack.

I looked at the reviews (which were mostly positive) and thought I would give it a try. My skepticism was quickly diminished after trying this for just a few days. I typically shower every morning and I have Vitamin C and Retinol that I apply to my face. So, when I got this I put it in the freezer and followed the instructions. So, instead of just applying the serums to my face, I started using this roller along with the serums. After less than a week I noticed much less puffiness around my eyes (and I am prone to that area to have bags and puffiness). I also noticed my skin looking noticeably better overall. I think applying this roller to my skin allows the pores to absorb the serums faster and deeper. I will continue to use this going forward. I am really impressed with the results!\nReview Title: This really works!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Iryasa Night Indulge Cream - Natural Face Cream for Dry Skin - Vegan Anti Aging Night Cream for Women - Firming Cream for Face and Neck - Organic Vitamin C Moisturizer for Face - 1.7oz\nReview Date: 2020/06/28\nStore: IRYASA\nAverage Rating: 3.7\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'IRYASA', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '1.7 Ounce', 'Use for': 'Face', 'Skin Type': 'Mature', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2.76 x 2.76 x 2.2 inches; 1.76 Ounces'}\nReview Text: To be honest, I rarely have used an overnight cream. Typically, my skin care routine is the same morning and night (wash, apply hyalauronic serum, and some kind of moistutrizer). So, when I saw this Iryasa cream I wanted to try it. Easy to apply, you can immediately feel the moisture starting to work. I do apply this about 30 minutes before I actually go to sleep to allow it time to be absorbed (before putting my face on my pillow) as it is a thicker type of cream and needs time. My skin in the morning feels better than ever. Soft and supple, I definitely feel a difference after using this for over 2 weeks now.

I had assumed it was like other scrubs I use but it wasn't. This is a powder which you need to mix with water to make a paste before you put it on your face. I have a tendency to like to use scrubs in the shower with me, so this extra step doesn't really work for me. As far as the scrubbing factor goes, it's ok. I didn't feel a real smoothing or softening of my skin after use the way I have with others. The biggest plus is the fragrance (i love the smell of oranges).

I had assumed it was like other scrubs I use but it wasn't. This is a powder which you need to mix with water to make a paste before you put it on your face. I have a tendency to like to use scrubs in the shower with me, so this extra step doesn't really work for me. As far as the scrubbing factor goes, it's ok. I didn't feel a real smoothing or softening of my skin after use the way I have with others. The biggest plus is the fragrance (i love the smell of oranges).

As was mentioned in other reviews, it is smaller and more lightweight than other rechargeable toothbrushes. But, beyond that, I just don't get i. I stopped using my older Phillips Sonicare to use this for the past two+ weeks. The vibrations on this brush are very small and I find myself pushing the toothbrush into my teeth and scrubbing to be sure they are getting clean. Maybe there is some secret sonic vibration thing going on, but it didn't happen for me. If I didn't actually have to still 'brush my teeth' manually with this electric toothbrush, maybe it would be fine. However, it's not the case. Without manual intervention, my teeth did not feel clean.

This makes a great gift package for someone you love, giving them everything they need to keep their mouth/gum health optimal. I have had issues (particularly gums) for the past 5 years. No ones fault but my own for not taking care of my mouth the way I should have all these years. This flosser is great. I fill it with Act Restoring mouthwash and use it after brushing. It amazes me how much stuff this flosser removes with a simple puff of air. Of course, you can purchase both these items separately, but you save in getting them together. Sonicare  makes the best tooth/gum care products on the market bar none!\nReview Title: Great combo pack.

I looked at the reviews (which were mostly positive) and thought I would give it a try. My skepticism was quickly diminished after trying this for just a few days. I typically shower every morning and I have Vitamin C and Retinol that I apply to my face. So, when I got this I put it in the freezer and followed the instructions. So, instead of just applying the serums to my face, I started using this roller along with the serums. After less than a week I noticed much less puffiness around my eyes (and I am prone to that area to have bags and puffiness). I also noticed my skin looking noticeably better overall. I think applying this roller to my skin allows the pores to absorb the serums faster and deeper. I will continue to use this going forward.

Typically, my skin care routine is the same morning and night (wash, apply hyalauronic serum, and some kind of moistutrizer). So, when I saw this Iryasa cream I wanted to try it. Easy to apply, you can immediately feel the moisture starting to work. I do apply this about 30 minutes before I actually go to sleep to allow it time to be absorbed (before putting my face on my pillow) as it is a thicker type of cream and needs time. My skin in the morning feels better than ever. Soft and supple, I definitely feel a difference after using this for over 2 weeks now.

Then I saw the ingredients after the first time and saw it contained formaldehyde and that was the last time I used the actual treatment.
