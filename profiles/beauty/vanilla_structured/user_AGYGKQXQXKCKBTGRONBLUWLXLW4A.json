It was packaged nicely especially since it was sent in a box! When I first took the wig out I saw that I received some eye lashes but no wig cap. The hair on the wig is very soft and manageable but when I tried it on, the first thing I was disappointed in was that the cap was smaller than I expected. The color is beautiful but lighter than expected. But I was so disappointed in the construction of the wig. If you look at the picture of me you can already see the weft showing through the bangs. Then when you just lift up the side if the wig you can how badly made the wig is. It is like this from the ear up to the top of the bangs. I was so very upset with this because all the reviews raved how good the wigs are. I am returning the wig because there isn't anyway to fix it.\nReview Title: So very disappointed and upset\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Fugady Hair Short Black Lace Front Wig Bob Loose Wavy Lace Wigs For Black Women Water Wave Lace Front Wigs Shoulder Length Pre Plucked Hairline Deep Wavy Wigs With Baby Hair Black Wig 14 Inch Wigs Synthetic\nReview Date: 2020/11/11\nStore: Fugady\nAverage Rating: 4.3\nProduct Details: {'Product Dimensions': '16 x 6 x 2 inches; 11.36 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I want to say is that I ordered a black wig and this isn't a black wig.

The wig is very thick which would be good for styles like pig tails, if yours doesn't become tangled. The length is true as you can see. And the curl pattern is just like the description says.

If you have a very sensitive head, I recommend you wear a wig cap because they can pull a haor are two. I do wear wig caps and the grip hold on the wig and the wig does sit still. Unless the wig is bigger than your head and then the wig might move around. But sometimes I don't wear a wig cap and it is comfortable for me. Now to get to the nitty gritty, these wig grip work better than any velvet wig grip I have every used. It has kept my non lace front and my lace fronts still on my head.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe purchasing history reveals a consistent preference for synthetic, wavy wigs, often featuring a glueless design. The individual tends to express disappointment regarding the fit and construction quality, particularly with cap sizes that are frequently deemed too small. While they appreciate aesthetics\u2014such as color and styling\u2014their dissatisfaction with tangling, shedding, and overall durability is notable. The sentiment towards most wigs includes a degree of frustration linked to quality control issues. \n\nPrice sensitivity emerges, as the shopper appears willing to return products not meeting their expectations, implying a demand for value. Their positive experience with wig grips indicates a preference for functional accessories that enhance their overall wig-wearing satisfaction. \n\nCore preferences synthesize around the need for well-constructed, aesthetically pleasing wigs that fit comfortably, with an inclination towards practicality and effective product functionality, indicating an openness to experimentation amidst a requirement for reliability and quality.",

    "text": "So I bought this wig from Wigoddess on a wig because the pink I had from another company was worn out. Now that is right for this wig. BUT it is definitely not a DARK PINK color. This is the lightess color of pink I have seen. Bow the roots are good and more natural. I decided to finally wear it and it does fit good except it is long around the ears which is making it difficult to glue the lace around the ears. And I don't want to cut into the wig to fix it. I have been wearing so far for 2 hours and it has barely tangled and only 2 strands of hair has come out and that is without me washing it. The lace is a light tan color and it is fitting my average size head. I have short hair. Now this is a wig that you do not have to glue is you are not clipping it back. My only major problem is that they made it an ironed in middle part which means I have to work on it for a bit to free it up which I don't like because the other pink wigs I have own were free Parting wigs and I very busy so I do not have a lot of time to work on this wig.  Now the hair is pretty full and natural looking so I don't believe the wefts will show when the wind blows which is good. It has good definition on the hair line but you can still pluck more if you need to. I know it should take heat BUT I still suggest the hot water method to straighten or curl it.",
