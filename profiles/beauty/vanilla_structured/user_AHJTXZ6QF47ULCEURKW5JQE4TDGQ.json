  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe purchase history reveals a consumer with a focus on hair-related products, demonstrating a preference for various types of wigs and extensions. A consistent pattern emerges where the individual often expresses dissatisfaction with product sizing and texture, particularly regarding synthetic items which frequently received low ratings due to misrepresentation or disappointment in quality. In contrast, human hair products tended to receive higher ratings, reflecting a preference for natural aesthetics, with notable appreciation for style, comfort, and overall appearance.\n\nCommon themes highlight a desire for versatility in hairstyles, as evidenced by purchases intended for quick application and changeability. Price sensitivity is noticeable, especially in lower-priced items where the buyer expresses hesitancy in returns despite dissatisfaction, indicating a pragmatic approach to budgeting. The buyer also values quality, evidenced by a mix of high and low ratings, suggesting they are willing to invest in products that meet their expectations.\n\nOverall, core preferences reflect a quest for stylish, versatile hair solutions with a leaning towards human hair products, strong sensitivity to quality indicators, and a cautious approach to pricing. This consumer seeks appealing aesthetics but prioritizes comfort and accurate product descriptions.",
