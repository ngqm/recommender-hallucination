It includes 7 different polygels but 5 of those 7 are around the same shade. I definitely like that this kit includes a small UV lamp along with both dual and nail forms. The dual forms on this kit are very curved which are not really my style but if you enjoy dual forms but do not like it as curved you can easily buy them on amazon separately . The polygels in this kit are on the skinny side. I think these are definitely worth it on sale and would recommend you buy them then.\nReview Title: Variety Variety Variety\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: JIADEL Gel Nail Polish Colors Set,Confetti Glitter Gel Nail Polish With No Wipe Base and Top Coat,Soak Off UV LED Nail Art Salon Starter Manicure Kit\nReview Date: 2021/03/01\nStore: JIADEL\nAverage Rating: 3.9\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'JIADEL', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Number of Items': '16', 'Liquid Volume': '0.17 Fluid Ounces', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '11 x 9 x 1 inches', 'Product Dimensions': '11 x 9 x 1 inches; 1.34 Pounds', 'UPC': '642940399488'}\nReview Text: This jiadel gel polish set brings some gorgeous unique colors to my collection.

There is a good variety of colors and some have glitter. I like this set because you get almost all the colors in a rainbow without breaking the bank and an added bonus, depending on how you look at it, is that they are small so you\u2019re more likely to use it all instead of the polish just sitting there. The one thing for me was that the blue glitter polish was very sheer and I needed like 4 coats to build it up but the other colors worked great. I definitely like this little set.\nSmall Rainbow\nBiutee Nail Mirror Powder4 Boxes 8 Colors 0.5g with 4 Brushes Nail Chameleon Powder Nail Glitter Nail Chrome Powder Manicure Unicorn Chrome Pigments\nBiutee\n{'Package Dimensions': '5.63 x 5.59 x 1.97 inches; 0.02 Ounces'}\nI have seen some reviews saying that this does not work, however for me it worked and applied perfectly. I only needed to rub it two times and it applied nicely and it looks very smooth as well. My powder did not break off like others, I\u2019d imagine it is because I was gentle with it. You do not need to rub it hard for it to apply nicely. I did have a layer at the bottom of gel polish so I do not know if that helped adhere the chrome but for me it worked great and I recommend it.\nGood performing Mirror Powder\nDienalls Dried Flowers for Nails, Nail Art Supplies for Women Acrylic Nail Decorations, with Tweezers Nail Art Accessories, 72 Pcs 3 Boxes Natural Dried Pressed Flowers\nDienalls\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.64 x 4.49 x 1.38 inches; 2.82 Ounces'}\nThese flowers for nails are nice.

It includes 7 different polygels but 5 of those 7 are around the same shade. I definitely like that this kit includes a small UV lamp along with both dual and nail forms. The dual forms on this kit are very curved which are not really my style but if you enjoy dual forms but do not like it as curved you can easily buy them on amazon separately . The polygels in this kit are on the skinny side.

The consistency is a bit weird , you only need one coat but the bottles feel empty. They are very very light compared to other gel polishes around the same size. These do change colors but only with hot water and for a few seconds, after they go back to normal which i thought wasn't very fun. They are nice colors however, i just don't know if you get a good amount of products as the bottles are dark and feel almost empty.

You have to slide it on a couple of times to get good pigmentation payoff however once you use the brush to blend it out the color slowly fades and leaves you with a sheer looking shadow. You will need to reapply a couple of times to have good coverage. Overall the colors and finish are cute however the execution could use some work.
