  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:  \nThe individual exhibits a strong inclination towards hair products, particularly wigs and braiding hair, indicating a preference for various styles and textures. Ratings suggest a mixed sentiment, as they express satisfaction with some products (notably human hair wigs) while finding others mediocre or disappointing, particularly in terms of synthetic options. \n\nCommon themes reveal a preference for quality, with higher ratings correlated to products that are soft, easy to use, and require minimal adjustment for natural appearance, emphasizing the importance of realistic looks and ease of installation. The recurring complaint about synthetic hair suggests a lower overall satisfaction compared to human hair, which they seem to favor, indicating a willingness to invest in higher-quality options.\n\nQuality is a consistent theme, as they favor products with minimal shedding, good lace blending, and lifelike appearances. They also seem sensitive to price, as reflected in their mixed ratings for lower-cost items. The presence of accessories or extra items (like edge scarves and braiding tools) appears to enhance their satisfaction when included, indicating that complementary products add value to their shopping experience.\n\nIn summary, this individual's core preferences center around high-quality, realistic human hair products with functional designs while maintaining awareness of cost-effectiveness in their selections.",
