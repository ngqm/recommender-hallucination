  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe purchase history indicates clear preferences for value, practicality, and effective performance, particularly in nail care products. The user exhibits a strong inclination towards tools and kits designed for home use, particularly in manicures and pedicures, suggesting a commitment to self-care. Positive ratings highlight satisfaction with product components and overall value, especially when products meet functional needs.\n\nConversely, negative experiences, especially with malfunctioning devices like the nail drill, indicate a low tolerance for poor quality and reliability. This reveals a preference for durable tools that deliver consistent performance. The mixed sentiment towards cosmetic products, such as eyebrow tattoos, shows a discerning taste; the user prioritizes natural aesthetics and ease of use, which translates into varying satisfaction levels.\n\nPrice sensitivity appears moderate, with acknowledgment of value being a recurring theme in successful purchases, while disappointment arises when quality does not justify the cost. In summary, the individual\u2019s core preferences center around effective, high-quality beauty care tools that offer durability and high value for a reasonable price, alongside a desire for practical solutions tailored to enhancing personal grooming experiences.",
