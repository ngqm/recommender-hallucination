Its super easy to use and creates some really cool effects with relative ease.<br /><br />In a nutshell, you use it with gel nail colors: Apply your basecoat, color (this suggests plain black or white for the best  effects) then top coat. Do not use rubbing alcohol at this point as you would typically do, but instead apply the powder, which is just like eyeshadow with an eyeshadow type applicator then seal with one last coat of gel top coat.<br /><br />It has a chrome like effect and blends nicely , to create all kinds of effects.

Don't get me wrong - I love a good bath and maybe I am crazy but I will pay up to $20 to my favorite retailer for their beautiful CBD bath bombs (which yes, also includes a crystal)  but as an avid bath salt user from basic to boutique; I cannot for the life of me understand what is in this product that justifies that price point. I compared to some of my premium brands too; just to see what this might have that they don't<br /><br />After a long spin class followed by 30 minutes of strength workouts I was feeling the muscle burn so I added this to my bath and soaked for 20 minutes. The smell is not my favorite but it is one I am used to from some of the other brands I use and it is consistent with the natural ingredients. It is hard to define but I would say it has an almost clinical smell.  It reminds me of a very clean hospital - not bad, just not my personal favorite scent. That said, they do use all natural ingredients so for that I am willing to pay more and I will say it was very relaxing, and helped with the muscle soreness.<br /><br />You do also get a rather large crystal in the bag -I like crystals but here is a watch out just in case you are not bothered one way or another - the crystal weighed 1oz so you are getting 8oz salts which is enough for one bath with 1/9 of the bag weight being taken up by the crystal.<br /><br />Now to be fair, the ingredient list does show all natural with no fillers that you might see in cheaper products such as coconut oil or unsourced scents and I really do feel crazy relaxed after this bath!

It applies like a face mask that is setting already and beads up as you apply which is weird. It also dries down very quickly.<br /><br />However please try and get past this as the results are amazing! My skin felt baby soft after using and very smooth but not dry or taut which it can often do after using face washes or masks.

The lamp took a whirl to dry and does not feel very sturdy. The same can be said of many of the tools or accessories that feel a bit chintzy and not that durable.<br /><br />The colors were okay, many not ones I would pick out but the shimmers / glitters were pretty and they do apply well.<br /><br />This kit is a lot cheaper than similar kits bjt ty do get what you pay for .\nReview Title: Okay kit, not very durable and lamp not the best\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: 3.3 Inch Hair Clips for Women Girls Thick Hair, Super Strong Hold Double Claw Hair Clips for Thin Hair, Nonslip Hair Claw Clips French Plastic Hair Jaw Clips Octopus Clip for All Hair Types, 3 Packs\nReview Date: 2021/08/29\nStore: Mevnccola\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Mevnccola', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Age Range (Description)': 'All Ages', 'Material': 'Plastic, Metal', 'Unit Count': '3.00 Count', 'Product Dimensions': '3.4 x 1 x 2.1 inches; 3.53 Ounces', 'UPC': '733557234610'}\nReview Text: I use these types of hair clips a lot and these are a good size - not too big and not too small, and will work for long and think hair.<br /><br />They don\u2019t have the best grip however which is always the litmus test for me. They have to stay and this is not the tightest hold and would not hold up to a workout.<br /><br />They are also quite thin and brittle feeling! Don\u2019t see them holding up for a long time. Would pay more for better quality\nReview Title: Not the best grip and feels a little thin and cheap\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: ENOUGH PROJECT Peeling Pack for Face \u2013 Gentle Exfoliating for Face \u2013 with Physical & Chemical Exfoliator \u2013 Alpha Hydroxy Acid and AHA From Trees Plants \u2013 with COSMOS-Certified Ingredients 3.38 FL OZ by Amorepacific\nReview Date: 2021/09/22\nStore: ENOUGH PROJECT\nAverage Rating: 4.2\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'ENOUGH PROJECT', 'Skin Type': 'Dry,All Skin Types', 'Product Benefits': 'Exfoliating', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Item Volume': '100 Milliliters', 'Package Dimensions': '6.5 x 2.01 x 1.69 inches; 4.8 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I generally steer clear of brands I have never heard of but this is produced by the the Parent Amorepacific brand that produces items of the same name, Laniege etc.<br /><br />This particular line is designed to be no fuss, no frills, no unnecessary animal testing and a fair, budget price. One note is that it comes with bare bones packaging and no directions or product information.<br /><br />It has a nice clean scent and quite frankly a very odd texture! It applies like a face mask that is setting already and beads up as you apply which is weird. It also dries down very quickly.<br /><br />However please try and get past this as the results are amazing! My skin felt baby soft after using and very smooth but not dry or taut which it can often do after using face washes or masks. It is also very gentle and not at all irritating !!<br /><br />I love Amorepacific and with this, you are getting quality results without the price tag! Will buy this again!!\nReview Title: Weird texture but leaves skin soft and not dry!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n    Structure your response as:\n   \n    SUMMARY:\n    [Final synthesis of preferences and patterns]",
