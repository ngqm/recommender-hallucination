The packaging was pretty nice, a flip open style case that looked promising. Upon opening the nails, I noticed that the colors were mostly on point when compared to the picture, save for the grey nails that looked a little more lavender in real life. I was happy with the design and colors. The nails weren't too big/small, and had a good assortment of sizes. Now, these nails are THIN. They bend super easily and they really don't hold up well to being removed and re-applied. The nails fell off less than 10 minutes after I affixed the stickers to my natural nails. They don't hold at all. I found they looked rather cheap, flimsy and obviously fake when they were on. The grey color was the worst, the chameleon color and diamond style better. The blue diamond shaped nails were a little thicker, too. They looked the best, I think. I would not recommend this for anyone more than a playset or an emergency kit. I do appreciate the lack of glue, but I couldn't get over the fact that the nails fall off and bend SO easily and that they looked a lot cheaper than other press-ons I've bought for the same price or lower.\nReview Title: Expected Better\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: 12 Sheets 3D Iridescent Butterfly Nail Art Stickers for Fingernail Toenail, Self-Adhesive Butterfly Nail Decals, Holographic Glittery Butterfly Nail Decorations for Women Girls\nReview Date: 2021/02/20\nStore: RUUKON\nAverage Rating: 3.9\nProduct Details: {'Surface Recommendation nail': '', '': 'Shape Irregular', 'Installation Type Self-Adhesive': '', 'Brand': 'RUUKON', 'Room Type': 'Anywhere', 'Theme': 'Butterflies,Butterfly', 'Number of Pieces': '12', 'Style': 'Floral', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Reusability': 'Single Use', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Pattern': 'Insect', 'Unit Count': '12.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '5.19 x 3.22 x 0.27 inches; 0.81 Ounces', 'UPC': '704129514447'}\nReview Text: I was so happy when these arrived.

These don't stick, like at all. There is a small amount of stickiness that lasts for mere seconds before these things fall off their surface (I've tried plastic, acrylic, skin, hardwood, and even carpeting to see). Honestly I was pretty surprised that these didn't stick to my carpet fibers. You can see in my photo that  I used these for nail art, and the lifting is visible. I held the stickers down when I noticed them lifting from the nail, but after a 30 seconds of holding the sticker down (onto a top coat, too) the gorgeous little butterflies lifted anyway.<br /><br />I want to give this product more stars so badly. The three stars I have given are for the aesthetics alone, while the other two stars are missing because the product does not really work the way it is intended to. I would recommend buying these as long as you are aware that you're going to need another product to make these stick to whatever surface you are using, and that lifting of the sticker away from the surface can happen.\nReview Title: Gorgeous, But Don't Stick Well\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Dip Powder Nail Starter Kit 8 Colors Acrylic Dipping Powder System for French Nail Manicure Nail Art Set, Portable Kit for Trave, No LED Nail Lamp Needed\u2026\nReview Date: 2021/02/20\nStore: Colorfairy\nAverage Rating: 3.2\nProduct Details: {'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'Colorfairy', 'Included Components': 'Dip Powder, Nail Lamp', 'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Package Dimensions': '5.98 x 4.17 x 2.72 inches; 9.77 Ounces'}\nReview Text: This set surprised me, because I wasn't expecting these powders to be anything more than the average. I love that this is portable and take up little space. The colors are a good mix, although I'd be happier with one of the pinks substituted for something more exciting. Overall great color choices.<br /><br />The brush is excellent, no fibers fell off and the brush was soft and cleaned the nail powder from the nails without marring the nail surface. The little side set of a cuticle pusher and nail files was nice, I really enjoyed the addition of a cuticle trimmer.<br /><br />The powders are absolutely amazing. These are the first powders I've ever used that came out perfect, nail after nail. It was extremely easy, and the powder so smoothly covered the nail that I didn't even need to buff them before top coat. They were just smooth, I've never had that happen with dip powders before. The color is also nice and vibrant, you don't need more than 3 dips (I wanted a nice, solid pink) to achieve your look. The addition of the brush saver (step 4) was a lifesaver, I feel it's a must have for doing dip nails.<br /><br />I didn't like the top coat at all. It didn't spread well, felt stiff, didn't give a good shine... it didn't make sense as the rest of the kit was pretty great. I'd use another top coat next time. Also, the pots of powder are kind of small to dip your nails in, but I made it work. I'd definitely purchase the powders again, I would love to see a powder and brush saver set! I can give or take the activator and base coat, but don't recommend the top coat. Great starter dip set.\nReview Title: Excellent, Easy to Use Powders\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: 2Pcs Summer Crystal Sequins Unicorn Girl Alligator Hair Clips (Holo+Pome Purple)\nReview Date: 2021/11/10\nStore: Summer Crystal\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Summer Crystal', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material': 'Polyester, Cotton', 'Unit Count': '2.00 Count', 'Number of Pieces': '2', 'Product Dimensions': '3.25 x 2.75 x 0.75 inches; 0.63 Ounces', 'UPC': '635638430488'}\nReview Text: These hair clips were so cute! My little sisters absolutely adored these ponies, both colors (there were two hair clips included) looked lovely. They're sequin covered, and I was very pleasantly surprised that none of the sequins fell off during use. One hair clip was a sort of rose gold, or rather a gold to pink look. The other was rainbow colored, very cute. They were a tiny bit large for my sisters, ages 7 and 10. However, they didn't slide down or fall off at all, and they were nice and light to wear. I loved the design and would definitely buy other designs if they were available. The only reason I didn't give these clips a five star rating is because they are a little too big for the age group they're meant for. You sort of have to finagle the hair style around the pony hair clips. Otherwise, I'm very happy with these and my sisters were great fans :)\nReview Title: Really Liked These\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:  \nThe purchase history reveals a user who exhibits a keen interest in colorful and visually appealing nail products and accessories, indicating a strong preference for aesthetics. However, their engagement is tempered by repeated disappointments regarding product quality, particularly in the adhesion and durability of nails and stickers. Consistently low ratings for products that failed to meet expectations highlight a critical perspective on quality over aesthetics.\n\nCommon themes articulate a preference for versatile and portable solutions, such as dip powder kits that are well-accepted due to their ease of use and reliable results despite some dissatisfaction with the included products. Price sensitivity is evident; the user appears reluctant to invest deeply in higher-end options, which suggests a desire for budget-friendly choices that still deliver satisfactory results.\n\nThe user enjoys products that allow for creativity, as seen in their positive reception of nail art items and hair accessories, favoring those that feature vibrant designs. Ultimately, this individual values a blend of creativity, aesthetic appeal, and adequate functionality, evidenced by their willingness to explore various product types while holding them to a high standard of quality.",
