  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe individual's purchase history reveals a strong preference for affordable beauty products that deliver high-quality results, often equating them with high-end alternatives. Consistently high ratings are given to items that prove surprisingly effective despite their lower price point, signaling a bias toward budget-friendly options that challenge typical quality expectations. Products related to eye makeup, such as eyeshadows and gel polishes, dominate the purchases, showcasing a clear interest in eye cosmetics for diverse purposes, including bold and everyday looks.\n\nQuality appears paramount, as evidenced by the significant disappointment expressed toward a specific product that caused irritation, while most other products received high satisfaction ratings. Price sensitivity is evident through the choice of affordable brands that still achieve impressive results, emphasizing their propensity to seek value without compromising on performance. Recurring remarks about product effectiveness and usability suggest the individual prioritizes ease of use and reliable functionality.\n\nIn conclusion, this shopper's core preferences center on high-value, budget-friendly beauty items, particularly for eye makeup, with a strong emphasis on product quality and performance over brand prestige. They demonstrate a willingness to experiment with various products, valuing positive outcomes and practicality in their beauty regimen.",
