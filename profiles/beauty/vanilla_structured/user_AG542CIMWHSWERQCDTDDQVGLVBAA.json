Until the filter was covered in dust. I emptied it out. Took a blow dryer to it and the dust is collected in the filter, but it\u2019s also blowing all over the place as well. I used stronger pressure from an air compressors to blow the dust out and it came out, however, it\u2019s not sucking the air like it did when I first got it.<br />Solution? Buy more filters even if it hasn\u2019t  been 2-3 months I thought it may be good to rotate out 3 different filters daily and use the air compressor on the filters once a week. It\u2019s still not sucking the air well. I\u2019d avoid this at all cost. $69.99 on the dust collector,  $19.99 on the replacement filters. My clothes are covered in dust. Do not purchase!
