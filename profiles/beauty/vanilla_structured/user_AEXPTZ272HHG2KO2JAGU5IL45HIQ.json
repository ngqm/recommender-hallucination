    "text": "The Bold Man Shampoo in the Califonia Love scent overall enjoyable, though I felt it was a little over stripping to my scalp. Typically I look for a happy medium of thoroughly cleaning my scalp without it being too harsh. While I was using this shampoo, I used a moisturizing conditioner to balance out the stripping nature. The scent has notes of coconut and other tropical ingredients, though it wasn't too overpowering. With a price of $17.99 when I am reviewing this shampoo, I find it to be a little too pricey for 250 ml. I expected more from the shampoo at this price point, but it still isn't terrible.
