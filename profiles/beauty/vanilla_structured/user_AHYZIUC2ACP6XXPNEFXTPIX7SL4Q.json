Notable themes include a tendency to seek effective solutions, though the consumer is sensitive to overpowering scents, which impacts their overall satisfaction.\n\nQuality appears to be prioritized over price, but there is an evident sensitivity to strong fragrances, hinting at the need for products that are effective yet gentle. A consistent pattern of seeking reusable or multi-functional items demonstrates an inclination toward practical, versatile solutions. Overall, this consumer values aesthetics and functionality while maintaining a critical eye on product quality and sensory characteristics.",

    "text": "These are amazing! They look real, too. There is a bit of a learning curve but what is nice is that the \"eyebrow\" pattern is also printed on the backside of the paper. This makes it much easier line it into place correctly. I had to remove one because I put it on in a wrong angle. They look real and once the water dries, is not too shiny.<br /><br />One thing to note, is that if you have hairs this will probably not work as the hairs seem to not let the eyebrow stick properly. If you have almost no brows, then this will be amazing.<br /><br />These tattoos are like the kids tattoos that you wet and stick. My 2nd try went much better.<br />1. cut the eyebrows as close to the shape as you can to avoid a raised outline<br />2. remove the plastic protection from the tattoo<br />3. place it exactly where you would like to lay it down - tattoo side towards clean, dry skin<br />4. place a saturated a washcloth against the paper back of the tattoo and hold it there for about 30 seconds, making sure to keep the tattoo pressed to your skin<br />5. once the tattoo paper backing is completely saturated, remove the tattoo starting from the widest side to the narrowest (start from the nose side first)<br />6. if the tattoo doesn't look like it's sticking, place back down and hold the washcloth on it again, pressing down on the paper with your fingers<br />7. remove",
