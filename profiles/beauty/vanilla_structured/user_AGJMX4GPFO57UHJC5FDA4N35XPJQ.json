  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe individual exhibits a clear preference for quality and functionality in their purchases, often favoring products that cater to self-care and personal enhancement, such as cosplay accessories, nail care kits, and cosmetics. Consistent ratings above 3.5 indicate satisfaction with the products, with an inclination towards quality materials and ease of use.\n\nA notable trend is their appreciation for beginner-friendly items, suggesting a focus on practicality and accessibility. The descriptions reveal a preference for moderate price points, as they value good quality relative to cost. However, feedback also shows a slight dissatisfaction with product specifics, such as tool instructions in grooming kits, indicating a desire for comprehensive user support.\n\nThe recurring theme across purchases is a balance between aesthetics (like in cosmetics with appealing colors) and performance (such as effectively functional nail tools). Overall, the individual favors products that enhance personal grooming and appearance while ensuring convenient use, demonstrating a blend of personal expression and practical utility in their buying habits.",
