(With these, fried chicken at a picnic wouldn't be too messy.) Yesterday, after a couple hours of gardening in the hot sun, I used one sturdy wipe (they're about 8\"X5\") on my face, neck, chest, arms, and hands, as a very refreshing clean-up.<br /><br />These are nothing but essential oil and water, no chemicals, so your skin won't be dried out or irritated.  I absolutely adore them and will keep some in my handbag and car from now on.\nReview Title: A Lemony Treat\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Hynt Beauty Perfetto Pressed Eye Shadow Singles (Khaki Star)\nReview Date: 2021/10/14\nStore: Hynt Beauty\nAverage Rating: 4.2\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Hynt Beauty', 'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '3.23 x 2.6 x 0.63 inches; 0.32 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I don't wear much eye makeup, but the olive-colored Khaki Star really appealed to me.  My eyes appear blue or green depending on what I'm wearing, and this shadow makes the green in my eyes much deeper and more apparent.<br /><br />I've tried applying it lightly with a finger and it makes a nice translucent color that way that enhances without taking over. With a brush, I put it along my lashes like eyeliner and it came out very nice. If I apply it twice, it's appropriate for nighttime wear.<br /><br />I wear contacts so it's important to me that eye shadow stays where I put it and doesn't flake into my eyes. This shadow passes that test perfectly, so I'll be getting a pale highlighting shade to go with this one. I'm very happy with this product.\nReview Title: Pleasing Color\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Acuaiss Cleansing Eyelid Wipes, Hygienic & Hydrating Eyelid Wipes with Hyaluronic Acid and Aloe Vera. 20 Pre-Moistened Eye Tissues\nReview Date: 2021/11/06\nStore: Acuaiss\nProduct Description: ['Acuaiss moisturizing Eyelid Wipes for ocular hygiene with hyaluronic acid, aloe vera and other natural extracts.

The most important aspect of treatment is a good hygiene. Acuaiss Cleansing wipes are ideal for people suffering from excessive eye discharge or grease in the eye area.']\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Acuaiss', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Unit Count': '20.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '3 x 2.9 x 2.6 inches; 1.6 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'AcuaissToallitas'}\nReview Text: I have very dry eyes and, in addition, use three prescription eye drops at bedtime and first thing in the morning. Since I wear contacts, I put the drops in the morning then doze in bed for another fifteen or twenty minutes before it's time to insert my lenses. During this time, my eyes tear up a little from the medication. The tears, combined with drips of medicine, create crusts around my eyes that are irritating if I'm not careful about wiping them away. They often sting and I don't have time for that -- cats are calling for breakfast and I need my contact lenses on to see to feed them.<br /><br />These wipes are terrific for cleaning away excess eye drops on my skin and lashes. They're thorough and don't sting and the wipes are big so I can use one side to do most of the cleaning turn it over to make sure my lashes are completely clear.  There is no pain despite my dry eyes.<br /><br />I wish I'd found these sooner, and I'm glad to have them. They make my morning routine less stingy and crusty!\nReview Title: Great for Sensitive Eyes\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Sasy n Savy, Citrus Souffl\u00e8 Hydrating and Nourishing Body Cr\u00e8me, Plant-Based Natural Ingredients For Daily Moisture, 6.08 fl oz(180mL)\nReview Date: 2022/05/09\nStore: Sasy n Savy\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Sasy n Savy', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '6.1 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Use for': 'Whole Body', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2.76 x 1.77 x 6.69 inches; 10.41 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I'm fragrance-sensitive and any man-made scent will instantly curl my nose and tweak my sinuses and put me in a foul mood as I scrub my skin with dish soap to get rid of the odor.  Sasy n Savy's Citrus Souffle Body Cream makes my nose and sinuses very, very happy. It's naturally and deliciously scented and my skin just eats it up.<br /><br />This cream is light and soaks in very quickly. It moisturizes very well and gets rid of itchiness caused by dry skin.  Made with all-natural ingredients including those delicious essential citrus oils, hibiscus, and oils of macadamia and avocado, there's nothing bad in the ingredient list, and it's cruelty-free. It quenches my skin and the pleasant scent lingers faintly for quite a while. I keep a tube on my desk and use it several times a day. Its scent is uplifting and its moisturizing properties are fabulous.\nReview Title: Mmmm -- It's Fabulous!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n    Structure your response as:\n   \n    SUMMARY:\n    [Final synthesis of preferences and patterns]",

    "text": "This moisturizer is described as a gel cream and contains aloe vera and hyaluronic acid. The latter is something I always want in face creams because it does a great job on my aging skin. The aloe vera is a nice touch, as well.<br /><br />I'm usually the one complaining about fragrances, but this time, I'm happy. The  gel-cream has a light (quickly dissipating) scent that's herby, almost minty. Unlike many fragrances, it doesn't bother my sinuses, plus I enjoy the odor.<br /><br />This product goes on clear and soaks in fast. I mainly use it on a dry spot on my face that flakes if I skip hyaluronic for more than a day or two. There's no sign of the flaky spot, so I'm very happy with this reasonably-priced cream.",
