According to the enclosed instructions, you always wear them so that the heart part of the backs are on top when you slide them onto the post of your earrings.  This insures that the weight of the earring pulls the heart against your ear which, in turn, counterbalances the earring and holds it securely against your ear.  They're really lightweight, but they work well.  I tried them on my heaviest earrings to see just how securely these backs hold and they do not disappoint.  Even using them with lighter earrings you can tell they are held much more tightly and upright against your ear.

I hoped these combs would be a good interim solution and I absolutely loved the color and flash of the rhinestones.<br /><br />With care, and holding onto the bottom part of my hair tightly while we place the combs, we can get them to hold my hair for a few hours (see photo) but then it starts to fall out unless we put the comb toward the top of my head.  Then they stay in for twice as long.  Still, I never make it through a full day with them, but while they last they look really pretty!\nReview Title: They hold my hair for a few hours\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: BRAVE Scottish Beard Oil - A Premium Beard Oil Recipe that Smoothes, Nourishes and Thickens Beard with a Light Fresh Long Lasting Kiss-Worthy Scent.100% Natural Oils, Vegan &Cruelty Free - Made in UK!\nReview Date: 2018/07/29\nStore: Skin Radiance\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Liquid Volume': '60 Milliliters', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Brand': 'Skin Radiance', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Unit Count': '2.00 Fl Oz', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.88 x 1.65 x 1.65 inches; 3.53 Ounces', 'UPC': '634304105002'}\nReview Text: This oil has a very soft, pleasant smell.

I use it for many things, although I have a few favorites.  I rub it into my damp hands a couple of times a day which leaves them softer and, unlike usual, my cuticles are not cracked or split (see photo 1).  I spray four or five pumps into my hand, rub them together and run them through my towel-dried hair.  Then I leave it to air dry and it ends up curly and soft (see photo 2) and lasts a couple of days until I wash it again.  I absolutely love the versatility.\nReview Title: I absolutely love the versatility\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Lash Ease One Step Fiber Building Mascara- Black, Buildable Volume, Lengthens Natural Eyelashes, Lightweight, All Day Wear, 0.38oz\nReview Date: 2019/07/24\nStore: Allstar Innovations\nAverage Rating: 3.7\nProduct Details: {'Special Feature': 'Lightweight', 'Brand': 'Allstar Innovations', 'Package Information': 'Tube', 'Coverage': 'Buildable', 'Package Type': 'Box', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '5.3 x 0.71 x 0.71 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'UPC': '740275051078'}\nReview Text: It's easy to put this mascara on without it clumping or making a mess.  When I first started using it, I put on two coats which definitely defined and darkened my lashes.  I could also see where it sometimes added fibers, but they were not consistent and only attached to a few of my lashes.  I was not particularly impressed.  However, after reading the \"Customer Questions and Answers,\" I saw one that said I needed to \"swirl the wand in the mascara before removing it from the bottle\" and \"use a zig-zag technique by moving the wand back and forth as you drag the wand upward.\"  When I followed this advice, it looked WAY, WAY different than my natural lashes (see photo 1) or my lashes using two coats of another quality name-brand mascara (see photo 2).  In fact, I got a DRAMATICALLY different look to my eyelashes, which definitely look longer and fuller (see photo 3).  It loads a lot of mascara on the brush using this method (see photo 4).<br /><br />I'm also happy that on those occasional nights when I'm too tired to worry about taking the mascara off before I go to bed, I get up with it still looking good and no fibers in my eyes.  I love that it wears well and washes off easily without leaving any dark smudges under my eyes.<br /><br />Overall, I think using this mascara takes some practice but the end results are worth it if you do it right!\nReview Title: At first I wasn't impressed.
