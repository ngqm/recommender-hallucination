    "text": "+Affordable<br />+2 full ounces of L Ascorbic acid<br />+No breakouts, clogged pores, redness, or synthetic fragrance<br />+Effective on discolorations / pigment issues<br />+Fights free radical formation<br />+Satisfaction guarantee<br />Cons:<br />-Dropper bottle<br />First Botany's  C serum offers alot for your money.  L Ascorbic acid is of the few products that's improved some ugly discolorations around my mouth and this bottle contains twice as much as other brands.  It doesn\u2019t have an abrasive and sour feel, and considering how well it works, the price is reasonable.  Nice to finally  find something I can afford to use daily that along with retinol, improves the dark spots around my mouth and keeps my crow's feet from getting worse.  L Ascorbic acid is the only vitamin c derivative that's been clinically proven to improve wrinkles, age spots and hyperpigmentation.  Wish they chose a pump top instead of a dropper<br />~Discount provided for evaluation and review",
