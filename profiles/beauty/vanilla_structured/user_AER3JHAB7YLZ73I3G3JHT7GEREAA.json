  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe individual exhibits a strong preference for skincare products focused on hydration and anti-aging. They consistently favor moisturizers and serums with natural and effective ingredients such as hyaluronic acid and Vitamin C, reflecting a desire for products that deliver deep moisture and rejuvenation. Most interactions reveal positive sentiments, with high ratings for products that feel good on the skin, emphasizing a preference for textures that are non-greasy and pleasant to use, often without fragrance. \n\nWhile there is an overall affection for premium brands, there is some price sensitivity evident in the lower ratings for products that fail to meet expectations, indicating a critical eye toward value in quality. The feedback demonstrates frustration with ineffective packaging or difficult application methods, particularly in the case of tools associated with skincare. \n\nOverall, core preferences center around effective, hydrating skincare, excellent user experience, and favorable perceptions of product formulations, alongside a cautious approach to functionality versus price.",
