This device has a Rose Quartz tip, heat, massage, red light(collagen production) and blue light(calms inflammation) therapy. It uses USB charging. The eye massager comes with a protective tip cap/cover and looks like a cute lipstick.<br />I like to use first the red light, heat, massage with my eye serum and then I use blue light, heat massage, with my eyecream. I am using this device only on my eyes(I have full face device with a larger head). It feels very soothing on my eyes and helps with puffiness too. Since it is small and has a cap, it is easy to just toss it in a purse on the go. This device would make a great gift!",
