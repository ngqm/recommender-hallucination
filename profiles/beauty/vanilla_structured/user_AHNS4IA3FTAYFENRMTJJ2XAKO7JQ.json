One thing I found extra impressive were the trimmers.  Usually, you need to soak your nails prior to trimming.  If not, they have a tendency to fly off into space, risking eye damage to anyone nearby.  These are so sharp, they just melt through my nail like butter.  I was a little surprised because I've never seen that happen before.  I suspect that'll change as I use them more and more, but it was still impressive to run across that.

    "text": "These COSYOO fashion boho headbands are perfect for everyday use. It came with 12 of them in all different designs and colors. I have shorter hair so the only way I can do something different with it is to use headbands. It also helps keep my hair out of my face when I'm working around the house. It's at the stage where it's getting to long and it hangs in my face. Our button headband is made of soft fabric (like chiffon, spandex and so on), which is breathable, absorb sweat, soft and comfortable everything that you want in a headband. They can be washed in the washing machine. Great price for 12 of them. I might even share with my daughter.",
