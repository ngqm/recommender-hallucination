I did try to remove my eye makeup with this balm and it was too greasy/thick and also stung my eyes, whereas my micellar water won't do that.<br /><br />The scent is a nice clean rose scent and I like the packaging, but I don't think I'll continue to use this. Seems like more work than is necessary and kinda makes me feel like it will clog my pores in the long run...\nReview Title: Feels like it creates an extra step...\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: [moonshot] Cream Paint Lightfit Air 3g - Blackpink Lisa Makeup Kpop Kbeauty Cosmetics, Airy Velvet Texture Matte Lip Makeup, Long Lasting Natrual Daily Lip Color (501 Almond Rose)\nReview Date: 2020/03/10\nStore: Moonshot\nAverage Rating: 4.2\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Moonshot', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Finish Type': 'Cream', 'Product Benefits': 'Long Lasting,Brightening,Makeup'}\nReview Text: A pretty MLBB velvety lip color.  The formula isn't nearly as drying as typical matte liquid lips. More of a velvety mousse like texture.<br /><br />I have medium tan skin and I'd say this is a nude pink shade on me so it may be a bit light for deeper skin tones.<br /><br />I discovered you can also use this as a cheek color as well! I dab a bit on the back of my hand and apply it from there. It's pretty pigmented on the cheeks so starting with less is better.\nReview Title: Can also be used as cream blush!:)\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Hair Scrunchies for women,Including 3 Pcs Long Silk Satin Hair Scarf & 3 Pcs Bunny Ear Scrunchies & 3 Pcs Elastic Hair Bands Scrunchy and 7Pcs Pearl Hair Clips,(16Pcs/9Colors)\nReview Date: 2020/04/10\nStore: Suptikes\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Material': 'Pearl, Silk', 'Item Form': 'Scrunchie', 'Brand': 'Suptikes', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '5 x 5 x 0.7 inches', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Product Dimensions': '5 x 5 x 0.7 inches; 7.2 Ounces', 'UPC': '760635003608'}\nReview Text: These scrunchies look great in person, especially the plain scrunchies, theyre a beautiful silk like material that has some shine to it. The plain ones also have a heavy duty elastic in them. I have super thick long hair and these do a great job of keeping my hair in a bun.<br /><br />Ive definitely overpaid for scrunchies at urban outfitters when these are just as nice if not nicer for sooo much cheaper. They're great!:)<br /><br />The little barettes are just okay, I find they pull my hair but the scrunchies are totally worth it.\nReview Title: Super cute plus great deal!!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Bior\u00e9 J-Beauty Makeup Removing Moisturizing Cleansing Jelly, Top Japanese Makeup Remover, Gentle Skin Cleanser, Mild Floral Fragrance, Non-Greasy, 7.8 Ounce\nReview Date: 2020/04/28\nStore: Bior\u00e9\nProduct Description: ['Bior\u00e9 J-Beauty Makeup Removing Moisturizing Cleansing Jelly is a non-greasy makeup remover that removes dirt and impurities from deep below the surface of your skin.

I apply it straight on my face, rub it in a bit, then add a bit of water to my hands, lather, then rub again. Then rinse k<br /><br />I have combo skin with drier cheeks and this doesn't leave my skin feeling stripped or dry. Still feels moisturized.<br /><br />This product smells of roses pretty strongly but I actually love the way it smells so I don't mind at all.<br /><br />Wouldn't really recommend for eye makeup though, I did find it to sting a bit so I'm just gonna stick to micellar for my eye makeup.<br /><br />Hope this review helps!:)\nReview Title: Melts away makeup, smells great\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Queendom Unlashed Mascara | Volumizing and Lengthening | Boosts Lash Length | Vegan, Cruelty Free, Paraben Free\nReview Date: 2020/06/04\nStore: Queendom\nAverage Rating: 3.3\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '5.28 x 0.94 x 0.63 inches; 0.85 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I have pretty long and decently full eyelashes so this mascara worked well for me as a daily mascara.<br /><br />Cute packaging, nice slim shape with cute design.<br /><br />I didn't find it to be too volumizing, but it does a good job at defining and lengthening.<br /><br />Formula was not very wet from first opening so this may dry out faster than others if not used up.<br /><br />My main issue with this mascara is the hard plastic applicator. It has longer and shorter hard bristles along the sides. I'm by no means a beginner with mascara, but for some reason I've poked my eye with this mascara applicator a couple of times already. The bristles just seem really hard and sharp!<br /><br />This could just be me having a problem for whatever reason, but thought I'd mention.<br /><br />Hope this review is helpful!\nReview Title: Decent mascara but VERY hard pokey applicator!\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Cuckoo Eyelashes 100% handmade 3D Faux Mink Lashes 4 Pairs/set \u2026 (Cuckoo 309)\nReview Date: 2020/06/28\nStore: Cuckoo\nAverage Rating: 3.2\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Cuckoo', 'Material': 'Silk, Faux Mink', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '5.91 x 4.33 x 0.39 inches', 'Material Feature': 'Cruelty Free', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '5.91 x 4.33 x 0.39 inches; 1.87 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'Cuckoo 309', 'UPC': '733430907945'}\nReview Text: (307) These lases are a little more dense so they definitely give the look of wearing false lashes, in kind of a more dated kind of way. I feel like the more spread out and whispy lashes are a lot more trendy these days. Band is quite thick also. Besides the band, the lashes themselves are pretty good quality and don't have a plastic sheen to them which is great. Price and quality is comparable to drugstore.<br /><br />(309) Also have a thicker band but are much more Whispy and have that fluffy instagram lash to them. Very pretty! I like these a lot better than the 307's. I'd give these a 5 and a 307 a 3 so since they're the same brand, I will average the review to a 4.<br /><br />Hope this review is helpful!\nReview Title: Dense, thicker band\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Color Me Cosmetics Gel Manicure Kit with LED Lamp - DIY Gel Nail Starter Set with Prep, Base and Top Coat, 2 Gel Polish Colors & Nail Tools - Beginner Nail Kit with Everything You Need Made in USA*\nReview Date: 2020/07/30\nStore: Color Me Cosmetics\nAverage Rating: 3.9\nProduct Details: {'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'Color Me Cosmetics', 'Included Components': 'Top Coat, Nail File', 'Finish Type': 'Glossy', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Package Dimensions': '8.6 x 7.6 x 2.7 inches; 1.4 Pounds'}\nReview Text: The polishes in this set work wonderfully and the packaging is very nice and would make an excellent gift!

It's waaaay too light. Definitely meant for fair to light medium skin tones. This stuff is pretty pigmented so I wouldn't try it if you think it might be too light. It probably will be. Goes on pretty opaque and pigmented, it's almost a light/medium weight foundation. It does go in silky smooth and has a nice finish. I also like the pump and packaging. A bit of a scent to it, but it's not too bad.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:  \nThe analysis of purchase history reveals a strong inclination towards beauty and haircare products, emphasizing quality and functionality over brand prestige. The individual's ratings suggest a preference for well-performing items, as indicated by consistently higher scores (above 4.0) for products that meet aesthetic needs, such as makeup sponges and scrunchies. However, sentiments shift notably when products fail to meet expectations, particularly regarding their effectiveness or texture, as with certain hair extensions and cleansing balms, leading to lower ratings.\n\nCommon themes include versatile application, with items such as lip products used for dual purposes (lip and cheek). The customer appreciates soft, user-friendly products and demonstrates price sensitivity, favoring value without compromising quality, as exemplified by positive remarks on affordable yet high-quality scrunchies compared to premium alternatives.\n\nRecurring patterns highlight a notable aversion to products that feel greasy or overly complicated in use, suggesting a preference for cleanliness and efficiency in beauty routines. There\u2019s also a clear preference for items that work well across multiple skin tones and types, although some products fell short in shade diversity. Overall, the core preferences reflect a need for soft, effective, versatile, and reasonably priced beauty solutions that enhance rather than complicate daily routines.",
