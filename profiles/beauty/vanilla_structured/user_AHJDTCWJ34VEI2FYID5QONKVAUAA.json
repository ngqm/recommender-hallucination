It comes true to the pictures but it did not come in the nice box like the ones in the videos.  I myself didn't prefer the color on myself so I did airbrush it with my Luminous Air brush makeup to give it the darker red tones you see in my pictures. The curls were too much for me so I paddle brushed the heck out of the wig, then with my flatiron on about 300\u00b0 ran it through the hair to relax the curls even more. I love how it blends seamlessly with my natural hair line. I did cut just a few baby hairs to blend with my own. The wig is so light on my head, the hair is so soft but it tangled like crazy before I straightened the curls out.\nReview Title: Great wig, true to picture.
