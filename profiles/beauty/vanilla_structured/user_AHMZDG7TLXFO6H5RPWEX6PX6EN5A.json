It works really well on the beard area and preps the skin for a nice, super smooth shave. It doesn\u2019t seem to strip the face of natural oils, which is great. Overall, it just leaves a really soft, clean, oil-free (the bad oils) look and feel. I would definitely recommend this for a nice clean face, especially for men with bushy beards.\nReview Title: Great for a soft clean face & beard\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Magnetic Eyelashes by UJM\uff0c3 Pairs Reusable Magnetic Eyelash and Eyeliner Kit Natural Look False Lashes with Mirror and Tweezers No Glue Needed Waterproof Magnetic Lashes Set\nReview Date: 2020/09/07\nStore: UJM\nAverage Rating: 3.7\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'UJM', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '4 x 4 x 0.3 inches', 'Material Feature': 'Gluten Free', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Mounting Type': 'Eyelash Glue', 'Product Dimensions': '4 x 4 x 0.3 inches; 3.53 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'UJM-004'}\nReview Text: Oh these are rough. They look extremely false when on, and are very clunky. The magnetic eyeliner makes it harder to apply and keep these on. Also, if you get the eyeliner in your eye, you better have an eyewash station nearby. These are almost like toy false lashes for kids to play dress up with if the eyeliner wasn\u2019t so toxic. The lashes (3 sets) come stacked in a compact that just feels breakable and not well made. The lashes themselves are very synthetic, and not natural looking at all. I like that the kit includes an eyelash tweezer applicator, but honestly that will be the only thing getting use from this kit. It\u2019s a great concept, just poorly executed. The liner goes on and you have to quickly get the lashes placed, or you\u2019ll lose adhesiveness by the second. Even when done in a timely manner, the magnetic components in the eyeliner don\u2019t work well with the magnetic strip on the lashes, so they won\u2019t stay on long. They are large and clunky and just look very unnatural, even when trimmed. The lashes themselves have a wire look and consistency to them, and look very similar to the lashes on a toy doll, only thicker and heavier looking. Would not recommend these, even for the low price.\nReview Title: Very synthetic look and feel\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: minihope Women's Elastic Hair Tiea, Black, 120 Count (Pack of 1), 4MM for Medium Hair.Value pack.\nReview Date: 2020/12/20\nStore: minihope\nAverage Rating: 4.6\nProduct Details: {'Material': 'Metal', 'Item Form': 'elastic', 'Brand': 'minihope', 'Hair Type': 'Medium, Thick', 'Number of Pieces': '120', 'Package Dimensions': '6.3 x 2.9 x 2.2 inches; 7.2 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'ET-SET-200703', 'UPC': '725683672763 661757097431'}\nReview Text: These are very good quality!

It\u2019s affordable, very lightweight, easy to use, and comes with some accessories and the settings on the lamp are convenient. It takes a bit longer than I was hoping to fully dry, but after about 10 minutes, you\u2019re good to go. I like this because it\u2019s small and light so I can pack it with me anywhere. It is easy to use, and a child could use it (with supervision so they don\u2019t look into the light) because you just slide your hand under the light and it will detect your hand and start the light/ drying process. I have noticed that the lag time seems to be getting longer on the motion detecting light, but it\u2019s not extremely bothersome. Sometimes it takes a few swipes, but it generally works. It\u2019s a great thing to have if you enjoy doing your nails at home, or even just a fun \u201cspa\u201d thing to do with your friends, or kids during winter and/ or quarantine.

Dr. Denese has a fantastic product line, and I love her magnetic face mask, amongst other things. I didn\u2019t get this product for the anti-aging properties, but more for the moisture and exfoliating base. I use it after I cleanse and tone my face, let it fully absorb for a few minutes, and then apply my serums and/or just moisturizer. When I use it at night I find that my skin feels plumper and moisturized when I wake up. The 2oz bottle can stretch out over a long period of time too, so the product is worth the money, it\u2019s just not quite in my everyday price range. I do like that I can cut out serums at night and still feel like I\u2019m treating my face. I don\u2019t have visible wrinkles yet so I haven\u2019t seen any anti-wrinkle effects, but my skin does feel fuller, if that makes sense.

My hair just feels softer and smoother when I use it, but I don\u2019t feel it in my hair at all, it quickly absorbs. I have long hair and this size is more of a travel size bottle for me, even using just a few pumps every few nights, I\u2019m down to the last bit of product. I will likely order it again because it\u2019s seamless for frizz, and I like how weightless it is.\nReview Title: Controls frizz w/o adding weight to hair\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Dr. Denese SkinScience Essential Lipid Anti Aging Power Infusion Dry Oil - Skin Nutrients 97% Organic 100% Natural - Rejuvinating Blend with Amaranth & Resveratrol - Paraben-Free, Cruelty-Free - 2oz\nReview Date: 2020/12/21\nStore: Dr. Denese\nAverage Rating: 4.2\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Dr. Denese', 'Item Form': 'Dr. Denese', 'Unit Count': '2.00 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Type': 'Adult', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.57 x 3.15 x 3.07 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'Item model number': '800166A', 'UPC': '811684022284', 'Manufacturer': 'Dr. Denese'}\nReview Text: This product is quite expensive but it packs a lot of great ingredients. Dr. Denese has a fantastic product line, and I love her magnetic face mask, amongst other things. I didn\u2019t get this product for the anti-aging properties, but more for the moisture and exfoliating base. I use it after I cleanse and tone my face, let it fully absorb for a few minutes, and then apply my serums and/or just moisturizer. When I use it at night I find that my skin feels plumper and moisturized when I wake up. The 2oz bottle can stretch out over a long period of time too, so the product is worth the money, it\u2019s just not quite in my everyday price range. I do like that I can cut out serums at night and still feel like I\u2019m treating my face. I don\u2019t have visible wrinkles yet so I haven\u2019t seen any anti-wrinkle effects, but my skin does feel fuller, if that makes sense. My skin feels tighter in a good way, and my skin looks and feels softer and just overall more even looking.\nReview Title: Moisturizing and \u201cplumping\u201d of skin\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n    Structure your response as:\n   \n    SUMMARY:\n    [Final synthesis of preferences and patterns]",
  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThis individual displays a preference for personal care products with natural ingredients and effective performance, particularly in skincare and grooming. They consistently rate products highly when they meet their standards for quality and functionality, as evidenced by their positive sentiments towards exfoliating facial cleansers, hair ties, and moisturizing serums. \n\nCommon themes in their purchases show an inclination towards products that enhance grooming routines, especially for facial care and hair management. The person values effectiveness in products like scrubs and moisturizing agents, highlighting their expectations for clean, soft skin and manageable hair without added weight or greasiness.\n\nQuality is a primary concern; they appreciate durable products (e.g., hair ties that don\u2019t easily break) and are put off by synthetic materials, as seen with the negative review of magnetic eyelashes. Despite a low price sensitivity for some items, they are cautious with higher-priced options, indicating a willingness to invest in quality but within their comfort range. \n\nOverall, this individual favors high-performance, user-friendly beauty solutions that boost confidence and offer good value, displaying a discerning approach to skincare with a critical eye for quality and result-oriented products.",
