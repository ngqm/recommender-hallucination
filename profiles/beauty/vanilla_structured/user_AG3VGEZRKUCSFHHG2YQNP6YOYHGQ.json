The styles vary from casual day to day wear to dramatic showstoppers. The lashes are synthetic fibers with a medium band that is sturdy and with proper care can be used easily 20 or more times. They are soft and comfortable to wear with a secure hold for all day wear. With the liner functioning as a glue, you eliminate the need for an extra step and instead of putting glue on the lash band, you put it on as you would a normal liner making application incredibly easy, even for a beginner. I love these lashes!!!\nReview Title: Perfect lashes for a beginner or pro!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: YinMer Lavish Lash \u2013 Eyelash Growth Enhancer & Brow Serum with Biotin & Natural Growth Peptides for Long, Thick Lashes and Eyebrows\nReview Date: 2020/12/15\nStore: OUZIFISH\nAverage Rating: 3.7\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '6.61 x 2.8 x 1.26 inches; 3.53 Ounces'}\nReview Text: This eyebrow serum came beautifully packaged beyond anything I expected. The packaging and presentation gave the immediate feel of an expensive and regal product. The actual tube and brush of the serum also are impeccable with regard to presentation. The serum itself is very basic and lacking a little in desired thickness. Using a simple thin brush like the one that is provided makes for a bit of a challenge in applying such a watery textured liquid to your brow. A spoolie type brush would have made application on your brows much easier. Having said that, the brush that is provided is perfect for application of the serum to your eyelashes which, like brows, respond to the same formulas to encourage retention of existing lashes and brows and promote growth of new ones. I have been using this product nightly for nearly two months now and definitely see a bit of noticeable growth in my lashes and some growth, though not as noticeable, in my brows. Part of that could be due to the slow rate of growth of eyebrows and part could be due to the uneven application on my eyebrows with the small liner like application brush. I will continue to use the product until it is finished but will definitely be looking for a serum with a spoolie style applicator for my next brow growth serum.\nReview Title: Better for a lash serum than brows ... but it\u2019s workable\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: L'ANGE HAIR Rubber Sectioning Hair Clips | Narrow-Tipped Design | For Parting & Sectioning Hair | Easy Grip Handles | Professional Styling Results | 6-Pack (Blush)\nReview Date: 2022/07/17\nStore: L'ANGE HAIR\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Brand': \"L'ANGE HAIR\", 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Color': 'Blush', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Embellishment': 'Bow', 'Package Dimensions': '8.46 x 5.71 x 1.14 inches; 2.89 Ounces', 'Item model number': '2323', 'UPC': '810108190585', 'Manufacturer': \"L'ANGE HAIR\"}\nReview Text: Styling your hair when it comes to curling or straightening it can sometimes be difficult as the thicker your hair is, the less effective a hot tool can be. That being said, it\u2019s important that you suction off your hair in order to get the most effective results from using your hot tools. This also comes into play when you are trimming or cutting hair, as you cannot cut the entire thickness of a section with one pass. It is important that you suction off your hair into thinner bundles so that a hot tool or your hair shears are most effective in trimming or curling or straightening your hair. These suctioning clips are incredibly effective for two reasons. First, the bottom portion of the clip has a somewhat pointed, though rounded, edge to help divide the hair into sections. Second, the top portion of the lab has a padded layer that helps to grab onto and hold the suction of hair in place. With the Number of clips in this package, you have more than enough to work with in order to section of all areas of your hair for curling, straightening, or trimming.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:  \nThe individual demonstrates a strong preference for beauty and grooming products, particularly focused on effective application methods and ease of use. The recurring high ratings (often 5.0) for eyelash products indicate a particular favor for items that simplify application, like self-adhesive eyeliners, which blend practicality with aesthetic appeal. \n\nQuality is a significant consideration, with attention to product presentation and packaging, as seen in the eyebrow serum review, which notes an impressive initial appearance but critiques functional shortcomings. \n\nAcross purchases, there's a clear inclination towards tools that enhance hair styling efficiency, shown by high ratings for hair sectioning clips and detangling combs that prevent hair loss and make styling easier. The individual prioritizes function, effectiveness, and product performance, indicating moderate price sensitivity as long as perceived value (efficiency, ease of use) aligns with cost.\n\nFinally, while they appreciate hydrating skincare products, such as a multivitamin sleep mask, the effectiveness of skincare products seems to be secondary compared to tangible results in makeup and hair styling. Overall, the core preferences suggest a consumer who values practical beauty solutions aimed at enhancing personal grooming while remaining stylish and efficient.",

    "text": "[[VIDEOID:cf747606acf9b5900867c48bd6720d4]] This under eye massager comes in a conveniently small package that can be easily stored. It comes with three massage settings. The first is the red light which warms the massage stone and provides a pulsating massage. The second is the blue light which cools the massage stone and provides a pulsating massage. The Third leaves the stone at room temperature with no light indicator, and provides a constant massage vibration. Hall of the massage settings feel nice on your under eye area, but I didn\u2019t find that they helped in absorption of my under eye creams, nor did they help with  any under eye discoloration or puffiness. So though the massage tool felt nice on my under eye area, I didn\u2019t find any effectiveness that would necessitate use of this on a regular basis.",
