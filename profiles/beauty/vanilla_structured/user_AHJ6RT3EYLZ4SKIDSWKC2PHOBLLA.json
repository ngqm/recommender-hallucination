This may be worth, if you don't mind spending long time removing your polish and are very concerned using only natural products, other than that, its not at all. I am very disappointed, its the worth nail polish remover I ever came across, nothing beats it. Unfortunately I already opened it, so I am not going to return it nor gift it, it will probably just go straight into the trash, I don't think I will want to use it any time.<br /><br />I received a sample in exchange of my honest opinion.\nReview Title: The slowest nail polish remover I ever saw.\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Webat Bath Bombs Gift Set, Spa Bomb Fizzies & Ultra Lush Essential Oil - Dry Skin Moisturize, Fit for Bubble & Spa Bath, Handmade Birthday Gift Ideal for Lady, Women, Girlfriend, Men\nReview Date: 2016/07/04\nStore: Webat\nProduct Description: [\"Product Specification: 1.

They smell amazing. Each ball is 2 1/4'' in diameter, they are pretty big, they weight 4.1 oz each. There are six scents: Yoga Strength, Garden of Heaven, Revive, Energy Grapefruit, Stress Relief and Vanilla Indulgence. Each is separately wrapped in a tissue. They all lay on a bed of cut paper, looks really nice. Box is also quality and additionally factory foiled at arrival. This is very suitable for gifting. Definitely a five stars product. Their smell is addictive.<br /><br />Yoga Strength - Lemon, Lime, Orange and Bergamot Oils;<br />Garden of Heaven - Lavender, Geranium and Lima OIls;<br />Revive - Peppermint, Lemon, Rosemary and Eucalyptus Essential Oils;<br />Energy Grapefruit - Grapefruit Essential Oil;<br />Stress Relief - Lavender, Marjoram and Ylang Oils;<br />Vanilla Indulgence - Vanilla Essential Oil.<br /><br />Yoga Strength is the best.<br /><br />Sample received for a fair evaluation.\nReview Title: Im highly impressed with these great scents.\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n    Structure your response as:\n   \n    SUMMARY:\n    [Final synthesis of preferences and patterns]",

    "text": "This bag is almost exactly what I wanted. I had an almost same Caboodles makeup bag purchased from Walmart about 8 years ago and just wanted same, new one. This one is bigger than the ones Walmart sells. I wish it was the same size as my old one as the new one appears bigger, mostly on the outside, but it sort of fits the same amount of cosmetics. Regardless, this is a beautiful bag, mine came with a separator and exactly as described. I will be purchasing Caboodles` bags again. I think the quality is very good. The top of my bag is larger than it should be and makes the bag to unnecessary look big but it still zippers around just as well. I`m happy with my purchase.",
