Great accessories, I have my other baby be the model for these bow headbands today.  Don't they look cute?  You can put one, or even two!  These headbands can also be used as hair ties too, feels to me they are made with the same elastic bands.  I've been stretching them, trying them on my head, on my 70 pound Pittie's head and it doesn't seem like they lost any elasticity so I would say pretty good quality~<br /><br />They will look great on babies, toddlers, and even pets!

I came across the opportunity to try this Almond Oil, so I went for it.  This bottle of Almond oil is 100% pure, cold pressed, USDA certified organic, made in USA, and cruelty free, what else can I ask for?  It has all these good qualities.<br /><br />I normally use Argan as my daily moisturizing routine and because of this review, I did some research on the benefit of organic Almond oil and here is what I found.  Almond has fatty acids, vitamin E, potassium, proteins, zinc which is good for skin, hair, and health.  And its affect on skins are:  reducing dark circles, delays signs of aging, removes impurities and dead skin cells, great for dry skin, natural makeup remover, and can be applied throughout the body.  I have been using it for a few nights and I like it.<br /><br />Almond oils are also used in many cultures for baby massages, since this bottle is USDA certified organic, I would not be worried to use a little bit on my baby's scalp and body~  :)<br /><br />Satisfied with product.

It has all the great qualities that fractionated coconut oil has and it is truly a multi-purpose oil.  A few days ago, my face got some allergic reactions to something, everything I used and ate was normal but somehow my face got redness all over, bumpy, and it stinks when I applied my normal face product, even Argan oil.  Didn't know what to do so I called up my facial lady and she said use coconut oil.  So fortunate to have this bottle of fractionated coconut oil handy so I began applying it on my face.  I was skeptical at first, didn't know how my skin gonna react.  I have to say, it worked wonder.  First, it didn't stink my skin, so I figured it was a good sign.  I thought it was going to be greasy but it actually was not greasy at all.  And it absorbs very quickly too, I only used like half a pump the first time, and then I reapply about 15 minutes later.  I have continued applying both days and nights up until today and my skin had calmed down and it feels great.  Very moisturizing, I have to say, I like it better than argan oil.  Argan oil is more rich compared to fractionated coconut oil so maybe it doesnt' work as well on sensitive or inflamed skin.<br /><br />If you google fractionated coconut oil, there's a looooong list of ways you can use it for.  Many Do It Yourself projects, make up remover, skin moisturizer, massage oil, crayon remover, hair conditioner, helps to fade stretch marks, shaving lotion, etc, etc, etc...<br /><br />I would totally recommend this bottle of fractionated coconut oil by Sky Organics, 5 stars product!<br /><br />Ingredients<br />100% PURE MEDIUM CHAIN TRIGLYCERIDE OIL (FRACTIONATED COCONUT OIL ,COCOS NUCIFERA) COLD-PRESSED BY EXPELLER METHOD.\nReview Title: You can pretty much use it for everything\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Gift for Mom Ceramic Flat Iron 1 .25 inch Professional Tourmaline Hair Straightener with Temperature Control,Dual Voltage for Worldwide Use (Purple)\nReview Date: 2017/03/02\nStore: ISHAKO\nAverage Rating: 3.7\nProduct Details: {'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '13.6 x 4.6 x 2.4 inches; 1.4 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'Flat iron straightener', 'Manufacturer': 'iSHAKO'}\nReview Text: I like this flat ceramic iron a lot and here's why:<br /><br />1.

The water tank is a bit small, it took two full tanks to completely straighten but that might also be me, took some time to get used to.  I really like the result, my hair doesn't frizz and it doesn't feel dried up even at end of the day, it still kept straight and not dull looking.

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe analysis of purchase history reveals a strong preference for multi-purpose products, particularly in beauty and personal care, emphasizing both functionality and versatility. Ratings show a consistent appreciation for high-quality items that induce positive sentiment, typically rated above 4.0. Frequent purchases of hair accessories and moisturizers suggest a focus on grooming and style, particularly for infants and self-care routines.\n\nA recurring theme is the use of natural, organic ingredients, reflecting an inclination towards eco-friendly and cruelty-free products. This is evident in the purchase of almond and coconut oils, highlighting a preference for products with strong health benefits and multiple applications, such as skin and hair care.\n\nQuality seems to be prioritized over price, as evidenced by willingness to try premium brands despite mixed ratings. However, there is some price sensitivity since products were reviewed positively when perceived as good value for their quality or when found on sale or as samples.\n\nOverall, the core preferences indicate a shopper who values multifunctionality, organic ingredients, and reliable quality, showing a conscious approach to personal care that balances effectiveness with environmental consciousness.",
