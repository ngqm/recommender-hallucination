So after i open up the bundles I notice how poorly constructed the wefts are. They looked like someone sewed individual wefts together in a poor attempt to make a real bundle. There were lose threads all over the place and because the wefts weren't made correctly all this hair does is shed. Horrible just horrible. Oooh and the kicker took a hot comb to it. Don't do that shit shriveled up on contact so that being said its not real hair either....<br /><br />The hair arrived on time, and the bundles are true to length, however that's the only highlight I can give. The bundles are so thin. If you are someone that normally doubles your wefts that's not gonna happen with these bundles. The hair has all kinds of un even split ends, the ends of the hair is so thin and frail that your going to have to cut a few inches off just to make it look decent. I'm glad I prepared for this and already had extra hair on stand by just in case this happened. I wouldn't recommend this hair unless your looking for a quick fix, but if that's the case there is other hair on here cheaper and better for that.\nReview Title: YOU GET WHAT YOU PAID FOR-NOT REAL HAIR\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

  "raw_response": "SUMMARY:\nThe purchase history reveals a consumer who demonstrates a strong preference for high-quality hair extensions, particularly favoring human hair over synthetic materials. They consistently rate satisfactory products highly, especially when the quality exceeds expectations, as evidenced by their enthusiastic reviews for certain hair extensions. \n\nConversely, they express dissatisfaction with products that fall short in quality or misrepresentation, leading to lower ratings and negative sentiments. This pattern also highlights a tendency to value true length and realistic descriptions, indicating a desire for authenticity in purchases.\n\nIn terms of design and aesthetics, the consumer appreciates vibrant and trendy items, as shown by their interest in nail art foils, but their disappointment with the perceived value suggests a sensitivity to price versus quality. They may prioritize quality over quantity, as indicated by their willingness to repurchase successful items while avoiding products that appear poorly constructed or described.\n\nOverall, this consumer likely prioritizes durability, authenticity, and quality of materials, with a clear sensitivity to value for money, consistently rewarding products that meet or exceed these standards.",
