According to the enclosed instructions, you always wear them so that the heart part of the backs are on top when you slide them onto the post of your earrings.  This insures that the weight of the earring pulls the heart against your ear which, in turn, counterbalances the earring and holds it securely against your ear.  They're really lightweight, but they work well.  I tried them on my heaviest earrings to see just how securely these backs hold and they do not disappoint.  Even using them with lighter earrings you can tell they are held much more tightly and upright against your ear.  They are designed so you can tighten or loosen the clasp on them so they're adjusted just the way you want them.  A friend gave me a set of these for Christmas and I liked them so I bought more for myself and a couple more sets for my sisters to try.  I'm happy that this set is 18K gold plated sterling silver so I won't have any problems with allergies.  They are a great idea and they have a very pretty finish.\nReview Title: Very pretty finish\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "LUCINE LASHES MINK COLLECTION -\"Bia\" - False Mink Eyelashes - Natural False Eyelashes for Thickness, Length and Volume - Reusable, Non-Irritating and Easy to Apply (Black)\nLUCINE LASHES\n{'Brand': 'LUCINE LASHES', 'Material': 'Mink Fur', 'Material Feature': 'Cruelty Free', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Mounting Type': 'Eyelash Glue', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.6 x 2.3 x 0.6 inches', 'UPC': '707129687159'}\nThese eyelashes are very soft and natural feeling, with a sturdy base to them.  I don't really care for base that looks like a thick layer of eyeliner but this one is kind of a medium thickness so it's okay.  However, I have very thick hair and eyelashes that have gotten thinner over time and these lashes are so thick they look really fake on me.  They look okay, but I don't think they'll ever be my &#34;go to&#34; lash.  Still, it's obvious they're made with care and the quality appears to be very good if you're looking for thick lashes.\nQuality appears to be very good\nMagic Bax Earring Lifters - 2 Pairs of Adjustable Hypoallergenic Earring Lifts (2 Pairs of 18K Gold Plated Earring Backs) As Seen on TV\nAllstar Innovations\n['\u2022 Get an instant earring lift with Magic Bax Earring Lifters \u2022 Helps those with bad piercings, stretched lobes and heavy earrings \u2022 Hypoallergenic and Perfect For Post Earrings \u2022 Simply slide the earring post into the Magic Bax, just like any earring back!
