Essential Oils, Coconut, Argan, Jojoba, Sweet Almond Oils, Organic Rose Hip Seed, Quick Dry Oil for Women & Men 4oz\nReview Date: 2018/10/14\nStore: Ruth Paul Skin\nAverage Rating: 3.5\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Ruth Paul Skin', 'Scent': 'Coconut', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Unit Count': '4.00 Fl Oz', 'Skin Type': 'Dry,All Skin Types', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.5 x 3.1 x 2.1 inches; 7.04 Ounces', 'UPC': '758913623600'}\nReview Text: This oil has a great peppermint scent, a light feel, and absorbs quickly into my skin.  I use it for many things, although I have a few favorites.  I rub it into my damp hands a couple of times a day which leaves them softer and, unlike usual, my cuticles are not cracked or split (see photo 1).  I spray four or five pumps into my hand, rub them together and run them through my towel-dried hair.  Then I leave it to air dry and it ends up curly and soft (see photo 2) and lasts a couple of days until I wash it again.  I absolutely love the versatility.\nReview Title: I absolutely love the versatility\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "LUCINE LASHES MINK COLLECTION -\"Bia\" - False Mink Eyelashes - Natural False Eyelashes for Thickness, Length and Volume - Reusable, Non-Irritating and Easy to Apply (Black)\nLUCINE LASHES\n{'Brand': 'LUCINE LASHES', 'Material': 'Mink Fur', 'Material Feature': 'Cruelty Free', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Mounting Type': 'Eyelash Glue', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.6 x 2.3 x 0.6 inches', 'UPC': '707129687159'}\nThese eyelashes are very soft and natural feeling, with a sturdy base to them.  I don't really care for base that looks like a thick layer of eyeliner but this one is kind of a medium thickness so it's okay.  However, I have very thick hair and eyelashes that have gotten thinner over time and these lashes are so thick they look really fake on me.  They look okay, but I don't think they'll ever be my &#34;go to&#34; lash.  Still, it's obvious they're made with care and the quality appears to be very good if you're looking for thick lashes.\nQuality appears to be very good\nMagic Bax Earring Lifters - 2 Pairs of Adjustable Hypoallergenic Earring Lifts (2 Pairs of 18K Gold Plated Earring Backs) As Seen on TV\nAllstar Innovations\n['\u2022 Get an instant earring lift with Magic Bax Earring Lifters \u2022 Helps those with bad piercings, stretched lobes and heavy earrings \u2022 Hypoallergenic and Perfect For Post Earrings \u2022 Simply slide the earring post into the Magic Bax, just like any earring back! Designed to be comfortable for all day wear \u2022 Magic Bax are adjustable to fit earring posts of various sizes']\n{'Material': 'Sterling Silver', 'Color': 'Set of 4 18K Gold Plated Sterling Silver', 'Style': 'Basic- 2 Pairs 18K Gold Plated', 'Brand': 'Allstar Innovations', 'Item Weight': '0.15 Pounds', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.87 x 4.17 x 0.94 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': '30632', 'UPC': '740275049303', 'Manufacturer': 'Allstar Innovations'}\nThese are made with a clever design to ensure you are putting them on correctly.  According to the enclosed instructions, you always wear them so that the heart part of the backs are on top when you slide them onto the post of your earrings.  This insures that the weight of the earring pulls the heart against your ear which, in turn, counterbalances the earring and holds it securely against your ear.  They're really lightweight, but they work well.  I tried them on my heaviest earrings to see just how securely these backs hold and they do not disappoint.  Even using them with lighter earrings you can tell they are held much more tightly and upright against your ear.  They are designed so you can tighten or loosen the clasp on them so they're adjusted just the way you want them.  A friend gave me a set of these for Christmas and I liked them so I bought more for myself and a couple more sets for my sisters to try.  I'm happy that this set is 18K gold plated sterling silver so I won't have any problems with allergies.  They are a great idea and they have a very pretty finish.\nVery pretty finish\n4 pcs COMB BANANA CLIP HAIR RISER CLAW(1Brown-1Black-1White-1Clear).\nSundiego2020\n{'Brand': 'Sundiego2020', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Color': 'White', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material': 'Plastic', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '8.43 x 5.59 x 1.46 inches; 2.57 Ounces'}\nThere is definitely a learning curve to using these.  The first time I tried it, I ended up with a lot of hair that didn't make it into the clip.  In subsequent tries, I ended up with the hairs at the very top of my head sticking up or outside the clip, and finally I ended up with the clip too far up on my head which resulted in my hair looking like a literal pony's tail!  But with continued practice, this clip ends up being very comfortable to wear, looking nice overall, and my hair looks like a soft and feminine fall of hair (see photos).  I'm glad I persevered because it's my preferred way to wear my hair now.\nTakes a lot of practice, but it's worth it\nWenHairCare Sweet Almond Mint - Cleanses, Nourishes and Restores the Look of Hair, No Harsh Sulfates (16 oz)\nLONGXTX\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.3 x 3.2 x 3.1 inches; 1.19 Pounds', 'UPC': '819763020213'}\nI have very thick, shoulder-length hair with a pretty, natural curl. Many conditioners leave my hair soft but pretty much straight.  When I use this conditioner, it leaves my hair soft and shiny, and tames the curl to a soft wave.  I love that this conditioner leaves me with two simple, easy choices for how to wear my hair depending on my mood.  I also LOVE the smell of it.\nLeaves my hair soft and shiny\nPangda 7 Pieces Hair Comb 20 Teeth Rhinestone Comb Pin Clip Bridal Hair Combs Accessory for Women Girls, Assorted Colors\nPangda\n{'Material': 'Plastic', 'Brand': 'Pangda', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Number of Items': '7', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '5.91 x 3.94 x 0.39 inches; 2.08 Ounces', 'UPC': '652508265834'}\nI have tried hair combs a few different times in the past without much luck.  I have thick, heavy hair that has been really long for more than 40 years and no combs were ever able to hold its weight.  A few years ago I cut my hair shorter.  Right now it's shoulder length; not quite long enough to put in a pony tail but too long to keep it easily out of my face.  I hoped these combs would be a good interim solution and I absolutely loved the color and flash of the rhinestones.<br /><br />With care, and holding onto the bottom part of my hair tightly while we place the combs, we can get them to hold my hair for a few hours (see photo) but then it starts to fall out unless we put the comb toward the top of my head.  Then they stay in for twice as long.  Still, I never make it through a full day with them, but while they last they look really pretty!\nThey hold my hair for a few hours\nBRAVE Scottish Beard Oil - A Premium Beard Oil Recipe that Smoothes, Nourishes and Thickens Beard with a Light Fresh Long Lasting Kiss-Worthy Scent.100% Natural Oils, Vegan &Cruelty Free - Made in UK!\nSkin Radiance\n{'Liquid Volume': '60 Milliliters', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Brand': 'Skin Radiance', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Unit Count': '2.00 Fl Oz', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.88 x 1.65 x 1.65 inches; 3.53 Ounces', 'UPC': '634304105002'}\nThis oil has a very soft, pleasant smell.  It leaves my sweetheart's beard a bit darker, shiny enough to catch the light as he speaks or moves around, keeps it in place (I'd guess it's about a medium hold), but still leaves it soft to the touch.  It lasted all day long and through the night until he showered in the morning.\nLasted all day long and through the night\nFull Body Oil Moisturizing Oil For Normal to Dry Skin Face Hair Cuticle Scalp Nails.
