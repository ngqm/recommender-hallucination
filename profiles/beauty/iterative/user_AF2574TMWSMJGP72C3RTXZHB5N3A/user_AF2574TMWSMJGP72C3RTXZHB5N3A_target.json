Losing a screw from the hinge on your glasses? Scared of the massive ball of hair stuck in your shower drain? Sick of trying to thread needles with nearly-invisible thread?  You need tweezers! Make difficult tasks easy with the right tools. Our Love It tweezers are perfect for grabbing, twisting, shaping and holding on to anything that's too delicate, small, fragile, or hard to grasp with your hands.   These tweezers are built to last. Too often, tweezers are made with cheap material and careless manufacturing standards. This means that they quickly bend out of alignment and become useless. We don't want that to happen to you... which is why we build our tweezers out of stainless steel, machined carefully to come together in exactly the right position.   A variety of tips for a variety of jobs. When you're handling anything small or fragile, the shape of your tweezers becomes extra important. That's why our Love It tweezer set ships with three different sizes of tool: standard, slanted, and extra-small. They're sharp, too-perfect for dislodging splinters or pulling that one annoying hair.  And because they're sharp, we ship our Love It tweezers with a stylish leather carrying case, perfect for keeping them safe and protecting the other objects in your purse.
