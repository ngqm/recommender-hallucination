Not too shiny or fake looking and nice and thick. There are no instructions on how to adjust or wear so there is a bit of a learning curve and you'll need to look up instructions. Once you know how, it is easy to put on and feels very secure. I got the 16T60 color and it is VERY ashy. I have level 9-10 blonde hair that leans more neutral vs ashy and this hair looked almost lavender compared because it is VERY ashy. Definitely recommend for someone with ash blonde hair.\nReview Title: Impressive for the price!\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Hair Clippers and Trimers for Men Cordless Rechargeable Hair Cutter Kit\nMayBuy\n['Hair Clippers and Trimers for Men Cordless Rechargeable Hair Cutter Kit']\n{'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Shaving', 'Color': 'Black', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'MayBuy', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.99 x 2.99 x 0.71 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'PINK55', 'Batteries': '1 Lithium Ion batteries required. (included)', 'UPC': '682500548413', 'Manufacturer': 'Maybuy'}\nThere is plenty to like about this kit.<br /><br />First, I like that it's USB powered.  That is a major convenience, especially if using in a professional setting.  Secondly, it's got good balance and is ergonomically pleasing.  A great feature when you're using is regularly.<br /><br />My sister, who has been a professional for 20 years, said it was among the sharpest (in a good way!) she's ever used.  Obviously this is huge when working on customers and you don't want to pulling hair out when you're trying to cut it.<br /><br />With the myriad attachments, there's really very little you can't do with it.  And best of all, the price is great for what you get.  I would recommend this for both home and professional settings.<br /><br />The battery length isn't great, but it also charges really quickly, so it's simply a matter of being mindful of it.\nGreat for home or the salon\nLaClaire Foaming Botanical Facial Cleanser with Enriched Antioxidant Botanicals - Nourishing pH Balanced Face Wash (50 ml/1.65 oz), Made in the USA\nLaClaire\n['A gentle foaming cleanser utilizing natural beneficial antioxidant botanicals to draw out impurities, excess oil and pollutants.

It's seemed to be like unwrapping an onion, with a box, then a smaller box, and paper. The bottle is wrapped in tissue paper and unfortunately the cleanser had leaked all over the paper and turned it a dark yellow color. This is a foaming cleanser and when mixed with water, the consistency is rather thick. I suffered from breakouts all over my forehead during the week or two using this cleanser which is a very unusual spot for me to break out. I had some other treatments affecting my hormones at the same time, so I can't say for certain that my skin condition was due to this product alone, but it certainly didn't help. When I switched to using Cetaphil cleanser, the breakouts cleared up almost immediately. Unfortunately this was a pass for me.\nToo much packaging, gave me breakouts\nMr. Pristine Organic Beard Shampoo with Natural Essential Oils for Moisturizing Skin & Hair, 8.5 oz.\nMr. Pristine\n{'Brand': 'Mr. Pristine', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Hair Type': 'Color Treated', 'Scent': 'Peppermint', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '5.21 x 2.8 x 2.3 inches; 7.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '627843801832', 'Manufacturer': 'Mr. Pristine'}\nI recently decided to enter my prophetic career by growing out my beard.  I've always keep a few days growth, but I finally cut loose and embrace my inner Moses.<br /><br />A few months into it, I realized a needed something more than a basic shampoo or soap for my beard.  I was pleased to try Mr. Pristine's beard shampoo and so far I've been pleased with the results.<br /><br />First of all, it smells great.  None of the scents are overwhelming or powerful.  The faint mint is nice and refreshing.  Secondly, the lather is fine.  I noticed that if I apply some to my hair and work a lather, it's nice and frothy.  I then apply to my beard and give it a good cleaning.  If I apply the shampoo directly to my beard, the later is noticeably less frothy.  I don't know why this is.<br /><br />At any rate, it's been working well for me and leaves me feeling nice and crisp after a shower.  My only misgiving is the price, which is a bit steep for what you get, in my opinion.\nGood shampoo, a bit pricey\nStamped Glorious Short Hair Extensions Halo Wire Sercet Crown Synthetic Wavy Curly Brown Blonde Bayalage Hairpieces For Women Invisible (16 inch, 16/60)\nStamped Glorious\n{'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Brand': 'Stamped Glorious', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '10 x 6.97 x 2.44 inches; 6.74 Ounces'}\nImpressed with the quality of this hair for the price!
