  "reference_summary": "Hair Clippers and Trimers for Men Cordless Rechargeable Hair Cutter Kit\nMayBuy\n['Hair Clippers and Trimers for Men Cordless Rechargeable Hair Cutter Kit']\n{'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Shaving', 'Color': 'Black', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'MayBuy', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.99 x 2.99 x 0.71 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'PINK55', 'Batteries': '1 Lithium Ion batteries required. (included)', 'UPC': '682500548413', 'Manufacturer': 'Maybuy'}\nThere is plenty to like about this kit.<br /><br />First, I like that it's USB powered.  That is a major convenience, especially if using in a professional setting.  Secondly, it's got good balance and is ergonomically pleasing.  A great feature when you're using is regularly.<br /><br />My sister, who has been a professional for 20 years, said it was among the sharpest (in a good way!) she's ever used.  Obviously this is huge when working on customers and you don't want to pulling hair out when you're trying to cut it.<br /><br />With the myriad attachments, there's really very little you can't do with it.  And best of all, the price is great for what you get.  I would recommend this for both home and professional settings.<br /><br />The battery length isn't great, but it also charges really quickly, so it's simply a matter of being mindful of it.\nGreat for home or the salon\nLaClaire Foaming Botanical Facial Cleanser with Enriched Antioxidant Botanicals - Nourishing pH Balanced Face Wash (50 ml/1.65 oz), Made in the USA\nLaClaire\n['A gentle foaming cleanser utilizing natural beneficial antioxidant botanicals to draw out impurities, excess oil and pollutants. Our foaming cleanser removes debris without disrupting skin\u2019s delicate PH balance. Use our cleanser to detoxify, purify and condition the skin\u2019s natural barrier.']\n{'Item Form': 'Foam', 'Skin Type': 'Oily, Combination, Dry, Normal', 'Brand': 'LaClaire', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2.75 x 5.5 x 1.63 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '891040000682', 'Manufacturer': 'LaClaire'}\nI wanted to love this cleanser, but my first disappointment was the giant box it was wrapped in. It's seemed to be like unwrapping an onion, with a box, then a smaller box, and paper. The bottle is wrapped in tissue paper and unfortunately the cleanser had leaked all over the paper and turned it a dark yellow color. This is a foaming cleanser and when mixed with water, the consistency is rather thick. I suffered from breakouts all over my forehead during the week or two using this cleanser which is a very unusual spot for me to break out. I had some other treatments affecting my hormones at the same time, so I can't say for certain that my skin condition was due to this product alone, but it certainly didn't help. When I switched to using Cetaphil cleanser, the breakouts cleared up almost immediately. Unfortunately this was a pass for me.\nToo much packaging, gave me breakouts\nMr. Pristine Organic Beard Shampoo with Natural Essential Oils for Moisturizing Skin & Hair, 8.5 oz.\nMr. Pristine\n{'Brand': 'Mr. Pristine', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Hair Type': 'Color Treated', 'Scent': 'Peppermint', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '5.21 x 2.8 x 2.3 inches; 7.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '627843801832', 'Manufacturer': 'Mr. Pristine'}\nI recently decided to enter my prophetic career by growing out my beard.  I've always keep a few days growth, but I finally cut loose and embrace my inner Moses.<br /><br />A few months into it, I realized a needed something more than a basic shampoo or soap for my beard.  I was pleased to try Mr. Pristine's beard shampoo and so far I've been pleased with the results.<br /><br />First of all, it smells great.  None of the scents are overwhelming or powerful.  The faint mint is nice and refreshing.  Secondly, the lather is fine.  I noticed that if I apply some to my hair and work a lather, it's nice and frothy.  I then apply to my beard and give it a good cleaning.  If I apply the shampoo directly to my beard, the later is noticeably less frothy.  I don't know why this is.<br /><br />At any rate, it's been working well for me and leaves me feeling nice and crisp after a shower.  My only misgiving is the price, which is a bit steep for what you get, in my opinion.\nGood shampoo, a bit pricey\nStamped Glorious Short Hair Extensions Halo Wire Sercet Crown Synthetic Wavy Curly Brown Blonde Bayalage Hairpieces For Women Invisible (16 inch, 16/60)\nStamped Glorious\n{'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Brand': 'Stamped Glorious', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '10 x 6.97 x 2.44 inches; 6.74 Ounces'}\nImpressed with the quality of this hair for the price! Not too shiny or fake looking and nice and thick. There are no instructions on how to adjust or wear so there is a bit of a learning curve and you'll need to look up instructions. Once you know how, it is easy to put on and feels very secure. I got the 16T60 color and it is VERY ashy. I have level 9-10 blonde hair that leans more neutral vs ashy and this hair looked almost lavender compared because it is VERY ashy. Definitely recommend for someone with ash blonde hair.\nImpressive for the price!\nMane Tame Deluxe Pomade 3.3oz/97mL - Firm Hold, Medium Shine - Made in USA, Water-Based, Combable, Rinses Out Easily, BARBER RECOMMENDED - Best used on dry hair\nMane Tame Professional Men's Grooming\n{'Hair Type': 'Dry', 'Liquid Volume': '118 Milliliters', 'Item Form': 'Clay', 'Brand': \"Mane Tame Professional Men's Grooming\", 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '3 x 3 x 2.5 inches; 5.6 Ounces', 'UPC': '851088008163'}\nI have thick and wirey hair so finding a product that works and has hold for my hair is hard to find, but this product delivers! It has a pretty smooth consistency between your fingers and goes on smoothly. I like that it \"sets\" - not all pomades or gels do and they stay sticky. This actually has holding power on my thick hair but isn't crunchy and stays soft. It has a pretty strong masculine smell which I do like, but it may not compliment your cologne. smells really good but it's pretty strong and masculine that may not work with your cologne. All the great reviews are true - this one is worth a try!\nHas great hold on my thick hair\nEmpty Amber Glass Spray Bottles - (4 Pack) 16 oz with Labels Refillable Container for Essential Oils, Cleaning Solutions, Cleaning Products, Hair, Plant Mister, Daily Shower, Gardening or Aromatherapy\nAYL\n{'Brand': 'AYL', 'Material': 'Glass', 'Capacity': '16 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '4', 'Product Care Instructions': 'Hand Wash Only', 'Package Dimensions': '9.88 x 7.6 x 7.17 inches; 2.98 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'EmptyAmberGlassSprayBottles 4 Pack', 'UPC': '860005177202'}\nThese bottles are wonderful!
