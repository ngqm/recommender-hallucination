It's seemed to be like unwrapping an onion, with a box, then a smaller box, and paper. The bottle is wrapped in tissue paper and unfortunately the cleanser had leaked all over the paper and turned it a dark yellow color. This is a foaming cleanser and when mixed with water, the consistency is rather thick. I suffered from breakouts all over my forehead during the week or two using this cleanser which is a very unusual spot for me to break out. I had some other treatments affecting my hormones at the same time, so I can't say for certain that my skin condition was due to this product alone, but it certainly didn't help. When I switched to using Cetaphil cleanser, the breakouts cleared up almost immediately. Unfortunately this was a pass for me.\nReview Title: Too much packaging, gave me breakouts\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

That is a major convenience, especially if using in a professional setting.  Secondly, it's got good balance and is ergonomically pleasing.  A great feature when you're using is regularly.<br /><br />My sister, who has been a professional for 20 years, said it was among the sharpest (in a good way!) she's ever used.  Obviously this is huge when working on customers and you don't want to pulling hair out when you're trying to cut it.<br /><br />With the myriad attachments, there's really very little you can't do with it.  And best of all, the price is great for what you get.  I would recommend this for both home and professional settings.<br /><br />The battery length isn't great, but it also charges really quickly, so it's simply a matter of being mindful of it.\nGreat for home or the salon\nLaClaire Foaming Botanical Facial Cleanser with Enriched Antioxidant Botanicals - Nourishing pH Balanced Face Wash (50 ml/1.65 oz), Made in the USA\nLaClaire\n['A gentle foaming cleanser utilizing natural beneficial antioxidant botanicals to draw out impurities, excess oil and pollutants.
