Unfortunately, I didn't like any of the colors in this set. Two of the gel polish are the same exact color, so I received 5 different colors not 6. The title of this product claims that it comes with a UV lamp, but it doesn't. I am glad I tested the colors on my nails before going further. Otherwise removal process is another painful process.\nReview Title: UV lamp is not included, the colors didn't look good on my nails\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "C'est Moi Gentle Cleansing Water | Gentle, Fragrance-Free Cleanser Removes Makeup and Refreshes Skin, Made with Cornflower Water, Aloe Vera, and Strawberry, Kiwi, and Apple Extracts | 5.9 fl oz.\nC'est Moi\n{'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Skin Type': 'Acne Prone,Sensitive', 'Brand': \"C'est Moi\", 'Scent': 'Kiwi, Strawberry, Unscented, Aloe Vera', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '1.84 x 1.84 x 6.06 inches; 7.69 Ounces', 'UPC': '039897626055'}\nThis cleanser removed my waterproof mascara and eyeliner effortlessly without leaving any residue behind, but left my skin feeling dry and tight. Of course that went away as soon as I applied my moisturizer. If you want something that removes make up quick and effectively then get this cleanser but don't expect your skin to feel soft and hydrated after using this.\nRemoves waterproof makeup effectively\nMAD | Cosmetic's Makeup Remover Cleansing Towelettes, Daily cleansing face wipes to remove waterproof mascara, alcohol free , with Vitamin E 25 count\nJUST FOR TOTS BY MAD\n{'Brand': 'JUST FOR TOTS BY MAD', 'Skin Type': 'Oily', 'Unit Count': '25.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '6.3 x 7.87 x 1.97 inches; 7.16 Ounces', 'UPC': '685757511926'}\nI was excited to get this product, but unfortunately it doesn't work at all. I don't put a lot of make up on. My make up routine is eyeliner, mascara and blush. This makeup remover towelettes doesn't have enough moisture to do the job right, and it dried out quickly as I was wiping my face with it. All it did was smudge the make up around my eyes leaving me with racoon eyes. Once my eyes started to feel irritated I stopped using it, and I used Garnier cleansing water with a cotton pad. I took a picture of the towelette and the cotton pad side by side to show how much make up this product left behind. Also, this cleanser smells so bad that I had to hold my breath when using it. I don't recommend this cleanser at all.\nSmells terrible, dries out quickly, doesn't remove make up\nFollain Everybody Bar Soap | Lavender & Bergamot, Skin Moisturizing Hand & Body Cleanser with Shea Butter, Argan Oil, Hydrate for Softer Skin, Non-Drying, Rich-Lather, Cruelty Free, 5 oz\nFollain\n{'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Brand': 'Follain', 'Scent': 'Bergamot,Lavender', 'Material Feature': 'Cru, Non GMO, Dermatologist Tested', 'Product Dimensions': '3.75 x 2.25 x 1 inches; 5.11 Ounces', 'Item model number': '692764483009', 'UPC': '692764483009'}\nThis soap doesn't have the best scent, but it is very creamy and moisturizing. It is a big bar of soap too so it will last me a long time. Because of its creamy texture, I used this soap to shave instead of using my shaving cream and it did a wonderful job! It makes me feel clean and fresh after every shower.\nVery creamy and big bar of soap\nIce Roller for Face & Eye by Charmlily, Puffiness, Migraine, Pain Relief - Cold Facial Massager Treatment to Reduce Puffy Face & Tighten Pores, Under Eye Wrinkles (Blue)\nCHARMLILY\n{'Brand': 'CHARMLILY', 'Special Feature': 'Heat', 'Is Cordless?': 'Yes', 'Product Grade': 'Home', 'Style': 'Rustic', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.91 x 3.54 x 2.44 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'UPC': '679360114261', 'Manufacturer': 'CHARMLILY'}\nI've never heard an ice roller before and as soon as I saw this I knew exactly what I would use it for. I have headache and neck pain everyday. I normally use an ice pack for aches and pain but replaced it with this roller. It massages my tight neck muscles and numbs the pain quickly. This roller is way better and more comfortable than a regular ice pack.\nEasy to use, helps with headache\nPet Tear Stain Remover Comb, 8 Pcs Double-Sided Dog Eye Comb Brush, Double Head Grooming Comb, Multipurpose Tool for Small Pet Cat Dogs Crust and Mucus Removal (Silver & Black)\nLBSXQGS\n{'Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Brand': 'LBSXQGS', 'Hair Type': 'Thick', 'Color': 'Silver', 'Size': 'Small', 'Package Dimensions': '9.76 x 6.89 x 0.35 inches; 4.94 Ounces', 'UPC': '805110051801'}\nThis double sided brush cleans my dog's eye area effectively. The pin side is very pointy and sharp so be very careful when brushing. I use the soft brush side of it when I apply my dog's eye stain remover gel. It distributes the gel better than using my fingers. The only thing that concerns me is the pin side for wiggly dogs. If your dog moves around constantly during grooming then this brush is not for you. My Mal-Shi is very calm during grooming so he just stands still, but my Shih Tzu is very wiggly, so I can't use this brush on him. The pin side is like needles, if he moves his head slightly he would get injured. I can't risk it.\nEffective, but not for wiggly dogs\nHeyedrate Activated Charcoal Soap Bar and Face Wash | Organic, Vegan, Natural Soap made with Dead Sea Mud and Our Essential Oil Blend (1 Pack (5 Ounces))\nEye Love\n{'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Brand': 'Eye Love', 'Scent': 'Eucalyptus, Coconut, Grapefruit, Rosemary', 'Material Feature': 'Organic, Natural, Vegan', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '4 x 1 x 1 inches; 4.97 Ounces', 'UPC': '850436007827'}\nI am not stranger to charcoal facial soap. I used to use the liquid version of it and got great results in the past. Since spring is here, I wanted to get rid of dead skin and rejuvenate my skin. This charcoal soap doesn't lather a lot but it is as effective as the liquid one. I distributed it using my silicone brush cleaner and got an amazing result. My skin feels cleaner, brighter and smoother. All the combination of natural ingredients in it nourishes my skin. This soap bar is going to last me a long time. Great value for what you get.\nMakes skin feel smoother and look radiant\nNail Polish Gel Remover Tools Kit for Women with Nail Clip Caps, Nail File, Nail Remover Cotton Pads,Brush, 2-in-1 Cuticle Scraper and Pusher, Nail Separator\nLahien\n{'Brand': 'Lahien', 'Item Form': 'Pad', 'Unit Count': '5.2911 Ounce', 'Package Dimensions': '7.99 x 5.82 x 1.69 inches; 4.16 Ounces', 'UPC': '782910194573'}\nI recently got a gel nail polish starter kit for myself. It was my first time doing gel nail and I loved it, but I didn't realize gel polish needs to be removed using a special technique. That's how I came across with this remover kit and I am glad I ordered it. I guess some people wrap aluminum foil around their nails, but I don't know how efficient that is. After I dipped the cotton pads in nail polish remover, I wrapped them around my nails and put the nail clippers on for 15 minutes. When I took them off, the gel polish looked soft and some of them were already peeled, so I used the scrapper to get rid of the rest of the polish, and filed my nails to smooth them out. That's it! This kit is very easy to use and does the job.\nEasy to use, does the job quickly\nYayoge Gel Nail Polish Kit \uff0c6 Colors Gel Nail Polish Base and Top Coat \uff0cUV Gel Nail Polish Set \uff0cSoak Off Gel Nail Art Manicure Kit, Ideal Gifts DIY Salon and Home\nyayoge\n{'Brand': 'Yayoge', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Glossy', 'Special Feature': 'Long-lasting', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Liquid Volume': '0.33 Fluid Ounces', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '8.66 x 7.09 x 2.36 inches', 'Product Dimensions': '8.66 x 7.09 x 2.36 inches; 13.76 Ounces'}\nBefore I cured my nails with the UV light, I applied different colors on each nail to see which one would compliment my skin.
