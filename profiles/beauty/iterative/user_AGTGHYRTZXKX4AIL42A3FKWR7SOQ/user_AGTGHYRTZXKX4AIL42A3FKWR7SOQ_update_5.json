The pin side is very pointy and sharp so be very careful when brushing. I use the soft brush side of it when I apply my dog's eye stain remover gel. It distributes the gel better than using my fingers. The only thing that concerns me is the pin side for wiggly dogs. If your dog moves around constantly during grooming then this brush is not for you. My Mal-Shi is very calm during grooming so he just stands still, but my Shih Tzu is very wiggly, so I can't use this brush on him. The pin side is like needles, if he moves his head slightly he would get injured. I can't risk it.\nReview Title: Effective, but not for wiggly dogs\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Of course that went away as soon as I applied my moisturizer.

I don't put a lot of make up on. My make up routine is eyeliner, mascara and blush. This makeup remover towelettes doesn't have enough moisture to do the job right, and it dried out quickly as I was wiping my face with it. All it did was smudge the make up around my eyes leaving me with racoon eyes. Once my eyes started to feel irritated I stopped using it, and I used Garnier cleansing water with a cotton pad. I took a picture of the towelette and the cotton pad side by side to show how much make up this product left behind. Also, this cleanser smells so bad that I had to hold my breath when using it. I don't recommend this cleanser at all.\nSmells terrible, dries out quickly, doesn't remove make up\nFollain Everybody Bar Soap | Lavender & Bergamot, Skin Moisturizing Hand & Body Cleanser with Shea Butter, Argan Oil, Hydrate for Softer Skin, Non-Drying, Rich-Lather, Cruelty Free, 5 oz\nFollain\n{'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Brand': 'Follain', 'Scent': 'Bergamot,Lavender', 'Material Feature': 'Cru, Non GMO, Dermatologist Tested', 'Product Dimensions': '3.75 x 2.25 x 1 inches; 5.11 Ounces', 'Item model number': '692764483009', 'UPC': '692764483009'}\nThis soap doesn't have the best scent, but it is very creamy and moisturizing. It is a big bar of soap too so it will last me a long time. Because of its creamy texture, I used this soap to shave instead of using my shaving cream and it did a wonderful job! It makes me feel clean and fresh after every shower.\nVery creamy and big bar of soap\nIce Roller for Face & Eye by Charmlily, Puffiness, Migraine, Pain Relief - Cold Facial Massager Treatment to Reduce Puffy Face & Tighten Pores, Under Eye Wrinkles (Blue)\nCHARMLILY\n{'Brand': 'CHARMLILY', 'Special Feature': 'Heat', 'Is Cordless?': 'Yes', 'Product Grade': 'Home', 'Style': 'Rustic', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.91 x 3.54 x 2.44 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'UPC': '679360114261', 'Manufacturer': 'CHARMLILY'}\nI've never heard an ice roller before and as soon as I saw this I knew exactly what I would use it for. I have headache and neck pain everyday. I normally use an ice pack for aches and pain but replaced it with this roller. It massages my tight neck muscles and numbs the pain quickly. This roller is way better and more comfortable than a regular ice pack.\nEasy to use, helps with headache\nPet Tear Stain Remover Comb, 8 Pcs Double-Sided Dog Eye Comb Brush, Double Head Grooming Comb, Multipurpose Tool for Small Pet Cat Dogs Crust and Mucus Removal (Silver & Black)\nLBSXQGS\n{'Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Brand': 'LBSXQGS', 'Hair Type': 'Thick', 'Color': 'Silver', 'Size': 'Small', 'Package Dimensions': '9.76 x 6.89 x 0.35 inches; 4.94 Ounces', 'UPC': '805110051801'}\nThis double sided brush cleans my dog's eye area effectively.
