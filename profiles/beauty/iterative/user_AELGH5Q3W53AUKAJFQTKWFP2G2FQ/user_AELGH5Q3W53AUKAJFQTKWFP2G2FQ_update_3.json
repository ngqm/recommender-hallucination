If you don't believe me, then literally look it up. WebMD will state that it helps with joint disorders, eye surgeries, and healing wounds/burns and more.<br /><br />The big statement here really is that it's very effective for any sort of regenerative properties. The serum is a very good moisturizer, and don't let the word &#34;acid&#34; turn you off of it. It's actually found in high quantities in the skin of a baby, which everyone knows is incredibly soft.<br /><br />This product, applied to your face, will protect it from UV damage, improve elasticity, make your face feel softer, and properly moisturize it.<br /><br />I have ben using products by Derma- nu for a while and this is my second buy of this serum. Do proper research before you buy products that you're going to put on your face to be seen everyday. I did, and I found this reliable product. The greatest thing is that it works with almost every skin type be it oily, dry, or combination. This is terrific because my skin is very, very combination and while parts of my face are dry, some are a little more oily. This balanced everything out very nicely , that's why I am getting the second bottle of the same one.<br />As they stated  that &#34;This Formula Has Been Infused with Vitamin C + Vitamin E + Green Tea Extract For Their Superior Anti Aging Benefits&#34;. I used to make my own masks with vitamin E, green tea and many other ingredients but it just takes too much time to mix it yourself. I alternate this serum with Derma-nu other serum to balance it. My skin is visibly better now.<br /><br />If you're on the fence, just buy it anyway. It's not expensive for what it does, and if you don't like it just get your money back with the 100% guarantee. You probably won't just like it...you'll love it. I was given an opportunity to obtain this product to test and review.\nReview Title: Second bottle of this serum\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I drink my tea, which helps me to get rid of bloating, I apply my Cellulite Cream, let it absorb, then I Put on my t-shirt and put my waist trainer on top. The waist trainer helps to keep my abdomen warm and triggers the ingredients in a cream (caffeine, retinol, Vitamin C  as well as many other ingredients) to star working better. That is my personal suggestion and you can apply it for yourself.
