  "reference_summary": "Anti Aging Skin Care Serum for Men & Women From Uptown Cosmeceuticals Offers Spin Trap\u00ae Intelligent Antioxidant, Advanced Scientific Formula Promotes Younger Looking Face, 30mL\nUptown Cosmeceuticals\n{'Product Benefits': 'Anti-Aging', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'Uptown Cosmeceuticals', 'Material Feature': 'Antioxidant', 'Unit Count': '1.0144 Fl Oz', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.6 x 1.7 x 1.7 inches; 0.8 Ounces', 'UPC': '685987989205'}\nSince I received this serum with a great discount I shared this skin care product with my friend , so she could provide her opinion.<br />She used it for several day and that's what she found out:<br />1. Nice, presentable packaging and good design.<br />2. Very pleasant scent (citrus and spring flowers kind) very fresh<br />3. Hypoallergenic (she has EXTREMELY sensitive skin)<br />4. Her husband tried it and stated that is helped him with pores<br />  I could add to that that the package arrived very fast and even the full price with the discount is acceptable compare to other serums from the mall.\nQuality product for good price\nInstaNatural Cellulite Cream - With Caffeine & Retinol - Body Firming Solution & Tightening Lotion for Thigh Area, Buttocks & More - No Wrap Needed - Anti Cellulite Control Treatment - 4 OZ\nInstaNatural\n['Reduce Cellulite and Tighten Your Skin With our Retinol & Caffeine Firming Cream As time progresses, both men and women will experience puckering and dimpling of cellulite in the following areas: - Thighs - Stomachs - Hips - Arms - Chest Our Cellulite Cream is packed with antioxidants and moisturizing ingredients to help improve skin tone and texture: - Specialized REGU-SLIM formula that tones, tightens, and improves the skin - Moisturizes and hydrates skin - Contains Retinol, Caffeine, Jojoba Oil and Vitamin E for supreme nourishment With InstaNatural, rest assured you will receive the best customer care and highest-quality Cellulite Cream around. - Premium blend of natural ingredients - 4 oz jar gives you more value for less expense - Made in the USA - Cruelty-Free']\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.2 x 3 x 3.2 inches; 6.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '616913954721 852661007238', 'Manufacturer': 'SETAF'}\nTo help this cream to work on my abdomen  I also purchased detox tea and a waist trainer. I drink my tea, which helps me to get rid of bloating, I apply my Cellulite Cream, let it absorb, then I Put on my t-shirt and put my waist trainer on top. The waist trainer helps to keep my abdomen warm and triggers the ingredients in a cream (caffeine, retinol, Vitamin C  as well as many other ingredients) to star working better. That is my personal suggestion and you can apply it for yourself. I also apply it on my neck 2x day as well.<br />I received this cream with a discount for trying, testing and reviewing\nVitamin C as well as many other ingredients) to star working better. That is my personal suggestion and you can ...\nPure Hyaluronic Acid Serum with Vitamin C for Face - Organic Anti Aging & Anti-Wrinkle Skin Treatment - Penetrates Deeply & Activates Collagen Production for a Younger, Firmer & Brighter Complexion\nDerma-nu Miracle Skin Remedies\n{'Skin Type': 'All', 'Product Benefits': 'Anti-Aging', 'Use for': 'Face', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'Derma-nu Miracle Skin Remedies', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1 x 1 x 4 inches; 1.25 Ounces', 'UPC': '787421301854'}\nHyaluronic acid is awesome for your skin. If you don't believe me, then literally look it up. WebMD will state that it helps with joint disorders, eye surgeries, and healing wounds/burns and more.<br /><br />The big statement here really is that it's very effective for any sort of regenerative properties. The serum is a very good moisturizer, and don't let the word &#34;acid&#34; turn you off of it. It's actually found in high quantities in the skin of a baby, which everyone knows is incredibly soft.<br /><br />This product, applied to your face, will protect it from UV damage, improve elasticity, make your face feel softer, and properly moisturize it.<br /><br />I have ben using products by Derma- nu for a while and this is my second buy of this serum. Do proper research before you buy products that you're going to put on your face to be seen everyday. I did, and I found this reliable product. The greatest thing is that it works with almost every skin type be it oily, dry, or combination. This is terrific because my skin is very, very combination and while parts of my face are dry, some are a little more oily. This balanced everything out very nicely , that's why I am getting the second bottle of the same one.<br />As they stated  that &#34;This Formula Has Been Infused with Vitamin C + Vitamin E + Green Tea Extract For Their Superior Anti Aging Benefits&#34;. I used to make my own masks with vitamin E, green tea and many other ingredients but it just takes too much time to mix it yourself. I alternate this serum with Derma-nu other serum to balance it. My skin is visibly better now.<br /><br />If you're on the fence, just buy it anyway. It's not expensive for what it does, and if you don't like it just get your money back with the 100% guarantee. You probably won't just like it...you'll love it. I was given an opportunity to obtain this product to test and review.\nSecond bottle of this serum\nEyelash Growth Serum for Long Eyelashes From Uptown Cosmeceuticals Contains Stem Cell & Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17, Dermatologist Lab Tested Lash & Eyebrow Growth Formula, 4 Months Supply, 3.5ml\nUptown Cosmeceuticals\n{'Color': 'Multicolor', 'Brand': 'Uptown Cosmeceuticals', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Package Type': 'Box', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '5 x 3 x 0.7 inches; 0.35 Ounces', 'UPC': '685987989168', 'Manufacturer': 'RightChoiceMarket'}\nI already wrote a nice review about the product and the great customer service I received from Uptown. Be careful with the thin applicator because it might be runny and don't pock yourself in the eye! My Eye lushes got thicker but not longer yet.
