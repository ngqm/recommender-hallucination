My daughter has put them on for me before and I love the way they make my eyes pop.  However, I cannot tell you how many pairs of lashes I have ruined in my many failed attempts of applying them.  I do not like to spend a lot of money for them while I am in the beginner phase for fear I will ruin them.  I know some cost a lot of money.  These are very affordable, come with several sets of pretty fluffy lashes, a tweezer to apply them and some glue.  My daughter, who is an eye lash guru said they were very good quality and was quite surprised by the great price point.  I am getting better applying them and not ruining as many as I have in the past.  I think a beginner or an experienced person would very much enjoy getting these lashes.\nReview Title: Pretty and very affordable\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Easydew 2-Step Face Contour Sheet Mask - Tightening & Anti-Aging & Hydrating Korean Face Mask with DW-EGF, Hyaluronic Acid for Anti-Winkle, Reducing Fine Line & Producing Collagen (Qty 5)\nEASYDEW\n{'Brand': 'EASYDEW', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Scent': 'Honey', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'Yes', 'Package Dimensions': '8.35 x 6.38 x 0.63 inches; 7.44 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'EETS1003', 'Manufacturer': 'CleveAid'}\nI am in love with skin care, more than ever in my life now that I in my 50s. I truly wish I started in my earlier years. And the newest & most exciting things in skin care are Korean skin care products. I had heard they were the best so I was excited to see this 2-step product & even more excited to try it. I will admit, I am a bit obsessed with face masks at the moment. I use a mask every day, especially during this pandemic while I am stuck at home & not able to go to a cosmetologist for a facial. I have aged & have dry skin with lots of fine wrinkles appearing around the corners of my eyes and a deep nasolabial fold forming. I am saddened every time Iook at my reflection in the mirror. I absolutely love this 2-step product. I opened one end of the product & applied the small masks to my eyes & around my mouth (4 to a pack) and then applied the whole face mask (step 2) over it all. I left them all on according to the directions and my face felt amazing afterwards. I was so pleased with the way my face felt that I was already looking forward to the next time I used this product. Btw, my face is very sensitive to skin care products & this particular product did not cause me any redness, irritation,  peeling or burning.  I would not hesitate to purchase this product in the future for a regular skin care regiment.\nAwesome product, great results!\nOrganic Vitamin C Serum For Face with Hyaluronic Acid - Luxurious Formula Made with Only Natural Organic Ingredients. For Acne, Wrinkles, Fine Lines, Age Spots, Sun Damage (1 oz)\nBrittanie's Thyme\n{'Skin Type': 'Acne Prone', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': \"Brittanie's Thyme\", 'Item Form': 'Serum', 'Material Feature': 'Organic, Natural', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.96 x 4.57 x 1.5 inches; 1 Ounces', 'UPC': '075363001667'}\nI really wanted to like this product but I wasn't able to get past the strong, chemical scent and thickness/stickiness feel. I have very sensitive skin on my face & I tend to put new products on my hand and/or antecubital area first, just in case. It came very nicely packaged, in a secure box to protect the glass bottle. As soon as I opened it, the thick, sticky liquid dripped all over the bottle and I had to wipe the bottle down with a wipe to prevent it from dripping down the sides of the bottle onto my vanity. I did apply it to the back of my hand & the scent was very off-putting and lingered. It remained very tacky and I would not want to apply make-up on top of it. That being said, I thought I might make it part of my bedtime skin care regiment but I couldn't go to sleep smelling the strong unpleasant scent it emitted. I cannot recommend this product.\nThick, sticky & unpleasant scent.\nEyenjoy False Eyelashes,3D Faux Mink Makeup Fake Eyelashes,Natural Layered Effect Eyelashes,Reusable Fluffy Handmade & Cruelty-Free Lashes,Black\uff084 packs with Tweezers and Eyelash Glue \uff09\nEyenjoy\n{'Product Dimensions': '4.72 x 7.87 x 0.59 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'UPC': '736067423444'}\nIn an attempt to keep up with current make-up trends, I and bound and determined to learn how to apply false eyelashes.
