I also like to wipe off my makeup at the end of the day before cleansing my face with a face wash. These are perfect because they are individually wrapped hence they won't dry out as some of the large packs of wipes do. Also, very convenient for folks who travel because they are small packages that fit perfectly in my travel toiletries bag. The wipes are unscented and contain vitamin E & aloe. There is no residue or tackiness on your skin after use. Each package contains 1 biodegradable bamboo wipe however the directions indicate not to flush them. I like them and will enjoy using them with my other skin care products.\nReview Title: Perfect for your toiletries bag...\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Easydew 2-Step Face Contour Sheet Mask - Tightening & Anti-Aging & Hydrating Korean Face Mask with DW-EGF, Hyaluronic Acid for Anti-Winkle, Reducing Fine Line & Producing Collagen (Qty 5)\nEASYDEW\n{'Brand': 'EASYDEW', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Scent': 'Honey', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'Yes', 'Package Dimensions': '8.35 x 6.38 x 0.63 inches; 7.44 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'EETS1003', 'Manufacturer': 'CleveAid'}\nI am in love with skin care, more than ever in my life now that I in my 50s. I truly wish I started in my earlier years. And the newest & most exciting things in skin care are Korean skin care products. I had heard they were the best so I was excited to see this 2-step product & even more excited to try it. I will admit, I am a bit obsessed with face masks at the moment. I use a mask every day, especially during this pandemic while I am stuck at home & not able to go to a cosmetologist for a facial. I have aged & have dry skin with lots of fine wrinkles appearing around the corners of my eyes and a deep nasolabial fold forming. I am saddened every time Iook at my reflection in the mirror. I absolutely love this 2-step product. I opened one end of the product & applied the small masks to my eyes & around my mouth (4 to a pack) and then applied the whole face mask (step 2) over it all. I left them all on according to the directions and my face felt amazing afterwards. I was so pleased with the way my face felt that I was already looking forward to the next time I used this product. Btw, my face is very sensitive to skin care products & this particular product did not cause me any redness, irritation,  peeling or burning.  I would not hesitate to purchase this product in the future for a regular skin care regiment.\nAwesome product, great results!\nOrganic Vitamin C Serum For Face with Hyaluronic Acid - Luxurious Formula Made with Only Natural Organic Ingredients. For Acne, Wrinkles, Fine Lines, Age Spots, Sun Damage (1 oz)\nBrittanie's Thyme\n{'Skin Type': 'Acne Prone', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': \"Brittanie's Thyme\", 'Item Form': 'Serum', 'Material Feature': 'Organic, Natural', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.96 x 4.57 x 1.5 inches; 1 Ounces', 'UPC': '075363001667'}\nI really wanted to like this product but I wasn't able to get past the strong, chemical scent and thickness/stickiness feel. I have very sensitive skin on my face & I tend to put new products on my hand and/or antecubital area first, just in case. It came very nicely packaged, in a secure box to protect the glass bottle. As soon as I opened it, the thick, sticky liquid dripped all over the bottle and I had to wipe the bottle down with a wipe to prevent it from dripping down the sides of the bottle onto my vanity. I did apply it to the back of my hand & the scent was very off-putting and lingered. It remained very tacky and I would not want to apply make-up on top of it. That being said, I thought I might make it part of my bedtime skin care regiment but I couldn't go to sleep smelling the strong unpleasant scent it emitted. I cannot recommend this product.\nThick, sticky & unpleasant scent.\nEyenjoy False Eyelashes,3D Faux Mink Makeup Fake Eyelashes,Natural Layered Effect Eyelashes,Reusable Fluffy Handmade & Cruelty-Free Lashes,Black\uff084 packs with Tweezers and Eyelash Glue \uff09\nEyenjoy\n{'Product Dimensions': '4.72 x 7.87 x 0.59 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'UPC': '736067423444'}\nIn an attempt to keep up with current make-up trends, I and bound and determined to learn how to apply false eyelashes.  My daughter has put them on for me before and I love the way they make my eyes pop.  However, I cannot tell you how many pairs of lashes I have ruined in my many failed attempts of applying them.  I do not like to spend a lot of money for them while I am in the beginner phase for fear I will ruin them.  I know some cost a lot of money.  These are very affordable, come with several sets of pretty fluffy lashes, a tweezer to apply them and some glue.  My daughter, who is an eye lash guru said they were very good quality and was quite surprised by the great price point.  I am getting better applying them and not ruining as many as I have in the past.  I think a beginner or an experienced person would very much enjoy getting these lashes.\nPretty and very affordable\nAnon Make Up Remover Wipes 100ct | Individually Wrapped Natural Vitamin E and Aloe Vera | Bamboo Mini Makeup Wipes | AirBnB\u2019s Choice for Convenient Single Use Face Wipes | Paraben and Alcohol Free\nOil Slick\n{'Package Dimensions': '8.3 x 8 x 2 inches; 1.1 Pounds', 'UPC': '308136994256'}\nMake-up wipes are very convenient while applying makeup (easy to clean up little mistakes).
