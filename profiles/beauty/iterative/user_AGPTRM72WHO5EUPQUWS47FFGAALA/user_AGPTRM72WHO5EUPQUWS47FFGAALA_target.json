It came beautifully packaged in a tall slender box (which I didn't want to throw away). The component is a peachy colored but clear plastic slender bottle with a plastic shiny gold cap & bottom. The serum has pretty petals floating around in it. The description says, \"delicate vegan petals dissolve on contact,\" however the few pumps that I used had no petals come out with the clear Gel\u00e8e serum.<br /><br />The floral scent was very strong & while it did dissipate a bit after being rubbed on my test spot, it did linger, hence the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. I'm just not a fan of strong fragrances in facial skin care.<br /><br />The serum rubbed in sheer & was quickly absorbed. I used it first on the back of my very dry hands and didn't see much of a difference when compared to my other hand.<br /><br />Despite the beauty of the component, I don't think I will be using it on my face because I just couldn't get past the lingering scent. I will, however, use it on other parts of my body not so near my nose.<br /><br />Unfortunately I would not purchase this in the future but if you like stronger, floral scents, you might love this.\nReview Title: A beauty to look at with a strong floral scent\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Easydew 2-Step Face Contour Sheet Mask - Tightening & Anti-Aging & Hydrating Korean Face Mask with DW-EGF, Hyaluronic Acid for Anti-Winkle, Reducing Fine Line & Producing Collagen (Qty 5)\nEASYDEW\n{'Brand': 'EASYDEW', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Scent': 'Honey', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'Yes', 'Package Dimensions': '8.35 x 6.38 x 0.63 inches; 7.44 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'EETS1003', 'Manufacturer': 'CleveAid'}\nI am in love with skin care, more than ever in my life now that I in my 50s. I truly wish I started in my earlier years. And the newest & most exciting things in skin care are Korean skin care products. I had heard they were the best so I was excited to see this 2-step product & even more excited to try it. I will admit, I am a bit obsessed with face masks at the moment. I use a mask every day, especially during this pandemic while I am stuck at home & not able to go to a cosmetologist for a facial. I have aged & have dry skin with lots of fine wrinkles appearing around the corners of my eyes and a deep nasolabial fold forming. I am saddened every time Iook at my reflection in the mirror. I absolutely love this 2-step product. I opened one end of the product & applied the small masks to my eyes & around my mouth (4 to a pack) and then applied the whole face mask (step 2) over it all. I left them all on according to the directions and my face felt amazing afterwards. I was so pleased with the way my face felt that I was already looking forward to the next time I used this product. Btw, my face is very sensitive to skin care products & this particular product did not cause me any redness, irritation,  peeling or burning.  I would not hesitate to purchase this product in the future for a regular skin care regiment.\nAwesome product, great results!\nOrganic Vitamin C Serum For Face with Hyaluronic Acid - Luxurious Formula Made with Only Natural Organic Ingredients. For Acne, Wrinkles, Fine Lines, Age Spots, Sun Damage (1 oz)\nBrittanie's Thyme\n{'Skin Type': 'Acne Prone', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': \"Brittanie's Thyme\", 'Item Form': 'Serum', 'Material Feature': 'Organic, Natural', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.96 x 4.57 x 1.5 inches; 1 Ounces', 'UPC': '075363001667'}\nI really wanted to like this product but I wasn't able to get past the strong, chemical scent and thickness/stickiness feel. I have very sensitive skin on my face & I tend to put new products on my hand and/or antecubital area first, just in case. It came very nicely packaged, in a secure box to protect the glass bottle. As soon as I opened it, the thick, sticky liquid dripped all over the bottle and I had to wipe the bottle down with a wipe to prevent it from dripping down the sides of the bottle onto my vanity. I did apply it to the back of my hand & the scent was very off-putting and lingered. It remained very tacky and I would not want to apply make-up on top of it. That being said, I thought I might make it part of my bedtime skin care regiment but I couldn't go to sleep smelling the strong unpleasant scent it emitted. I cannot recommend this product.\nThick, sticky & unpleasant scent.\nEyenjoy False Eyelashes,3D Faux Mink Makeup Fake Eyelashes,Natural Layered Effect Eyelashes,Reusable Fluffy Handmade & Cruelty-Free Lashes,Black\uff084 packs with Tweezers and Eyelash Glue \uff09\nEyenjoy\n{'Product Dimensions': '4.72 x 7.87 x 0.59 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'UPC': '736067423444'}\nIn an attempt to keep up with current make-up trends, I and bound and determined to learn how to apply false eyelashes.  My daughter has put them on for me before and I love the way they make my eyes pop.  However, I cannot tell you how many pairs of lashes I have ruined in my many failed attempts of applying them.  I do not like to spend a lot of money for them while I am in the beginner phase for fear I will ruin them.  I know some cost a lot of money.  These are very affordable, come with several sets of pretty fluffy lashes, a tweezer to apply them and some glue.  My daughter, who is an eye lash guru said they were very good quality and was quite surprised by the great price point.  I am getting better applying them and not ruining as many as I have in the past.  I think a beginner or an experienced person would very much enjoy getting these lashes.\nPretty and very affordable\nAnon Make Up Remover Wipes 100ct | Individually Wrapped Natural Vitamin E and Aloe Vera | Bamboo Mini Makeup Wipes | AirBnB\u2019s Choice for Convenient Single Use Face Wipes | Paraben and Alcohol Free\nOil Slick\n{'Package Dimensions': '8.3 x 8 x 2 inches; 1.1 Pounds', 'UPC': '308136994256'}\nMake-up wipes are very convenient while applying makeup (easy to clean up little mistakes). I also like to wipe off my makeup at the end of the day before cleansing my face with a face wash. These are perfect because they are individually wrapped hence they won't dry out as some of the large packs of wipes do. Also, very convenient for folks who travel because they are small packages that fit perfectly in my travel toiletries bag. The wipes are unscented and contain vitamin E & aloe. There is no residue or tackiness on your skin after use. Each package contains 1 biodegradable bamboo wipe however the directions indicate not to flush them. I like them and will enjoy using them with my other skin care products.\nPerfect for your toiletries bag...\nlootaan 500 Pieces False Nails French Acrylic Fake Nails Tips Half Cover Artificial Fake Nails With Box and False Nail Clipper for Women Girl\nlootaan\n{'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'lootaan', 'Number of Pieces': '500', 'Package Dimensions': '9 x 6 x 2 inches; 8.01 Ounces', 'UPC': '710157699223'}\nI am a nail biter of 40+ years. I long to have beautiful nails. And I did, thanks to nail salons prior to the covid19 pandering. Once the pandemic hit I was still reluctant to go to a salon after they opened in limited capacity. I was determining to learn how to do them myself. I mistakenly ordered tips versus whole nails and because of this, these nail tips didn't work for me. That being said,  these tips are of excellent quality if you know how to make them work for you. Highly recommend if you do..\nNail tips are great if you know what to do with them\nMurad Hydration Intense Recovery Cream - Deeply Moisturizes Severely Dry and Stressed Skin - For Face and Eyes, 1.7 Fl Oz\n{'Brand': 'Murad', 'Scent': 'Unscented', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Active Ingredients': 'Vitamin A', 'Unit Count': '1.7 Fl Oz', 'Language': 'English', 'Product Dimensions': '2.91 x 2.91 x 1.69 inches; 7.2 Ounces', 'Item model number': '15293', 'UPC': '767332152936'}\nI became a fan of the Murad brand after receiving different Murad products in my beauty box subscriptions over the past few years. The products I received in the past were high quality and, I feel, superior to other brands that I have tried with similar claims. This intense recovery cream does not disappoint.<br /><br />The thick & luxurious cream comes in a 1.7 ounce frosted glass tub and it is easily applied to my face & neck area. It has a very slight hygienic scent that quickly dissipates after application. The product immediately absorbed & left my skin feeling soothed & hydrated and never tacky or greasy. I have very sensitive skin and the cream caused my face no adverse reactions.<br /><br />Directions indicate to apply it to clean face, neck & chest morning and night. I use a variety of skincare serums depending on the time of day & the current condition of my skin and this cream played nicely with my other skin care products and make-up.<br /><br />Murad claims, \"Now, calm comes in a cream. Murad's Intense Recovery Cream is a clinically proven, comforting cream for face & eyes that reduces visible signs of stress-induced aging and redness. Microalgae extract smooths the look of facial tension and stress lines. Deeply moisturizes even severely dry skin as it relieves visible redness & encourages recovery.\"<br /><br />Ingredients include Shea Butter & Macadamia Oil, Mirabilis Jalapa Plant Extract, Microalgae Extract.<br /><br />Included in this review are pictures of the literature on the box & tub for your review.<br /><br />I am very excited to add this Murad product to my collection of Murad skincare as I know I will enjoy using it as much as I enjoy using the other Murad skincare products I have in my arsenal.<br /><br />Having only used this now for a few days, this is a firstly impression review. I look forward to seeing a reduction in the redness on my face.<br /><br />Highly recommend \u2661\nHigh quality skincare for my aged skin\nSparkling Oxygen Mask, Skin Energizing Treatment with Bubbling Action\nT\u00d3NICA\n{'Brand': 'T\u00d3NICA', 'Product Benefits': 'Oxygenating', 'Scent': 'Oxygen', 'Unit Count': '1.7 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '4.61 x 1.46 x 1.42 inches; 2.89 Ounces'}\nI received 1.7 ounces of product in a plastic pump bottle. The product has a shimmery gold appearance & has a light, very pleasing scent.<br /><br />This product claims the following:  \"this unique effervescent mask delivers the essential benefits of oxygen to energize the skin and brighten dullness, instantly... Perfect to revive and rejuvenate dull, tired skin; it also replenishes moisture to give the skin a plump, dewy appearance.\"<br /><br />I did my usual double cleanse and applied this product as directed by applying a thin layer to damp skin & left it on for 10 minutes. It sort of tickled my face as it began to bubble a little. I am not sure if my face was damp enough or if I didn't use enough product but the bubbly effect eased up & then the product dried a bit. After my time was up, I rinsed my face with warm water & I gently patted my skin dry. Usually this is when I would apply a toner but I wanted to feel my face once it was dry. I was hoping this product would replenish moisture to give my skin a plump & dewy finish. Unfortunately my skin felt tight & dry and left me feeling unimpressed because of this.<br /><br />For the price point & disappointing results, I cannot recommend this product.\nLeft my face feeling tight & dry\nTULA Probiotic Skin Care Supersize 24-7 Moisture Hydrating Day & Night Cream | Holiday 2020, Ageless is the New Anti-Aging, Face Cream, Contains Watermelon Fruit and Blueberry Extract | 3.4 oz\nTULA\n{'Brand': 'TULA', 'Scent': 'Watermelon', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '3.4 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '5.43 x 5.16 x 3.43 inches; 3.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '850014698355'}\nI received either a full size or deluxe sample of a Tula skincare product a few years ago when I got one of my first beauty box subscriptions. After using it, I think, is when I first fell in love with all things skincare! So thanks Tula lol! I was a little shocked at the price of Tula products but years later, after trying lots & lots of other skincare brands, I feel the price point for Tula skincare is worth it.<br /><br />I was very excited to see this \"super-sized\" 3.4 oz tub and I just had to try it. As with the other Tula products I have tried, this did not disappoint. If I could have rated it higher than 5 stars, I would have. It is a thick luxurious cream that glides on your face like silk and is quickly absorbed. It didn't leave my face feeling greasy or tacky,  just soft, hydrated & moisturized. Today is a non-makeup day for me & I am just going to enjoy the way my face feels after using this awesome cream.<br /><br />I will be purchasing this product when it's out, although you only need a little, so I'm assuming this tub will last a long time. I highly recommend this Tula product!\n5+ \ud83c\udf1f - love this luxurious cream\nWinky Lux Orchid Gelee Serum | Skin Brightening Serum | Hydrating Serum with Hyaluronic Acid & Ogliopeptide (30 mL / 1 fl. oz)\nWinky Lux\n{'Skin Type': 'All', 'Product Benefits': 'Anti-Aging', 'Use for': 'Face', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'Winky Lux', 'Package Dimensions': '6.34 x 1.26 x 1.18 inches; 2.89 Ounces', 'UPC': '818324025131'}\nI received 1 oz. of the brand's Orchid Gel\u00e8e Serum.
