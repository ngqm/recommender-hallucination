It doesn\u2019t really have a scent feels like mud. It starts drying quickly and starts flaking which causes a mess. The headband is not luxurious as described, its not soft either. I kept product on 20<br />Mins as it started falling off my face. My skin did feel very hydrated which is a plus. I will use it a few times a week as instructed but not sure I will purchase again.\nReview Title: Application is not great but mask is hydrating\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
