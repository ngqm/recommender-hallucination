Years of coloring has damaged my hair badly so I am very picky what I use on it.<br /><br />Not only is this shampoo organic and not loaded with sulfates and parabens but it has an amazing smell. Almost like a sweet cedar.<br /><br />The shampoo has a medium lather. I used 10 pumps as I have think and mid length hair. I also left the shampoo in my hair for about 2 minutes.<br /><br />After washing my hair was not greasy or heavy from residue. There was definitely a shine but no oily feel.<br /><br />I have oily roots and this shampoo cleaned my hair with easy while leaving it evenly moisturizer.<br /><br />Overall I am very pleased and I definitely will be purchasing again.<br /><br />I was selected to review this item for free.

Produced little to no bubbles and what it did produce dissipated quickly. It does smell amazing.<br />3/5<br />Sugar scrub: Very moisturizing. Not to oily and not to dry. It has the right amount of oils. It left my skin silky smooth but my bathtub slippery.<br />4/5<br />Bath pillow: Very comfortable, had a bit of a strange smell at first I wiped it down with a cleansing wipe. The suction cups do come out but they are easy to reinsert.<br />4/5<br />Soap: Medium lathering it does clean well with no yucky residue.<br />4/5<br /><br />In all this is a decent set. I would like to see the bubble bath revamped. Then I could justify the price. As is I would not pay asking price as I could buy a better quality set for the same price.<br /><br />I was offered a discount to review this item. I paid 10$ out of pocket for this item.
