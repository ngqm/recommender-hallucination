Years of coloring has damaged my hair badly so I am very picky what I use on it.<br /><br />Not only is this shampoo organic and not loaded with sulfates and parabens but it has an amazing smell. Almost like a sweet cedar.<br /><br />The shampoo has a medium lather. I used 10 pumps as I have think and mid length hair. I also left the shampoo in my hair for about 2 minutes.<br /><br />After washing my hair was not greasy or heavy from residue. There was definitely a shine but no oily feel.<br /><br />I have oily roots and this shampoo cleaned my hair with easy while leaving it evenly moisturizer.<br /><br />Overall I am very pleased and I definitely will be purchasing again.<br /><br />I was selected to review this item for free.

Produced little to no bubbles and what it did produce dissipated quickly. It does smell amazing.<br />3/5<br />Sugar scrub: Very moisturizing. Not to oily and not to dry. It has the right amount of oils. It left my skin silky smooth but my bathtub slippery.<br />4/5<br />Bath pillow: Very comfortable, had a bit of a strange smell at first I wiped it down with a cleansing wipe. The suction cups do come out but they are easy to reinsert.<br />4/5<br />Soap: Medium lathering it does clean well with no yucky residue.<br />4/5<br /><br />In all this is a decent set. I would like to see the bubble bath revamped. Then I could justify the price. As is I would not pay asking price as I could buy a better quality set for the same price.<br /><br />I was offered a discount to review this item. I paid 10$ out of pocket for this item.

I am always on the lookout for the best products.<br /><br />This brush is definitely a must have. It has several attachments that keep your skin in is best shape.<br /><br />I tan in the summer mostly sunless but I also get a natural base tan. Before and after exfoliation is key to keeping a natural looking tan. In the video I am in a bathing suit (wanted to make that clear) and I am preparing to exfoliate before I go to the beach. With this brush you have a body brush, a facial brush, a pumice stone and a facial sponge.<br /><br />The body brush is great for legs and arms and even backs. The facial brush is Ye best way to deep clean all the makeup residue and grime from your face. The pumice stone is perfect for elbows, knees, ankles and fee. Lastly the sponge is an added bonus for serums and creams.<br /><br />My only complaint is the need for so many batteries. Other than that definitely a great brush set to have!<br /><br />I was selected to review this item at a discount.

I'm a rock collector and I am all about beauty so this definitely peaked my interest!<br /><br />I've been using this for about a week and honestly I haven't seen an improvement in my complexion or anything fancy but this is awesome to use before applying makeup. It seems to grab the makeup and hold it on longer. Weird I know it isn't the intended use but it works! I also use it after I've done my make up to set it. If you compare ingredients to most setting spray that is all natural they are almost identical.<br /><br />The smell is light and flowery. Definitely has a scent of Rose with a bit of a witch hazel after scent.<br /><br />The spray itself is medium mist and covers the entire face with one burst. It's very light and absorbs quickly.<br /><br />This is a nice hydrating mist that has a multitude of uses and I would definitely recommend it.<br /><br />I was selected to review this item at a discount.
