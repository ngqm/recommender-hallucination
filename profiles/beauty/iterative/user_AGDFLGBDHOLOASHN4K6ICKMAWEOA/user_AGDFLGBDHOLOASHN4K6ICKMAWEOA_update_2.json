Produced little to no bubbles and what it did produce dissipated quickly. It does smell amazing.<br />3/5<br />Sugar scrub: Very moisturizing. Not to oily and not to dry. It has the right amount of oils. It left my skin silky smooth but my bathtub slippery.<br />4/5<br />Bath pillow: Very comfortable, had a bit of a strange smell at first I wiped it down with a cleansing wipe. The suction cups do come out but they are easy to reinsert.<br />4/5<br />Soap: Medium lathering it does clean well with no yucky residue.<br />4/5<br /><br />In all this is a decent set. I would like to see the bubble bath revamped. Then I could justify the price. As is I would not pay asking price as I could buy a better quality set for the same price.<br /><br />I was offered a discount to review this item. I paid 10$ out of pocket for this item. My reviews are based on quality and preformance and are never manipulated in any way.\nReview Title: This has two of my favorite things, blackberries and organic ingredients\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
