He finds that this kit is helpful because there are a variety of tools that address most skin issues. He also likes there is a kit that holds all of the tools which means that he can keep them together and doesn't have to look for them when needed.  And finally, this kit was affordable and even more reasonable than some that I have seen in several discount stores.\nReview Title: Just what he needed.\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Transdermal vitamin C powder for anti-aging and skin rejuvenation. Highly potent Vitamin C complex helps brighten, and minimize fine lines and wrinkles through collagen synthesis, making your skin bright, nourished and glowing with natural radiance.']\n{'Brand': 'Vitabrid', 'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Finish Type': 'Natural', 'Skin Type': 'Combination', 'Product Benefits': 'Brightening', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '5.1 x 2.6 x 1.5 inches; 2.72 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Hyundai IBT Co., Ltd'}\nThis is perhaps one of the most difficult reviews that I have written in a while. Usually I know immediately if the product is a hit or miss, but Vitabrid C12 is different. I can\u2019t decide. I\u2019m torn. After using VC12 for about 3 weeks, I am still unsure of the results.<br /><br />The concept: Vitamin C is slow released thru the skin by mixing a small amount of VC12, with water or a moisturizer, onto the face and neck. The results, brighter, smoother and firmer skin. The powder comes in a convenient small bottle (about the length of your thumb) with a small spoon (used for measuring). Simply mix the appropriate amount - I use about 2 spoonfuls since I put it on my face and neck- with a lightweight moisturizer. I didn\u2019t notice any tightness, irritation or itching after I applied this to my skin (i.e., face and neck). I simply apply my makeup as usual. With that being said, I haven\u2019t noticed anything bad either -no additional breakouts and no nasty white film (left on my face from bad blending). But I also haven\u2019t looked in the mirror and said \u201cwow\u201d or \u201cgosh, this is like a facelift in a bottle moment\u201d.  Not to mention that this product takes a little more effort than my usual skincare regime. I am not use to mixing products before I use them. **Therefore, I am going to give this product 3 stars BUT continue to use it for a little longer to see if I am wowed. After all each container is believed to last about 3 months. If I notice something earth shattering in the next month or so, I will amend my review. Otherwise, this review will stand.\nUndecided still.\nBlack Mask Peel Off Mask Purifying Blackhead Remover Mask Deep Pore Cleansing Activated Charcoal Mask for Face Nose, Acne Treatment Oil Control\nReve Beauty\n[\"Specifications: Mask Color: Black Gender: Unisex Type: Remove blackhead mask Fit for: All types of skin.
