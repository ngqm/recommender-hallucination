You get 18 brushes in different shapes and sizes. You get everything from a foundation brush, to one that you can apply eyeshadow with. They (black) handles are easy to hold and use. The bristles are made of animal hair.  So, far I haven\u2019t noticed any shedding. Everyone knows that you should change out your brushes every once in a while. So, give these a chance. Did I mention, this set is inexpensive, under $21 on Amazon.\nReview Title: Time to change out my brushes.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Vitabrid C12 Vitamin C face brightening powder - 12hours Transdermal, the Best professional Vitamin C complex and LDH help brighten and minimize fine lines/wrinkles through collagen synthesis\nLUBEX\n['State-of-the art 12-hour Transdermal Vitamin C powder for your face! Transdermal vitamin C powder for anti-aging and skin rejuvenation. Highly potent Vitamin C complex helps brighten, and minimize fine lines and wrinkles through collagen synthesis, making your skin bright, nourished and glowing with natural radiance.']\n{'Brand': 'Vitabrid', 'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Finish Type': 'Natural', 'Skin Type': 'Combination', 'Product Benefits': 'Brightening', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '5.1 x 2.6 x 1.5 inches; 2.72 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Hyundai IBT Co., Ltd'}\nThis is perhaps one of the most difficult reviews that I have written in a while. Usually I know immediately if the product is a hit or miss, but Vitabrid C12 is different. I can\u2019t decide. I\u2019m torn. After using VC12 for about 3 weeks, I am still unsure of the results.<br /><br />The concept: Vitamin C is slow released thru the skin by mixing a small amount of VC12, with water or a moisturizer, onto the face and neck. The results, brighter, smoother and firmer skin. The powder comes in a convenient small bottle (about the length of your thumb) with a small spoon (used for measuring). Simply mix the appropriate amount - I use about 2 spoonfuls since I put it on my face and neck- with a lightweight moisturizer. I didn\u2019t notice any tightness, irritation or itching after I applied this to my skin (i.e., face and neck). I simply apply my makeup as usual. With that being said, I haven\u2019t noticed anything bad either -no additional breakouts and no nasty white film (left on my face from bad blending). But I also haven\u2019t looked in the mirror and said \u201cwow\u201d or \u201cgosh, this is like a facelift in a bottle moment\u201d.  Not to mention that this product takes a little more effort than my usual skincare regime. I am not use to mixing products before I use them. **Therefore, I am going to give this product 3 stars BUT continue to use it for a little longer to see if I am wowed. After all each container is believed to last about 3 months. If I notice something earth shattering in the next month or so, I will amend my review. Otherwise, this review will stand.\nUndecided still.\nBlack Mask Peel Off Mask Purifying Blackhead Remover Mask Deep Pore Cleansing Activated Charcoal Mask for Face Nose, Acne Treatment Oil Control\nReve Beauty\n[\"Specifications: Mask Color: Black Gender: Unisex Type: Remove blackhead mask Fit for: All types of skin.

He finds that this kit is helpful because there are a variety of tools that address most skin issues. He also likes there is a kit that holds all of the tools which means that he can keep them together and doesn't have to look for them when needed.  And finally, this kit was affordable and even more reasonable than some that I have seen in several discount stores.\nJust what he needed.\nLaClaire Acne Wash with Salicylic Acid & Tea Tree Oil - Face Cleanser for Acne-Prone Skin (50 ml/1.65 oz)\nLaClaire\n{'Item Form': 'Oil, Foam', 'Skin Type': 'Oily, Combination, Dry, Normal', 'Brand': 'LaClaire', 'Scent': 'Tea Tree', 'Material Feature': 'Antibacterial', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '5.5 x 2.75 x 1.63 inches; 9.14 Ounces', 'UPC': '891040000705', 'Manufacturer': 'LaClaire'}\nLaClaire (Beverly Hills) Clarifying Cleanser is a delight on the skin. Simply add a dime sized amount, with a little water and distribute on your face with your hands (or if you prefer a loofah). The small (1.6 ounce) pump bottle is simple to use and doesn\u2019t take up too much space in the cabinet or on the counter. There are some pretty nice ingredients that include tea tree oil, salicylic acid and aloe. I\u2019ve used the product for a few days now and have not noticed any dryness or irritation. Nor have I noticed any redness or rashes. The scent of the cleanser is not strong (smells like tea tree oil) and does not linger long. And finally, what I like the most? This company has made a product in a bottle that is reusable. I really like companies who have a philosophy to reduce their impact on the world. Being socially aware of how their products can affect the environment and actively doing something about it is a company that I can support. You can reuse the bottle and add liquid soap or other things.\nLeaves your skin feeling cool and refreshed.\nFuller Brush Styling Professional Hairbrush - Everyday Hair Styling Tool - Combination Boar and Nylon Bristles Gently Brush Hair while Styling Smoothing and Removing Tangles Dirt Flakes and Oil\nFuller Brush\n{'Brand': 'Fuller Brush', 'Shape': 'Rectangular', 'Handle Material': 'Plastic', 'Product Benefits': 'Smoothing', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '8.98 x 2.6 x 1.81 inches; 1.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '083701005291'}\nClearly Amazon has mis-priced this brush. $50, for a plastic handled brush and firm bristles? First, I am ok with the plastic handle. It is easy to grip and hold. And since it is plastic, you don\u2019t have to worry about it looking faded after several washes (I do clean mine) like you do with the wooden ones. I\u2019m even ok with the firm bristles (nylon and boar), because I have coarse hair and I\u2019m not tender headed.  I like that it smooths the hair easily.  What I don\u2019t like is the PRICE. I can\u2019t believe they expect people to pay $49 for this brush. Yikes! And the sad thing is that it didn\u2019t even come in pretty packaging. Just in a simple white box. So, while I am sure I will use this brush, I can\u2019t get over the price. 2 stars\n$50 for a plastic brush?\nikoo Deep Caring Hair Mask, Hydrate & Shine, Great for Normal, Dry or Lackluster Hair, All Natural Ingredients, Effectively Hydrates, Moisturizes & Adds Shine - 6.8 Fl Oz\nikoo\n{'Brand': 'Ikoo', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Material Feature': 'Natural, Cruelty Free, Vegan', 'Hair Type': 'Dry,Normal', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '3.74 x 3.74 x 3.15 inches; 11.68 Ounces'}\nThe Ikoo Infusions hair mask was surprisingly great. It is moisturizing, hydrating and nourishing. This product comes in a round (6.8 oz) container. The thick (light green) cream smells refreshing and bright.  Some of the ingredients are macadamia oil, honey extract and camellia oil. It is non-greasy but does leave a slight shine. This product is cruelty, vegan, sulfate and paraffin free (Peta approved since that is important for some consumers). I have coarse, sometimes dry hair, that after using this product made it more manageable after just one treatment. I used it as a deep conditioning treatment. It left my scalp and hair feeling refreshed and clean. I\u2019d recommend it.\nMoisturizing and hydrating.\nFragrantshare Makeup Brush Set 18pcs Travel Makeup Brushes [Horse Hair Hand Brush] with Blush, Eye Shadow, Eye Liner, Highlighter, Eyebrow, Eyelash, Foundation Brush - Black\nFragrantShare\n{'Brand': 'FragrantShare', 'Color': 'Black', 'Material': 'Animal Hair', 'Item Form': 'Wand', 'Number of Pieces': '18', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Ferrule Material': 'Aluminum', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '10 x 7 x 1.7 inches; 11.22 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'PRO-18', 'UPC': '633690926659'}\nI like that this set (Fragrantshare) contains a variety of (make-up) brushes.
