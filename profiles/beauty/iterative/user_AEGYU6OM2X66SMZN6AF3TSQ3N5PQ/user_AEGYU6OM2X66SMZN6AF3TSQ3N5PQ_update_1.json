Usually I know immediately if the product is a hit or miss, but Vitabrid C12 is different. I can\u2019t decide. I\u2019m torn. After using VC12 for about 3 weeks, I am still unsure of the results.<br /><br />The concept: Vitamin C is slow released thru the skin by mixing a small amount of VC12, with water or a moisturizer, onto the face and neck. The results, brighter, smoother and firmer skin. The powder comes in a convenient small bottle (about the length of your thumb) with a small spoon (used for measuring). Simply mix the appropriate amount - I use about 2 spoonfuls since I put it on my face and neck- with a lightweight moisturizer. I didn\u2019t notice any tightness, irritation or itching after I applied this to my skin (i.e., face and neck). I simply apply my makeup as usual. With that being said, I haven\u2019t noticed anything bad either -no additional breakouts and no nasty white film (left on my face from bad blending). But I also haven\u2019t looked in the mirror and said \u201cwow\u201d or \u201cgosh, this is like a facelift in a bottle moment\u201d.  Not to mention that this product takes a little more effort than my usual skincare regime. I am not use to mixing products before I use them. **Therefore, I am going to give this product 3 stars BUT continue to use it for a little longer to see if I am wowed. After all each container is believed to last about 3 months. If I notice something earth shattering in the next month or so, I will amend my review. Otherwise, this review will stand.\nReview Title: Undecided still.\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
