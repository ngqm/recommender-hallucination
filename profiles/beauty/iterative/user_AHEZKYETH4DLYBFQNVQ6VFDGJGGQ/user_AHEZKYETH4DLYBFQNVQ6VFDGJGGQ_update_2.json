The material is good and the band fits my small head well. If your head was on the larger side, they'd stretch but might feel tight behind the ears. They're durable and will keep my hair in place.\nReview Title: Small but cute\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

They smell great and are very versatile. Mix them with your favorite oil (I like coconut) and apply topically or add a few drops to a diffuser for a peaceful night sleep. I recently had a cold and mixed the peppermint and coconut oil and applied to my chest for a cough. It was soothing and helped with the sinuses as well. Makes a great gift because it comes in a cute little box as well.\nNice starter kit\nFolora 4pcs Premium 1 Inch Wide Solid Color Floral Plaid Headband Set for Women Girls, Pink\nFolora\n{'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Occasion': 'Wedding, Birthday', 'Material': 'Plastic', 'Number of Items': '4', 'Brand': 'Folora', 'Product Dimensions': '4.72 x 0.98 x 5.51 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'FLR-HB-4pcs Pink'}\nI ordered the pink headband set and these are really cute styles.
