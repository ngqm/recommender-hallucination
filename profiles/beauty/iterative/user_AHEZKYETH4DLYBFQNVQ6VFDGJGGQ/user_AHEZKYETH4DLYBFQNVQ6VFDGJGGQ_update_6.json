The little nubs are longer and feel more pointed but these work at giving your skin a little extra scrubbing without injuring the skin. Easy to clean and should be easy to keep clean. Would also work at cleaning your makeup brushes.\nReview Title: Good face scrubber\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Bloomy Essentials Top 3 Organic Essential Oils Starter Set 10 mL (1/3 oz) - USDA Certified Organic - 100% Pure Lavender, Lemon and Peppermint\nBloomy Essentials\n{'Brand': 'Bloomy Essentials', 'Scent': 'Lemon,Peppermint,Lavender', 'Special Feature': 'Pure', 'Seasons': 'All Seasons', 'Item Volume': '10 Milliliters', 'Package Dimensions': '3.8 x 3.6 x 1.2 inches; 6.38 Ounces', 'UPC': '680912084567', 'Manufacturer': 'Bloomy Essentials'}\nI use essential oils for many purposes and this 3 piece set is a great starter kit for those who love lavender, lemon and peppermint. They smell great and are very versatile. Mix them with your favorite oil (I like coconut) and apply topically or add a few drops to a diffuser for a peaceful night sleep. I recently had a cold and mixed the peppermint and coconut oil and applied to my chest for a cough. It was soothing and helped with the sinuses as well. Makes a great gift because it comes in a cute little box as well.\nNice starter kit\nFolora 4pcs Premium 1 Inch Wide Solid Color Floral Plaid Headband Set for Women Girls, Pink\nFolora\n{'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Occasion': 'Wedding, Birthday', 'Material': 'Plastic', 'Number of Items': '4', 'Brand': 'Folora', 'Product Dimensions': '4.72 x 0.98 x 5.51 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'FLR-HB-4pcs Pink'}\nI ordered the pink headband set and these are really cute styles. The material is good and the band fits my small head well. If your head was on the larger side, they'd stretch but might feel tight behind the ears. They're durable and will keep my hair in place.\nSmall but cute\nDROP THE BOMB Bbosong Sun Stick SPF50+ PA++++ 15g - Oil Free UVA/UVB Protection Sebum Control Skin Smooth Moisturizing Sunblock Stick Balm without Sticky, Primer before Makeup\nDROP THE BOMB\n{'Sun Protection': '50 SPF', 'Item Weight': '15 Grams', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Brand': 'DROP THE BOMB', 'Package Dimensions': '3.5 x 1.7 x 1.1 inches; 0.53 Ounces'}\nI was not able to use this product as intended since it was in several pieces when it arrived. I liked that it was spf50 to protect the skin on my face but unfortunately, I can't use it.\nBroken in pieces\nGrinding Away Skin Polishing Scrub, 3 fl. oz., Polishing Scrub Works to Improve Skin's Texture and Tone by Buffing Away Dead Skin Cells by Higher Education Skincare\nHigher Education\n{'Brand': 'Higher Education', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Product Benefits': 'Smoother', 'Material Feature': 'Gluten Free, Cruelty Free', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.59 x 3.58 x 1.61 inches; 3 Ounces', 'UPC': '811381031008'}\nI need a good face scrub to clean out the pores but it needs to be gentle at the same time to not inflame my skin. This scrub didn't really irritate my skin but the granules in the scrub are very rough. I found it to be more so than other scrubs I've used. Thankfully, it didn't irritate my skin. I just had to be extra gentle. That said, my skin was smooth again so it does work.\nInteresting texture\n[the SAEM] Derma Plan Cleansing Bubble Pad 15pcs - One Step Gentle Makeup Cleansing Wipes Produce Fine & Dense Bubbles, Hypoallergenic Formula, Pore Clean, Mild Exfoliation\nTHESAEM\n{'Brand': 'THESAEM', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Unit Count': '15.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '3.9 x 3.9 x 1.8 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nGreat if you're heading out for a trip. There's 15 pads in a little container so makes it easy to use. The pads clean well and are gentle to use. One step cleaning and easy to tote with you to the gym, plane or wherever you need a clean up.\nSmall travel pack\nFacial Cleansing Brush made with Ultra Hygienic Soft Silicone 4-PACK\nHAMUULL\n{'Product Dimensions': '2.76 x 1.97 x 0.08 inches; 0.32 Ounces', 'UPC': '779683799654', 'Manufacturer': 'HAMUULL'}\nThese silicone face scrubbers are a little bigger than others I've used but it helps cover my area on my face when cleaning.
