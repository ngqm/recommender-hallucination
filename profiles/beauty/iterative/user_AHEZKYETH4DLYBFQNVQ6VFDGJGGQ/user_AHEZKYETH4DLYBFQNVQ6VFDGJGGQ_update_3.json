  "reference_summary": "Bloomy Essentials Top 3 Organic Essential Oils Starter Set 10 mL (1/3 oz) - USDA Certified Organic - 100% Pure Lavender, Lemon and Peppermint\nBloomy Essentials\n{'Brand': 'Bloomy Essentials', 'Scent': 'Lemon,Peppermint,Lavender', 'Special Feature': 'Pure', 'Seasons': 'All Seasons', 'Item Volume': '10 Milliliters', 'Package Dimensions': '3.8 x 3.6 x 1.2 inches; 6.38 Ounces', 'UPC': '680912084567', 'Manufacturer': 'Bloomy Essentials'}\nI use essential oils for many purposes and this 3 piece set is a great starter kit for those who love lavender, lemon and peppermint. They smell great and are very versatile. Mix them with your favorite oil (I like coconut) and apply topically or add a few drops to a diffuser for a peaceful night sleep. I recently had a cold and mixed the peppermint and coconut oil and applied to my chest for a cough. It was soothing and helped with the sinuses as well. Makes a great gift because it comes in a cute little box as well.\nNice starter kit\nFolora 4pcs Premium 1 Inch Wide Solid Color Floral Plaid Headband Set for Women Girls, Pink\nFolora\n{'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Occasion': 'Wedding, Birthday', 'Material': 'Plastic', 'Number of Items': '4', 'Brand': 'Folora', 'Product Dimensions': '4.72 x 0.98 x 5.51 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'FLR-HB-4pcs Pink'}\nI ordered the pink headband set and these are really cute styles. The material is good and the band fits my small head well. If your head was on the larger side, they'd stretch but might feel tight behind the ears. They're durable and will keep my hair in place.\nSmall but cute\nDROP THE BOMB Bbosong Sun Stick SPF50+ PA++++ 15g - Oil Free UVA/UVB Protection Sebum Control Skin Smooth Moisturizing Sunblock Stick Balm without Sticky, Primer before Makeup\nDROP THE BOMB\n{'Sun Protection': '50 SPF', 'Item Weight': '15 Grams', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Brand': 'DROP THE BOMB', 'Package Dimensions': '3.5 x 1.7 x 1.1 inches; 0.53 Ounces'}\nI was not able to use this product as intended since it was in several pieces when it arrived.
