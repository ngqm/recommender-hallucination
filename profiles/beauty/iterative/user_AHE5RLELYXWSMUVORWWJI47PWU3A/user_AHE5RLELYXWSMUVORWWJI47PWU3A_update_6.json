I only wish I had the original versions to compare. I've only heard negative things about the original stamping polishes from BM so I don't own any, I've only used MdU. But when BM reformulated their stamping polishes I gave them a try and I now own all the new collections so I gave these a try too. Boy am I glad I did. These DID NOT DISAPPOINT! I don't own white stamping polish, I use Sinful Colors Snow Me White that has been open for 3 days, it works but it's still not proper stamping polish. The black I use is MdU, the absolute holy grail of stamping polishes. But I have to say that these are beyond good! This black is comparable to MdU black in every way, except the smell. These have just become my favorite! I don't think I will be ordering from anyone else anymore.\nReview Title: Great stamping polishes!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Murray & Lanman Florida Water Plastic Bottle 7.5 oz\nMurray & Lanman\n['The enduring popularity of world-famous Florida Water is due to its wonderful light floral scent with lemon overtones. Unchanged since 1808, this revitalizing scent is used as an invigorating splash, aftershave, or fragrant addition to the bath. For more than 200 years men and women have loved the Florida Water scent, named for the Fountain of Youth.']\n{'Brand': 'Murray & Lanman', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Item Volume': '221 Milliliters', 'Scent': 'Florida Water', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '3 x 2 x 1 inches; 7.8 Ounces', 'Item model number': '0076690000149', 'Department': 'Health & Beauty', 'UPC': '076690000149 885662210413', 'Manufacturer': 'Atlas Ethnic'}\nIf you like bay rum, then you'll like Florida Water. If you don't like bay rum after a hot shave then something is wrong with you. Turn in your man card immediately.\nYou either love it or hate it\nCICI&SISI Nail Stamping Stamping Plate Set Jumbo 5-Set of 6 JUMBO Nail Art Konad Polish Stamping Manicure Accessories Kit All New Designs with FREE STAMPER & SCRAPER TOOLS SET\n{'Package Dimensions': '8.9 x 5.75 x 1.26 inches; 1.2 Pounds'}\nIdeas are limitless with the buffet sections on the three plates. Like the other sets it's difficult to get a clean scrape on some of the corner images. But I do think it helps if you have a very flexible scraper, which I don't.\nLike the other sets it's difficult to get a clean ...\nSupernail China Silk Wrap, 72 Inch\nSuperNail\n['Supernail china silk wrap is made from 100% pure silk that provides added strength and protection.']\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2 x 4 x 5 inches; 0.63 Ounces', 'Item model number': '51010', 'UPC': '073930510109', 'Manufacturer': 'Supernail'}\nThis is my first time using plain silk wrap and I love it!  I started using the self adhesive silk tabs to fix cracks and they worked great so I wrapped all my nails but I had to keep buying them. So I upgraded to this. I'm so glad I did. Yes it takes longer to do my nails now but it's so totally worth it. I wrap my nails every week or so and there's still so much of it left! I will not buy anything else, EVER!\nLove this stuff!\nCICI&SISI Acrylic Nail Art Stamping Plates Set Jumbo 6- Set of 6 Pieces JUMBO Nail Polish Stamping Manicure Kit\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '8 x 7 x 2 inches; 1.1 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'JB1', 'UPC': '710824498753'}\n&#34;Jeff's Wife&#34;-  Great plates and images that stamp beautifully, as always from Cici & Sisi. I do have two issues. One is that four of the six sleeves are cracked in the corners, like it's old, dried out plastic but I guess it's nothing that some packing tape can't fix. I've never had this issue with the other five sets from them. The other issue is the holder feels a bit more foam like instead of the pleather like the previous ones. But those issues have absolutely nothing to do the stamping ability of the images which, in the end, is the most important thing!\nAnother great set of images!\nLumaRx Facial Cleansing Brush with 1-Minute Pulsing Timer and LED Speed Indicator Light, Rechargeable and Showerproof, White/Silver\n{'Material': 'Silver', 'Brand': 'LumaRx', 'Color': 'White/Silver', 'Power Source': 'electric', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '3.88 x 7 x 10 inches', 'Product Dimensions': '3.88 x 7 x 10 inches; 5.6 Ounces', 'Item model number': '1', 'UPC': '074590543216', 'Manufacturer': 'LumaRx'}\nWell built and compact. The charger base works well.<br /><br />So far the 'waterproofness' has endured splashes, but don't dare try to dump it in a tub of water.<br /><br />The brushes work well and are replaceable. They should be available on Amazon.<br /><br />The case is a cool and shiny white patent leather.\nWell built and compact\nLOVATIC Teeth Whitening Pen - 2 Packs - Advance Teeth Whitening Solution - 35% Carbamide Peroxide - Safe, Convenient and Effective\nLOVATIC\n{'Product Dimensions': '1.1 x 1.1 x 2.6 inches; 4 Ounces', 'UPC': '780150949359'}\n&#34;Jeff's Wife&#34;- These are so good!
