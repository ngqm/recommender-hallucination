  "reference_summary": "Murray & Lanman Florida Water Plastic Bottle 7.5 oz\nMurray & Lanman\n['The enduring popularity of world-famous Florida Water is due to its wonderful light floral scent with lemon overtones. Unchanged since 1808, this revitalizing scent is used as an invigorating splash, aftershave, or fragrant addition to the bath. For more than 200 years men and women have loved the Florida Water scent, named for the Fountain of Youth.']\n{'Brand': 'Murray & Lanman', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Item Volume': '221 Milliliters', 'Scent': 'Florida Water', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '3 x 2 x 1 inches; 7.8 Ounces', 'Item model number': '0076690000149', 'Department': 'Health & Beauty', 'UPC': '076690000149 885662210413', 'Manufacturer': 'Atlas Ethnic'}\nIf you like bay rum, then you'll like Florida Water. If you don't like bay rum after a hot shave then something is wrong with you. Turn in your man card immediately.\nYou either love it or hate it\nCICI&SISI Nail Stamping Stamping Plate Set Jumbo 5-Set of 6 JUMBO Nail Art Konad Polish Stamping Manicure Accessories Kit All New Designs with FREE STAMPER & SCRAPER TOOLS SET\n{'Package Dimensions': '8.9 x 5.75 x 1.26 inches; 1.2 Pounds'}\nIdeas are limitless with the buffet sections on the three plates. Like the other sets it's difficult to get a clean scrape on some of the corner images. But I do think it helps if you have a very flexible scraper, which I don't.\nLike the other sets it's difficult to get a clean ...\nSupernail China Silk Wrap, 72 Inch\nSuperNail\n['Supernail china silk wrap is made from 100% pure silk that provides added strength and protection.']\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2 x 4 x 5 inches; 0.63 Ounces', 'Item model number': '51010', 'UPC': '073930510109', 'Manufacturer': 'Supernail'}\nThis is my first time using plain silk wrap and I love it!  I started using the self adhesive silk tabs to fix cracks and they worked great so I wrapped all my nails but I had to keep buying them. So I upgraded to this. I'm so glad I did. Yes it takes longer to do my nails now but it's so totally worth it. I wrap my nails every week or so and there's still so much of it left! I will not buy anything else, EVER!\nLove this stuff!\nCICI&SISI Acrylic Nail Art Stamping Plates Set Jumbo 6- Set of 6 Pieces JUMBO Nail Polish Stamping Manicure Kit\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '8 x 7 x 2 inches; 1.1 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'JB1', 'UPC': '710824498753'}\n&#34;Jeff's Wife&#34;-  Great plates and images that stamp beautifully, as always from Cici & Sisi. I do have two issues. One is that four of the six sleeves are cracked in the corners, like it's old, dried out plastic but I guess it's nothing that some packing tape can't fix. I've never had this issue with the other five sets from them. The other issue is the holder feels a bit more foam like instead of the pleather like the previous ones. But those issues have absolutely nothing to do the stamping ability of the images which, in the end, is the most important thing!\nAnother great set of images!\nLumaRx Facial Cleansing Brush with 1-Minute Pulsing Timer and LED Speed Indicator Light, Rechargeable and Showerproof, White/Silver\n{'Material': 'Silver', 'Brand': 'LumaRx', 'Color': 'White/Silver', 'Power Source': 'electric', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '3.88 x 7 x 10 inches', 'Product Dimensions': '3.88 x 7 x 10 inches; 5.6 Ounces', 'Item model number': '1', 'UPC': '074590543216', 'Manufacturer': 'LumaRx'}\nWell built and compact. The charger base works well.<br /><br />So far the 'waterproofness' has endured splashes, but don't dare try to dump it in a tub of water.<br /><br />The brushes work well and are replaceable. They should be available on Amazon.<br /><br />The case is a cool and shiny white patent leather.\nWell built and compact\nLOVATIC Teeth Whitening Pen - 2 Packs - Advance Teeth Whitening Solution - 35% Carbamide Peroxide - Safe, Convenient and Effective\nLOVATIC\n{'Product Dimensions': '1.1 x 1.1 x 2.6 inches; 4 Ounces', 'UPC': '780150949359'}\n&#34;Jeff's Wife&#34;- These are so good! I only wish I had the original versions to compare. I've only heard negative things about the original stamping polishes from BM so I don't own any, I've only used MdU. But when BM reformulated their stamping polishes I gave them a try and I now own all the new collections so I gave these a try too. Boy am I glad I did. These DID NOT DISAPPOINT! I don't own white stamping polish, I use Sinful Colors Snow Me White that has been open for 3 days, it works but it's still not proper stamping polish. The black I use is MdU, the absolute holy grail of stamping polishes. But I have to say that these are beyond good! This black is comparable to MdU black in every way, except the smell. These have just become my favorite! I don't think I will be ordering from anyone else anymore.\nGreat stamping polishes!\nLiquid Latex Fashions Metallic Silver Latex Body Paint for Adults and Kids, Zombie Skin Makeup, Ideal for Art, Parties and Cosplay, Super Flexible- 4 Oz\nLiquid Latex Fashions\n{'Color': 'Metallic Silver', 'Brand': 'Liquid Latex Fashions', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Package Information': 'Bottle', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '3 x 3 x 3 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': '010583', 'UPC': '811832010583', 'Manufacturer': 'Liquid Latex Fashions'}\n&quot;Jeff's Wife&quot; - This is not true to color, it dries quite a bit darker, as you can see from the pic, but since I only use it for nail art I don't care but some of you might. I bought the pink back in Feb. 2015, still using it just got tired of the color, and this one seems slightly less opaque but maybe it's because that one is pink on pale skin but a second coat fixes the opacity, (only 1 coat in the pic). It may leave a few specks of the shimmer on your skin when you peel it off but they wipe away effortlessly.<br /><br />If you're new to nail art and want to use this for that, I do suggest you transfer some to an empty polish bottle (cleaned with acetone or brand new doesn't matter) using a syringe with some sort of tip, an eye dropper or even a straw, this will keep the large bottle from drying out. This 4 oz bottle will last you a very long time, I still have about half the bottle I bought in Feb. 2015, and costs a fraction of the price as those other brands marketed specifically for nail art.\nGood for Nail Art\nNail Art Stamp Stamping Templates Stamping Tool Set 2.8cm Clear Silicone Stamper Scraper Stamping Plate Guide Template 6PCS\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.1 x 4.61 x 1.1 inches; 7.2 Ounces'}\n&#34;Jeff's Wife&#34; - I got these when they were an Add-On Item for $3.99, definitely worth the price. The stamper works great, I didn't even wash it first (even though you should always wash new stampers before first use), and it's slightly (I do mean slightly) softer then other clear stampers I own.<br /><br />If you're new to stamping or not familiar with clear stampers, they are more delicate than opaque ones and tear easily, so be gentle with it. Wash it with dish soap & warm water, dry with a paper towel and clean it with a lint roller or tape. Never buff it or use acetone, you'll make it cloudy defeating the purpose of a clear stamper. When picking up, ROLL GENTLY over the image if you apply too much pressure it won't pick up. When applying the image to the nail press straight down (again, with GENTLE pressure) and rock side to side or roll from side to side. Don't push the tip of the nail into it, it will tear.<br /><br />All the plates stamp great, I didn't swatch every image, although plates 29 & 41 have shallow etching (in my experience this is normal for BP plates) so the thinner scraper is a nice addition. It's not as thin as the 0.5mm and not a thick as the 1mm ones I own, I'd say it's 0.75mm (I didn't get out the calipers). There are different size images, a little for every nail size. But I do wish the water marble designs were bigger, I'm not a Water Marble Witch yet. Plate 52 is great for lead lighting or Sharpie water coloring.<br /><br />The stamping guide works like it's supposed to, I've added a photo to show how it's used just in case it's confusing. I have a set of 4 templates from another brand already, there's not much difference in size or thickness of the metal but the designs are different. The edges aren't finished, like a plate with no backing, but I don't think it would cause anyone to slice their finger open unless you're being extremely careless.<br /><br />All in all a great set.\nNice set\nPore Strips, Blackhead Remover Charcoal Nose Strips Deep Cleansing 24 Strips\nCalMyotis\n['Pore strips are tested under strict US regulations. No Fillers, Harmful Fragrances, Dyes or preservative. The pore strips made from safe and high quality ingredients can achieve the expected expectations.']\n{'Size': '24 Count', 'Orientation': 'Landscape', 'Shape': 'Rectangular', 'Frame Type': 'Wrapped Canvas', 'Color': 'NO', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '3.94 x 0.59 x 1.97 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '723585398217', 'Manufacturer': 'CalMyotis'}\n\"Jeff's Wife\" - I've used the white name brand for years and some store brands but not the charcoal ones. These work just as good as the others, although I'm not sure if the charcoal really makes a difference.<br /><br />The description photos show slits in the strip but I haven't seen them in mine, not a big deal but they do serve a purpose. There is quite a bit of black residue left over (there's also residue left over when using the white ones, the black is just more visible) but it rinses away easily with warm water.<br /><br />I'm very happy with these.\nWorks great\nLaClaire Foaming Botanical Facial Cleanser with Enriched Antioxidant Botanicals - Nourishing pH Balanced Face Wash (50 ml/1.65 oz), Made in the USA\nLaClaire\n['A gentle foaming cleanser utilizing natural beneficial antioxidant botanicals to draw out impurities, excess oil and pollutants. Our foaming cleanser removes debris without disrupting skin\u2019s delicate PH balance. Use our cleanser to detoxify, purify and condition the skin\u2019s natural barrier.']\n{'Item Form': 'Foam', 'Skin Type': 'Oily, Combination, Dry, Normal', 'Brand': 'LaClaire', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2.75 x 5.5 x 1.63 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '891040000682', 'Manufacturer': 'LaClaire'}\nIt's gentle and cleanses well but I notice that it left a thin slippery residue that cannot be washed off easily. If you have a Clarisonic though it could help get rid of this problem. If not, maybe use a washcloth after rinsing.\nLeaves a film, expensive\nDenTek Animal Toothbrush Cover 1 Count (Pack of 4)\nDenTek\n[\"DenTek Kids Toothbrush Cover.

But the brush box says its a Beard Brush. So, I still tried using it as a shaving brush. Big mistake. It was like using a pot & pan scrub brush. I couldn't raise up a lather it's so stiff. But it did a nice job exfoliating my face.<br /><br />Badger? Don't think so. I have many real badger brushes. This appears to be horse or boar. There might be some goat mixed in, who knows for sure?\nNot a shaving brush\nCESTLV Bamboo Charcoal Toothbrush + Toothpaste Kit (10 Pack Bulk), Hotel Amenities for Guest & Travel, BPA Free, Individually Boxed Dental Kits, Recyclable\nC'est La Vie\n{'Brand': \"C'est La Vie\", 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Special Feature': 'Charcoal Toothbrush', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Material Feature': 'Recyclable', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.4 x 3.62 x 2.2 inches; 7.05 Ounces', 'Item model number': '0011', 'UPC': '703980635810'}\nThe bristles are super soft, almost like a make-up brush soft.
