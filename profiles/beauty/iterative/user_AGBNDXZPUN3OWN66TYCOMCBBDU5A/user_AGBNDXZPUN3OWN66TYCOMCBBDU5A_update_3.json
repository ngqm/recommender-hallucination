I have waist-length, thick hair and this held it perfectly well. It kept all of my hair inside and didn\u2019t get wet at all. It\u2019s good thick material, I definitely recommend for those with long and thick hair.\nFor long hair.\n8PC Lazy Bird's Nest Plate Hairpin Velvet Bird Nest Shaped Hair Clips Expandable Ponytail Holder Hair Loops Nest Plate Hairpin Hair Claw Clip barrette\nAhkeaDirectly\n{'Brand': 'AhkeaDirectly', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Embellishment': 'Resin', 'Material': 'Plastic', 'Package Dimensions': '6.02 x 5.2 x 2.32 inches; 4.16 Ounces', 'UPC': '761312153890'}\n[[VIDEOID:2e5c6485a58e57540c7be371e49b8b9b]] They are really nice and they expand big enough to make any hair style you want to use it for.
