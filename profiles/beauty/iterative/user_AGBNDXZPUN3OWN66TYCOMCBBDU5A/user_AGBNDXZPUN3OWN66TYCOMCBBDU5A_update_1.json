Cheetah\nReview Date: 2022/05/23\nStore: Kristin Ess\nProduct Description: ['But make it fashun! This chic satin, oversized scrunchie can be wrapped once or twice depending on the thickness of your hair. Try securing your ponytail with a regular elastic first and then put this over to maximize the look!']\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Material': 'Satin', 'Item Form': 'Scrunchie', 'Brand': 'Kristin Ess', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Number of Pieces': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '10.55 x 6.26 x 1.46 inches; 1.13 Ounces', 'Item model number': '184-KES-0309', 'UPC': '840797141438'}\nReview Text: [[VIDEOID:1caeab65346b101dab4627efe802e13f]] This has no stretch whatsoever. It\u2019s literally just a super tight hair tie wrapped in a bunch of extra, unnecessary fabric. I have waist length hair and only use scrunchies because it\u2019s the only thing that stretches enough and holds my hair. This is not it ladies.\nReview Title: Absolutely not\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
