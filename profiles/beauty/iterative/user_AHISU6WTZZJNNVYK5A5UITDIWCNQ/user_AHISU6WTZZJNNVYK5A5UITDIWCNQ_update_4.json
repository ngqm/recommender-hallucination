She really liked it. Said it went on easily and stayed on. She is very fair skinned so it looked really nice and stood out. You get 4 colors and they are a matte with a sparklyness to it. It is a compact design and worked great for contouring also. She had no irritations or problems with it.\nReview Title: LOVE IT\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Silicone Makeup Sponge 2 Pack Premium Quality Silisponge -Easy To Wash Beauty Sponge Applicator for Flawless Application of Liquid Foundation,Primer, Concealer by SEALUXE\nSEALUXE\n{'Brand': 'SEALUXE', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '3.5 x 3.5 x 0.6 inches', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Makeup'}\nMy 18 year old grand daughter does her full face make up everyday whether she is leaving the house or not. I will admit she is pretty good at it, but she does spend alot of money on it. She had been using a sponge type and what she said that she really likes about this blender is that there is alot less waste of makeup, since the sponge absorbs it and this silicone blender spreads it. She said it spreads alot more evenly also and she was very happy with how she could clean it easily in water after each use.\nSPREADS EVENLY & CLEANS EASILY\nLeyla Milani Hair Styling Spray - Professional Extra Firm Hold Flexible Hairspray, 3-Level Adjustable Nozzle, Best Heat Resistant Anti-Humidity Finishing Hair Sprays, Hold it Right There (10oz)\nLeyla Milani Hair\n{'Hair Type': 'All', 'Liquid Volume': '10 Fluid Ounces', 'Item Form': 'Spray', 'Brand': 'Leyla Milani Hair', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '10 x 2 x 1.7 inches; 12.8 Ounces'}\nI have kind of fine hair, but it is like I have alot of it. My hair normally when I curl it is flat within 1 hour tops. Even when I use hair spray, to even get it to hold I have to use alot of hairspray and then my hair feels so stiff and gross looking. This hair spray held my hair all day long and my hair was not at all stiff or hard or sticky, it was very free flowing. I absolutely love the smell of this hair spray. You adjust the spray flow on the nozzle. So depending on how I want my hair to be for the day is whether I use  the light, the medium or the high spray.\nHELD MY HAIR CURLS ALL DAY LONG & SMELLS GREAT\nLeyla Milani Hair - Heat Protecting Anti Frizz Shine & Thermal Spray Alcohol-Free, Clean Melon Scent, Hair Repair - Glossilocks Spray - msrp $23\nLeyla Milani Hair\n{'Hair Type': 'All', 'Item Form': 'spray', 'Brand': 'Leyla Milani Hair', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Unit Count': '4.75 Ounce'}\nI have very dull and lifeless hair, I think it is from too much sun and abuse growing up My hair is light weight but very frizzy so I have to use straighteners or curling irons to have it look decent. This has definitely made my hair shiny and looking great. I just sprayed it on damp hair, I combed it through and then I used a flat iron and I have also used it with the curling iron and I loved the outcome. My hair definitely had alot more life to it. I think if your hair looks good you feel good about yourself. The smell of this spray is amazing, it is like a fresh melon scent. It is super easy to use and I love that it gives my hair a layer of protection from the heated hair appliances and the sun. It is for all hair types and it is very light weight.\nFANTASTIC SCENT & LOVING THE SHINY HAIR\nTanali Contour Highlighter Powder Palette -4 Color Matte Glitter Foundation Face Makeup Compact Set (#2)\n{'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Finish Type': 'Matte', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Style': 'Compact', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.59 x 4.41 x 0.98 inches; 3.84 Ounces', 'UPC': '712069255788'}\nMy grand daughter used this on many different areas of her body for high lighting purposes.
