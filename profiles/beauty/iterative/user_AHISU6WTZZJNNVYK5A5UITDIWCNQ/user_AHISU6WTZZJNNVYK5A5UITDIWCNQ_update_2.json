My hair normally when I curl it is flat within 1 hour tops. Even when I use hair spray, to even get it to hold I have to use alot of hairspray and then my hair feels so stiff and gross looking. This hair spray held my hair all day long and my hair was not at all stiff or hard or sticky, it was very free flowing. I absolutely love the smell of this hair spray. You adjust the spray flow on the nozzle. So depending on how I want my hair to be for the day is whether I use  the light, the medium or the high spray.\nReview Title: HELD MY HAIR CURLS ALL DAY LONG & SMELLS GREAT\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I will admit she is pretty good at it, but she does spend alot of money on it. She had been using a sponge type and what she said that she really likes about this blender is that there is alot less waste of makeup, since the sponge absorbs it and this silicone blender spreads it. She said it spreads alot more evenly also and she was very happy with how she could clean it easily in water after each use.\nSPREADS EVENLY & CLEANS EASILY\nLeyla Milani Hair Styling Spray - Professional Extra Firm Hold Flexible Hairspray, 3-Level Adjustable Nozzle, Best Heat Resistant Anti-Humidity Finishing Hair Sprays, Hold it Right There (10oz)\nLeyla Milani Hair\n{'Hair Type': 'All', 'Liquid Volume': '10 Fluid Ounces', 'Item Form': 'Spray', 'Brand': 'Leyla Milani Hair', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '10 x 2 x 1.7 inches; 12.8 Ounces'}\nI have kind of fine hair, but it is like I have alot of it.
