The sound is pretty clear coming through and the ear pieces are super cushy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, where these headphones fall short for me is the fit. They don\u2019t fit snug at all, it\u2019s almost as if the ear pieces just hang off the top of my ears. It\u2019s definitely usable, but loose fitting in my opinion.<br /><br />Other than that, they are pretty monster headphones, so just be sure you\u2019re ready to be wearing size huge. I honestly wouldn\u2019t have a problem with the size of the headphones if they fit better. I\u2019m too afraid to make sudden movements because they feel like they will slip off.\nReview Title: Comfortable, but loose fitting\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
