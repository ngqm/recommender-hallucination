The sound is pretty clear coming through and the ear pieces are super cushy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, where these headphones fall short for me is the fit. They don\u2019t fit snug at all, it\u2019s almost as if the ear pieces just hang off the top of my ears. It\u2019s definitely usable, but loose fitting in my opinion.<br /><br />Other than that, they are pretty monster headphones, so just be sure you\u2019re ready to be wearing size huge. I honestly wouldn\u2019t have a problem with the size of the headphones if they fit better. I\u2019m too afraid to make sudden movements because they feel like they will slip off.\nComfortable, but loose fitting\nVIRTUE Shaping Spray, 7 oz\n{'Product Dimensions': '2 x 2 x 9.5 inches; 8.78 Ounces', 'UPC': '817023022168'}\nI have medium thickness curly hair that is very frizz prone in humid weather, so a shaping spray is a must for me on those humid days. Since I have curly hair, I avoid any products with sulfates to prevent dry hair, so I\u2019m very happy this product is sulfate free. It has a nice scent and does a great job preventing frizz. What I like most is that it doesn\u2019t change the texture of my hair too much- none of that crunchy hair spray feel. It also has a nice scent, but it\u2019s not too strong or overpowering. However, for the price point, I\u2019m not sure I could justify continued use of this product.\nGreat hold without the crunch\n9 Pieces Waterproof Shower Cap,Dot Plastic Shower Caps Waterproof Reusable Large Elastic Bath Hair Cap,Beauty Salon Spa Shower Caps Lace Elastic Band Printed Hat Protection Hair Bath Caps Shower Caps\nBeeGift\n{}\nI use shower caps for a slightly unconventional purpose- covering my bread bowl while the dough proofs. I like it because they\u2019re easy to take off and on when the dough needs to be folded, and they provide a more secure seal if I\u2019m doing an overnight proof, so I don\u2019t need to worry about the top of the dough drying out. These have worked great for that purpose.\nWork great\nWaxing Kit,Wax Warmer Hair Removal for Women Men,upgrade Portable Wax Kit with Scented Hard Wax Beans,Wax Machine for sensitive skin Full Body at home waxing or on vacation\nJAPUSOON\n{'Item Form': 'Wax', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Brand': 'JAPUSOON', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '7.52 x 7.4 x 5.2 inches; 1.41 Pounds', 'UPC': '750440491196'}\nThe warmer works well, melting the wax in 10-15 minutes. After the wax is melted you can lower the temp to keep it warm, but not so hot that it will burn your skin. The kit comes with enough wax for at least a full leg wax (both legs). The kit comes with popsicle sticks for application. This was my first time home waxing, so it took me a bit to get my technique down, but definitely doable on your own.\nGreat for home use\nKoluaWax | Beach Legs Hard Wax Beads (1lb Bag) | For Legs, Back & More | Lavender\nKoluaWax\n{'Item Form': 'Wax', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Body', 'Material Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Material Type Free': 'Paraben Free', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Package Dimensions': '11.85 x 5.98 x 2.56 inches; 1.09 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'BEACHLEGS'}\nThis wax is elastic and covers large areas well. I have dark course hair, and this worked great on my legs. My skin is generally more on the sensitive side, but I had no irritation from this wax.\nGood for legs\nZZLOVE Amino Acids Body Wash for Men Women Moisturizing Shower Gel with Milk Protein Hydrolysate and Natural Plant Extracts\nZZLOVE\n{'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Brand': 'ZZLOVE', 'Scent': 'Honey, Papaya', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '6.77 x 3.03 x 2.95 inches; 14.39 Ounces'}\nThe body wash is a little bit thicker, probably due to the moisturizing feature, so even though it\u2019s a small bottle, I\u2019m able to get a lot of use out of it.
