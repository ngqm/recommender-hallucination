ProductPackage: 1 wig + 1 free hair cap + 1 free hair band Version: V2 (add 4 comb inside to increase safety) How to wear a wig: 1. Wrap your hair tightly in the wig cap we prepared for you. 2. Push in all the hair on the sides, back and front to create a smooth surface. 3. Gently comb the wig and pull the adjustable strap to fit your head size. 4. Hold the top and bottom of the wig, pull it out from the front of the head, and then gently pull it back to adjust the wig to cover the hat and fit the head perfectly How to clean a wig: 1. Using mild shampoo, gently soak the wig in cold or warm water. 2. Rinse the hair in the same direction with warm water. 3. Gently comb your hair from top to bottom. 4. Tile the wig and let it dry naturally. How to care for a wig: 1. Do not spray gel water and wax on the wig to avoid greasy wigs. 2. Do not use hair clips to avoid damage to the net. 3. Do not curl hair that exceeds 400 degrees Fahrenheit (about 100.2 degrees Celsius). Comb your hair patiently. 4. After finishing use, put it back in the box or dust-proof. Q A 1. Why does hair fall out? After the new product is produced, some floating hair will appear on it. When wearing it for the first time, please comb and remove the floating hair. 2. About tangles: Hair will be tangled due to dryness, grease and dirt accumulation. And all synthetic wigs are a little tangled, which is normal.For long-term use, please make sure to wash and care for it at least once a week. If you have any questions, please feel free to email us.\"]\n{'Material': 'Steel', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Brand': 'Nostalgia', 'Cartoon Character': 'Straight', 'Package Dimensions': '9.69 x 4.96 x 2.13 inches; 10.23 Ounces'}\nNot what I expected\nPoor quality\nButterfly Locs Crochet Hair 18 inch , 7 Packs Natural Black Long Butterfly Locs Crochet Braids, Distressed Faux Locs Hair Extensions for Black Women T30#\nTioolioo\n{'Brand': 'Tioolioo', 'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Extension Length': '18 Inches', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '10.98 x 8.27 x 4.02 inches; 13.12 Ounces'}\nAs expected\nLove\nWUDAS 7 Packs Passion Twist Hair 12 Inch Water Wave Crochet Hair for Braiding Short Passion Twist Crochet Hair for Butterfly Locs (7Pac.27#)\nWUDAS\n{'Brand': 'WUDAS', 'Extension Length': '12 Inches', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '11.5 x 8.19 x 2.6 inches; 13.44 Ounces'}\nI love the curl pattern\nGreat price and hair",
