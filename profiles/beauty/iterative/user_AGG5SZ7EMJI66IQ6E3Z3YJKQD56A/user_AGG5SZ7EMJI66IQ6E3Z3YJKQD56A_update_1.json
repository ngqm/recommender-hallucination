It tangles easily and the combs don\u2019t really have a purpose and pokes you in the scalp. It\u2019s extremely heavy, & definitely has a synthetic look to it. But maybe add some baby powder or dry shampoo to get rid of the shine?\nReview Title: You get what you pay for.\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
