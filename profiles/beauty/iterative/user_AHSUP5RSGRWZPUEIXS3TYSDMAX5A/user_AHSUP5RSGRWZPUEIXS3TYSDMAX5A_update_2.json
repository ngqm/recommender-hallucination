The brushes I've been seeing look flimsy and painful with their wire tips. I liked the rubber tips on this so took the chance. It's working great so far. I can tell it doesn't hurt my cat...although she still doesn't love what's happening. It smoothed their hair without pulling it all out. The bristles kept their shape. The button pushed all the hair up, so I could cleanly and easily pull it all off. It's more comfortable to hold, and the cover is actually helpful to keep the bristles clean and protected from being bent. It's a little large for even my large cats but totally doable. It would definitely work for larger dogs as well. The price is reasonable and considering so many other similar brushes received poor reviews, I'm especially happy with this for the price.\nReview Title: Working well\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "ZENOTRI Rudios Fine Deep Forming Cleanser | Wash Face Weakly Acidic Cleansing Foam | Adsorption cleaning | Panthenol Citric Acid | 6.8 FL OZ\nZENOTRI\n{'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Brand': 'ZENOTRI', 'Material Feature': 'Hypoallergenic, Natural', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '7.83 x 1.97 x 1.61 inches; 9.81 Ounces'}\nI bought this out of curiosity about foam cleansers and because a reviewer said it smells like coconut. Actually, it smells like citrus pine to me, which makes a lot more sense looking at the pinecones on the package and the fact is says there pine leaf, grapefruit, and citron extracts. It's a nice scent if you like those. Anyway, I'm finding one pump of these foams work for me (maybe I would need more if I was wearing makeup, and I wish I could tell you how well this removes makeup). This spread thicker than other foams I have used so far. It felt like it did a good job cleaning and left my skin soft and fresh. The price is on par with other foam cleansers I've tried. This would last me a long time since I only need one pump, but I'm just as happy with cheaper cleansers with scents I prefer.\nClean, Citrus, Pine\nCMQC Self Cleaning Slicker Brush for Cats & Dogs Pet Grooming Brush Tool for Shedding Pets Hair Brush for Long Short Haired Dog Cat to Remove Tangles, Loose Fur, Mats (Blue)\nCMQC\n{'Brand': 'CMQC', 'Color': 'Blue', 'Shape': 'Oblong', 'Handle Material': 'Rubber', 'Special Feature': 'Self Cleaning', 'Product Dimensions': '6.3 x 4.3 x 3 inches; 5.61 Ounces'}\nI needed a brush for my cats because the one I've been using removes almost too much hair and hurts my one cat plus it's uncomfortable to hold.
