The color is beautiful and not too orange. While I like the gold too, the specks of glitter are larger and more obvious than I would like. Some gold is really fine and distributes as an even shimmer across your lips. With this, you can see the glitter speck here, the glitter speck there, the glitter speck falling a little outside your lip line that will probably end up somewhere else on your face. It has more of a youthful, party feel. I agree it's a color reminiscent of sunsets, suited for summer and fall. The case is possibly the most sophisticated I own though. It has a nice weight, and the magnetic closure feels good. It came in a box and in a sealed bag. I don't mind wearing this color, but I wouldn't buy it again. I think I like the case the best, but I'm not convinced the color or feel add up to make it worth $38.\nReview Title: Very glittery\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "ZENOTRI Rudios Fine Deep Forming Cleanser | Wash Face Weakly Acidic Cleansing Foam | Adsorption cleaning | Panthenol Citric Acid | 6.8 FL OZ\nZENOTRI\n{'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Brand': 'ZENOTRI', 'Material Feature': 'Hypoallergenic, Natural', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '7.83 x 1.97 x 1.61 inches; 9.81 Ounces'}\nI bought this out of curiosity about foam cleansers and because a reviewer said it smells like coconut. Actually, it smells like citrus pine to me, which makes a lot more sense looking at the pinecones on the package and the fact is says there pine leaf, grapefruit, and citron extracts. It's a nice scent if you like those. Anyway, I'm finding one pump of these foams work for me (maybe I would need more if I was wearing makeup, and I wish I could tell you how well this removes makeup). This spread thicker than other foams I have used so far. It felt like it did a good job cleaning and left my skin soft and fresh. The price is on par with other foam cleansers I've tried. This would last me a long time since I only need one pump, but I'm just as happy with cheaper cleansers with scents I prefer.\nClean, Citrus, Pine\nCMQC Self Cleaning Slicker Brush for Cats & Dogs Pet Grooming Brush Tool for Shedding Pets Hair Brush for Long Short Haired Dog Cat to Remove Tangles, Loose Fur, Mats (Blue)\nCMQC\n{'Brand': 'CMQC', 'Color': 'Blue', 'Shape': 'Oblong', 'Handle Material': 'Rubber', 'Special Feature': 'Self Cleaning', 'Product Dimensions': '6.3 x 4.3 x 3 inches; 5.61 Ounces'}\nI needed a brush for my cats because the one I've been using removes almost too much hair and hurts my one cat plus it's uncomfortable to hold. The brushes I've been seeing look flimsy and painful with their wire tips. I liked the rubber tips on this so took the chance. It's working great so far. I can tell it doesn't hurt my cat...although she still doesn't love what's happening. It smoothed their hair without pulling it all out. The bristles kept their shape. The button pushed all the hair up, so I could cleanly and easily pull it all off. It's more comfortable to hold, and the cover is actually helpful to keep the bristles clean and protected from being bent. It's a little large for even my large cats but totally doable. It would definitely work for larger dogs as well. The price is reasonable and considering so many other similar brushes received poor reviews, I'm especially happy with this for the price.\nWorking well\nLOVE CINEMA Mascara 222\nLOVE CINEMA\n{'Brand': 'LOVE CINEMA', 'Item Volume': '0.24 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Information': 'Tube', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Water Resistance Level': 'Waterproof'}\nReviews when I ordered this were raving about it. It's not bad, but it's not all that. Many more reviews have been added since then that reflect that.\nAffordable, average mascara\nBy Terry Hyaluronic Pressed Hydra-Powder | Transcluscent | Infused with Hyaluronic Acid | Vegan\nBy Terry\n{'Brand': 'By Terry', 'Item Form': 'powder', 'Finish Type': 'Matte', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '3.19 x 3.15 x 0.75 inches; 2.82 Ounces', 'Item model number': '3700076457087'}\nI've used a drugstore pressed powder for years and always gotten compliments, so it's hard to think I need to pay $52. I can't say I was especially impressed by this. HOWEVER, I'm getting to the age where I'm starting to notice my makeup can look dry and accentuate lines I didn't even think I had. I'm not wearing much makeup these days, but based on reviews, I got this with the hope it will work for maturing skin. I can see this also washing you out a bit as another reviewer mentioned. It's white, and even though I'm fair, I felt this needed a very light application. The good news is if such a thin dusting can live up to the reviews, it makes the price a little better. I was surprised how low quality the puff felt. It's very thin and almost felt rough.\nMaybe better for older skin?\nEMILIE HEATHE - Lip Atelier Lip Color | Sustainable, Cruelty-Free, Clean Beauty (Public)\n{'Finish Type': 'Shimmery, Natural', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Smoothening,Moisturizing,Clean', 'Material Type Free': 'Paraben Free', 'Coverage': 'Buildable', 'Specialty': 'Cruelty-free,Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '7.2 x 2.13 x 1.5 inches; 1.45 Ounces', 'UPC': '810033380181'}\nI have a lot of orange-gold lip colors because I find them very flattering on me, so I was pretty confident I would like this.
