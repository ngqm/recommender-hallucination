It came in an unsealed box. There's a plastic cover under the lid, but there was a mess of cream all around the rim and threads. Maybe it was used? It smells like lotion and salad dressing. It feels like Vaseline on the skin, which is okay for a sleeping mask. It made me feel like it was  certainly locking in moisture, but the next day, I didn't really notice anything different in my skin. I like sleeping masks but don't expect I would order this again. I definitely find it overpriced ($44) for the packaging, experience, and results - or lack thereof.\nReview Title: Smells like salad dressing and feels like petroleum jelly\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "ZENOTRI Rudios Fine Deep Forming Cleanser | Wash Face Weakly Acidic Cleansing Foam | Adsorption cleaning | Panthenol Citric Acid | 6.8 FL OZ\nZENOTRI\n{'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Brand': 'ZENOTRI', 'Material Feature': 'Hypoallergenic, Natural', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '7.83 x 1.97 x 1.61 inches; 9.81 Ounces'}\nI bought this out of curiosity about foam cleansers and because a reviewer said it smells like coconut. Actually, it smells like citrus pine to me, which makes a lot more sense looking at the pinecones on the package and the fact is says there pine leaf, grapefruit, and citron extracts. It's a nice scent if you like those. Anyway, I'm finding one pump of these foams work for me (maybe I would need more if I was wearing makeup, and I wish I could tell you how well this removes makeup). This spread thicker than other foams I have used so far. It felt like it did a good job cleaning and left my skin soft and fresh. The price is on par with other foam cleansers I've tried. This would last me a long time since I only need one pump, but I'm just as happy with cheaper cleansers with scents I prefer.\nClean, Citrus, Pine\nCMQC Self Cleaning Slicker Brush for Cats & Dogs Pet Grooming Brush Tool for Shedding Pets Hair Brush for Long Short Haired Dog Cat to Remove Tangles, Loose Fur, Mats (Blue)\nCMQC\n{'Brand': 'CMQC', 'Color': 'Blue', 'Shape': 'Oblong', 'Handle Material': 'Rubber', 'Special Feature': 'Self Cleaning', 'Product Dimensions': '6.3 x 4.3 x 3 inches; 5.61 Ounces'}\nI needed a brush for my cats because the one I've been using removes almost too much hair and hurts my one cat plus it's uncomfortable to hold. The brushes I've been seeing look flimsy and painful with their wire tips. I liked the rubber tips on this so took the chance. It's working great so far. I can tell it doesn't hurt my cat...although she still doesn't love what's happening. It smoothed their hair without pulling it all out. The bristles kept their shape. The button pushed all the hair up, so I could cleanly and easily pull it all off. It's more comfortable to hold, and the cover is actually helpful to keep the bristles clean and protected from being bent. It's a little large for even my large cats but totally doable. It would definitely work for larger dogs as well. The price is reasonable and considering so many other similar brushes received poor reviews, I'm especially happy with this for the price.\nWorking well\nLOVE CINEMA Mascara 222\nLOVE CINEMA\n{'Brand': 'LOVE CINEMA', 'Item Volume': '0.24 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Information': 'Tube', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Water Resistance Level': 'Waterproof'}\nReviews when I ordered this were raving about it. It's not bad, but it's not all that. Many more reviews have been added since then that reflect that.\nAffordable, average mascara\nBy Terry Hyaluronic Pressed Hydra-Powder | Transcluscent | Infused with Hyaluronic Acid | Vegan\nBy Terry\n{'Brand': 'By Terry', 'Item Form': 'powder', 'Finish Type': 'Matte', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '3.19 x 3.15 x 0.75 inches; 2.82 Ounces', 'Item model number': '3700076457087'}\nI've used a drugstore pressed powder for years and always gotten compliments, so it's hard to think I need to pay $52. I can't say I was especially impressed by this. HOWEVER, I'm getting to the age where I'm starting to notice my makeup can look dry and accentuate lines I didn't even think I had. I'm not wearing much makeup these days, but based on reviews, I got this with the hope it will work for maturing skin. I can see this also washing you out a bit as another reviewer mentioned. It's white, and even though I'm fair, I felt this needed a very light application. The good news is if such a thin dusting can live up to the reviews, it makes the price a little better. I was surprised how low quality the puff felt. It's very thin and almost felt rough.\nMaybe better for older skin?\nEMILIE HEATHE - Lip Atelier Lip Color | Sustainable, Cruelty-Free, Clean Beauty (Public)\n{'Finish Type': 'Shimmery, Natural', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Smoothening,Moisturizing,Clean', 'Material Type Free': 'Paraben Free', 'Coverage': 'Buildable', 'Specialty': 'Cruelty-free,Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '7.2 x 2.13 x 1.5 inches; 1.45 Ounces', 'UPC': '810033380181'}\nI have a lot of orange-gold lip colors because I find them very flattering on me, so I was pretty confident I would like this. The color is beautiful and not too orange. While I like the gold too, the specks of glitter are larger and more obvious than I would like. Some gold is really fine and distributes as an even shimmer across your lips. With this, you can see the glitter speck here, the glitter speck there, the glitter speck falling a little outside your lip line that will probably end up somewhere else on your face. It has more of a youthful, party feel. I agree it's a color reminiscent of sunsets, suited for summer and fall. The case is possibly the most sophisticated I own though. It has a nice weight, and the magnetic closure feels good. It came in a box and in a sealed bag. I don't mind wearing this color, but I wouldn't buy it again. I think I like the case the best, but I'm not convinced the color or feel add up to make it worth $38.\nVery glittery\nPineapple Gommage Peeling Gel by Vitamasques - Gentle Botanical Cellulose Exfoliator for Sensitive Skin - De-Clogs Pores & Eliminates Dead Skin - Vegan, Free from Parabens & Gluten\nVitamasques\n{'Brand': 'Vitamasques', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Material Feature': 'Cruelty Free, Vegan', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Scent': 'Pineapple', 'Package Dimensions': '4.92 x 2.2 x 1.38 inches; 2.08 Ounces', 'UPC': '750258970371'}\nThe tube had a foil seal. There is a pineapple scent. You're supposed to massage the gel on dry skin for 2 minutes. As soon as you start, it starts to pill. I feel like most of it immediately dries up and falls off though I'm sure it's grabbing dead skin too. While it's gentle in that it's not using coarse particles, I didn't enjoy the dry rubbing and tugging at my skin. You can only avoid that over 2 minutes by applying a generous amount of gel, but it's a small tube. My skin looked a little brightened afterwards but not as soft and bright as many other exfoliators (scrubs, peels, masks, serums, etc). This is $12.99, which doesn't seem like as great of a value after seeing how much you need to use. I didn't like the application, results, or price enough to reorder this.\nDry rub\nEveryday Beauty Radiance Cleanser, Rejuvenating Antioxidant Gel Cleanser with Rose Hip Seed Oil, Vitamin A, C, and E for All Skin Types to Soothe and Nourish Dry Damaged Skin, 4fl oz. Pump Bottle\nEveryday Beauty\n{'Brand': 'Everyday Beauty', 'Scent': 'Rose', 'Material Type Free': 'Cruelty-free,Gluten-free,Non-gmo,Sulfates', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '6.42 x 1.81 x 1.77 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'UPC': '700463002336', 'Manufacturer': 'Cosmetic Solutions, LLC'}\nThe bottle came in a sealed box. It's a light pink gel. The scent is nice but more fruity-rose like you might find in products scented for children. It cleans okay. I don't feel it's worth $16, but I don't think I would buy this one again regardless.\nOkay cleanser\nEveryday Beauty Strawberry Exfoliator, Nourishing, Hydrating, and Rich Antioxidant Exfoliating Scrub with Ginseng, Strawberry Seeds, and Black Currant for Dry Dehydrated, and Aging Skin, 1.7 oz. Jar\nEveryday Beauty\n{'Brand': 'Everyday Beauty', 'Material Feature': 'Gluten Free, Cruelty Free', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Information': 'Jar', 'Item Weight': '1.7 Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '3.03 x 2.99 x 2.13 inches; 1.7 Ounces', 'UPC': '700463002374', 'Manufacturer': 'Cosmetic Solutions, LLC'}\nIf you love strawberries and/or are seeking a gentle scrub, this is a good choice. The sealed tub also had a plastic cover under the the lid and was boxed. The scrub had a little brown in it like what you might see when fruit starts to rot or in yogurt, but it's dated good until 9/14/2023, so I felt okay using it. The red particles made my husband and I realize we didn't confidently know the color of strawberry seeds, but I think they are. They feel kind of squishy, and the scrub feels more like a creamy moisturizing lotion. It does smell like strawberries and makes skin soft. This is a different scrub that feels gentle. I personally prefer one that feels like it's polishing and cleaning more than moisturizing though. This is currently $12.\nGentle exfoliator\nEveryday Beauty Renewal Night Cream Nourishing Facial Moisturizer with Brown Algae Extract, Squalene, Hyaluronic Acid and Glycerin to Moisturize and Protect Skin, Reduce Signs of Aging, 1 oz. Jar\nEveryday Beauty\n{'Brand': 'Everyday Beauty', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Active Ingredients': 'algae extract,glycerin', 'Unit Count': '1.0 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '2.56 x 2.56 x 2.05 inches; 4.97 Ounces', 'UPC': '700463002398', 'Manufacturer': 'Cosmetic Solutions, LLC'}\nI really like Everyday Beauty's Hydrating Instant Mask so was hopeful for this Night Cream, but I wasn't as impressed. It didn't seem to leave my skin quite as velvety soft or last as many hours, yet the Night Cream is more expensive at $38/1 fl oz. The Mask is $22/1.7 fl oz and can be used overnight as often as needed. I use it as the last step in my skincare routine. This cream came in a box, unsealed and simply smells like a cream.\nPrefer the Hydrating Instant Mask\nCelleanser Vegan Clean Serum100% Vegan Ingredients Quick Relief and Repair Hypoallergic Tested Hydrating Panthenol Silky Texture Made in Korea 30ml 1.01 fl. oz.\nCelleanser\n{'Package Dimensions': '5.83 x 1.26 x 1.26 inches; 2.89 Ounces'}\nI used this later in a day, after derma rollering, and I felt it helped soothe my skin. No lingering irritation or redness from the derma roller. I'm not sure if it was this serum alone or how it worked in conjunction with my other skin care products, but my skin felt velvety soft afterwards. I enjoyed the lavender-scented milky texture of this serum. It came in a sealed box. It's affordably priced at $9.99. I would get this again.\nSoft & soothed skin\nVitamasques Multivitamin Sleeping Mask Made with Essential Vitamins & Multi-Molecular Hyaluronic Acid for Healthy, Nourished & Hydrated Skin - Vegan, Free from Parabens & Gluten\nVitamasques\n{'Brand': 'Vitamasques', 'Scent': 'Hyaluronic Acid', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Unit Count': '1.0 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '5.98 x 2.36 x 1.57 inches; 2.08 Ounces', 'UPC': '750258970081'}\nThis came with a foil seal in a bag. It's a very sweet scented gel that feels nice on the skin - like a soft layer/barrier, but unlike other overnight masks I've tried, the effects weren't really apparent once you remove this the next morning. It's currently $12.99.\nGood for the price\nAct of Wellness R&R Sleeping Mask - Leave on Overnight Treatment with Hyaluronic Acid + Retinol Alternative for Happy and Feel It Soft Skin - Vegan and Cruelty Free (2oz\nAct of Wellness\n{'Brand': 'Act of Wellness', 'Unit Count': '1.0 Ounce', 'Material Feature': 'Vegan', 'Skin Tone': 'All'}\nI didn't care much for this sleeping mask.
