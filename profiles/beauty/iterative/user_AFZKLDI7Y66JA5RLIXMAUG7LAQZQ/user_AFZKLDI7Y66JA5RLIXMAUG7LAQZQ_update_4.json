Dual Voltage, S1, White\nReview Date: 2019/07/27\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Product Benefits': 'This ceramic, rotating curling iron provides easy, quality waves in minutes!', 'Shape': 'Barrel', 'Brand': 'The Beachwaver Co.', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Material': 'Ceramic', 'Product Dimensions': '15.75 x 1.75 x 2 inches; 14.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': '1', 'UPC': '817741020613', 'Manufacturer': 'AmazonUs/SB10T', 'Country of Origin': 'China'}\nReview Text: [[VIDEOID:3158725939fb8ccdffa1fd3ca1707063]] This is so cool. At first when I opened it, I thought the tiny little clamp looked really weird for a curler. The box is also huge when you get it and the whole curler is pretty long - definitely not for easy storage. When I used it though, the results turned out GREAT. Basically you work it by clamping the very end of a streak of hair, then pressing one of the arrow buttons to tell the barrel which direction to rotate. It rotates, picking up your hair as it goes. After a few seconds, just let go of the clamp and you have a curl! Brush it through and you'll get the results in the photo. There really wasn't any kind of kink in the end of my hair either as sometimes happens with clamps (as long as you don't rotate the barrel the wrong way from how you clamped it). One nice thing is that there\u2019s a \u201chome\u201d button for when you rotate the barrel too far from where your thumb is to unclamp the strand - you can see it in the video where it kind of rotates back real quick to line up the clamp release with my thumb. All in all it was really quick, less than 15 minutes to figure the thing out and curl my full head of hair!\nReview Title: I love this curler!!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Eyelash Curler With Refill Pad Lash Curlers Tool ULG Travel Eye Lashes Clip Professional Stainless Steel Curled Cosmetic Makeup Accessory Rose Gold\nULG\n{'Brand': 'ULG', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '2.6 x 5.1 x 1.7 inches', 'Operation Mode': 'Manual'}\nNice! Works as expected and comes with a whole lot of refills which is nice. Not that you need to replace them all that often.\nUseful\nUV Light for Nails,LKE Curing Lamp for Gel Nail Polish 54W UV Led Light Gel Nail Starter Kit Nail Dryer Accessories\nLKE\n{'Brand': 'LKE', 'Light Source Type': 'LED', 'Number of Light Sources': '2', 'Wattage': '54 watts', 'Control Method': 'App', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '9.45 x 8.7 x 5.08 inches; 2 Pounds', 'Batteries': '1 Lithium Ion batteries required.'}\nThis is the first UV/LED gel nail polish lamp I've ever tried, but it's been amazing so far! It seems pretty standard, it has options for timing from 10 seconds to 120. The best thing about it is that you can set the setting, and it will remember the setting and turn on when you put your hand in via motion sensors! That's super convenient when you have one or both hands covered in wet polish! It plugs into the wall and has a cord that I've found to definitely be long enough, and it's great that you don't have to rely on batteries for it. 5 stars!\nWorks great!\n&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&\nYRMJK\n{'Brand': 'YRMJK', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Item Firmness Description': 'Soft', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '9.1 x 3.1 x 2.7 inches; 13.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '738426030676', 'Manufacturer': 'MUTTUS'}\nThis set has everything you need for an electric toothbrush. In total it includes 6 brush heads (in the photo, one was still in the box), a charger, a case to hold the toothbrush and two brush heads for traveling, and the toothbrush itself with 5 distinct modes. Really you can think of it as having 15 modes because each mode can be on high, medium, or low intensity. The instruction manual describes each of the modes - they vary in rhythm and power. I used one of the weaker settings as the manual suggested because this is my first time using an electric toothbrush, which was the perfect amount of power for me! Have to mention that when this touches your lips by accident it tickles like I have never been tickled before, but I think that is to be expected from any electric toothbrush and just takes some getting used to. Overall, 5 stars - the color is also super cute, and you can't beat the very sturdy travel case! Just wish it had a compartment for the charger. Also impressed with its ability to hold a charge!\nGreat toothbrush set!\nThe Beachwaver Co.
