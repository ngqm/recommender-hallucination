In total it includes 6 brush heads (in the photo, one was still in the box), a charger, a case to hold the toothbrush and two brush heads for traveling, and the toothbrush itself with 5 distinct modes. Really you can think of it as having 15 modes because each mode can be on high, medium, or low intensity. The instruction manual describes each of the modes - they vary in rhythm and power. I used one of the weaker settings as the manual suggested because this is my first time using an electric toothbrush, which was the perfect amount of power for me! Have to mention that when this touches your lips by accident it tickles like I have never been tickled before, but I think that is to be expected from any electric toothbrush and just takes some getting used to. Overall, 5 stars - the color is also super cute, and you can't beat the very sturdy travel case! Just wish it had a compartment for the charger. Also impressed with its ability to hold a charge!\nReview Title: Great toothbrush set!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Works as expected and comes with a whole lot of refills which is nice. Not that you need to replace them all that often.\nUseful\nUV Light for Nails,LKE Curing Lamp for Gel Nail Polish 54W UV Led Light Gel Nail Starter Kit Nail Dryer Accessories\nLKE\n{'Brand': 'LKE', 'Light Source Type': 'LED', 'Number of Light Sources': '2', 'Wattage': '54 watts', 'Control Method': 'App', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '9.45 x 8.7 x 5.08 inches; 2 Pounds', 'Batteries': '1 Lithium Ion batteries required.'}\nThis is the first UV/LED gel nail polish lamp I've ever tried, but it's been amazing so far! It seems pretty standard, it has options for timing from 10 seconds to 120. The best thing about it is that you can set the setting, and it will remember the setting and turn on when you put your hand in via motion sensors! That's super convenient when you have one or both hands covered in wet polish! It plugs into the wall and has a cord that I've found to definitely be long enough, and it's great that you don't have to rely on batteries for it. 5 stars!\nWorks great!\n&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&\nYRMJK\n{'Brand': 'YRMJK', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Item Firmness Description': 'Soft', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '9.1 x 3.1 x 2.7 inches; 13.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '738426030676', 'Manufacturer': 'MUTTUS'}\nThis set has everything you need for an electric toothbrush.
