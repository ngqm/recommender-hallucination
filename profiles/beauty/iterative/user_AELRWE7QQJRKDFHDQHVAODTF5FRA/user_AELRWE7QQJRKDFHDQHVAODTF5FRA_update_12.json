I'm so bummed they're so thin because my hair is so thick. They are all 3 individually wrapped bundles and tell you the length on them. The track part is super thick but the very ends just thin out sooo much. I guess that is how natural hair is so I will give it a try. I'm going to do a hand tied weft and will update after I wear them and let you guys know how they dry too. I have naturally curly hair so I always prefer hair that dried kinda wavy like my own and nobody ever says in the reviews that and I'm sure other people wanted to know too!\nReview Title: Nice but thin\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
