I have maybe 10+ different brands of lashes because I'm looking to find my favorite brand to use on my clients. These are the softest lashes I've used this far!! There doesn't seem to be like a super full amount on each line but that will make them easier to make volume lash fans with for sure! They are seriously so soft you guys! I seriously love these! I got the 8mm-15mm lengths in black then one row of blonde brown color, red and one row of blue the colored lashes are all in 12mm which is perfect! The case is unique too, I like that it is magnetic closure that is unique and it's a neat design too.\nReview Title: SOFT!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I'm so bummed they're so thin because my hair is so thick. They are all 3 individually wrapped bundles and tell you the length on them. The track part is super thick but the very ends just thin out sooo much. I guess that is how natural hair is so I will give it a try. I'm going to do a hand tied weft and will update after I wear them and let you guys know how they dry too. I have naturally curly hair so I always prefer hair that dried kinda wavy like my own and nobody ever says in the reviews that and I'm sure other people wanted to know too!\nNice but thin\nMia Secret Monomer 8oz + Black Nail File Emery Boards Top-quality (100/180 Grit) - 5Pack\nSylvia Lashes\n{'Material': 'Emery', 'Brand': 'Sylvia Lashes', 'Unit Count': '20.0 Ounce', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '9.17 x 5.43 x 0.83 inches; 5.19 Ounces', 'UPC': '794020365385', 'Manufacturer': 'Okk Express'}\nPerfect condition, the monomer has the same scent as my other same brand and same color so I do believe It is authentic Mia Secret and I love this monomer.

This does have a fake hair kind of shine and it does shed quiet a bit. It is so cute and not easily tangled either. It's shorter in the back and a little longer in the front. The cap is a little on the more snug side. This has a really nice and pretty wave to it that makes it look a little more natural in my opinion. It's seriously so cute and unique it comes with 2 really nice wig caps and a barrette too and a seriously such cute earrings. I love these earrings so much such a nice little bonus\nSo cute and I love the pink stripe\nEyelash Extension,BREYLEE Individual Eyelash Easy Fan Eyelash Silk Semi Permanent Extension Volume Lashes 15 Row 0.07 Thickness C Curl 8-15mm Mix Lash Extension Supplies For Salon Professional Use\nBREYLEE\n{'Brand': 'BREYLEE', 'Material': 'Silk', 'Item Form': 'Individual', 'Mounting Type': 'Eyelash Glue', 'Unit Count': '2.1164 Ounce', 'Package Dimensions': '5.67 x 3.15 x 0.67 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'Item model number': '1', 'UPC': '601951015015'}\nThese are so soft and I absolutely love them!
