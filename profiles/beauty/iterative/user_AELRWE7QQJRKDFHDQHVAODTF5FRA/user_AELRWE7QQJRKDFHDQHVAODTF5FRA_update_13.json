These will work with short nails medium large and xl nails too. They're just perfect I love these so much and cannot wait to try them!! There is one very unique shape I've never done or seen used before so that's really neat and I cannot wait!!!\nGreat variety for different length nails!\nLUXEDIVA Brazilian Virgin Hair Straight 3 Bundles 10A Unprocessed Brazilian Short Straight Human Hair Weave Weft Natural Black 14 16 18\nLUXEDIVA\n{'Brand': 'LUXEDIVA', 'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Installation Type': 'Sew-In', 'Package Dimensions': '11.02 x 10.91 x 2.68 inches; 12.31 Ounces'}\nThe hair is a very nice quality and it is the length expected but it is so thin and the tracks are so bulky. I'm so bummed they're so thin because my hair is so thick. They are all 3 individually wrapped bundles and tell you the length on them. The track part is super thick but the very ends just thin out sooo much. I guess that is how natural hair is so I will give it a try. I'm going to do a hand tied weft and will update after I wear them and let you guys know how they dry too. I have naturally curly hair so I always prefer hair that dried kinda wavy like my own and nobody ever says in the reviews that and I'm sure other people wanted to know too!\nNice but thin\nMia Secret Monomer 8oz + Black Nail File Emery Boards Top-quality (100/180 Grit) - 5Pack\nSylvia Lashes\n{'Material': 'Emery', 'Brand': 'Sylvia Lashes', 'Unit Count': '20.0 Ounce', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '9.17 x 5.43 x 0.83 inches; 5.19 Ounces', 'UPC': '794020365385', 'Manufacturer': 'Okk Express'}\nPerfect condition, the monomer has the same scent as my other same brand and same color so I do believe It is authentic Mia Secret and I love this monomer.
