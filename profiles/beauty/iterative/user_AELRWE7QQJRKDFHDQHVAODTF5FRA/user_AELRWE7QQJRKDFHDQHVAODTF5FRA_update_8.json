I have like 15 pairs of scissors and they're all dull so I figured I'd give these a try! I'm soo glad I did, I have nothing I dislike or don't love and I always have something I dislike usually lol. These have cute little blue gems and are really sharp and do a great job they're comfortable for my little hands and my chubby fingers! So excited to use them at work tommorrow!!! They have a nice weight to them I would expect to pay like $50+ for these atleast so I am blown away. I'm so glad I chose these!!\nReview Title: Good buy- Licensed pro going on 11 years!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
