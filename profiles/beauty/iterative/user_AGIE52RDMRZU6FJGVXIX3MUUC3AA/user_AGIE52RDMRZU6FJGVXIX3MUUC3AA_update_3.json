The length is up to my belly button which is consider very long. It's hard to manage sometimes because I don't like shampoo that weighs my hair down or make them tangled.<br /><br />This argan oil shampoo smells very good but I prefer something that is not scented with chemicals which are labeled as &#34;parfum&#34;<br />The scent don't really bother me. The texture is nice and not too thick. Lathers up my hair nicely with a quarter size. Since I have a lot of hair, I have to use a quarter size or more. I scratch and rub my scalp for about 30-50 seconds before I rinse in a bucket. This helps me to clean my hair even better. Instead of just rinse form the shower, which dandruff can still stick in my hair.<br />I am quite impressed with the result. My hair is not too dry not oily at all but moisturized. It feels silky with some volume and smells great.\nReview Title: It's hard to manage sometimes because I don't like shampoo that weighs my hair down or make them ...\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
