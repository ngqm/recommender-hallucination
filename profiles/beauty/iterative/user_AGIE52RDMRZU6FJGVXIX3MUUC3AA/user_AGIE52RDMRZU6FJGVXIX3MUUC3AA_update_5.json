Very sweet but not fruity. It reminds me of when I used to eat the fruit in the summer time. So refreshing and sweet. It's a touch of summer! I have to try not to lick it away when I apply it on my lips.\nThis is by most one of my favorite flavors because it tastes JUST like the fruit\nSALE! Lighted Makeup Mirror for Travel and Home 10x 1x Vanity Mirror with BONUS Eyebrow Tweezers\n{'Package Dimensions': '5.2 x 4.8 x 2.2 inches; 12 Ounces'}\nThis is an unique mirror. I have yet to see one like this. The mirror came with a standard tweezer. Not the best but can't complain.<br /><br />It is very well made and high quality. There are two mirrors; enlargement and normal. Very well designed for applying makeup because of light.<br />A good size. Neither too big or small. Travel friendly and great for those messy desks ;)<br />Adjustable and very light weigh.<br /><br />The mirror has 3 slots for batteries. To open the cover on the bottom you have to turn the circular plate.<br />Three slides for lighting option; top mirror light, and bottom.

The length is up to my belly button which is consider very long. It's hard to manage sometimes because I don't like shampoo that weighs my hair down or make them tangled.<br /><br />This argan oil shampoo smells very good but I prefer something that is not scented with chemicals which are labeled as &#34;parfum&#34;<br />The scent don't really bother me. The texture is nice and not too thick. Lathers up my hair nicely with a quarter size. Since I have a lot of hair, I have to use a quarter size or more. I scratch and rub my scalp for about 30-50 seconds before I rinse in a bucket. This helps me to clean my hair even better. Instead of just rinse form the shower, which dandruff can still stick in my hair.<br />I am quite impressed with the result. My hair is not too dry not oily at all but moisturized. It feels silky with some volume and smells great.\nIt's hard to manage sometimes because I don't like shampoo that weighs my hair down or make them ...\nSeya Beauty Pro Makeup Train Case with Dual Tray Removable & Adjustable Plastic Dividers (Black with Silver Trim)\nSeya\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '15.3 x 9.5 x 9 inches; 6.05 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'TS04SBKF', 'UPC': '784190959972'}\nThis case is extremely sturdy with a downfall: it's too heavy.<br />It has these two closures but there is no security because there is no code pad or lock. The trays opens up which adds an organized compartment.\nPlenty of room\nWEBEAUTY Makeup Brushes Set 10 Pieces Premium Synthetic Foundation Brush Blending Face Powder Blush Concealers Eye Shadows+ Bonus Blender Sponge + Brush Egg + Travel Makeup Bag (10+3pcs) Gift For Lady\nWEBEAUTY\n{'Brand': 'WEBEAUTY', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'For Concealing, For Blush, For Foundation', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Item Form': 'Wand', 'Number of Pieces': '10', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Ferrule Material': 'Aluminum', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '9.9 x 5.2 x 1.9 inches; 10.41 Ounces', 'UPC': '772629967834'}\nThese are your basic and pretty much must haves makeup brushes.
