I like that it's got the multiple colors, I personally haven't had many that do. The length and style combined with the colors is a lot of fun. It sheds a little. I try to be careful with the ends as they've been a little tangly but it's a costume wig so I often experience that with other costume wigs, especially with length and curls. Overall I really like it and think it looks good\nReview Title: Fun and pretty!\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

It's bulky but not heavy and comfortable to wear- even for hours at a time. The mic is a good length and able to bend a bit, if needed. The cord seems durable and connected well to the PS4 controller. The controls for the headset itself all work good. All around, a good headset \ud83d\udc4d\nAll around, a good headset\nPadded Rhinestone Crystal Headband Bejewled Wide Velvet Hairband Statement Bridal Wedding Party Headwear Hair Hoop Hair Accessories (rainbow)\nJERTOCLE\n{'Color': 'Gold,Silver,Rainbow', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material': 'Pearl, Cloth, Rhinestone, Crystal', 'Fabric Type': 'Velvet', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '6.2 x 5.4 x 1.85 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'UPC': '783911261158'}\nThis is definitely a statement headband!

I wouldn't say it's in bad shape but I feel it is for being in mid 30s. Having health stuff going on, former daily tanning machine user, former smoker and my weight goes up-and-down- all things that have contributed to my skin changes and my neck is no exception. This cream is soothing and leaves a lot of moisturize but not a lot of goop. I feel like my skin looks smoother, though I'm sure more consistent and long-term use will bring the most benefits and results. The texture of it is so creamy and thick and feels great on!
