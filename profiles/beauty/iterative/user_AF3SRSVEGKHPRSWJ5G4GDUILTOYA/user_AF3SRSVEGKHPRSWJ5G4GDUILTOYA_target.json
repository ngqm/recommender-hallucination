  "reference_summary": "AUGNORYE 13 Pcs Hair Cutting Scissors Kit, Professional Hair Barber Scissors Kit with Thinning Shears, Home Hair Shears for Women, Men, Kids\nAUGNORYE\n{'Brand': 'AUGNORYE', 'Included Components': 'Scissors', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Blade Material': 'Stainless Steel'}\nI really only wanted this for the cape and the scissors and the scissors are decent.  I've been using them to shape the recent hair cut I gave myself.  They are sharp and have a good weight to them.  I have not used the thinning shears yet so I cannot speak to them.  The other items in the kit are all pretty basic and cheap.  I gave the thin plastic combs to my daughter to use with her dolls.  The cape is thin and the strings in the back for tying seem flimsy.  One of the strings is way to too making tying difficult.  I have not had a need for any of the other items.  I do like the storage case though...a nice compact way to keep everything together and easy to find when it is needed.\nI like the scissors\n2 Pack Hair Towel Wrap Turban Microfiber Drying Shower and Bath, Twist Head Towels with Button, Magic Quick Dryer, Hair Care for Women and Girls, One Wrap Plus One Cap and Two Velvet Hair Bands\nMEETWIN\n{}\nA lot of quality in these products.  Extremely soft like a blanket or child's plush making it very comfortable to use and no stress or tension on the hair. The turbine has been great for my daughter. Much easier to get on her thick hair after it has been freshly washed. The twist towels always hurt her ears and since I wash her hair in the shower, getting her towel wrapped head in a tee shirt could at times be difficult.  The turbine is easy on her ears and comfy all over. It isn't bulky making it easier to get dressed with it on after a shower.<br />I use the wrap towel and it works great. Really soaks up the excess water. The button and elastic loop are sturdy, they don't feel like they will fall off or snap from regular use. The scrunchies are a bonus. They too are soft and velvety. Not needed for my hair styles or my daughter's really she still loves them even just to wear on her wrist.<br />I have multiple wrapping hair towels but these are my new favorites.\nSoft and comfortable\nBarber Hair Cutting Cape for Men Women, Made with Ultra Soft Silk Fiber, 63\" x 57\"\nSmoTecQ\n{'Package Dimensions': '11.8 x 9.2 x 0.7 inches; 4.8 Ounces'}\nWorks well. Full coverage and easy to use closure- hook and eye on stretchy elastic. I don't know about it being \"ultra soft\", it feels like most hair cutting capes...kind of plastic like. Works for my family's needs.\nDoes the job\n5pcs Nail Art Liner Brushes, Lystaii Dual-ended Painting Nail Design Brush Pen Include Liner Brushes and Dotting Pen Nail Art Point Drill Drawing Brush Double Ended Dotting Tools Set 5,7,9,11,14mm\nLystaii\n{'Package Dimensions': '9.41 x 3.86 x 0.75 inches; 1.41 Ounces'}\nI don't paint my nails often, but I do like the change a little polish can bring to my look. I have just made my first attempt at using gel polish and I am loving the results and longevity gels provide. I did a few simple polka dots on my nails to test out these nail tools. It worked out just fine.  I like that the glitter is inside the base so that the outside is smooth to the touch. The different colors also makes it easy to differentiate between the various sizes at a glance. Next time I'll use the brush end to add some stripes. The metal end was easy to clean with just the wipe of a cotton ball. I'll clean the brush side with soap a water when using gels and acetone when using regular polish.\nEasy to use for a beginner\nMicrofiber Hair Towels - 5 Towel Set \u2013 5 Beautiful Colors - Great for all Hair Types - Size (10 x 26 inches) Lightweight, Absorbent, and Ultra Soft. Colors Rose, Pink, Gray, Blue, and Lilac.\nAViBNiUM\n{'Brand': 'AViBNiUM', 'Towel form type': 'Hair Towel', 'Age Range (Description)': 'All Ages', 'Material': 'Microfiber', 'Product Dimensions': '26\"L x 10\"W', 'Package Dimensions': '13 x 10 x 3 inches; 1.06 Pounds', 'UPC': '860005528004'}\nLight weight, absorbent and wash and dry well. Very soft and comfortable to wear. The elastic hoop and be a little annoying to get around the button when working blindly, but not enough to dislike these hair towels.\nSoft and drying\nThink Nature Orange Blossom Shampoo, No Sulfate Paraben, All hair types16.9fl.oz(500ml)\nthink nature\n{'Brand': 'Think nature', 'Item Form': 'Foam', 'Hair Type': 'All Hair Types16.9fl.oz,All Hair Types', 'Scent': 'Citrus,Orange', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '3.1 x 2.7 x 7.8 inches; 1.06 Pounds'}\nThis smells amazing. It is very gentle. I find that I need to lather more than once to get that clean feeling that I'm looking for though. The scent is a light citrus.\nSmells amazing\nCuckoo Face Makeup Oil-Absorbing Volcanic Face Roller,Jade Roller Set Facial Beauty Tools,Face Roller Skin Massager for Face\nCuckoo\n['Cuckoo Face Makeup Oil-Absorbing Volcanic Face Roller& Jade Roller', 'Why choose Cuckoo?', 'Cuckoo has one pc of Oil-Absorbing Volcanic Face Roller and one pc of Jade roller.  The oil-absorbing volcanic face roller can help you absorb excess grease and keep your skin fresh and shiny at all times.  The jade roller can improve skin circulation, soothes your skin, reducing puffiness, wrinkling and fine lines to smooth your skin.', 'Advantage Of Oil-Absorbing Volcanic Face Roller', 'Prefect Oil Absorption Effect', 'Like oil-absorbing paper, but better.\\xa0Roll through your face with volcanic stone balls to instantly absorb excess grease and keep your skin fresh and shiny at all times.', 'Reusable Use', 'Unlike blotting papers for oily skin that are used once and thrown out, this oil-absorbing roller is easy to clean make it reusable.', 'Special Design', 'Built-in special ball design, rolling is silkier and easier, gently or wherever the skin is shiny, rolling the face rollers.\\xa0The oil on the face will disappear.', 'Easy To Carry', 'You don\u2019t have to go rooting around your purse for blotting papers anymore.', 'Advantage Of Jade Roller', 'Natural Rose Quartz Jade', 'Natural approach to caring the skin, no dyes, sulfates, parabens or other chemicals.

Small and compact about as tall as a tube of chap stick just wider.  I keep it with me to use on my tzone and it really does the trick.  Quicker and easier than blotting with a papertowel.  The real test will come this summer.  Comes with a second roller which is nice.\nShine free\nOlnamo Deovie Flatulent Odor Destroyer pads Deodorant Sheet for IBS\n\uff4f\uff4c\uff4e\uff41\uff4d\uff4f\n{'Brand': '\uff4f\uff4c\uff4e\uff41\uff4d\uff4f', 'Item Form': 'sheet', 'Scent': 'Coconut', 'Product Dimensions': '0.4 x 3.2 x 5.9 inches; 1.13 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'olnamo'}\nGreat gag gift for a family member.
