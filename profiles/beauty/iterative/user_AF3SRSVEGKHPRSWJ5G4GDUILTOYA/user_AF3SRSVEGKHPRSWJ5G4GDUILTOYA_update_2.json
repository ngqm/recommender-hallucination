Extremely soft like a blanket or child's plush making it very comfortable to use and no stress or tension on the hair. The turbine has been great for my daughter. Much easier to get on her thick hair after it has been freshly washed. The twist towels always hurt her ears and since I wash her hair in the shower, getting her towel wrapped head in a tee shirt could at times be difficult.  The turbine is easy on her ears and comfy all over. It isn't bulky making it easier to get dressed with it on after a shower.<br />I use the wrap towel and it works great. Really soaks up the excess water. The button and elastic loop are sturdy, they don't feel like they will fall off or snap from regular use. The scrunchies are a bonus. They too are soft and velvety. Not needed for my hair styles or my daughter's really she still loves them even just to wear on her wrist.<br />I have multiple wrapping hair towels but these are my new favorites.\nReview Title: Soft and comfortable\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I've been using them to shape the recent hair cut I gave myself.  They are sharp and have a good weight to them.  I have not used the thinning shears yet so I cannot speak to them.  The other items in the kit are all pretty basic and cheap.  I gave the thin plastic combs to my daughter to use with her dolls.  The cape is thin and the strings in the back for tying seem flimsy.  One of the strings is way to too making tying difficult.  I have not had a need for any of the other items.  I do like the storage case though...a nice compact way to keep everything together and easy to find when it is needed.\nI like the scissors\n2 Pack Hair Towel Wrap Turban Microfiber Drying Shower and Bath, Twist Head Towels with Button, Magic Quick Dryer, Hair Care for Women and Girls, One Wrap Plus One Cap and Two Velvet Hair Bands\nMEETWIN\n{}\nA lot of quality in these products.
