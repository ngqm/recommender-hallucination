It's been a hard adjustment.  I know no cream or non surgical option will give me results like surgery would.  The cooper's ligaments once stretched will not suddenly retract from a serum.<br />This serum is light and easy to apply.  It does not irritate my sensitive skin and leaves it moisturized.  I also use a hyaluronic serum.<br />That being said I have noticed a small improvement.  They look a little fuller, not a measurable difference but to my eye they look a little less sad.  This in theory increases estrogen activity locally to increase the fullness of the breast tissue.  This will not replace a surgical breast lift but for minor changes it works for me.\nReview Title: Subtle changes\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

It's easy to use and looks natural.  It has a good weight to it.  It even came with some eyelashes.\nGood color\nDreamemo 48W UV LED Nail Lamp, with 4 Timer Setting, Professional Pink Nail Dryer for Gel Nail Polish Gel Nail Starter Kit for Fingernail and Toenail Curing\nDreamemo\n{'Style': 'Traditional', 'Brand': 'Dreamemo', 'Light Source Type': 'LED', 'Wattage': '48 watts', 'Pattern': 'Solid', 'Package Dimensions': '11.26 x 8.58 x 4.37 inches; 1.63 Pounds'}\nLove this.  Great for nails and those of use who might be a little clumsy and \"miss\" the opening smearing polish on the light. Works great.  Lots of nails in it's future.\nwide opening\nSam&Helen Magnetic Eyelashes With Eyeliner Kit, 5Pairs Magnetic Eyelashes And 2 Tubes Magnetic Eyeliners With Eyelash Applicator-No Glue Needed\nSam&Helen\n{'Brand': 'Sam&Helen', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '5.51 x 5.71 x 0.63 inches', 'Material Feature': 'Gluten Free', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Mounting Type': 'Eyelash Glue', 'Product Dimensions': '5.51 x 5.71 x 0.63 inches; 2.4 Ounces'}\nI have a few friends who have tried similar products and I was curious.  The liner is thick and has almost a rubbery feel.  Even with makeup remover I found it quite challenging to remove.  Make sure to mix it before applying.  It took me three coats to get the lashes to stay.  Make sure to let it dry all the way.  The lash options are helpful to get the right look.\nchallenging to remove\nEmilia Hypoallergenic Bath Oil for Babies - Paraben-Free Natural Baby Wash Enriched With Natural Oat Extract, Sunflower, Sweet Almond, Sesame, Calendula, and Chamomile 8.5 fl.oz.\nEmilia\n{'Brand': 'Emilia', 'Scent': 'Chamomile', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Unit Count': '8.5 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.81 x 2.05 x 1.85 inches; 8.78 Ounces'}\nI really like the smell.  It is easy to add to my daughters bath and she comes out soft and ready for night time.  It leaves her skin soft but not oily and doesn't cause her sensitive skin any trouble.\nRelaxing\nLAPOTHICELL Blemish Out Cream 50ml, Face Moisturizer, improves uneven skin tone.\nLAPOTHICELL\n{'Brand': 'LAPOTHICELL', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Type': 'Acne Prone', 'Product Dimensions': '2.36 x 2.36 x 2.36 inches; 3.42 Ounces'}\nI've fallen in love with a couple Korean beauty products so I was excited to try this one.  It came in a cute little pink box.  The outside of the container was clean.  I have combination skin and I am prone to hormonal breakouts.  Using this twice a day seems to help my blemishes heal faster and not get as bad.  My skin feels very healthy after using this regularly.  I have sensitive skin and have not had any problems.\nGreat for blemishes\nEZ Detangler Brush, Morgles 2 Pack Detangling Brush for Curly Hair Ez Hair Detangling Brush for Afro America/ African Hair 3a to 4c Wavy Hair\nMORGLES\n{'Brand': 'MORGLES', 'Shape': 'Oblong', 'Handle Material': 'Rubber', 'Unit Count': '2.00 Count', 'Hair Type': 'Curly,Wavy,Thick', 'Product Dimensions': '9.69 x 2.99 x 1.38 inches; 6.38 Ounces'}\nReally easy to use brush that is great for all hair types.  My daughter has curly hair and this brush makes it so much easier to brush her hair.  She is more willing to sit for me to brush and style her hair and doesn't complain.  Then she attempts to brush my hair (still developing that skill).\nGreat for tangly hair\nOnkessy Lip Gloss Base Primer for DIY Lip Gloss Make Your Own Lip Gloss DIY Handmade Lip Gloss Glaze Gel Waterproof Non-Stick Cup 50/80ML\nOnkessy\n{'Brand': 'Onkessy', 'Product Benefits': 'Softening,Smoothening', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Matte', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '5.43 x 3.07 x 1.26 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nThe volume is accurate to the ad for the lipgloss base.  It works well, I mix with Shae butter, vitamin e and pigment.  It is a good volume for my daughter and I to make homemade lipgloss but if making gifts or anything more than a handful of tunes this is a small volume.  Mine did not come with the non stick bowl the ad mentions.  It seems a little pricey but works well and my sensitive skin does not react to it.\nWorks well\nSwiss Botany Pueraria Mirifica Breast Lifters for Women - Breast Enlargement Serum with Pure Pueraria Mirifica Oil for Breast Firming, Lifting and Fuller, Bigger Breast - Large 2oz Bottle\nSwiss Botany\n{'Product Dimensions': '2 x 3 x 4 inches; 2 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Swiss Botany'}\nBetween breastfeeding and weightloss my breasts are saggy and not full.
