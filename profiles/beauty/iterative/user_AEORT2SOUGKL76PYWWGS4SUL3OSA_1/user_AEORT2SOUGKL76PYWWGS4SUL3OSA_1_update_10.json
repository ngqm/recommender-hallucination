They are reusable and more comfortable than I expected to wear.  They do not come with eyelash glue.  They come staged on thin white plastic that I use to store them.\nReview Title: Dramatic and easy to use\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

It's easy to use and looks natural.  It has a good weight to it.  It even came with some eyelashes.\nGood color\nDreamemo 48W UV LED Nail Lamp, with 4 Timer Setting, Professional Pink Nail Dryer for Gel Nail Polish Gel Nail Starter Kit for Fingernail and Toenail Curing\nDreamemo\n{'Style': 'Traditional', 'Brand': 'Dreamemo', 'Light Source Type': 'LED', 'Wattage': '48 watts', 'Pattern': 'Solid', 'Package Dimensions': '11.26 x 8.58 x 4.37 inches; 1.63 Pounds'}\nLove this.  Great for nails and those of use who might be a little clumsy and \"miss\" the opening smearing polish on the light. Works great.  Lots of nails in it's future.\nwide opening\nSam&Helen Magnetic Eyelashes With Eyeliner Kit, 5Pairs Magnetic Eyelashes And 2 Tubes Magnetic Eyeliners With Eyelash Applicator-No Glue Needed\nSam&Helen\n{'Brand': 'Sam&Helen', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '5.51 x 5.71 x 0.63 inches', 'Material Feature': 'Gluten Free', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Mounting Type': 'Eyelash Glue', 'Product Dimensions': '5.51 x 5.71 x 0.63 inches; 2.4 Ounces'}\nI have a few friends who have tried similar products and I was curious.  The liner is thick and has almost a rubbery feel.  Even with makeup remover I found it quite challenging to remove.  Make sure to mix it before applying.  It took me three coats to get the lashes to stay.  Make sure to let it dry all the way.  The lash options are helpful to get the right look.\nchallenging to remove\nEmilia Hypoallergenic Bath Oil for Babies - Paraben-Free Natural Baby Wash Enriched With Natural Oat Extract, Sunflower, Sweet Almond, Sesame, Calendula, and Chamomile 8.5 fl.oz.\nEmilia\n{'Brand': 'Emilia', 'Scent': 'Chamomile', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Unit Count': '8.5 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.81 x 2.05 x 1.85 inches; 8.78 Ounces'}\nI really like the smell.  It is easy to add to my daughters bath and she comes out soft and ready for night time.  It leaves her skin soft but not oily and doesn't cause her sensitive skin any trouble.\nRelaxing\nLAPOTHICELL Blemish Out Cream 50ml, Face Moisturizer, improves uneven skin tone.\nLAPOTHICELL\n{'Brand': 'LAPOTHICELL', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Type': 'Acne Prone', 'Product Dimensions': '2.36 x 2.36 x 2.36 inches; 3.42 Ounces'}\nI've fallen in love with a couple Korean beauty products so I was excited to try this one.  It came in a cute little pink box.  The outside of the container was clean.  I have combination skin and I am prone to hormonal breakouts.  Using this twice a day seems to help my blemishes heal faster and not get as bad.  My skin feels very healthy after using this regularly.  I have sensitive skin and have not had any problems.\nGreat for blemishes\nEZ Detangler Brush, Morgles 2 Pack Detangling Brush for Curly Hair Ez Hair Detangling Brush for Afro America/ African Hair 3a to 4c Wavy Hair\nMORGLES\n{'Brand': 'MORGLES', 'Shape': 'Oblong', 'Handle Material': 'Rubber', 'Unit Count': '2.00 Count', 'Hair Type': 'Curly,Wavy,Thick', 'Product Dimensions': '9.69 x 2.99 x 1.38 inches; 6.38 Ounces'}\nReally easy to use brush that is great for all hair types.  My daughter has curly hair and this brush makes it so much easier to brush her hair.  She is more willing to sit for me to brush and style her hair and doesn't complain.  Then she attempts to brush my hair (still developing that skill).\nGreat for tangly hair\nOnkessy Lip Gloss Base Primer for DIY Lip Gloss Make Your Own Lip Gloss DIY Handmade Lip Gloss Glaze Gel Waterproof Non-Stick Cup 50/80ML\nOnkessy\n{'Brand': 'Onkessy', 'Product Benefits': 'Softening,Smoothening', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Matte', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '5.43 x 3.07 x 1.26 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nThe volume is accurate to the ad for the lipgloss base.  It works well, I mix with Shae butter, vitamin e and pigment.  It is a good volume for my daughter and I to make homemade lipgloss but if making gifts or anything more than a handful of tunes this is a small volume.  Mine did not come with the non stick bowl the ad mentions.  It seems a little pricey but works well and my sensitive skin does not react to it.\nWorks well\nSwiss Botany Pueraria Mirifica Breast Lifters for Women - Breast Enlargement Serum with Pure Pueraria Mirifica Oil for Breast Firming, Lifting and Fuller, Bigger Breast - Large 2oz Bottle\nSwiss Botany\n{'Product Dimensions': '2 x 3 x 4 inches; 2 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Swiss Botany'}\nBetween breastfeeding and weightloss my breasts are saggy and not full.  It's been a hard adjustment.  I know no cream or non surgical option will give me results like surgery would.  The cooper's ligaments once stretched will not suddenly retract from a serum.<br />This serum is light and easy to apply.  It does not irritate my sensitive skin and leaves it moisturized.  I also use a hyaluronic serum.<br />That being said I have noticed a small improvement.  They look a little fuller, not a measurable difference but to my eye they look a little less sad.  This in theory increases estrogen activity locally to increase the fullness of the breast tissue.  This will not replace a surgical breast lift but for minor changes it works for me.\nSubtle changes\nKidskin- Foaming Body Wash with Tea Tree Oil- Helps Combat Body and Foot Odor and Stubborn Body Acne and Skin Issues - Cruelty Free, Gluten Free, Paraben Free, Sulfate Free, Unscented, and Vegan- Made in USA\nKidskin\n['Kidskin Foaming Body Wash with Tea Tree Oil is designed exclusively for teens, tweens, pre teens, and boys and girls to work as an effective, yet gentle body wash. Natural ingredients like Allantoin and Bisabolol nourish beyond surface level, and penetrate into the lower levels of the skin for the deepest hydration possible, while active ingredient tea tree oil works to fight body acne and skin issues teens are commonly prone to. Unlike shower bars and other soaps, our products are designed to soothe problematic and compromised skin. With 100% Natural ingredients that are paraben, sulfate, fragrance, and gluten free, the Kidskin Foaming Body Wash with Tea Tree Oil is gentle enough for every day use. Our mission is to provide teens (like our own!) with a body wash that leaves them feeling fresh and confident so they can focus on what really matters- every day. Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Musa Sapientum (Banana) Extract, Polysorbate-20, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, ^ Glycerin, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Sea Salt (Sodium Chloride), Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Allantoin, Bisabolol']\n{'Item Form': 'Bar, Foam', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Brand': 'Kidskin', 'Scent': 'Tea Tree', 'Material Feature': 'Cruelty Free', 'Package Dimensions': '7.83 x 2.83 x 2.24 inches; 8 Ounces', 'Item model number': '4012', 'UPC': '880628401263', 'Manufacturer': 'Kidskin'}\nThis really helped with the acne on my back and left my skin feeling smooth and healthy. It foams out of the pump with the amount I need for a single use.  I keep the cap on it when I am not using it to keep it clean.  So far it is lasting well and I have been using it for several weeks as a daily wash.  It does not dry my skin out.\nAwesome\nKISSNOWY Manga Lashes Natural Look , Single Individual Lashes Wispy Cluster Lashes Extension for Cosplay Japanese Anime Makeup False Lashes (F-01)\nKISSNOWY\n{'Brand': 'KISSNOWY', 'Material': 'Faux,Faux Mink,Mink', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '0.39 inches', 'Material Feature': 'Cruelty Free', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Item model number': '6D-05', 'UPC': '608018540503 608576075066'}\nThese are on the dramatic side for me but not the most dramatic ones I've used.  They are reusable and more comfortable than I expected to wear.  They do not come with eyelash glue.  They come staged on thin white plastic that I use to store them.\nDramatic and easy to use",
