It works well, I mix with Shae butter, vitamin e and pigment.  It is a good volume for my daughter and I to make homemade lipgloss but if making gifts or anything more than a handful of tunes this is a small volume.  Mine did not come with the non stick bowl the ad mentions.  It seems a little pricey but works well and my sensitive skin does not react to it.\nReview Title: Works well\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

The liner is thick and has almost a rubbery feel.  Even with makeup remover I found it quite challenging to remove.  Make sure to mix it before applying.  It took me three coats to get the lashes to stay.  Make sure to let it dry all the way.  The lash options are helpful to get the right look.\nchallenging to remove\nEmilia Hypoallergenic Bath Oil for Babies - Paraben-Free Natural Baby Wash Enriched With Natural Oat Extract, Sunflower, Sweet Almond, Sesame, Calendula, and Chamomile 8.5 fl.oz.\nEmilia\n{'Brand': 'Emilia', 'Scent': 'Chamomile', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Unit Count': '8.5 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.81 x 2.05 x 1.85 inches; 8.78 Ounces'}\nI really like the smell.  It is easy to add to my daughters bath and she comes out soft and ready for night time.

It came in a cute little pink box.  The outside of the container was clean.  I have combination skin and I am prone to hormonal breakouts.  Using this twice a day seems to help my blemishes heal faster and not get as bad.  My skin feels very healthy after using this regularly.  I have sensitive skin and have not had any problems.\nGreat for blemishes\nEZ Detangler Brush, Morgles 2 Pack Detangling Brush for Curly Hair Ez Hair Detangling Brush for Afro America/ African Hair 3a to 4c Wavy Hair\nMORGLES\n{'Brand': 'MORGLES', 'Shape': 'Oblong', 'Handle Material': 'Rubber', 'Unit Count': '2.00 Count', 'Hair Type': 'Curly,Wavy,Thick', 'Product Dimensions': '9.69 x 2.99 x 1.38 inches; 6.38 Ounces'}\nReally easy to use brush that is great for all hair types.  My daughter has curly hair and this brush makes it so much easier to brush her hair.  She is more willing to sit for me to brush and style her hair and doesn't complain.  Then she attempts to brush my hair (still developing that skill).\nGreat for tangly hair\nOnkessy Lip Gloss Base Primer for DIY Lip Gloss Make Your Own Lip Gloss DIY Handmade Lip Gloss Glaze Gel Waterproof Non-Stick Cup 50/80ML\nOnkessy\n{'Brand': 'Onkessy', 'Product Benefits': 'Softening,Smoothening', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Matte', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '5.43 x 3.07 x 1.26 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nThe volume is accurate to the ad for the lipgloss base.
