The liner is thick and has almost a rubbery feel.  Even with makeup remover I found it quite challenging to remove.  Make sure to mix it before applying.  It took me three coats to get the lashes to stay.  Make sure to let it dry all the way.  The lash options are helpful to get the right look.\nchallenging to remove\nEmilia Hypoallergenic Bath Oil for Babies - Paraben-Free Natural Baby Wash Enriched With Natural Oat Extract, Sunflower, Sweet Almond, Sesame, Calendula, and Chamomile 8.5 fl.oz.\nEmilia\n{'Brand': 'Emilia', 'Scent': 'Chamomile', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Unit Count': '8.5 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.81 x 2.05 x 1.85 inches; 8.78 Ounces'}\nI really like the smell.
