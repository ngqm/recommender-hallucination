But it just won't grow long enough. While shopping around on Amazon, I found this clip in ponytail. And the fact that it's real human hair, and just a smidge off from my natural shade of color, I had to give it a try...I'm so glad I did. Now, I'm the one walking around with my head held high, and my \"ponytail\" swinging. I love it so  much. I HAVE to give this 5 stars, how can I not? It's perfect for me, and if you too have the same problems with your natural hair as I do, you may be just as impressed with this product as I am.\nReview Title: Ponytail\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I passed it on to a friend of mine, who seems to like it. Saying, \"her skin feels so soft and smooth.\"\nSharing with friends\nDaletu Nail Clips, 10PCS Clear Nail Clips Finger Extension Fixed Clip, Quick Building Finger Builder Nail Clamps, Nails Art DIY Manicure Tool\nDaletu\n{'Size': 'Large', 'Brand': 'Daletu', 'Coverage': 'Full Well Tips', 'Number of Pieces': '10', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '4.09 x 3.9 x 2.01 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '738634020063'}\nI use the polygel nails, and from time to time, I need to clip it on to hold it on until it gets completely dry. I got these clips to help aid in holding my nails in place. But for some reason, these clips leave dents in my nails. I  had to redo them totally. 1 star is the lowest  I can go.\nDents in nails\nLuxsea 12 Colors Liquid Eyeliner Kit Matte and Glitter Colorful Cosmetic Pen Set Lasting Highly-Pigmented Extremely Fine Easy to Wear Waterproof Eye Liner Makeup Pen Set\nuxsea\n{'Brand': 'uxsea', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Finish Type': 'Metallic,Glitter,Shimmer,Matte', 'Special Feature': 'Waterproof, Matte', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '6.97 x 5.51 x 0.55 inches; 0.71 Ounces'}\nThe colors and very pretty. But when putting the liner on my eyes, I dipped the liner in the color, and went to apply it to my eye, but it's just not that great. It starts out going on smoothly, but its like it dries out mid stride across my lid. So other than the beautiful colors, I have nothing more good to say about these liquid eyeliners.\nToo Fast Drying Liner\nWaxing Kit,Wax Warmer Hair Removal for Women Men,upgrade Portable Wax Kit with Scented Hard Wax Beans,Wax Machine for sensitive skin Full Body at home waxing or on vacation\nJAPUSOON\n{'Item Form': 'Wax', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Brand': 'JAPUSOON', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '7.52 x 7.4 x 5.2 inches; 1.41 Pounds', 'UPC': '750440491196'}\nIt could warm the wax up a little quicker.

One long hair, because I used to have long hair. That was a BIG NOPE! So I seen this one, It being the color of my natural hair, and shorter, I thought I would give it a try...Still a NOPE! Maybe I just cannot wear a wig...or maybe just not yet. I do still have hair. To me, it seems I'm about bald, but to others I've still got plenty of hair...I don't know, I'm just used to having hair, and I want hair, so I was trying this wig to rush along my need of something to give me hair, when I'm truly not ready for it yet. Because it's a nice wig, nice color, length and style, I rate this wig with 4 stars. It's not the wigs fault I'm not ready.\nNot for me\nVlasy Ponytail Extension Human Hair Black Brown Wrap Around Clip in Ponytail Hair Extensions Real Human Hair Long Straight Ponytail Hairpiece Easy Wearing 16 Inch\nVlasy\n{'Brand': 'Vlasy', 'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Extension Length': '16 Inches', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '10.87 x 3.7 x 0.67 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nI  have very short hair and just cannot get it to grow past my shoulders, no matter what I do...<br />I see all these ladies walking around with these cute ponytails hanging, and it makes me so sad, I just wish I could put my hair into one.
