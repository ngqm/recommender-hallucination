But when putting the liner on my eyes, I dipped the liner in the color, and went to apply it to my eye, but it's just not that great. It starts out going on smoothly, but its like it dries out mid stride across my lid. So other than the beautiful colors, I have nothing more good to say about these liquid eyeliners.\nReview Title: Too Fast Drying Liner\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

  "profile": "The user demonstrates a strong preference for natural and organic skincare products, particularly those focused on moisturizing and nourishing properties. They favor body scrubs with natural exfoliators to achieve smooth, soft skin. Recent interactions reveal a cautious approach to product selection due to past adverse reactions, notably a rash, which indicates sensitivity to certain formulations. This concern is highlighted by a low rating given to a product that failed to meet their performance expectations.\n\nAdditionally, the user values sharing experiences with friends, often passing unsuitable products to others who can benefit from them, reflecting a communal aspect to their preferences for effective and recommendable items. A new interest in nail care has emerged, with the user purchasing clips for polygel nails, although they encountered issues that resulted in dents in their nails, leading to a very low rating. \n\nIn a more recent interaction, the user purchased a set of liquid eyeliners, noting their appealing colors but ultimately expressing dissatisfaction with the product due to its quick drying time when applied, resulting in a low rating. This underscores their continued emphasis on product performance and gentleness, while also illustrating a broader interest in various beauty products, all while maintaining their cautious approach to suitability and effectiveness.",
