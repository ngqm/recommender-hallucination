When I saw that these masks can help with dry eyes I had to give it a try. This has quickly become my favorite part of my nighttime routine.  It is so relaxing I think I could sleep with it on. I do wish it got a bit hotter but I guess they don't want you to burn your eyes.\nReview Title: Love this!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Its actually made me kind of lazy cleaning my brushes because it does such a great job getting all the makeup off. The little silicone brush thingy is pretty useful.

I never really use drug store eyeshadow and to be honest I don't think I have any in my collection.  But if this is the quality I can expect then that is about to change. I'm so impressed with the performance of these shadows! Most of the shades are buttery smooth and pigmented.  The mattes blend out so easily and I didn't get any patchiness. You do have to build these up but that is not necessarily a bad thing. There was quite a bit of kick up in the pan but I didn't get any fallout at all.  This color story is beautiful and even if you aren't a fan of colorful eyeshadow there's still lots to work with. I am very much looking forward to trying more palettes from this brand.\nI'm impressed!\nseedling Heated Eye Mask for Dry Eyes, Eye Compress Moist Heat, Silk sleep mask for dry eye relief, Plant Extract Warm Compress for Eyes, Stye Eye Therapy Mask (Blue)\nSeedling\n{'Brand': 'Seedling', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '9.2 x 4.2 x 0.6 inches', 'Product Dimensions': '9.2 x 4.2 x 0.6 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'M', 'Manufacturer': 'seedling', 'Country of Origin': 'China'}\n[[VIDEOID:36d4410bf57b9b8fc73b6e62a0e7688b]] I've been dealing with dry eyes for a couple years now and I wear contacts so it can get pretty uncomfortable.
