I never really use drug store eyeshadow and to be honest I don't think I have any in my collection.  But if this is the quality I can expect then that is about to change. I'm so impressed with the performance of these shadows! Most of the shades are buttery smooth and pigmented.  The mattes blend out so easily and I didn't get any patchiness. You do have to build these up but that is not necessarily a bad thing. There was quite a bit of kick up in the pan but I didn't get any fallout at all.  This color story is beautiful and even if you aren't a fan of colorful eyeshadow there's still lots to work with. I am very much looking forward to trying more palettes from this brand.\nReview Title: I'm impressed!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
