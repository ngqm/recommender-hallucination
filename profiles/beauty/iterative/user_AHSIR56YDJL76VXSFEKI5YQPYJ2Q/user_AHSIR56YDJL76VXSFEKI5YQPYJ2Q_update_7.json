I've got dry skin pretty much all the time and gets much worse in winter.  I've tried other oils but I didn't like the way they made my skin feel afterwards.  I hate it when my skin feels sticky and that's usually the way I feel after most oils and even moisturizers.  Not this though, it softens and moisturizes in the shower but it doesn't leave any stickiness behind. It does have a scent. I think it smells nice but if you're sensitive to fragrance this could be a problem for you.  I really love this product but I do think it's pretty expensive for the amount you get.\nReview Title: It's really great even though it's overpriced\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Its actually made me kind of lazy cleaning my brushes because it does such a great job getting all the makeup off. The little silicone brush thingy is pretty useful.  It definitely helps me get my brushes clean faster.\nIt works\nSalux Nylon Japanese Beauty Skin Bath Wash Cloth/Towel - White2PACK\nSALUX\n['Beauty Skin Cloth is great for your skin.

Even my husband loves them and I can never get him to exfoliate. It feels so great to wash with this.  If you like body scrubs i highly recommend try this because it is so much better.\nExfoliate everywhere!\nessence | Welcome to London Eyeshadow Palette | 12 Highly Pigmented, Matte & Metallic Blendable Shades | Vegan & Cruelty Free | Free From Oil, Fragrance, Parabens, Alcohol, & Microplastic Particles\nessence cosmetics\n{'Brand': 'Essence cosmetics', 'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Finish Type': 'Metallic, Matte', 'Special Feature': 'Cruelty Free', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Product Dimensions': '6.73 x 2.52 x 0.47 inches; 0.46 Ounces', 'Item model number': '934871', 'Manufacturer': 'Cosnova'}\nThis is my first time using essence eyeshadow and it will definitely not be my last. I never really use drug store eyeshadow and to be honest I don't think I have any in my collection.  But if this is the quality I can expect then that is about to change. I'm so impressed with the performance of these shadows! Most of the shades are buttery smooth and pigmented.  The mattes blend out so easily and I didn't get any patchiness. You do have to build these up but that is not necessarily a bad thing. There was quite a bit of kick up in the pan but I didn't get any fallout at all.  This color story is beautiful and even if you aren't a fan of colorful eyeshadow there's still lots to work with. I am very much looking forward to trying more palettes from this brand.\nI'm impressed!\nseedling Heated Eye Mask for Dry Eyes, Eye Compress Moist Heat, Silk sleep mask for dry eye relief, Plant Extract Warm Compress for Eyes, Stye Eye Therapy Mask (Blue)\nSeedling\n{'Brand': 'Seedling', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '9.2 x 4.2 x 0.6 inches', 'Product Dimensions': '9.2 x 4.2 x 0.6 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'M', 'Manufacturer': 'seedling', 'Country of Origin': 'China'}\n[[VIDEOID:36d4410bf57b9b8fc73b6e62a0e7688b]] I've been dealing with dry eyes for a couple years now and I wear contacts so it can get pretty uncomfortable.  When I saw that these masks can help with dry eyes I had to give it a try. This has quickly become my favorite part of my nighttime routine.  It is so relaxing I think I could sleep with it on. I do wish it got a bit hotter but I guess they don't want you to burn your eyes.\nLove this!\nBaboo Kids Bamboo Toothbrush Soft Bristles - BPA Free Activated Charcoal - Organic Wooden Baby Tooth Brush - Eco-Friendly Biodegradable Toothbrushes for Toddlers, Child and Babies\nBABOO\n{'Brand': 'BABOO', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Kid', 'Special Feature': 'Charcoal Infused Bristle', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Item Firmness Description': 'Ultra Soft', 'Product Dimensions': '5.12 x 0.44 x 0.44 inches; 0.42 Ounces', 'UPC': '869003000444', 'Material Feature': 'Biodegradable Warning', 'Manufacturer': 'Baboo'}\nThis is the cutest little toothbrush.  It's a little less than 6\" long.  It's the perfect size for small hands. The bristles are super soft so it won't be too rough on the kiddos. I like that they're black, I've never seen that before. The bamboo feels smooth and I'm not seeing any splintering so far.\nPerfect for little hands\nVitamasques Multivitamin Sleeping Mask Made with Essential Vitamins & Multi-Molecular Hyaluronic Acid for Healthy, Nourished & Hydrated Skin - Vegan, Free from Parabens & Gluten\nVitamasques\n{'Brand': 'Vitamasques', 'Scent': 'Hyaluronic Acid', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Unit Count': '1.0 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '5.98 x 2.36 x 1.57 inches; 2.08 Ounces', 'UPC': '750258970081'}\n[[VIDEOID:890fbc174078c15263a7f9bc618c3905]] I've tried several things from this brand and so far this one is my favorite.  I'm surprised because I didn't expect to like it but I really enjoy it.  I've been using it after Thierry night cream.  It is really wet when you put it on. The little colored balls rub into your skin when you're applying.  It dries down and soaks into my skin so fast.  Plus it smells really good.  I love that it's a sleeping mask and you don't have to wash it off. I've got dry skin and the night cream alone wasn't enough moisture for me but adding this on top is so much better.\nLove this\nTropic Labs Washed Up All-In-One Shower Oil | Gentle Cleansing Body Wash, Bath Oil, & Shaving Oil | Sulfate-Free Body Oil Wash | Skin Moisturizing Body Rinse | Lightweight, Vegan & Cruelty-Free (TSA Friendly)\nTropic Labs\n{}\nI love this oil!
