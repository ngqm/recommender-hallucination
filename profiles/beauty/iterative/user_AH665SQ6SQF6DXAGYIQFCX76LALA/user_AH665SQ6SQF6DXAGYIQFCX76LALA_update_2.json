My hair is fine and color treated and is frequently subjected to heat from dryers and curling irons. This did leave it feeling soft and looking healthy. However it didn't do much to refresh my style and the fragrance is strong. It is not an unpleasant aroma, sweet like baby powder and light musk, but not my favorite. It is strong and it lasts all day. The bottle tucks easily into a bag or briefcase and the spray functions smoothly. I wish it either had a difference scent or was fragrance free. I appreciate the exclusion of mineral oil, petrolaltum or artificial coloring. It is an effective product that provides relief to stressed locks.\nReview Title: Helps Hair Look Healthier\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I was not happy as I was leaving for a trip with some important meetings the next day.  I could live without the cut but not the roots.  In desperation I purchased this product and boy was I pleased. The kit comes with directions, the usual skimpy gloves, a small bottle of color and activator.  It mixes easily.  The sponge applicator provides good control.  The product sits for ten minutes (fifteen if you have hard to color hair or alot of gray), rinse out, shampoo and style. Initially I was concerned that the color was too dark but it was great, blended beautifully with my expensive salon color.  It looked as good as what I get at the salon and without the attitude and expense.
