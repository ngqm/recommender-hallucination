I was not happy as I was leaving for a trip with some important meetings the next day.  I could live without the cut but not the roots.  In desperation I purchased this product and boy was I pleased. The kit comes with directions, the usual skimpy gloves, a small bottle of color and activator.  It mixes easily.  The sponge applicator provides good control.  The product sits for ten minutes (fifteen if you have hard to color hair or alot of gray), rinse out, shampoo and style. Initially I was concerned that the color was too dark but it was great, blended beautifully with my expensive salon color.  It looked as good as what I get at the salon and without the attitude and expense.

My hair is fine and color treated and is frequently subjected to heat from dryers and curling irons. This did leave it feeling soft and looking healthy. However it didn't do much to refresh my style and the fragrance is strong. It is not an unpleasant aroma, sweet like baby powder and light musk, but not my favorite. It is strong and it lasts all day. The bottle tucks easily into a bag or briefcase and the spray functions smoothly. I wish it either had a difference scent or was fragrance free. I appreciate the exclusion of mineral oil, petrolaltum or artificial coloring. It is an effective product that provides relief to stressed locks.\nHelps Hair Look Healthier\nDr. Yates MD - Keratin Fiber, Premium Hair Enhancing Replenishing Fibers (Dark Brown, 0.42 oz)\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.24 x 2.95 x 1.85 inches; 2.75 Ounces'}\nLike most of these product it is a tad fussy and messy. Practice definitely makes perfect and less is more. the dark brown color is pretty good. If you sprinkle it too thickly it looks artificial. It does give the appearance of fuller hair and masks bare scalp to some extent. the fibers need hair to adhere to so it will be of  no use to those who are bald. I tried it without any spray or holding solution. It adhered fine. The dry particles do brush off without staining. It doesn't run down your face if you sweat but removes easily with shampoo. There is definitely a learning curve to application and it is important to get a close match to your natural color. 3.5\nUse a Light Hand\nSTYLEAGAL False Eyelashes - 4 Pairs Multipack Natural 3D False Eyelashes Natural Thick Hand-Made Faux Mink Eyelashes Extension(G106)\nstyleagal\n{'Brand': 'styleagal', 'Material': 'Faux Mink', 'Material Feature': 'Cruelty Free', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Mounting Type': 'Eyelash Glue', 'Package Dimensions': '6.6 x 3.8 x 0.3 inches; 0.63 Ounces'}\nThese nicely made lashes add drama. Perfect  for special occasions they have length and volume. The black band is flexible. My own lashes are rather sparse so these make a big (and wonderful) difference. But I need something less dramatic for daily use. These are good, reusable, and comfortable on. The glue is NOT included.\nPerfect for Special Occasions\nMagnetic Eyelashes and Magnetic Eyeliner kit, 5 Pairs of Reusable 3D 5D Lashes, Eyelashes with Natural Look, Upgraded Waterproof Magnetic Eyeliner, Easy to Use-No Glue Needed\nLUO&YL\n{'Brand': 'LUO&YL', 'Material Feature': 'Glue Free', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Mounting Type': 'Eyelash Glue', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '5.94 x 5.87 x 0.91 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '791324774387'}\nWith all the mandatory mask-wearing, attention is on the eyes. These lashes are e4asys to apply. The lashes themselves are quite nice and there is a variety that will fit the mood and occasion, from daytime to date night.  If you are adept with liquid eyeliner you will have no problem with the liner. It takes a little practice but once mastered the lashes stay in place. They don't look or feel any different than the usual false lashes. I like them.\nEasy Application\nYanJie Velvet Stretched Button Headband Holder for Nurse Mask Women/Girls/Men 6 Package, Leopard Black Gray Velvet ,Protect your Ear Headband 20inch (Leopard)\nYanJie\n{'Color': 'Gray', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material': 'Velvet', 'Fabric Type': 'Velvet', 'Number of Items': '6', 'Package Dimensions': '9.13 x 6.34 x 1.46 inches; 4.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '788381037319'}\nI really like these velvet hair bands. They are stylish and the buttons are positioned perfectly. They hold my mask securely without slipping or aggravating my ears. There is a nice variety of two leopards and three neutrals, cream, black and gray. It was supposed to be a six pack but I only received five. Mine also were not as wide as depicted. But that being said they are a fashion forward way to keep hair and masks in place.\nStylish\n3 Barrel Curling Iron, Milantia 3/4 Inch Mini Travel Curling Wand Hair for Small Curly, Dual Voltage Ceramic Tourmaline 19mm Crimper Hair Iron for Women - Fast Heating, Portable\nMilantia\n{'Shape': 'Barrel', 'Brand': 'Milantia', 'Hair Type': 'All,Thick,Thin', 'Material': 'Ceramic', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Product Dimensions': '9.25 x 1.97 x 1.97 inches; 12.63 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Milantia'}\nI actually like the small size of this curling iron. It gets hot quickly and the temperature is not adjustable. I have fine, color treated hair so using heat protective product is a must with this. It is pretty easy to use. The curls are more like retro style waves. They last a most a day. It is lightweight and ideal for travel.\nMini Iron\nKOMMOK Curling Iron Wand 1 Inch Hair Curler Barrel Professional Grade with Tourmaline Ceramic Coating, Professional LCD Display 230-410 Degrees Fahrenheit for Thin to coarse Hair, Rose Gold\nKOMMOK\n{'Brand': 'KOMMOK', 'Hair Type': 'Coarse', 'Material': 'Ceramic', 'Max Temperature Setting': '210 Degrees Celsius', 'Heater Surface Material': 'Ceramic', 'Package Dimensions': '15.75 x 5.5 x 2.5 inches; 1.35 Pounds', 'Manufacturer': 'KOMMOK'}\nI have fine color treated  shoulder length hair. This wand is amazing. There is a good range of temperature and a bright LED read out. It warms quickly. Easy to use it creates shiny, healthy looking, long lasting curls. I use the low range and my hair did not look or feel damaged.  I appreciate the long cord.The one inch barrel is perfect for me. It comes with a carrying case, protective glove and two clips. It does take time to cool off though.\nFast & Efficient\nBesame Cosmetics | Forever Red Lipstick - 1925 | Classic Color Lipstick | Vintage Makeup | Long Lasting Lipstick | Semi Matte Lipstick for Women | Moisturizing Lipstick for Sensitive Skin\nBESAME COSMETICS\n{'Brand': 'BESAME COSMETICS', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Finish Type': 'Semi Matte', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Long Lasting,Nourishing,Clean,Moisturizing,Makeup', 'Package Dimensions': '4.45 x 1.14 x 1.06 inches; 0.74 Ounces'}\nI like the red color. It is rich with a vintage feel. A small amount of product comes in a metal tube. There is a leaflet with directions in which they say to use over lip balm. They are not kidding. Although it goes on smooth and creamy it is very drying. The velvet finish is nice but it dries slowly, smudges and transfers. It does not withstand eating and drinking. But my main objection is that it is very drying. My lips felt dry and parched, a little less so after using lip balm.\nDrying\nCodex Labs Skin Hydration Kit | Microbiome Friendly, Vegan, Calendula, Soothing for dry,flaky or itchy skin, Sensitive Skin, EWG\nCodex Beauty\n{'Package Dimensions': '5.1 x 2.8 x 1.5 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nThis set is a goid way to try these products. There are travel sized containers of an exfoliator and a moisturizer and four samples of oils, two cleansing and two nourishing. The exfoiliator has a light fragrance. It is gentle and effective. The moisturizer smells  stronger and less pleasant. It does make skin look and feel soft and smooth. Pricy for what you get but a decent travel set.\nSmall with Fragrance\nOsmotics Eye Lash Enhancing Serum - Eyelash & Brow Growth Serum for Fuller, Healthier and Bolder Looking Lashes - Advanced Formula Formulated with Biotin and Natural Growth Peptides for Longer, Thicker and Darker Eyelashes - Nourishes, Conditions, Strengthen, Enhance, Moisturize and Lengthen Natural Lash and Brows\nOsmotics Cosmeceuticals\n['EYELASH GROWTH SERUM - A revolutionary enhancing serum that promotes the appearance of fuller, bolder-looking Lashes.

The formula nourishes and conditions to promote the appearance of healthier, fuller, and more beautiful-looking lashes. Plus, this lash booster leaves lashes feeling moisturized and longer looking in just 4 weeks. The gentle full lash serum is safe to use around the eyes, just apply it 1-2x daily from root to tip of your lashes. With the included, fine-tip brush applicator, the application is quick and simple.']\n{'Skin Type': 'All', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'Osmotics Cosmeceuticals', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '7.83 x 2.17 x 2.05 inches; 0.63 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'O OSMOTICS COSMECEUTICALS'}\nThis serum is easy to apply. Fragrance free it is non-irritating.  I used it on both my lashes and brows. After eight weeks there was minimal improvement. It seems to enhance the natural growth cycle. Sparse brows and lashes will not turn long and luxurious.\nNo Miracle Here\nAct of Wellness R&R Sleeping Mask - Leave on Overnight Treatment with Hyaluronic Acid + Retinol Alternative for Happy and Feel It Soft Skin - Vegan and Cruelty Free (2oz\nAct of Wellness\n{'Brand': 'Act of Wellness', 'Unit Count': '1.0 Ounce', 'Material Feature': 'Vegan', 'Skin Tone': 'All'}\nI lije the ingredients and the company's mission. Not sure why they call it a mask. It applies  like any other moisturizing cream. It is not perfumed but has a light scent. It absorbs quickly. My skin felt smoother after use though not softer. I like it.\nGood Ingredients",
