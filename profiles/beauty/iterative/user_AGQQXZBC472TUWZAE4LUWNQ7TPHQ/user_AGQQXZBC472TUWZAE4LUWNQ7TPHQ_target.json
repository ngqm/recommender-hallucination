I use a little bit of blonde shampoo to keep the color nice and bright. Love it. Ive been doing extensions for nearly 12 years and these are some of the best in this price point.\nAmaaaaazing hairr omgg\nFull Shine 18\" Tape in Remy Human Hair Extensions Tape Ombre Extensions Dip Dyed Color #8 Ash Brown Fading to #60 and #18 Ash Blonde Highlighted Extensions 20 Pcs 50gram Per Package\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '8.6 x 5 x 2 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'UPC': '734602042013'}\nThis color is very hard to find. Very blendable and soft. I would def recommend two or three packs for a full head of extensions.\nColor is perfect\nVeSunny 20\" Remy Keratin Tip Hair Extensions Blonde Human Hair 1G/S #60 Platinum Blonde Pre Bonded Flat Tip Human Hair Extensions 50 Strands\nVe Sunny\n{'Brand': 'Ve Sunny', 'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Installation Type': 'Fusion', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '20 x 1 x 1 inches; 4.23 Ounces', 'UPC': '798863458884'}\nLove this hair. It does require some additional toning if ur looking for that icy blonde color. And requires deep conditioning but I love this hair. Great for someone looking for some added length and thickness\nLove these\nVeSunny 16inch #4 Dark Brown Remy Tape in Hair Extensions Human Hair 20pcs 100% Remy Tape in Hair Extensions 50g Per Pack 20pcs\nVe Sunny\n{'Brand': 'Ve Sunny', 'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Extension Length': '16 Inches', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Installation Type': 'Tape-In', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '16 x 1 x 1 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '799577978088'}\nBeautiful hair. Great quality. It does shed a lot but stays in well for about five to six weeks. Great for a temporary longer thicker look. Would highly recommend.\nGreat hair\nSunny 40pcs 100g 16inch Tape in Colored Hair Extensions Dark Brown Fade to Honey Blonde Balayage Double Weft Tape in Hair Extensions Real Human Hair\nSunny Beauty\n{'Brand': 'Sunny Beauty', 'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Installation Type': 'Tape', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '16 x 1 x 1 inches; 3.52 Ounces', 'UPC': '639631413158'}\nMy clients love this hair. The downfall is that is does shed but even extensions twice as much $$ shed. They do get dry so I would recommend using a leave in conditioner on them. I do re-tape them with babe tape for extra hold. These are re.usable if properly cared for. The color is very blend-able and natural.\nLove this hair.\nNicole Miller 2 Pack (30 Count Each) Charcoal and Rosehip Facial Cleansing and Make Up Remover Wipes\nNicole Miller\n{'Brand': 'Nicole Miller', 'Skin Type': 'acne prone', 'Unit Count': '2.00 Count', 'Item Form': 'Wipes', 'Package Type': 'Pouch', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.77 x 4.17 x 3.54 inches; 1.11 Pounds', 'UPC': '192598163615'}\nWasn\u2019t a huge fan of these, they look cool but that\u2019s about it. The wipes themselves don\u2019t have much moisture on them so u need to use three or four of them. Plus with the cloth being black u cannot see if all your makeup is fully removed\nWould Not Recommend\nMoresoo 20 Inch Micro Link Hair Extensions Remy Human Hair Extensions Color #60 Platinum Blonde Micro Ring Loop Human Hair Extensions Blonde Hair Extensions 50G/50S\u2026\nMoresoo\n{'Brand': 'Moresoo', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Installation Type': 'Microlink', 'Package Dimensions': '8.2 x 4.7 x 1.6 inches; 1.76 Ounces'}\nThere were dead bugs in my hair when I opened it today.
