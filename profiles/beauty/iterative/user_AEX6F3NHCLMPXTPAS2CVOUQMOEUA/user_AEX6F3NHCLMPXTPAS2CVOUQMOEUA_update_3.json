It is difficult trying to get the wipes out of the package as the opening is too small. These wipes are slightly scented and I found the scent to not be pleasant. Once I had the wipe in my hands and on my face I could not get rid of the smell - not even when I washed both hands and face with my favorite body gel - there was still a bit of the wipe's fragrance. The wipes are infused with Vitamin E and made with Argan oil and Hyaluronic. This product is alcohol free and is moistened to just the right level so it not dripping when taken out the package. Do not dispose these in the toilet. I think this product is made in Hong Kong but not sure of that.\nReview Title: Do Not Dispose In Toilet\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

This top Japanese makeup remover glides on gently and leaves no sticky residue. Formulated with conditioning beauty essence, this jelly leaves skin feeling moisturized and free of makeup. Satisfaction Guaranteed.

You simply pump some of the cleaner in the palm of your hand and then massage it gently on your face to clear away the makeup -  then rinse your whole face with water. The scent is mild but very nice. When finished you will not feel any sticky residue. I love the guard on the pump that allows you to put it on the pump when you are not using it so little fingers cannot spread the jelly around when you are not looking nor can the pump squirt out when the bottle falls over or when you are traveling. This product was made in Japan.\nLove The Guard For The Cap\nBior\u00e9 J-Beauty Makeup Removing Moisturizing Cleansing Jelly, Top Japanese Makeup Remover, Gentle Skin Cleanser, Mild Floral Fragrance, Non-Greasy, 7.8 Ounce\nBior\u00e9\n['Bior\u00e9 J-Beauty Makeup Removing Moisturizing Cleansing Jelly is a non-greasy makeup remover that removes dirt and impurities from deep below the surface of your skin.

There are 44 wipes in each packet and each wipe is about 4.5 x 5.5 inches (you probably would need 2 or 3 wipes a time if you wear a lot of makeup) and is pre-moisturized. These wipes are to be deposed in the garbage not the toilet and are not to be close to your eyes. Directions state that you should place the cloth on the area that has make-up for about 5 seconds and then wipe off. The scent smells very nice and my skin did feel smooth when done.
