I live in Colorado and I do get lots of sun daily. I started using this vitaminC serum in order to minimize my uneven skin tone and hopefully help to reduce pores from 4 different berries that this vitamin C serum contains. For first impression I did like the consistency, non tackiness on my face. This serum is good to use daily without thinking too much about it. You do need to apply sunscreen underneath before putting this serum if you apply on a daylight time. Overall, I really like the serum and I am glad to see great Korean beauty products on amazon. I would recommend this serum!\nReview Title: Good daily serum\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I popped these open before I put on make up. I didn\u2019t see much differences. Except cooling since they were in the refrigerator. The product is made in China as well. If someone is interested in where it\u2019s made.\nOkay\nABOUT ME MediAnswer Collagen Firming Up Mask 4ea (1box) 25g - 77% Pure Collagen Extract Anti-Aging Total Care Facial Mask Sheet, Powerful Hydrating and Anti-Wrinkle Night Skin Care\nSamyang\n{'Brand': 'Samyang', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Anti-aging', 'Scent': 'Fresh', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.1 x 6.3 x 0.9 inches; 0.88 Ounces'}\nABOUT ME MediAnswer Collagen Firming Up Mask is made with 77% Pure Collagen Extract  The collagen supposed to help Anti-Aging Total Care, Powerful Hydrating and Anti-Wrinkle. I like the mask sheets. The sheets are very interesting without being messy. These masked helped me a lot to calm my skins after getting lots of sun from Florida. I would recommend these masks\nCollagen!\nCancun Collection Cacao Body Bronzer \u2013 Superfood Infused Sunless Tanning Lotion with Cacao 5.1 fl.oz, For Instant Tan in 1 minute.\nCancun Collection\n{'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'Cancun Collection', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Material Feature': 'Antioxidant', 'Package Dimensions': '5.1 x 4.6 x 1 inches; 14.39 Ounces', 'UPC': '659436986640'}\nThis is my first time using Cancun collection body bronzer.

This bronzer did not make me look like an orange either. I like the clean ingredients that this bronzer contains. I would recommend this bronzer. So far I am in love with this!<br /><br />++ I would recommend to apply this bronzer with a bronzer glove if can.

I told myself why not try one?! So I did! The pads are bigger than my goto face cleaning pads which I really like. One pad does a long way around my face even to neckline. This bottle has got plenty of liquid to work on. Also, I didn\u2019t notice any irritation after using this bottle. Overall, I like the scent, it is mild. Also, I like the inexpensive price point. This bottle works for me. I hope my review helps!\nInexpensive, great daily face pads\nEasydew 2-Step Face Contour Sheet Mask - Tightening & Anti-Aging & Hydrating Korean Face Mask with DW-EGF, Hyaluronic Acid for Anti-Winkle, Reducing Fine Line & Producing Collagen (Qty 5)\nEASYDEW\n{'Brand': 'EASYDEW', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Scent': 'Honey', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'Yes', 'Package Dimensions': '8.35 x 6.38 x 0.63 inches; 7.44 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'EETS1003', 'Manufacturer': 'CleveAid'}\nMy friend told me about this brand and this face masks. I was so curious to try. I am in my 30\u2019s now. I do happen to use a lot more of anti wrinkle products these days. I like the masks because the ingredients are good for anti wrinkle, I noticed the masks moisturize well after use them. I like the concept and the ingredients as well. I am going to have to purchase more in the future after I run out!\nWorth the hype!\n[Abib] Creme coating mask Tone-up solution 17g (5pcs)\nAbib\n{'Brand': 'Abib', 'Scent': 'Unscented', 'Number of Items': '5', 'Package Dimensions': '8.7 x 6.2 x 0.8 inches; 8.01 Ounces'}\nI\u2019ve used Abib\u2019s cooling masks before. I think like this toning mask sheets more. Because, the mask sheets are thick, lock all the moistures while wearing the mask sheets, leave soft and smooth skin afterward. I didn\u2019t notice dramatic tone-up effect. But, overall I love the concept of the mask sheet, very moisturizing they are. I wish Abib company could minimize the packing later on. Other than that I\u2019m very happy with these non drying your skin masks!\nSuitable for dry skin\nDr. Denese Cannabis Sativa Super Serum with Soothing Calming Organic Cold-Pressed Hemp Oil, Ginger, Bisabolol, Ceramides - Reduce Look of Wrinkles, Moisturize & Improved Tightness - Cruelty-Free - 2oz\nDr. Denese\n{'Skin Type': 'All, Oily, Sensitive, Dry', 'Product Benefits': 'Dr. Denese', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'Dr. Denese', 'Item Form': 'Serum', 'Package Dimensions': '4.6 x 2.6 x 1.7 inches; 2 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Dr. Denese'}\nFirst time trying Dr. Denese products. I often see it either online or at the drugstore. I apply a few drops at night time. This serum makes my face much brighter and clear looking. However, I found no expiration date on the box nor on the product. Other than that this product works well on my skin type ( I have normal skin type with oily T zone). I would recommend trying if you\u2019re in mid 30\u2019s like myself. It\u2019s great.\nLove the serum but not expiration date\nKaruna Oh, Glow On Face Mask Sheet, Skincare and Beauty Facial Masks with Moisturizing and Collagen Promotion Properties for Healthy Glow, Contain Green Tea, Vitamin C and Pineapple (3 Sheets)\nKaruna\n{'Brand': 'Karuna', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrate Skin,Hydrate', 'Scent': 'Pineapple', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Package Dimensions': '6.54 x 4.88 x 0.87 inches; 9.59 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'MSF1004 - CA', 'UPC': '857950007166'}\nEvery time I find a beauty brand I try going to their websites and learn about their ingredients, where the products are manufactured. I assumed the products were made somewhere in California with USA ingredients. But, I noticed that the product is made in Taiwan. No offense to the country. But, I\u2019ve never used a beauty product manufactured in Taiwan before.<br /><br />I do like the fact that the masks are made without toxic ingredients. Also, mask is okay. But, I wish the company put where the products are manufactured on amazon page. Also, thought that the price was overpriced. 3 product for $18 is too much.\nNot so \u201chip\u201d than you think.\nKaruna Hit Refresh Eucalyptus Fiber-Infused Sheet Mask: Burst of Hydration & Refreshing Glow, 3 Count\nKaruna\n{'Brand': 'Karuna', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating', 'Scent': 'Eucalyptus', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Package Dimensions': '6.5 x 4.88 x 0.71 inches; 4.2 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'MSF1006 - CA', 'UPC': '857950007159'}\nThe product is okay. I didn\u2019t feel these masks were better than other masks that I\u2019ve used before. Also, the masks are not made in USA. They are made in Taiwan. Cool advertisement but, it\u2019s 3 masks for $18. It\u2019s a pass for me.\nOverpriced.\nEasydew Daily Double Hydra Cream 2.02 fl oz - Moisturizing Cream with EGF & Serine of NMFHydrating, Soothing, Anti-Aging EGF, Serine - N.M.F(Natural Moisturizing Factors) for Oily, Sensitive, Acne-Prone, Dry Skin Types\nEASYDEW\n{'Brand': 'EASYDEW', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '5.2911 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Type': 'Acne Prone,Oily,Sensitive,All Skin Types', 'Package Dimensions': '5.98 x 1.69 x 1.46 inches; 3 Ounces'}\nI recently got some sort of skin reaction that I couldn\u2019t apply my normal goto skin care products. I tested this Easydew daily double hydra care cream on my wrist first then started applying minimum amount on my face. Ever since I started using this cream my face was clearing up, my face was becoming normal. Partially I was eating clean and minimized my skin care but, still I really do think this product helped me out a lot.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product who has sensitive skin and even normal skin type people as well. This product is very mind and soothing. I would highly recommend this product!\nVery soothing and mild on skin\nEASYDEW Fill Up Volume Spot 0.67 fl oz -Anti-Aging Filler Spot Good for Topical Wrinkle Care with Hyaluronic Acid I Moisturizer with Instant Filling Effect and Skin Renewal | For Topical Area\nEASYDEW\n{'Brand': 'EASYDEW', 'Scent': 'Aloe Vera', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Active Ingredients': 'Hyaluronic acid', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Product Dimensions': '1.46 x 0.91 x 5.71 inches; 1.41 Ounces'}\nI am a  big fan of Easy dew products. First time trying this fill up volume product. I am in my 30\u2019s and I see my eyes are slightly stared to sag sadly! I haven\u2019t noticed dramatic differences. But, Easy dew products never broke me out before and so does this product. I apply this day and night time. The eye product is rich and little goes a long way. Overall, it is a great product to treat small area. I like this product a lot. I would recommend this!\neasy to apply, rich and moist using\nCaudalie Beauty Essentials Beauty Elixir Set: 3 Piece Radiance Trio including a Pore Tightening Facial Mist, Daily Foam Cleanser, Brightening Glycolic Peel Mask\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.87 x 5.83 x 1.61 inches; 1.18 Pounds'}\nThese Caudalie beauty essential is life! I\u2019ve been loving this caudalie brand since I was younger. I love the eco friendly packaging and the company donates to the charity afterward too. Of course the products are well familiar for me. I love how this set has everything you need as a skin care set. This packaging is everything. I would be very happy if someone gifted this to me for Christmas or as a birthday gift. My skin is happy and shiny! No complains here.\nBeautiful and cheaper to buy set\nEASYDEW DW-EGF Double Synergy Moist Ampoule1.01 fl oz -K Beauty Award-Winning Anti Aging Ampoule with EGF to Plump, Moisturize Skin I For Sensitive Skin, Gift for Mom, Wife, Her\nEASYDEW\n{'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Anti-aging', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'EASYDEW', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '4.29 x 1.54 x 1.46 inches; 3.53 Ounces'}\nI love Easydew\u2019s skin care products. Their products seem to work very well on my skin. I was first introduced from a friend of mine from Korea. I absolutely loved Easydew\u2019s green face lotion so much I decided to try the company\u2019s other products.<br /><br />I have normal to sensitive skin. I am very sensitive to scent, certain ingredients. Easydew products have very mild baby like scent that\u2019s smells amazing. Also, this serum absorbs on my skin in no time. I apply this after washing my face than apply Easydew green face cream. The combo is fire!<br />Overall, this product works very well on my skin type. If you\u2019re mid- sensitive skin this product would work well. I would highly recommend this serum. This makes my face glowy!\nMoisturizing and soothing for sensitive skin\nMurad Hydration Intense Recovery Cream - Deeply Moisturizes Severely Dry and Stressed Skin - For Face and Eyes, 1.7 Fl Oz\n{'Brand': 'Murad', 'Scent': 'Unscented', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Active Ingredients': 'Vitamin A', 'Unit Count': '1.7 Fl Oz', 'Language': 'English', 'Product Dimensions': '2.91 x 2.91 x 1.69 inches; 7.2 Ounces', 'Item model number': '15293', 'UPC': '767332152936'}\nI recently moved to a very low humidity area. This Murad hydration intense recovery cream has been such a great help for my dry, dull skin. The cream is thick so I apply small amount then I reapply the same amount. So far that method has been working out great for my skin. I use it at night time and I wake up to fresh and moisturized skin. Overall, I am happy with almost no scent cream product and the product itself is great. I would recommend to anyone who has dry and dull skin that need some rich hydration. This cream would be great!\nDeeply moisturizing\nKneipp Body Lotion (Lavender)\n{'Brand': 'Kneipp', 'Scent': 'Lavender', 'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Active Ingredients': 'lavender,vitamin a', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '5.2 x 2.72 x 13.7 inches; 7.05 Ounces'}\nI\u2019ve used kneipp\u2019s body wash before. I liked the product so much I wanted to try body lotion version. I have pretty bd anxiety, also have trouble falling asleep at night time. I think this lavender body lotion has been helping me falling asleep faster than usual.<br />The smell is very natural, (not sweet or artificial) you can smell the pure lavender scent from the lotion. The lotion\u2019s consistency is slightly runny but not liquidy.<br />Overall, this product has been helping me falling asleep, I even apply during the day to my arms and hands because the lotion smells so good. If you\u2019re looking for a natural scented body lotion, this would be appropriate. I would recommend this product. Plus, Kneipp doesn\u2019t test on animal.\nLovely smell helps sleeping, anxiety\nLAPOTHICELL Vita-C Energy Boosting Serum 25ml, Firming, Brightening\nLAPOTHICELL\n{'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'LAPOTHICELL', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Vitamin,Smooth Skin,Brightening,Energy'}\nFirst time trying this Korean beauty brand.
