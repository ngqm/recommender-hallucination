I told myself why not try one?! So I did! The pads are bigger than my goto face cleaning pads which I really like. One pad does a long way around my face even to neckline. This bottle has got plenty of liquid to work on. Also, I didn\u2019t notice any irritation after using this bottle. Overall, I like the scent, it is mild. Also, I like the inexpensive price point. This bottle works for me. I hope my review helps!\nReview Title: Inexpensive, great daily face pads\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
