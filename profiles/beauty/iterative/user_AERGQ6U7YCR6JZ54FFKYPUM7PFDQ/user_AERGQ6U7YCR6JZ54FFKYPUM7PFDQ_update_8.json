I think like this toning mask sheets more. Because, the mask sheets are thick, lock all the moistures while wearing the mask sheets, leave soft and smooth skin afterward. I didn\u2019t notice dramatic tone-up effect. But, overall I love the concept of the mask sheet, very moisturizing they are. I wish Abib company could minimize the packing later on. Other than that I\u2019m very happy with these non drying your skin masks!\nReview Title: Suitable for dry skin\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
