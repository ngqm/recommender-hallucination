As they claimed I\u2019ve been putting this moisturizer day and night time. It\u2019s a bit early to tell if my fine lines and wrinkles are reduced.

I popped these open before I put on make up. I didn\u2019t see much differences. Except cooling since they were in the refrigerator. The product is made in China as well. If someone is interested in where it\u2019s made.\nOkay\nABOUT ME MediAnswer Collagen Firming Up Mask 4ea (1box) 25g - 77% Pure Collagen Extract Anti-Aging Total Care Facial Mask Sheet, Powerful Hydrating and Anti-Wrinkle Night Skin Care\nSamyang\n{'Brand': 'Samyang', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Anti-aging', 'Scent': 'Fresh', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.1 x 6.3 x 0.9 inches; 0.88 Ounces'}\nABOUT ME MediAnswer Collagen Firming Up Mask is made with 77% Pure Collagen Extract  The collagen supposed to help Anti-Aging Total Care, Powerful Hydrating and Anti-Wrinkle. I like the mask sheets. The sheets are very interesting without being messy. These masked helped me a lot to calm my skins after getting lots of sun from Florida. I would recommend these masks\nCollagen!\nCancun Collection Cacao Body Bronzer \u2013 Superfood Infused Sunless Tanning Lotion with Cacao 5.1 fl.oz, For Instant Tan in 1 minute.\nCancun Collection\n{'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'Cancun Collection', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Material Feature': 'Antioxidant', 'Package Dimensions': '5.1 x 4.6 x 1 inches; 14.39 Ounces', 'UPC': '659436986640'}\nThis is my first time using Cancun collection body bronzer. I have to say I love this product! I have odd patch between my neck and chest area. This body bronzer did great job on hiding and  blending into my body without looking crazy. This bronzer did not make me look like an orange either. I like the clean ingredients that this bronzer contains. I would recommend this bronzer. So far I am in love with this!<br /><br />++ I would recommend to apply this bronzer with a bronzer glove if can. That\u2019s the best way to get the best result.\nSuperfood infused!\n[the SAEM] Derma Plan Cleansing Bubble Pad 15pcs - One Step Gentle Makeup Cleansing Wipes Produce Fine & Dense Bubbles, Hypoallergenic Formula, Pore Clean, Mild Exfoliation\nTHESAEM\n{'Brand': 'THESAEM', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Unit Count': '15.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '3.9 x 3.9 x 1.8 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nI never used the SEAM\u2019s skin products before. I told myself why not try one?! So I did! The pads are bigger than my goto face cleaning pads which I really like. One pad does a long way around my face even to neckline. This bottle has got plenty of liquid to work on. Also, I didn\u2019t notice any irritation after using this bottle. Overall, I like the scent, it is mild. Also, I like the inexpensive price point. This bottle works for me. I hope my review helps!\nInexpensive, great daily face pads\nEasydew 2-Step Face Contour Sheet Mask - Tightening & Anti-Aging & Hydrating Korean Face Mask with DW-EGF, Hyaluronic Acid for Anti-Winkle, Reducing Fine Line & Producing Collagen (Qty 5)\nEASYDEW\n{'Brand': 'EASYDEW', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Scent': 'Honey', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'Yes', 'Package Dimensions': '8.35 x 6.38 x 0.63 inches; 7.44 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'EETS1003', 'Manufacturer': 'CleveAid'}\nMy friend told me about this brand and this face masks. I was so curious to try. I am in my 30\u2019s now. I do happen to use a lot more of anti wrinkle products these days. I like the masks because the ingredients are good for anti wrinkle, I noticed the masks moisturize well after use them. I like the concept and the ingredients as well. I am going to have to purchase more in the future after I run out!\nWorth the hype!\n[Abib] Creme coating mask Tone-up solution 17g (5pcs)\nAbib\n{'Brand': 'Abib', 'Scent': 'Unscented', 'Number of Items': '5', 'Package Dimensions': '8.7 x 6.2 x 0.8 inches; 8.01 Ounces'}\nI\u2019ve used Abib\u2019s cooling masks before. I think like this toning mask sheets more. Because, the mask sheets are thick, lock all the moistures while wearing the mask sheets, leave soft and smooth skin afterward. I didn\u2019t notice dramatic tone-up effect. But, overall I love the concept of the mask sheet, very moisturizing they are. I wish Abib company could minimize the packing later on. Other than that I\u2019m very happy with these non drying your skin masks!\nSuitable for dry skin\nDr. Denese Cannabis Sativa Super Serum with Soothing Calming Organic Cold-Pressed Hemp Oil, Ginger, Bisabolol, Ceramides - Reduce Look of Wrinkles, Moisturize & Improved Tightness - Cruelty-Free - 2oz\nDr. Denese\n{'Skin Type': 'All, Oily, Sensitive, Dry', 'Product Benefits': 'Dr. Denese', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'Dr. Denese', 'Item Form': 'Serum', 'Package Dimensions': '4.6 x 2.6 x 1.7 inches; 2 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Dr. Denese'}\nFirst time trying Dr. Denese products. I often see it either online or at the drugstore. I apply a few drops at night time. This serum makes my face much brighter and clear looking. However, I found no expiration date on the box nor on the product. Other than that this product works well on my skin type ( I have normal skin type with oily T zone). I would recommend trying if you\u2019re in mid 30\u2019s like myself. It\u2019s great.\nLove the serum but not expiration date\nKaruna Oh, Glow On Face Mask Sheet, Skincare and Beauty Facial Masks with Moisturizing and Collagen Promotion Properties for Healthy Glow, Contain Green Tea, Vitamin C and Pineapple (3 Sheets)\nKaruna\n{'Brand': 'Karuna', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrate Skin,Hydrate', 'Scent': 'Pineapple', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Package Dimensions': '6.54 x 4.88 x 0.87 inches; 9.59 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'MSF1004 - CA', 'UPC': '857950007166'}\nEvery time I find a beauty brand I try going to their websites and learn about their ingredients, where the products are manufactured. I assumed the products were made somewhere in California with USA ingredients. But, I noticed that the product is made in Taiwan. No offense to the country. But, I\u2019ve never used a beauty product manufactured in Taiwan before.<br /><br />I do like the fact that the masks are made without toxic ingredients. Also, mask is okay. But, I wish the company put where the products are manufactured on amazon page. Also, thought that the price was overpriced. 3 product for $18 is too much.\nNot so \u201chip\u201d than you think.\nKaruna Hit Refresh Eucalyptus Fiber-Infused Sheet Mask: Burst of Hydration & Refreshing Glow, 3 Count\nKaruna\n{'Brand': 'Karuna', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating', 'Scent': 'Eucalyptus', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Package Dimensions': '6.5 x 4.88 x 0.71 inches; 4.2 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'MSF1006 - CA', 'UPC': '857950007159'}\nThe product is okay. I didn\u2019t feel these masks were better than other masks that I\u2019ve used before. Also, the masks are not made in USA. They are made in Taiwan. Cool advertisement but, it\u2019s 3 masks for $18. It\u2019s a pass for me.\nOverpriced.\nEasydew Daily Double Hydra Cream 2.02 fl oz - Moisturizing Cream with EGF & Serine of NMFHydrating, Soothing, Anti-Aging EGF, Serine - N.M.F(Natural Moisturizing Factors) for Oily, Sensitive, Acne-Prone, Dry Skin Types\nEASYDEW\n{'Brand': 'EASYDEW', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '5.2911 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Type': 'Acne Prone,Oily,Sensitive,All Skin Types', 'Package Dimensions': '5.98 x 1.69 x 1.46 inches; 3 Ounces'}\nI recently got some sort of skin reaction that I couldn\u2019t apply my normal goto skin care products.
