I like the mask sheets. The sheets are very interesting without being messy. These masked helped me a lot to calm my skins after getting lots of sun from Florida.

This bronzer did not make me look like an orange either. I like the clean ingredients that this bronzer contains. I would recommend this bronzer. So far I am in love with this!<br /><br />++ I would recommend to apply this bronzer with a bronzer glove if can.

I was so curious to try. I am in my 30\u2019s now. I do happen to use a lot more of anti wrinkle products these days. I like the masks because the ingredients are good for anti wrinkle, I noticed the masks moisturize well after use them. I like the concept and the ingredients as well. I am going to have to purchase more in the future after I run out!\nWorth the hype!\n[Abib] Creme coating mask Tone-up solution 17g (5pcs)\nAbib\n{'Brand': 'Abib', 'Scent': 'Unscented', 'Number of Items': '5', 'Package Dimensions': '8.7 x 6.2 x 0.8 inches; 8.01 Ounces'}\nI\u2019ve used Abib\u2019s cooling masks before. I think like this toning mask sheets more. Because, the mask sheets are thick, lock all the moistures while wearing the mask sheets, leave soft and smooth skin afterward. I didn\u2019t notice dramatic tone-up effect. But, overall I love the concept of the mask sheet, very moisturizing they are. I wish Abib company could minimize the packing later on. Other than that I\u2019m very happy with these non drying your skin masks!\nSuitable for dry skin\nDr. Denese Cannabis Sativa Super Serum with Soothing Calming Organic Cold-Pressed Hemp Oil, Ginger, Bisabolol, Ceramides - Reduce Look of Wrinkles, Moisturize & Improved Tightness - Cruelty-Free - 2oz\nDr. Denese\n{'Skin Type': 'All, Oily, Sensitive, Dry', 'Product Benefits': 'Dr. Denese', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'Dr. Denese', 'Item Form': 'Serum', 'Package Dimensions': '4.6 x 2.6 x 1.7 inches; 2 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Dr. Denese'}\nFirst time trying Dr. Denese products. I often see it either online or at the drugstore. I apply a few drops at night time. This serum makes my face much brighter and clear looking. However, I found no expiration date on the box nor on the product. Other than that this product works well on my skin type ( I have normal skin type with oily T zone). I would recommend trying if you\u2019re in mid 30\u2019s like myself. It\u2019s great.\nLove the serum but not expiration date\nKaruna Oh, Glow On Face Mask Sheet, Skincare and Beauty Facial Masks with Moisturizing and Collagen Promotion Properties for Healthy Glow, Contain Green Tea, Vitamin C and Pineapple (3 Sheets)\nKaruna\n{'Brand': 'Karuna', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrate Skin,Hydrate', 'Scent': 'Pineapple', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Package Dimensions': '6.54 x 4.88 x 0.87 inches; 9.59 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'MSF1004 - CA', 'UPC': '857950007166'}\nEvery time I find a beauty brand I try going to their websites and learn about their ingredients, where the products are manufactured.
