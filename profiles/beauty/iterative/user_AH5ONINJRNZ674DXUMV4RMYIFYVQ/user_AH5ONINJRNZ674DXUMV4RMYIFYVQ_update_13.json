  "reference_summary": "Brush Strokes Large Ball Tip Rounder Brush (Assorted Colors)\nBrush Strokes\n{'Brand': 'Brush Strokes', 'Shape': 'Oblong', 'Special Feature': 'Not-applicable', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Hair Type': 'Fine', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '8.8 x 2.6 x 2.6 inches; 1.6 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'SG_B004F0KBDW_US', 'UPC': '794168349933'}\nPros: This brush is so light weight and makes it so easy to create a smooth, straight look with your hair. It does not tangle at all and is easy to use.<br />Cons: The brush made my hair a little flat, but I have thin, fine hair that requires work to create body.\nGreat for smoothing and straightening hair!\nCancun Collection Cacao Body Bronzer \u2013 Superfood Infused Sunless Tanning Lotion with Cacao 5.1 fl.oz, For Instant Tan in 1 minute.\nCancun Collection\n{'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'Cancun Collection', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Material Feature': 'Antioxidant', 'Package Dimensions': '5.1 x 4.6 x 1 inches; 14.39 Ounces', 'UPC': '659436986640'}\nThis Cancun Collection Cacao Bronzer is a fabulous alternative to getting a natural suntan from a tanning bed or from the sun due to harmful UV rays. It is also a great alternative if you do not like using self-tanners that can smell. This applies easily and blends with all skin tones. I have fair skin, but this even works on my skin color too. The bronzer blurs imperfections and stays on until you shower with soap!  I recommend this product!  See my pictures for more information.\nGreat, natural looking bronzer!\nMD Complete Bright & Healthy Citrus-C Refresh Retinol + Vitamin C Multitasking Treatment\nMD Complete by Dr. Brian Zelickson\n{'Brand': 'MD Complete by Dr. Brian Zelickson', 'Scent': 'Citrus', 'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Unit Count': '1.0 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Product Dimensions': '2 x 1.25 x 4.5 inches; 2.26 Ounces', 'UPC': '850458005719'}\nThis MD Complete Bright & Healthy serum has all the ingredients recommended to treat fine lines, wrinkles and dull texture (Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Vitamin B, Retinol and Omega-3). However, I did not find this to be moisturizing at all and it actually dried my skin out - making my fine lines and wrinkles more noticeable. The product indicates this product is great for someone in their 20\u2019s or 30\u2019s - maybe that\u2019s true, but this is not an effective product for someone 40+ dealing with aging skin. I cannot recommend this product for aging skin - maybe it\u2019s effective for younger skin to prevent aging \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f - but it is not restorative if you have aging skin.\nNot recommended for aging skin\n2-Pack Puretize 16.9 Oz Hand Sanitizing Gel w/Pump Tops - Extra Strength 70% Ethyl Alcohol - Moisturizing Formula with Aloe Vera, Vitamin E & Botanical Extracts - Quick Drying Formula\nPure Daily Care\n{'Brand': 'Pure Daily Care', 'Unit Count': '33.8 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Special Feature': 'Moisturizing', 'Scent': 'Unscented', 'Package Dimensions': '7 x 6.5 x 4.5 inches; 1.06 Pounds', 'UPC': '810016711360'}\nThis Puretize I stand hand sanitizer contains 70% ethyl alcohol and is free of dyes and strong perfumes. It has a bit of an alcohol or medicine sent but it is not overpowering. See my picture for a list of ingredients. Even though it is 70% alcohol it did not leave my skin feeling dried out. I think this is a great value for two containers it would be great to use in an office, church, school, or even at home! Overall, I like this product and recommend it!\nKeeps germs away!!!\nSunsonic Electric Razor, Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Pop Up Beard Trimmer, Type-C USB Mens Electric Razor.\nMDDM\n{'Brand': 'MDDM', 'Special Feature': 'Rechargeable,Cordless', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Blade Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Head Type': 'Rotary', 'Package Dimensions': '7.36 x 3.82 x 2.6 inches; 8.78 Ounces', 'UPC': '738629925151', 'Manufacturer': 'MDDM'}\n[[VIDEOID:f269f4bbb908ea03a9ffb408f24f4cd3]] This Sunsonic electric shaver for men is simple to use. It comes fully charged. To recharge it, you simply plug the cord into a usb charger and into the shaver. It does not provide a very close shave though. If you prefer a close shave, this may not be the best option for you.<br /><br />If you are looking for an inexpensive electric shaver to keep in your car or in your office for emergencies, or if you are looking for one to travel with, this is a good option. The shaver also comes with a pop-up trimmer. Simply push a button on the back of the shaver and a trimmer pops up so that you can shave your neck and around ears. See my video for additional details.\nGood emergency backup saver - no close shave\nVILLAGE11FACTORY Cica Cream, Centella Soothing and Repairing Cream for Dry and Irritated Skin, Moisturizer, Anti-Wrinkles, Lightweight, Relieves Irritated Skin, Fragrance Free, Dermatologically Tested, 1.69 fl oz 50ml\nVILLAGE11FACTORY\n{'Brand': 'VILLAGE11FACTORY', 'Scent': 'Fresh', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Active Ingredients': 'hyaluronic_acid', 'Unit Count': '1.7 Fl Oz', 'Package Dimensions': '5.2 x 1.97 x 1.46 inches; 2.47 Ounces'}\nThis Derma Clear B5 Cica Cream is not oily/greasy at all. It makes my skin feel incredibly hydrating and makes my skin so very soft. It\u2019s unclear from the packaging if this product is specifically designed to use on your face or all over. I\u2019ve used it on my hands, elbows, and on dry spots all over my body and was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked. I didn\u2019t notice any scent when using the lotion. My only reason for taking a star away from the rating is because of the cost of this product. You only get 1.69 fluid ounces of product, so it\u2019s not a great value. However, I do think the product is effective!\nVery moisturizing and soften skins\nPretty Frank Natural Deodorant Jar- No Aluminum Deodorant for Women, Men, Teens, & Kids \u2013 Paraben Sulfate Free Cream Deodorant with Shea Butter, Coconut Oil, Vitamin E & Baking Soda (Jasmine)\nPRETTY FRANK\n{'Brand': 'PRETTY FRANK', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Scent': 'Jasmine, Coconut', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '3.42 x 2.79 x 2.59 inches; 5.61 Ounces'}\nThis Pretty Frank natural deodorant has a pretty strong Jasmine scent. The instructions say to use a piece size amount. I didn\u2019t read that at first and applied too much making the smell over powering. If you use the appropriate amount, the smell is not too strong. It helps keep you fresh smelling all day! Keep in mind this does not have anti-perspirant in it so it will allow you to sweat. However, it should help prevent odor. I like the fact that this is aluminum free, paraben free, toxin free and petroleum free. it is also free of imitation perfumes.<br /><br />So far, I like using this product but need to put it to a test on a hot humid day while exercising! If that does the trick, I will update my review to five stars. The weather in my area is very stormy, so I am unable to give this a full testing! However, this has worked for me so far wearing this under normal daily activities.\nA little goes a long way!\nBH DERMCENTER Retinol Serum Restores Rejuvenates and Purifies Skin, 1 oz, Reduces Appearance of Fine Lines, Non-GMO, Vegan, Cruelty Free\nBH DERMCENTER\n{'Product Dimensions': '2 x 2 x 5 inches; 1 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'BHDRETSER', 'UPC': '850004068076'}\nThis BH DERMCENTER Retinol Serum is made in the USA. This serum is paraben free, vegan, non-GMO, and gluten free. A little of this serum goes along way. It can be used daily under your moisturizer. It contains retinal which is supposed to restore collagen to your skin, lighten dark spots, and hide fine wrinkles. Only time will tell if this serum lives up to its claims. However, I like the way it feels on my skin and it was non-irritating. Overall, I recommend this product.\nFeels good on skin - non-irritating\nRose Quartz Roller with Derma Roller 0.25mm, Facial Kit with Microneedle and Pink Jade Rollers\nLOLYSENTA\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.1 x 5.1 x 1.6 inches; 8.78 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'LS17', 'UPC': '850002524062', 'Manufacturer': 'LOLYSENTA, LLC'}\nThis Rose Quartz Roller with Derma Roller 0.25mm is a great value for this facial kit. It\u2019s giftable and is believed that the microneedling treatment and pink jade roller is supposed to stimulate collagen. I\u2019ve only used both for a few days so I can\u2019t say effective this product will be, but I\u2019m willing to give it a try. The jade roller is great to use when applying your favorite face serum. It glides and rolls smoothly. The microneedling treatment is not too painful when you simply apply a little bit of pressure. It did not cause bleeding because I used it gently as directed. You do need to be sure to only use it on clean skin and wash it after each use. I am hoping to see more vibrant skin after using these tools for a few weeks.\nSupposed to promote a more youthful appearance\nO!GETi Vitamin C Foam Cleanser | Foaming Facial Cleanser, Perfect Pore Cleansing Foam, Face Wash for Dry & Sensitive Skin, Sebum Reducing, Moisture Control & Minimizing Pores, Korean Skin Care, Gift for Women, Paraben-free, 4.23 Oz (120g)\nO!GETi\n{'Item Form': 'Foam', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'O!GETi', 'Scent': 'Tangerine', 'Material Feature': 'Natural'}\n[[VIDEOID:54b0aa506bf0c71a7c1b9f3ed89e41ee]] This O!GETi vitamin C foam cleanser is a rich and thick cleaner than foams nicely on your face to help remove impurities. This leaves my face feeling very soft and looking brighter. This product includes Centella, Panthenol, Tangerine extracts, and vitamin c. It is a gentle cleanser that does not dry out my face. This does include fragrance that is not noticeable at all, and it does not irritate sensitive skin. Overall, I like this product I would recommend it. This product is made in Korea.\nFoaming cleanser that brightens skin on your face\n2Pcs Mascara Black Volume and Length 4D Natural and Long Lasting Lash Blast Mascara, 0.27 Fl Oz\nMarine Forest\n{'Brand': 'Marine Forest', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Item Volume': '0.27 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Information': 'Tube', 'Water Resistance Level': 'Waterproof', 'Package Dimensions': '4.84 x 2.01 x 0.98 inches; 3.17 Ounces', 'UPC': '729843907382'}\nThis 2-piece Waterproof Mascara is a very good value. The mascara is not a super \u201cwet\u201d formula - its a bit on the dry side which has its pros and cons. Pros: Will not weigh fine/thin lashes down or flatten them like some super wet mascaras will do. It is also buildable. Cons:  If takes multiple applications to add real volume and thickness to your lashes.<br /><br />This mascara did not cause any irritation or sensitivity and it stayed put all day long (even when sweating). It\u2019s also easy to remove with a waterproof eye makeup remover.<br /><br />I didn\u2019t notice this mascara helping curl my lashes. I still had to use an eyelash curler to give my lashes curl.<br /><br />Overall, this is a pretty good mascara. See my pictures for details.\nGood value\nEyebrow Tattoo Pen, Waterproof brow Pencil, Microblading Brow Pen, Natural Looking, Long Lasting (1# Light Brown)\nEINHOOM\n{'Brand': 'EINHOOM', 'Item Form': 'Pencil', 'Finish Type': 'Natural', 'Product Benefits': 'Smoothening', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '4.8 x 0.79 x 0.75 inches; 0.32 Ounces'}\nUpdated review: This Eyebrow Tattoo Pen in light brown is a good color for light blondes!  The formula advertises to be sweat proof/waterproof, but that is definitely not the case. I wore this and sweated when I wrote my initial review, but after getting wet in the rain, this product seemed to disappear (my reason for removing a star). It has a natural look to it with a 4-fork tip head that lets you create more realistic looking brows. This gets 3 stars for its wearability and durability and application. The formula goes on quite dry so you really have to work in applying yet so it looks even on both brows. However, I like the color and the fork applicator. See my pictures for a before and after (First picture is before and second picture is after application of this product).\nUpdated review - not waterproof\nBig Hair Claw Clips For Women - 2 PCS 4.3 Inch Large Hair Clips For Girls Nonslip Strong Hold jaw banana Matte hair clips for Thick Hair\nBAUTVAS\n{'Brand': 'BAUTVAS', 'Hair Type': 'Fine', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Style': 'Claw', 'Embellishment': 'Bow', 'Package Dimensions': '4.8 x 3.46 x 2.2 inches; 2.08 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'TY-us-fjia-001-2', 'UPC': '787477719412'}\n[[VIDEOID:e638d573d9ab99e9f8893ffcda965fcd]] These claw hair clips work great for long hair.
