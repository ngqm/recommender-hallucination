It has a bit of an alcohol or medicine sent but it is not overpowering. See my picture for a list of ingredients. Even though it is 70% alcohol it did not leave my skin feeling dried out. I think this is a great value for two containers it would be great to use in an office, church, school, or even at home! Overall, I like this product and recommend it!\nReview Title: Keeps germs away!!!\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Brush Strokes Large Ball Tip Rounder Brush (Assorted Colors)\nBrush Strokes\n{'Brand': 'Brush Strokes', 'Shape': 'Oblong', 'Special Feature': 'Not-applicable', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Hair Type': 'Fine', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '8.8 x 2.6 x 2.6 inches; 1.6 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'SG_B004F0KBDW_US', 'UPC': '794168349933'}\nPros: This brush is so light weight and makes it so easy to create a smooth, straight look with your hair. It does not tangle at all and is easy to use.<br />Cons: The brush made my hair a little flat, but I have thin, fine hair that requires work to create body.\nGreat for smoothing and straightening hair!\nCancun Collection Cacao Body Bronzer \u2013 Superfood Infused Sunless Tanning Lotion with Cacao 5.1 fl.oz, For Instant Tan in 1 minute.\nCancun Collection\n{'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'Cancun Collection', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Material Feature': 'Antioxidant', 'Package Dimensions': '5.1 x 4.6 x 1 inches; 14.39 Ounces', 'UPC': '659436986640'}\nThis Cancun Collection Cacao Bronzer is a fabulous alternative to getting a natural suntan from a tanning bed or from the sun due to harmful UV rays. It is also a great alternative if you do not like using self-tanners that can smell. This applies easily and blends with all skin tones. I have fair skin, but this even works on my skin color too. The bronzer blurs imperfections and stays on until you shower with soap!  I recommend this product!  See my pictures for more information.\nGreat, natural looking bronzer!\nMD Complete Bright & Healthy Citrus-C Refresh Retinol + Vitamin C Multitasking Treatment\nMD Complete by Dr. Brian Zelickson\n{'Brand': 'MD Complete by Dr. Brian Zelickson', 'Scent': 'Citrus', 'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Unit Count': '1.0 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Product Dimensions': '2 x 1.25 x 4.5 inches; 2.26 Ounces', 'UPC': '850458005719'}\nThis MD Complete Bright & Healthy serum has all the ingredients recommended to treat fine lines, wrinkles and dull texture (Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Vitamin B, Retinol and Omega-3). However, I did not find this to be moisturizing at all and it actually dried my skin out - making my fine lines and wrinkles more noticeable. The product indicates this product is great for someone in their 20\u2019s or 30\u2019s - maybe that\u2019s true, but this is not an effective product for someone 40+ dealing with aging skin. I cannot recommend this product for aging skin - maybe it\u2019s effective for younger skin to prevent aging \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f - but it is not restorative if you have aging skin.\nNot recommended for aging skin\n2-Pack Puretize 16.9 Oz Hand Sanitizing Gel w/Pump Tops - Extra Strength 70% Ethyl Alcohol - Moisturizing Formula with Aloe Vera, Vitamin E & Botanical Extracts - Quick Drying Formula\nPure Daily Care\n{'Brand': 'Pure Daily Care', 'Unit Count': '33.8 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Special Feature': 'Moisturizing', 'Scent': 'Unscented', 'Package Dimensions': '7 x 6.5 x 4.5 inches; 1.06 Pounds', 'UPC': '810016711360'}\nThis Puretize I stand hand sanitizer contains 70% ethyl alcohol and is free of dyes and strong perfumes.
