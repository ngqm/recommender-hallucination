I came across this SAISZE Jaw Exerciser which, like the YouTube ads, claim to be a Facial Fat Burner, and eliminating Double Chin Reducer for improved jawlines, so I finally bit it and ordered myself one to try.<br /><br />Unboxing was surprisingly taken aback, since I thought the packaging would be a little more elaborate, better packaging in bubble wraps, instructions, illustration, etc, the kind of packaging that I expect for items bought from my local Dollar Stores. Inside, it contains the blue Jaw Exerciser, anda laynard. Inside the Dollar Store-style plastic bag, there's nothing else. I was trying to figure out where does the laynard go, typically lanyards go inside a tiny holes, for example, on a smartphone. Since there's neither any \"tiny\" holes anywhere nor instructions, I went back to the product page, and looked at the product page photos, so the lanyard goes into the HUGE opening in the center of the Jaw Exerciser. This is nice, since this permits you to hang the Jaw Exerciser while it's not in use, instead of putting inside my pants pockets which is full of dirt & lint, probably not the best place. NOW, the only thing to try out is:<br />\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14does this thing actually WORK?\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14<br /><br />Well, you first should put the Jaw Exerciser in hot water for 5-10 minutes to soften it, and then after removing the protecting strips, you'd bite down to put pressure and allow the \" softened\" device to be molded according to your individual jawline, which will make the Jaw exercises more effective.<br /><br />I've been trying it for the last 2-3 months, while it's better than nothing - the Jaw muscles are probably the most neglected and difficult to exercise on a regular basis. So, for that purpose, ANY exercise is a plus, however, if you TOTALLY depend your double chins be gone on this gadget, you'd be drastically disappointed \ud83d\ude1e\u2639\ufe0f\ud83d\ude1e\u2639\ufe0f\u2639\ufe0f Simply, it's a supplement to Health Diet, Regular Exercises, and Sleep Well, that's the ONLY way to burn fat, and eliminating double chins, this or ANY Jaw Exerciser is just a gimmick gadget.<br /><br />\u2639\ufe0f\ud83d\ude1f\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\udc4eNot Recommended\ud83d\udc4e\u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude1f\nReview Title: \u2639\ufe0f\ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\udc4eMore of Gimmick Gadget, noe effective in eliminating Double Chins\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\ude1f\u2639\ufe0f\u2639\ufe0f\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Face Lift Tapes for Instant Face, Neck and Eye Lift Kit Tape\nC CRYSTAL LEMON\n{'Brand': 'C CRYSTAL LEMON', 'Unit Count': '40.00 Count', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '5.67 x 3.35 x 0.87 inches; 0.6 Ounces', 'UPC': '725330346603'}\nWe all may want to age gracefully but aging does take a toll on our face in the most bothersome way. Sagging skin and age lines look utterly unappealing and make us self-conscious. While there are myriad of facelift choices, such as Botox, facelift surgery, non-surgical facelifts, etc., a large section of women still look for less painful and less expensive options to achieve the best results. An instant facelift is also in pretty high demand to restore a more youthful look and here comes the importance of a face tape. The affordable solution takes years off your face immediately without the use of harmful chemicals or painful injections.<br /><br />Through Amazon's Vine Voices Program, I came across the \u300eCrystal Lemon Face Lift Tape\u300f.<br /><br />Unboxing revealed that it comes in a 40 band-aid lookalike patches of various sizes for different areas of our faces where you'd like to tighten the skins a little. I'm skeptical to begin with, but unless I try, I don't like to pre-judge anything, and let the results speak for themselves.<br /><br />The Premise<br />==========<br />These face lift tapes are basically a \u2018band-aid solution to a mature face\u2019. As the name reveals, it is nothing but a simple facial \u2018tape\u2019 that pulls back and stretches the skin to create an illusion of a tighter face. The tape is usually breathable, hypoallergenic, and of medical-grade. This non-surgical option gives a mini facelift instantly by smoothing out wrinkles and fine lines in a sagging and aged face. Since the last few decades, the facelift tape has been very popular only among Hollywood celebrities. But now, it has become a fast and easy at-home fix for anyone developing premature signs of aging.<br /><br />The VERDICT<br />\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f<br /><br />When used correctly, this Face Lift Tape could make dramatic changes to your aged look by reducing fine lines and wrinkles instantly. They are effective in smoothing out very fine lines around the eyes and firming up the jaw, which is really difficult to achieve even with makeup. However, this typically works better in older seniors like my mom, they didn't quite work, or make any difference, as I'm not old enough. Remember it's easy to go from F to D, but not so easy going from A to A+, if your skins are not wrinkled bad enough, it's nearly impossible to see a difference \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude0f\ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude04<br /><br />\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f If you find my review helpful, pls hit the \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\nWorks Better for Much Older & Wrinkled Skins\nCharyeah Bath Pillow Bathtub Spa Pillow With Powerful Gripping Suctions, Comfortable and Soft 2-Panel Cushions for Head, Neck, Back and Shoulder Support,Fits Hot Tub, Jacuzzi, Spas\nCharyeah\n{'Package Dimensions': '14.33 x 12.28 x 2.2 inches; 9.95 Ounces', 'UPC': '787937393473'}\nAfter a hard day's work or workout session, there's nothing better than nothing than soaking myself in a bubble bath with epsom salt - it really helps me with relaxation & pain relief. I also love to turn off the lights, and light some aromatherapy candles & music. There's only one thing that's missing, a bath pillow so I can lay back & rest my neck as well.<br /><br />Through Amazon's Vine Voices Program, I came across this \u300eCharyeah Bath Pillow for Bathtub/Spa\u300f.<br /><br />Unboxing revealed that it's a decent sized bath pillow, not too large that it takes up too much room around your bathtub, but large enough to hold your head/neck comfortably.<br /><br /> INSTALLATION<br />\ud83d\udec1\ud83d\udec1\ud83d\udec1\ud83d\udec1\ud83d\udec1\ud83d\udec1<br />Since I've never owned one, it would have been nice to have a picture of how it should sit in the tub; but eventually I figured it out since there's really only two ways to place it. For those of you having issues, remember to put the thin, rectangular strip portion around the rim of the bathtub, and the wide part on the slanted portion of the tub & that's where your neck and head would rest on while soaking in the bathtub.<br /><br /> REMOVAL<br />\ud83d\udec1\ud83d\udec1\ud83d\udec1\ud83d\udec1<br />A few words of cautions, after you're done, make sure you slide the bathtub pillow suction cups off the tub instead of pulling them off, trust me - you pull enough times, the suction cups will no doubt be severed from the pillow main body.<br /><br /> The VERDICT<br />\ud83d\udec1\ud83d\udec1\ud83d\udec1\ud83d\udec1\ud83d\udec1<br />  I think this bathtub pillow works well, allowing me to get the true relaxation bubble bath experience that it's designed for. As long as you follow the aforementioned tips, it really does the job. It would have been nice to have a hook so that upon removal I can hang it inside the bathtub area like bathtub caddy or showerhead allowing it to dripdry.<br /><br />\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udec1\ud83d\udec1 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED\ud83d\udec1\ud83d\udec1\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc93\n\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udec1\ud83d\udec1 Enhance Your Bubble Bath Relaxation Experience\ud83d\udec1\ud83d\udec1\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc93\nBrittanie's Thyme Hyaluronic Acid Serum, 8 oz, 100% Botanical Professional Clinical Strength for Face | Anti-Aging Anti Wrinkles & Hydrating Skincare Treatment\nBrittanie's Thyme\n{'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Use for': 'Face', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': \"Brittanie's Thyme\", 'Item Form': 'Serum', 'Package Dimensions': '7.17 x 2.83 x 2.52 inches; 8 Ounces'}\nAs we hit the much dreaded middle ages, most of us will then realize we ain't going to win the battle against Father Time. As such, we can, probably do, use a little help such as Retinol & Hyaluronic Acid based skincare products.<br /><br />  While It is widely known that it's  the collagen that gives the skin its firmness, but it is the Hyaluronic Acid that nourishes & hydrates the collagen.<br /><br />Most Hyaluronic Acid found in night creams or serums are traditionally extracted from rooster combs, and now it is mainly produced via streptococcal fermentation.<br /><br />Through Amazon's Vine Voices Program, I came across this \u300eBrittanie's Thymes 100% Botanical Hyaluronic Acid Serum\u300f. Botanical Hyaluronic Acid is derived from a plant called cassia angustifolia, protects the skin, strongly binds to water, and fills in wrinkles and fine lines.<br /><br />The VERDICT<br />==========<br />  Unboxing revealed that this bottle comes in an 8 oz (or 236 ml) of Botanical Hyaluronic Acid Serum which, even if used daily, should conveniently last me 3 months as part of my daily skincare regimen. I have been applying this \"Botanical\" version of Hyaluronic Acid Serum for about 2 & 1/2 months, I can see that it really performs better than its \"synthetic\" counterparts. In general, botanically sourced ingredients are better for the skin than their synthetic counterparts. As a result, Brittanie's Thyme Botanical Yyaluronic Acid holds 1000x its own weight in water, making it an essential ingredient for hydrating skincare products.<br /><br />  If you've already using some sorts of Hyaluronic Acid based skincare products (mostly synthetic types), nothing wrong with it, and it's working for you, GREAT! However, if you're looking for a more effective one, I highly recommend that give this botanical version a try.<br /><br />\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc8c\ud83d\udc4d HIGHLY RECOMMENDED\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc8c\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc9e\n\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc8c\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc4dBotanical Hyaluronic Acid much better than Synthetic HA\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc8c\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc9e\nSERUM By MERLOT - RESVERATROL - NATURAL ANTI-AGING - DAMAGE CORRECTOR - BOOST COLLAGEN - 1 FL OZ. - DARK CIRCLE CORRECTOR -\nMerlot\n{'Product Benefits': 'Anti-Aging', 'Scent': 'Unscented', 'Brand': 'Merlot', 'Item Form': 'Serum', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '4.6 x 0.8 x 0.8 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '860219000945'}\nAs I hit the dreaded middle ages, fine lines & wrinkles creep up all over my face, especially around the corners of my eyes - a true testament that battling Father Time is a losing proposition & I need help. Hence, I practice my daily skincare regimen religiously! My daily skincare regimen includes using serums, moisturizers, oils, eye creams. Sometimes I indulge in a spritz of Rosewater for refreshment.<br /><br />Now I use my face serums to do two things. First, of course, is for the benefit to my skin; and the various serums produce different effects simply because they consist of different main ingredients. Most all of them help protect against environmental contaminants, help reduce the appearance of lines, and some even help dark spots to lighten. Merlot Sunrise Serum uses natural grape seed antioxidants as its main active ingredient. (If you check the Merlot skincare line website, you'll see that their focus is on the use of grape seed antioxidants in all of their products.)<br /><br /> My second use is my own personal \"spa\" massage. I literally massage the serum into my skin. I focus on my temples, forehead, jaw line, nasal bridge, between eyes, and crows feet areas. I apply a firm, upward rotating massage with my splayed fingers. I thoroughly believe this helps me to relax, relieves tension, and massages the lymph system to aid in drainage. I just feel this is good for me. I even do this more than once a day when I have a headache or a particularly stressful day. This will work with most any serum.<br /><br />It works well with the Merlot Sunrise Serum because it in itself is refreshing, a light hint of \"fresh air\" scent, and literally feels good on my skin.<br /><br />The recommended use is twice daily - morning and evening - on cleansed skin. Then followed by moisturizer. I am totally enjoying this lovely serum.<br /><br />\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udc4d HIGHLY RECOMMENDED\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc9e\n\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95Natural Skincare Antioxidant Made in the U.S.A\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc9e\nLesentia Tinted Moisturizer with SPF 31 \u2013 Tinted Moisturizer For Face With Spf and Blemish Concealer with All Natural Ingredients like Shea Butter, Jojoba Oil, Vitamin E and Zinc* (Medium - 2fl oz)\nL'esentia\n{'Brand': \"L'esentia\", 'Scent': 'Unscented', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Active Ingredients': 'jojoba,vitamin e,zinc', 'Unit Count': '2.00 Fl Oz', 'Package Dimensions': '6.77 x 2.32 x 2.24 inches; 5.29 Ounces', 'UPC': '850016254009'}\nThis fL'Essentia Facial Moisturizer comes in a very convenient pump that fits in to my handbag or I can slip it easily into one of jacket pocket, if I were doing outdoor activities.

But, my very first experience was a disappointing one, as the \"milky\" cleanser worked up nearly no foams at all. At this point, I don't even care that much about its list of active ingredients, no matter how good they are, I felt that my facial cleansing experiences were compromised by the lack of foaming in working up enough lathers, NONE to be visible. If this were a milky \"lotion\", and not intended to be washed off, then I understand!

This is nice, since this permits you to hang the Jaw Exerciser while it's not in use, instead of putting inside my pants pockets which is full of dirt & lint, probably not the best place. NOW, the only thing to try out is:<br />\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14does this thing actually WORK?\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14<br /><br />Well, you first should put the Jaw Exerciser in hot water for 5-10 minutes to soften it, and then after removing the protecting strips, you'd bite down to put pressure and allow the \" softened\" device to be molded according to your individual jawline, which will make the Jaw exercises more effective.<br /><br />I've been trying it for the last 2-3 months, while it's better than nothing - the Jaw muscles are probably the most neglected and difficult to exercise on a regular basis. So, for that purpose, ANY exercise is a plus, however, if you TOTALLY depend your double chins be gone on this gadget, you'd be drastically disappointed \ud83d\ude1e\u2639\ufe0f\ud83d\ude1e\u2639\ufe0f\u2639\ufe0f Simply, it's a supplement to Health Diet, Regular Exercises, and Sleep Well, that's the ONLY way to burn fat, and eliminating double chins, this or ANY Jaw Exerciser is just a gimmick gadget.<br /><br />\u2639\ufe0f\ud83d\ude1f\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\udc4eNot Recommended\ud83d\udc4e\u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude1f\n\u2639\ufe0f\ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\udc4eMore of Gimmick Gadget, noe effective in eliminating Double Chins\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\ude1f\u2639\ufe0f\u2639\ufe0f",
