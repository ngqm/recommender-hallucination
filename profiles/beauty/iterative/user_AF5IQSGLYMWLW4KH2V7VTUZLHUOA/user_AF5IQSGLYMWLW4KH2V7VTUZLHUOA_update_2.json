  "reference_summary": "Face Lift Tapes for Instant Face, Neck and Eye Lift Kit Tape\nC CRYSTAL LEMON\n{'Brand': 'C CRYSTAL LEMON', 'Unit Count': '40.00 Count', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '5.67 x 3.35 x 0.87 inches; 0.6 Ounces', 'UPC': '725330346603'}\nWe all may want to age gracefully but aging does take a toll on our face in the most bothersome way. Sagging skin and age lines look utterly unappealing and make us self-conscious. While there are myriad of facelift choices, such as Botox, facelift surgery, non-surgical facelifts, etc., a large section of women still look for less painful and less expensive options to achieve the best results. An instant facelift is also in pretty high demand to restore a more youthful look and here comes the importance of a face tape. The affordable solution takes years off your face immediately without the use of harmful chemicals or painful injections.<br /><br />Through Amazon's Vine Voices Program, I came across the \u300eCrystal Lemon Face Lift Tape\u300f.<br /><br />Unboxing revealed that it comes in a 40 band-aid lookalike patches of various sizes for different areas of our faces where you'd like to tighten the skins a little. I'm skeptical to begin with, but unless I try, I don't like to pre-judge anything, and let the results speak for themselves.<br /><br />The Premise<br />==========<br />These face lift tapes are basically a \u2018band-aid solution to a mature face\u2019. As the name reveals, it is nothing but a simple facial \u2018tape\u2019 that pulls back and stretches the skin to create an illusion of a tighter face. The tape is usually breathable, hypoallergenic, and of medical-grade. This non-surgical option gives a mini facelift instantly by smoothing out wrinkles and fine lines in a sagging and aged face. Since the last few decades, the facelift tape has been very popular only among Hollywood celebrities. But now, it has become a fast and easy at-home fix for anyone developing premature signs of aging.<br /><br />The VERDICT<br />\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f<br /><br />When used correctly, this Face Lift Tape could make dramatic changes to your aged look by reducing fine lines and wrinkles instantly. They are effective in smoothing out very fine lines around the eyes and firming up the jaw, which is really difficult to achieve even with makeup. However, this typically works better in older seniors like my mom, they didn't quite work, or make any difference, as I'm not old enough. Remember it's easy to go from F to D, but not so easy going from A to A+, if your skins are not wrinkled bad enough, it's nearly impossible to see a difference \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude0f\ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude04<br /><br />\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f If you find my review helpful, pls hit the \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\nWorks Better for Much Older & Wrinkled Skins\nCharyeah Bath Pillow Bathtub Spa Pillow With Powerful Gripping Suctions, Comfortable and Soft 2-Panel Cushions for Head, Neck, Back and Shoulder Support,Fits Hot Tub, Jacuzzi, Spas\nCharyeah\n{'Package Dimensions': '14.33 x 12.28 x 2.2 inches; 9.95 Ounces', 'UPC': '787937393473'}\nAfter a hard day's work or workout session, there's nothing better than nothing than soaking myself in a bubble bath with epsom salt - it really helps me with relaxation & pain relief.
