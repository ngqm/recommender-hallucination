I use a disposable glove to apply it, and that keeps me from accidentally getting it in my eyes or anywhere else I don't intend for it to be. My focus area with this cream is my abdomen, admittedly one of the hardest areas to lose belly fat regardless of method. The burn is delayed for about 10 minutes, but when it starts, I can definitely feel it. It's a strong sensation, but not painful, and it reassures me that the cream is activating. Like probably many other folks who use this cream, I am also doing other things at the same time to try and lose weight: watching what I eat, exercising more, drinking more water, etc. Therefore, even though I am very slowly seeing a reduction in my belly fat, it's difficult for me to say how much of that is from using this cream and how much is from the other measures that I am taking to produce the same result. I consider $12.98 for two tubes a reasonable price for adding this cream to my weight loss efforts, and will continue to use it as long as I continue to see results.\nReview Title: Can Definitely Feel the Heat\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "The Vegan Glow Quinoa Protein Shampoo Bar | EWG Verified | Vegetable proteins from Quinoa & Soybeans\nThe Vegan Glow\n{'Package Dimensions': '2.91 x 2.91 x 1.34 inches; 3.53 Ounces'}\nThis shampoo bar is great for travel away from home. It measures 2 5/8 inches in diameter and about 7/8  inches deep. It fits easily into carry-on luggage, a shaving kit, or a backpack. To me the scent smelled more like chalk than coconut, but it lathers well, cleans thoroughly, and washes out well with no residual scent, so I'm not docking it any stars for the scent. I don't see myself reordering it at the current list price of $13.00 (13% off the original price of $15.00), because there are many other bars with a more pleasant fragrance that do just as good a job, but I will gladly use the rest of this bar without complaint. No matter what, shampoo bars are handy for traveling and are great for the environment, and I like the eco-friendly packaging of just a simply, recyclable cardboard box and no plastic wrapper.\nLathers Well, Cleans Well, Nice and Portable for Travel\nHot Cream 2 Pack, Belly Fat Burner Sweat Cream for Women and Men, Fat Burning Slimming Cream, Slim Weight Loss Cream, Anti-Cellulite Massage Cream for Body Shaping Waist, Abdomen and Buttocks\nPurvigor\n{'Brand': 'Purvigor', 'Scent': 'Unscented', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Unit Count': '2.1164 Ounce', 'Package Dimensions': '5.59 x 4.96 x 1.73 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Purvigor'}\nThis order comes with two 60 ml tubes of slimming cream.
