I tried a prior one that was much bigger with supporting sides that ran halfway down my back, and found that it put me at an awkward angle in the tub that put way too much pressure on my tailbone and was extremely uncomfortable. I ordered this one to replace the other one, and I am thrilled with it. It's incredibly comfortable to rest my head against, and stays in place well using the two large suction cups on the back of it. I usually like to slide deeper into the tub about halfway through my bath, and this pillow is small enough and light enough that I can simply and easily readjust it to my new position, and it's still just as secure and just as comfortable after I've moved it. When I'm done bathing, it has a handy plastic hook attached that I can use to hang the bath pillow on the towel rack to dry. This pillow currently sells for $12.99, and I feel like it's a good value.\nReview Title: So Soft and Comfortable, Perfect Size for Me\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "The Vegan Glow Quinoa Protein Shampoo Bar | EWG Verified | Vegetable proteins from Quinoa & Soybeans\nThe Vegan Glow\n{'Package Dimensions': '2.91 x 2.91 x 1.34 inches; 3.53 Ounces'}\nThis shampoo bar is great for travel away from home. It measures 2 5/8 inches in diameter and about 7/8  inches deep. It fits easily into carry-on luggage, a shaving kit, or a backpack. To me the scent smelled more like chalk than coconut, but it lathers well, cleans thoroughly, and washes out well with no residual scent, so I'm not docking it any stars for the scent. I don't see myself reordering it at the current list price of $13.00 (13% off the original price of $15.00), because there are many other bars with a more pleasant fragrance that do just as good a job, but I will gladly use the rest of this bar without complaint. No matter what, shampoo bars are handy for traveling and are great for the environment, and I like the eco-friendly packaging of just a simply, recyclable cardboard box and no plastic wrapper.\nLathers Well, Cleans Well, Nice and Portable for Travel\nHot Cream 2 Pack, Belly Fat Burner Sweat Cream for Women and Men, Fat Burning Slimming Cream, Slim Weight Loss Cream, Anti-Cellulite Massage Cream for Body Shaping Waist, Abdomen and Buttocks\nPurvigor\n{'Brand': 'Purvigor', 'Scent': 'Unscented', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Unit Count': '2.1164 Ounce', 'Package Dimensions': '5.59 x 4.96 x 1.73 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Purvigor'}\nThis order comes with two 60 ml tubes of slimming cream. I use a disposable glove to apply it, and that keeps me from accidentally getting it in my eyes or anywhere else I don't intend for it to be. My focus area with this cream is my abdomen, admittedly one of the hardest areas to lose belly fat regardless of method. The burn is delayed for about 10 minutes, but when it starts, I can definitely feel it. It's a strong sensation, but not painful, and it reassures me that the cream is activating. Like probably many other folks who use this cream, I am also doing other things at the same time to try and lose weight: watching what I eat, exercising more, drinking more water, etc. Therefore, even though I am very slowly seeing a reduction in my belly fat, it's difficult for me to say how much of that is from using this cream and how much is from the other measures that I am taking to produce the same result. I consider $12.98 for two tubes a reasonable price for adding this cream to my weight loss efforts, and will continue to use it as long as I continue to see results.\nCan Definitely Feel the Heat\nBath Bombs Gift Set, Bath Bomb Gift for Women with Rose Petals, Lavender Scent 5pc Handmade Bubble Bath Gift Box with Soap & Petals Mothers Day Gifts Ideas for Mom, New Mom, Wife Birthday Gift for Her\n# BFFLOVE\n{'Brand': '# BFFLOVE', 'Scent': 'Lavender,Rose', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Benefits': 'Softening,Stress Relief,Moisturizing,Aromatherapy', 'Material Feature': 'Organic, Vegan', 'Product Dimensions': '7.65 x 1.85 x 5.35 inches; 13.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '810001817473', 'Manufacturer': '# BFFLOVE'}\nThis is an absolutely wonderful gift set that is even nicely pre-wrapped with colorful paper and a beige ribbon and bow. The back of the box has a label explaining what's inside, but because of the type of adhesive and the type of glossy wrapping used, this label can be easily peeled off with no sticky adhesive remnant on the wrapping paper (see my before and after photos). Inside the wrapper, is a plain white sturdy cardboard box. Inside, there is a wrapped square bar of scented soap, a box of dried rose petals that look and smell pretty, and three rose and lavender scented bath bombs that spell out the word \"MOM.\" The \"O\" in \"MOM\" is shaped like a pink heart. All these items are resting on a bed of white nesting paper. Both the wrapping paper for the soap and the cardboard of the box containing the rose petals have the same pattern as the outer wrapping paper. Among other ingredients, each bath bomb contains coconut oil, sea salt, and shea butter. For the dried rose petals, it says to place them in still, warm bath water. It also says to drain the bath as usual as the dried florals are biodegradable. This gift is not just for Mother's Day, it's for any mom, any day, who would enjoy a thoughtful gift and a relaxing bath with these lovely scented bath bombs.\nVery Nice Pre-Wrapped Gift Set for Moms of All Ages\nFacial Cleansing Brush, Wireless Charging Base Soft Brush Set with 3 Brush Heads for Face Spa, Exfoliating, Massaging and Deep Cleansing\nSyllable\n{'Brand': 'Syllable', 'Power Source': 'electric', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '8.74 x 6.89 x 3.31 inches; 1.52 Pounds'}\nWhen I first tried this facial cleansing brush I thought it was broken, the brushes would not spin they just vibrated.  Upon further review of the product information page I could see that the device did in fact work by vibration.  The set comes with three brush heads for dry, normal and oily skin.  There's also a wireless charging base that can hold one of the brush heads, a charging cable (USB to micro USB) and a \"user guide\" which is not very good (it states that there are two brushes, there are three, a number of other problems).  The guide also recommends replacing the brushes after using for 3 months but I couldn't find any replacement brushes.  May be a good facial cleaner but it just tickled my face and didn't feel like it was doing much else.\nBrushes do not spin, they vibrate\nNot My Mama's Bubbling Girls Face Wash All Natural Daily Cleanser 6 oz.\nNot My Mama's\n{'Product Dimensions': '1.5 x 1.5 x 6.75 inches; 7.37 Ounces'}\nI got this for my wife, and here is her review: I liked this Not My Mama's Bubbling Face Wash before I even received it, because I thought the name was cute. The plastic 6 oz bottle has an iridescent label that reflects light just like bubbles do, which is kind of cool. The ingredient list is full of natural components, which is good. The bottle has an inner safety seal, so there was no leakage during shipment. This also reassures me that the contents have not been tampered with. The wash itself applies smoothly. Best of all, though, are the results. This cleans my face thoroughly and gently, and shrinks my pores well. My skin feels smooth and fresh after using this. I have very sensitive skin, and it's extremely hard for me to find a face wash that cleans well without leaving my face feeling dry and irritated. This face wash does exactly what I need for it to do. It currently lists for $20, but it takes very little to clean my entire face, so I expect it to last a while. After trying so many disappointing facial cleansers, I am quite happy with this one and definitely consider it a good value.\nCleans Well and Shrinks Pores\nGryph & IvyRose Coat of Arms Hydrating Lotion for Kids - Hydrating Moisturizer with Shea Butter & Coconut Oil - All Natural, Sustainable, Cruelty Free, No Parabens, No Sulfates, Vegan - USA Made - 8oz\nGryph & IvyRose\n{'Brand': 'Gryph & IvyRose', 'Scent': 'Coconut Shea', 'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Active Ingredients': 'Sweet Almond Oil', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '5.67 x 2.28 x 2.24 inches; 8 Ounces', 'UPC': '856991007210'}\nThis Gryph & IvyRose Coat of Arms Body Lotion smells so good that I can't seem to stop sniffing my hands once I've applied the lotion. It comes in an 8 fl. oz. (240 ml) plastic bottle with a push top cap and a couple of cute sea turtles on the label. The lotion is thick and white and contains lots of ingredients that are wonderful for my skin--oils, botanical extracts, aloe, shea butter, etc. My skin is left smooth, soft, well hydrated, and smelling wonderful. This body lotion currently sells for $14.99, and I consider it a good value for kids and adults alike.\nWonderful Scent, Mositurizes Well\nBathtub Pillow, Non Slip, Breathable Soft, Comfortable Head Neck Support, Machine Washable, 2 Large Suction Cups (Blue)\nJxmnTex\n{'Package Dimensions': '12.2 x 8.03 x 3.03 inches; 4.97 Ounces', 'UPC': '705116001063'}\nThis bath pillow has turned out to be absolutely what I want in a pillow.
