The back of the box has a label explaining what's inside, but because of the type of adhesive and the type of glossy wrapping used, this label can be easily peeled off with no sticky adhesive remnant on the wrapping paper (see my before and after photos). Inside the wrapper, is a plain white sturdy cardboard box. Inside, there is a wrapped square bar of scented soap, a box of dried rose petals that look and smell pretty, and three rose and lavender scented bath bombs that spell out the word \"MOM.\" The \"O\" in \"MOM\" is shaped like a pink heart. All these items are resting on a bed of white nesting paper. Both the wrapping paper for the soap and the cardboard of the box containing the rose petals have the same pattern as the outer wrapping paper. Among other ingredients, each bath bomb contains coconut oil, sea salt, and shea butter. For the dried rose petals, it says to place them in still, warm bath water. It also says to drain the bath as usual as the dried florals are biodegradable. This gift is not just for Mother's Day, it's for any mom, any day, who would enjoy a thoughtful gift and a relaxing bath with these lovely scented bath bombs.\nReview Title: Very Nice Pre-Wrapped Gift Set for Moms of All Ages\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "The Vegan Glow Quinoa Protein Shampoo Bar | EWG Verified | Vegetable proteins from Quinoa & Soybeans\nThe Vegan Glow\n{'Package Dimensions': '2.91 x 2.91 x 1.34 inches; 3.53 Ounces'}\nThis shampoo bar is great for travel away from home. It measures 2 5/8 inches in diameter and about 7/8  inches deep. It fits easily into carry-on luggage, a shaving kit, or a backpack. To me the scent smelled more like chalk than coconut, but it lathers well, cleans thoroughly, and washes out well with no residual scent, so I'm not docking it any stars for the scent. I don't see myself reordering it at the current list price of $13.00 (13% off the original price of $15.00), because there are many other bars with a more pleasant fragrance that do just as good a job, but I will gladly use the rest of this bar without complaint. No matter what, shampoo bars are handy for traveling and are great for the environment, and I like the eco-friendly packaging of just a simply, recyclable cardboard box and no plastic wrapper.\nLathers Well, Cleans Well, Nice and Portable for Travel\nHot Cream 2 Pack, Belly Fat Burner Sweat Cream for Women and Men, Fat Burning Slimming Cream, Slim Weight Loss Cream, Anti-Cellulite Massage Cream for Body Shaping Waist, Abdomen and Buttocks\nPurvigor\n{'Brand': 'Purvigor', 'Scent': 'Unscented', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Unit Count': '2.1164 Ounce', 'Package Dimensions': '5.59 x 4.96 x 1.73 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Purvigor'}\nThis order comes with two 60 ml tubes of slimming cream. I use a disposable glove to apply it, and that keeps me from accidentally getting it in my eyes or anywhere else I don't intend for it to be. My focus area with this cream is my abdomen, admittedly one of the hardest areas to lose belly fat regardless of method. The burn is delayed for about 10 minutes, but when it starts, I can definitely feel it. It's a strong sensation, but not painful, and it reassures me that the cream is activating. Like probably many other folks who use this cream, I am also doing other things at the same time to try and lose weight: watching what I eat, exercising more, drinking more water, etc. Therefore, even though I am very slowly seeing a reduction in my belly fat, it's difficult for me to say how much of that is from using this cream and how much is from the other measures that I am taking to produce the same result. I consider $12.98 for two tubes a reasonable price for adding this cream to my weight loss efforts, and will continue to use it as long as I continue to see results.\nCan Definitely Feel the Heat\nBath Bombs Gift Set, Bath Bomb Gift for Women with Rose Petals, Lavender Scent 5pc Handmade Bubble Bath Gift Box with Soap & Petals Mothers Day Gifts Ideas for Mom, New Mom, Wife Birthday Gift for Her\n# BFFLOVE\n{'Brand': '# BFFLOVE', 'Scent': 'Lavender,Rose', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Benefits': 'Softening,Stress Relief,Moisturizing,Aromatherapy', 'Material Feature': 'Organic, Vegan', 'Product Dimensions': '7.65 x 1.85 x 5.35 inches; 13.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '810001817473', 'Manufacturer': '# BFFLOVE'}\nThis is an absolutely wonderful gift set that is even nicely pre-wrapped with colorful paper and a beige ribbon and bow.
