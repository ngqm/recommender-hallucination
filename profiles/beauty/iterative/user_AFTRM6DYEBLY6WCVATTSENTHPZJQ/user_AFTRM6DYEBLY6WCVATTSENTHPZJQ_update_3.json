I mean, come on a roller for your face?  But I admit I was wrong.  The first few times were pleasant.  I used them to spread my face oil around but I read that it's much better if it's cool.  I put it in the fridge for an hour and OMG!  Total turnaround.  The bags under my eyes shrunk a bit but it feels so much better.  I don't see the cosmetic changes but the coolness against my face after a long day at work.  Two thumbs up.\nReview Title: Jade Roller for Face\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Not colored or processed.  We've been using another conditioner in a primarily African American line but she didn't like the smell (coconut).  This one has won her over completely.  After she gets out of the shower, she puts a dime size dab in hand and coats her hands and then start at the ends works her way to the roots.<br /><br />There is no residue and it washes out completely the next time so there are no flaky specs.\nCarols Daughter Almond Milk Restoring Conditioner\nGreen Goo Natural Skin Care for Eczema, Psoriasis, Cracked Hands and Feet, Black, Dry Skin, 1.82 Ounce\nGreen Goo\n{'Brand': 'Green Goo', 'Scent': 'Dry Skin', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Active Ingredients': '*Achillea Millefolium (Yarrow) Flower Extract, *Calendula Officinalis (Calendula) Flower Oil, *Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower, *Sambucus Nigra (Elder) Flower, *Trifolium Pratense (Red Clover) Flower., Vitamin_e*Achillea Millefolium (Yarrow) Flower Extract, *Calendula Officinalis (Calendula) Flower Oil, *Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower, *Sambucus Nigra (Elder) Flower, *Trif\u2026  See more', 'Unit Count': '1.82 Ounce', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2 x 2 x 0.5 inches; 1.2 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'GOO-05690', 'Department': 'Unisex-adult', 'Date First Available': 'April 22, 2016', 'Manufacturer': 'Green Goo'}\nI got this because of a persistent dry spot on my neck and ear for over a year .

Within two days of four times a day, the dry spots were gone.
