Hard to fit every finger when the nails are different sizes.<br /><br />And, we\u2019re NOT all sized the same. Hence why some packaging is no less than 24 nails with 12 sizes. I know because I\u2019ve bought nails like this for YEARS! Just look up KISS and you\u2019ll see what I am talking about.<br /><br />This?<br /><br />Was this a joke?

That is NOT how you wear these nails to begin with \u2013 and definitely NOT with nail glue. Even being \u201cfake\u201d, the nails should at LEAST attempt to look realistic. See how the salons do them, look on Google (or your favorite search engine).<br /><br />Who thought this was a great idea? And, these HAVE to be the LARGEST sizes for the particular \u201cnails\u201d I\u2019ve seen. These really are a fancier version of the Lee and Wet N\u2019 Wild from the late 1980\u2019s/early 1990\u2019.<br /><br />What\u2019s worse? Even the PACKAGING states: 24<br /><br />Did they not think anyone would notice that detail?<br /><br />I\u2019ll admit, these are pretty. And, thinking it was a HALF package, I contacted Amazon for a return/replacement. I cancelled the replacement, but I am returning these. As I told the rep \u2013 they\u2019re pretty useless as they are. There is NO way I can use these. I would, at MINIMUM, only get 4 nails worth of coverage. For this price? Nope. Not at all. And, I feel sorry for those who do have to pay.<br /><br />In addition, the nearly $16 price tag (excluding sales tax) for 12 nails? Unreasonable. In my case, I\u2019d need TWO (2) sets which would run $32. For that price \u2013 I might as well just wear a mask, go to the salon, and have them do it for me. My nails would definitely last two weeks, and I wouldn\u2019t have to do them myself.<br /><br />I will not be getting these again and DO NOT recommend them. The seller might have a better set out there, but not this selection.\nReview Title: Not Sure if This is a Joke\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

A positive review was not required, nor was it requested, and all words are my own.<br /><br />Getting my nails done is not just a relaxing experience, but it is also an expressive/creative one.<br /><br />Seeing this colorful and glittery set \u2013 I had to get it.<br /><br />I don\u2019t know about others\u2019 experiences \u2013 mine did not come with a brush or applicator for the little \u201cgel pots\u201d. I remembered what my nail techs used to use \u2013 small make-up brushes \u2013 and thankfully I had some. That seemed to work.<br /><br />The black polish is necessary to get the desired effect. I chose the purple glitter gel and after a few awkward moments \u2013 I got a pretty decent manicure. More of the black showed through, there were moments when the purple glitter reflected, but it wasn\u2019t what I thought.<br /><br />I haven\u2019t tried the other colors. But, this is fairly decent and easy to use. Not my favorite as there are other brands out there that are even easier to use.<br /><br />Overall, I\u2019m not too unhappy with it. It\u2019s not something I would likely purchase again.\nNot so Starry\nSTYLEAGAL Portable Electric Nail Drill, Manicure Pedicure Drill Kit Professional nail starter kit for beginners acrylic with drill\uff082020 Upgraded\uff09\nstyleagal\n{'Brand': 'styleagal', 'Voltage': '5 Volts', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.8 x 4.5 x 2 inches; 8.01 Ounces', 'UPC': '782913461771', 'Manufacturer': 'STYLEAGAL'}\nPretty standard nail drill.<br /><br />This is similar, if not identical to most of the nail drills used in the salon.<br /><br />Best used to remove gel polishes and/or nail tips to prepare them for other polishes or plain removal.\nStandard Nail Drill\n20pcs Nail Tips Clips for Quick Building Polygel Nail Forms Nail Tips Clip for Finger Nail Extension DIY Manicure Nail Art Tool\ntiggell\n{'Size': '20 Count (Pack of 1)', 'Material': 'Plastic', 'Brand': 'Tiggell', 'Style': 'French', 'Coverage': 'Full Well Tips', 'Package Dimensions': '8.98 x 6.85 x 2.2 inches; 4.16 Ounces', 'UPC': '795853588163'}\nI mainly got these for a \u201chome-made\u201d gel soak off (using foil).<br /><br />And, they worked! They don\u2019t pinch at all; even my mom used them and said she could barely feel them.<br /><br />Light weight and fairly durable.

So that could make this a bit hard to work with.<br /><br />The colors are pretty though.<br /><br />This isn\u2019t the best kit out there, I have seen better ones. The packaging isn\u2019t that stable or durable. I ended up putting the jars in a pencil case.<br /><br />I honestly wouldn\u2019t get it again.

I have another one by OVLUX (one of my favorites).

I had to SMASH it with my arm to get it to MOVE.<br /><br />The scent? If you\u2019re looking for Bath & Body Works type of Cherry Blossom, you\u2019re not going to get it.<br /><br />Once you get it out, and can take the scent \u2013 after it is applied, it is a soft, moisturizing and no slip scrub.<br /><br />This isn\u2019t something I\u2019d get again or recommend.\nNot The Worst, But Definitely Not The Best\n3 Barrel Curling Iron, 25mm Curling Waver Iron Hair Waver with LCD Display Adjustable Temperature 1 Inch Tourmaline Ceramic Triple Hair Crimper Hair Tools for Deep Waves All Style (1#)\nSolati\n{'Brand': 'Solati', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy, Curly, Normal', 'Material': 'Ceramic', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Max Temperature Setting': '210 Degrees Celsius', 'Package Dimensions': '15.94 x 4.21 x 3.5 inches; 1.54 Pounds', 'UPC': '757350981861', 'Manufacturer': 'Solati'}\nI have been trying, for well over 30 years, to get a curling iron that actually did what it was supposed to \u2013 curl my hair.<br /><br />Hot curlers \u2013 no good results<br /><br />Curling Irons (\u00bc, \u00bd) \u2013 no good results<br /><br /> Wrap-Around Fabric Curlers \u2013 nothing there<br /><br />I saw this and thought it couldn\u2019t fail.

First up \u2013 there is NO heat seating guide for SAFE curling. THIS DEVICE IS CELSIUS (C) ONLY, NO FARENHEIT (F) OPTION. Google is strongly needed here.<br /><br />According to Redken: \u201cFor those with fine or thin hair, keep your iron set below 200 (so below 100\u00b0C on this device) degrees Fahrenheit. Any higher and your strands may burn. For those with coarse or thicker hair, have your curling iron set between 200 degrees and 300 degrees (148.9\u00b0C or on this device 150) Fahrenheit for optimal curls\u201d [9 Curling Iron Secrets You Need to Know About/Redken]<br /><br />Using that, as well as Glamour\u2019s 8-10 second rule [How to Curl Your Hair Correctly: 7 Mistakes to Avoid \u2013 Glamour; \u201cDrill it into your brain: You should hold an iron on your hair for eight to 10 seconds max\u201d], along with using thinner groups of hair \u2013 I should have SOME wave. Nope. I even went 25 seconds. Nothing.<br /><br />As my hair has become a bit thinner, has been color treated, and exposed to SO much \u2013 I wasn\u2019t about to turn this up hotter.<br /><br />The curler is designed much like a crimper, but the \u201cwidth\u201d can make it difficult to handle, especially by yourself. There is a \u201cguard\u201d which heats up as well and it is easy to burn yourself.<br /><br />It wins with innovative idea as well as the digital temp gauge. Also, it does heat up SUPER fast, as well as cool down just as fast when lowering the temp.<br /><br />For use by myself \u2013 this is a two star deal.

I love the idea of the individually gift boxed tubes, the cap is wonderful (huge and easy to use), the product is generously sized.<br /><br />The problem is that this stuff is runny, doesn\u2019t absorb that well on me, and the \u201cscent\u201d that is there \u2013 it isn\u2019t that great.<br /><br />For $15 before tax, that is roughly $3.75 a tube, and while they\u2019re smaller \u2013 I\u2019d honestly stick with Bath & Body Works.<br /><br />This isn\u2019t something I\u2019d get again and I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. I also wouldn\u2019t give it as a gift.\nIt Slightly Works\nTirtyl Hand Soap Sheet Variety Pack - 240 Pack with Portable Storage Tin - Camping/Outdoor/Travel/Handbag - Lavender & Aloe - Bergamot & Ylang Ylang - Jasmine & Patchouli\nTirtyl\n{'Brand': 'Tirtyl', 'Scent': 'Bergamot,Lavender,Jasmine', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Unit Count': '240.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '9.88 x 6.26 x 0.75 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nAs most have said here \u2013 these are great for travel, especially when you can\u2019t find soap around but have water. Though I wouldn\u2019t carry a bar of soap, I have used \u201ctravel\u201d size body wash as a hand soap. If it cleans the body, should clean the hands, right?<br /><br />Anyway \u2026<br /><br />The metal container I got was dented, but that is okay as I don\u2019t intend to travel where I won\u2019t have soap. So, I\u2019m using these at my bathroom sink.<br /><br />LET ME STATE THIS AS A WARNING: HANDS MUST BE DRY BEFORE GRABBING A SOAP SHEET.<br /><br />I know all caps is yelling, but trust me \u2013 it is for a VERY GOOD reason. As one reviewer said, even a drop of water can damage these.<br /><br />Basically I grab a one with dry hands, hold it in palm, turn water on, let it dissolve. Good lather, I don\u2019t really smell a \u201cscent\u201d, hands wash clean. They don\u2019t dry out, but I do use a moisturizing sanitizer, and hand lotion after.<br /><br />I wouldn\u2019t say these go years \u2013 if you\u2019re like me and using them as an alternative to other hand soaps to preserve waste, they might last about a month (8 washes per day, 30 days). If only as travel backup \u2013 they might last a few years. Again, it depends on how they\u2019re used.<br /><br />I personally find them a bit on the pricey side at almost $10 before tax. That\u2019s just me.<br /><br />I do have other soaps, and these should last me a while. I would not recommend them as a body wash. As opposed to carrying a bar of soap, try a travel container with body wash. Just my suggestion.\nGreat for Travel\nYOUNG VISION Pearl Hard Wax Beads for Hair Removal, Wax Beans 1000 g/2.2 lb/35 oz for Home Waxing, Painless Bikini&Brazilian Waxing Beads, Thick/Coarse Hair Removal Wax Kit, Sensitive Skin Friendly\nYOUNG VISION\n{'Item Form': 'Wax', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'YOUNG VISION', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '7.99 x 6.14 x 4.88 inches; 2.72 Pounds'}\nI think a lot of us want an easier way to remove hair. Shaving, especially for a bigger girl like me, is not that easy. It\u2019s worse when you have long legs, short arms.<br /><br />It\u2019s bad when you have certain chin hairs (thankfully not that much it isn\u2019t manageable another way).<br /><br />I tried some sugar wax kit back about 20+ years ago. That was a NIGHTMARE! It was supposedly edible. I think you microwaved the container, spread it on, let it cool, used a paper strip (supplied) to remove the hair. It didn\u2019t work and stung.<br /><br />I then moved to a hair removal cream, that partially worked.<br /><br />After that? Back to the hold stand-by \u2013> shave foam/cream and a razor. For my main body parts, that\u2019s always worked. Tough \u201cchin\u201d hairs \u2013> using a tweezer work. No, the dermaplaning tool didn\u2019t work on them.<br /><br />I got a wax warmer, so I thought all beads/beans were equal.<br /><br />These came with ZERO instructions, and the after spray bottle was busted. The warmer kit at least had some. And, my warmer kit had specially made, disposable \u201ccups\u201d.<br /><br />These beads/beans, in a smaller cup, took over 90 minute to melt. And, the warmer was on 180\u00b0(F).<br /><br />I tried a small amount on my arm. The wax was sticky, not liquidy, and it cooled almost as soon as it hit my skin.<br /><br />I let it sit there for a few minutes (over 5), and peeled the max off. It didn\u2019t hurt, sting, or cause redness \u2013 then again \u2026<br /><br />THE HAIR WAS STILL THERE<br /><br />Okay, so my hair on my arm is a little thin. But, if this removes thick hair, shouldn\u2019t it remove thinner hair?<br /><br />I found another patch, got some warm wax \u2013 tried it again. Nope. Tried legs, arms, and under my chin. Nothing. Then again, I see I'm not the only one experiencing issues with these beads/beans.<br /><br />I may have gotten a bad batch. But, I definitely wouldn\u2019t get these again.\nWax On, Wax Off, Hair Still There\nFIDDY898 Gold Silver Floral Hair Comb For Bride Tiny Beaded Wedding Hair Jewelry-Silver\nFIDDY898\n{'Brand': 'FIDDY898', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Color': 'Gold,Silver', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '5.9 x 3.9 x 2.2 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'FDSD061101'}\nThis is, for less than $10, a lovely comb.<br /><br />Can function at a wedding or other event. However, the cons outweigh the beauty.<br /><br />Given how delicate this is, there is NO storage box or bag. So, after use \u2013 where does one put it? That is an issue for me. Even a simple velvet type bag would be a good idea.<br /><br />Second? The comb itself.<br /><br />While absolutely stunning in design \u2013 function is a bit questionable because of the construction. The combs are \u201cOPEN\u201d design \u2013 thus loose hairs can weave in, particularly those with thick and curly hair. This makes removal or readjusting a bit difficult if not a tad uncomfortable.<br /><br />This is also for thicker hair, not thin, and thus circles back to the issue I just presented.<br /><br />While pretty, it isn\u2019t something I am particularly pleased with. It isn\u2019t something I would get for myself again. I also wouldn\u2019t give it as a gift.\nBeautiful But Need to Be Cautious When Using\nNULASTIN Skin \u2013 Gentle Exfoliating Cleanser | Invigorating Face Scrub with Caffeine, Jojoba Oil Beads, Calendula Flower Extract & Witch Hazel \u2014 For Dry, Oily & Sensitive Skin (Vegan & Cruelty-Free)\nNULASTIN\n{'Brand': 'NULASTIN', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Skin Type': 'Dry,All Skin Types', 'Product Benefits': 'Exfoliating', 'Material Feature': 'Cruelty Free, Vegan', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.38 x 2.36 x 6.5 inches; 6.88 Ounces', 'UPC': '718122770717'}\nThis is an exfoliating facial cleanser that really didn't feel that great or give me that much in benefits.

The seller might have a better set out there, but not this selection.\nNot Sure if This is a Joke",
