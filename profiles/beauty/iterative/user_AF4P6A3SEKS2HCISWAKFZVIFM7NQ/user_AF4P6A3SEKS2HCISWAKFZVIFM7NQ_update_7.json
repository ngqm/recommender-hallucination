Google is strongly needed here.<br /><br />According to Redken: \u201cFor those with fine or thin hair, keep your iron set below 200 (so below 100\u00b0C on this device) degrees Fahrenheit.

Also, it does heat up SUPER fast, as well as cool down just as fast when lowering the temp.<br /><br />For use by myself \u2013 this is a two star deal.

  "reference_summary": "Biutee Starry Sky Nail Gel Firework Nail Gel With black Nail Polish Gel 8ml UV LED\nBiutee\n{'Brand': 'Biutee', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'Gel', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '3.5274 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Liquid Volume': '0.27 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '4.92 x 3.31 x 1.77 inches; 4.59 Ounces'}\nThank you in advance to the Amazon VINE program for providing an item to review. A positive review was not required, nor was it requested, and all words are my own.<br /><br />Getting my nails done is not just a relaxing experience, but it is also an expressive/creative one.<br /><br />Seeing this colorful and glittery set \u2013 I had to get it.<br /><br />I don\u2019t know about others\u2019 experiences \u2013 mine did not come with a brush or applicator for the little \u201cgel pots\u201d. I remembered what my nail techs used to use \u2013 small make-up brushes \u2013 and thankfully I had some. That seemed to work.<br /><br />The black polish is necessary to get the desired effect. I chose the purple glitter gel and after a few awkward moments \u2013 I got a pretty decent manicure. More of the black showed through, there were moments when the purple glitter reflected, but it wasn\u2019t what I thought.<br /><br />I haven\u2019t tried the other colors. But, this is fairly decent and easy to use. Not my favorite as there are other brands out there that are even easier to use.<br /><br />Overall, I\u2019m not too unhappy with it. It\u2019s not something I would likely purchase again.\nNot so Starry\nSTYLEAGAL Portable Electric Nail Drill, Manicure Pedicure Drill Kit Professional nail starter kit for beginners acrylic with drill\uff082020 Upgraded\uff09\nstyleagal\n{'Brand': 'styleagal', 'Voltage': '5 Volts', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.8 x 4.5 x 2 inches; 8.01 Ounces', 'UPC': '782913461771', 'Manufacturer': 'STYLEAGAL'}\nPretty standard nail drill.<br /><br />This is similar, if not identical to most of the nail drills used in the salon.<br /><br />Best used to remove gel polishes and/or nail tips to prepare them for other polishes or plain removal.\nStandard Nail Drill\n20pcs Nail Tips Clips for Quick Building Polygel Nail Forms Nail Tips Clip for Finger Nail Extension DIY Manicure Nail Art Tool\ntiggell\n{'Size': '20 Count (Pack of 1)', 'Material': 'Plastic', 'Brand': 'Tiggell', 'Style': 'French', 'Coverage': 'Full Well Tips', 'Package Dimensions': '8.98 x 6.85 x 2.2 inches; 4.16 Ounces', 'UPC': '795853588163'}\nI mainly got these for a \u201chome-made\u201d gel soak off (using foil).<br /><br />And, they worked! They don\u2019t pinch at all; even my mom used them and said she could barely feel them.<br /><br />Light weight and fairly durable. There are enough for two people to use at the same time, or extras on hand if they ever break.<br /><br />If used for poly gels, I\u2019m sure they would work just as well.\nNail Clips\nAcrylic Nail Powder Set Vcedas 24 Colors Acrylic Nail Art Tips UV Gel Carving Powder Dust Design Decoration 3D Manicure\nVcedas\n{'Product Dimensions': '5.91 x 3.94 x 0.79 inches; 1.3 Pounds'}\nBe warned, this is NOT \u201cdip powder\u201d. This is indeed acrylic powder in VERY small jars.<br /><br />This does not come with instructions though \u2013 at least mine didn\u2019t. So that could make this a bit hard to work with.<br /><br />The colors are pretty though.<br /><br />This isn\u2019t the best kit out there, I have seen better ones. The packaging isn\u2019t that stable or durable. I ended up putting the jars in a pencil case.<br /><br />I honestly wouldn\u2019t get it again. As far as durability, I usually do my manicure every week or so.\nNot The Best Set Out There\nUV LED Nail Lamp \u2013 128W Rapid-Curing Gel Nails Dryer for Manicures and Pedicures \u2013 Dual-Voltage with Extra-Long Cable, Multi-Language Manual \u2013 Professional Gel Lamp for Homes or Salons by OVLUX, Gold\nOVLUX\n{'Brand': 'OVLUX', 'Special Feature': 'Energy Efficient', 'Light Source Type': 'LED', 'Material': 'Gel', 'Connectivity Technology': 'USB', 'Package Dimensions': '9.4 x 8.3 x 4.3 inches; 1.55 Pounds', 'UPC': '765453999881'}\nThis UV/LED lamp is by far one of the best I\u2019ve used. I have another one by OVLUX (one of my favorites). So, when I saw this, I didn\u2019t hesitate to get it to have on standby.<br /><br />There are a few issues with it, but I\u2019m overall pleased.<br /><br />Very easy to use.\nGold Standard of Lamps\nCherry Blossom Hand & Body Sugar Polish by South of France Clean Body Care | Moisturizing Sugar Scrub for Women | Shea Butter + Sunflower Oil | 8 oz Tube\nSouth of France Natural Body Care\n{'Brand': 'South of France Natural Body Care', 'Product Benefits': 'Moisturizing', 'Active Ingredients': 'Shea butter', 'Material Feature': 'Gluten Free, Natural', 'Item Volume': '8 Fluid Ounces', 'Product Dimensions': '8 x 2.8 x 2 inches; 8.8 Ounces', 'UPC': '856885005148', 'Manufacturer': 'South Of France LLC'}\nI really wanted to LOVE this scrub \u2013 there was just too much wrong with it to even LIKE it.<br /><br />First of all \u2013 this is FAR TOO THICK to squeeze out of the tube. I had to SMASH it with my arm to get it to MOVE.<br /><br />The scent? If you\u2019re looking for Bath & Body Works type of Cherry Blossom, you\u2019re not going to get it.<br /><br />Once you get it out, and can take the scent \u2013 after it is applied, it is a soft, moisturizing and no slip scrub.<br /><br />This isn\u2019t something I\u2019d get again or recommend.\nNot The Worst, But Definitely Not The Best\n3 Barrel Curling Iron, 25mm Curling Waver Iron Hair Waver with LCD Display Adjustable Temperature 1 Inch Tourmaline Ceramic Triple Hair Crimper Hair Tools for Deep Waves All Style (1#)\nSolati\n{'Brand': 'Solati', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy, Curly, Normal', 'Material': 'Ceramic', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Max Temperature Setting': '210 Degrees Celsius', 'Package Dimensions': '15.94 x 4.21 x 3.5 inches; 1.54 Pounds', 'UPC': '757350981861', 'Manufacturer': 'Solati'}\nI have been trying, for well over 30 years, to get a curling iron that actually did what it was supposed to \u2013 curl my hair.<br /><br />Hot curlers \u2013 no good results<br /><br />Curling Irons (\u00bc, \u00bd) \u2013 no good results<br /><br /> Wrap-Around Fabric Curlers \u2013 nothing there<br /><br />I saw this and thought it couldn\u2019t fail.
