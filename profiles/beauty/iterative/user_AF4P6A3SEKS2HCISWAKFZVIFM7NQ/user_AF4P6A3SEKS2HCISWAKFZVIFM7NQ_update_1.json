A positive review was not required, nor was it requested, and all words are my own.<br /><br />Getting my nails done is not just a relaxing experience, but it is also an expressive/creative one.<br /><br />Seeing this colorful and glittery set \u2013 I had to get it.<br /><br />I don\u2019t know about others\u2019 experiences \u2013 mine did not come with a brush or applicator for the little \u201cgel pots\u201d. I remembered what my nail techs used to use \u2013 small make-up brushes \u2013 and thankfully I had some. That seemed to work.<br /><br />The black polish is necessary to get the desired effect. I chose the purple glitter gel and after a few awkward moments \u2013 I got a pretty decent manicure. More of the black showed through, there were moments when the purple glitter reflected, but it wasn\u2019t what I thought.<br /><br />I haven\u2019t tried the other colors. But, this is fairly decent and easy to use. Not my favorite as there are other brands out there that are even easier to use.<br /><br />Overall, I\u2019m not too unhappy with it. It\u2019s not something I would likely purchase again.\nReview Title: Not so Starry\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
