  "reference_summary": "Biutee Starry Sky Nail Gel Firework Nail Gel With black Nail Polish Gel 8ml UV LED\nBiutee\n{'Brand': 'Biutee', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'Gel', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '3.5274 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Liquid Volume': '0.27 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '4.92 x 3.31 x 1.77 inches; 4.59 Ounces'}\nThank you in advance to the Amazon VINE program for providing an item to review. A positive review was not required, nor was it requested, and all words are my own.<br /><br />Getting my nails done is not just a relaxing experience, but it is also an expressive/creative one.<br /><br />Seeing this colorful and glittery set \u2013 I had to get it.<br /><br />I don\u2019t know about others\u2019 experiences \u2013 mine did not come with a brush or applicator for the little \u201cgel pots\u201d. I remembered what my nail techs used to use \u2013 small make-up brushes \u2013 and thankfully I had some. That seemed to work.<br /><br />The black polish is necessary to get the desired effect. I chose the purple glitter gel and after a few awkward moments \u2013 I got a pretty decent manicure. More of the black showed through, there were moments when the purple glitter reflected, but it wasn\u2019t what I thought.<br /><br />I haven\u2019t tried the other colors. But, this is fairly decent and easy to use. Not my favorite as there are other brands out there that are even easier to use.<br /><br />Overall, I\u2019m not too unhappy with it. It\u2019s not something I would likely purchase again.\nNot so Starry\nSTYLEAGAL Portable Electric Nail Drill, Manicure Pedicure Drill Kit Professional nail starter kit for beginners acrylic with drill\uff082020 Upgraded\uff09\nstyleagal\n{'Brand': 'styleagal', 'Voltage': '5 Volts', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.8 x 4.5 x 2 inches; 8.01 Ounces', 'UPC': '782913461771', 'Manufacturer': 'STYLEAGAL'}\nPretty standard nail drill.<br /><br />This is similar, if not identical to most of the nail drills used in the salon.<br /><br />Best used to remove gel polishes and/or nail tips to prepare them for other polishes or plain removal.\nStandard Nail Drill\n20pcs Nail Tips Clips for Quick Building Polygel Nail Forms Nail Tips Clip for Finger Nail Extension DIY Manicure Nail Art Tool\ntiggell\n{'Size': '20 Count (Pack of 1)', 'Material': 'Plastic', 'Brand': 'Tiggell', 'Style': 'French', 'Coverage': 'Full Well Tips', 'Package Dimensions': '8.98 x 6.85 x 2.2 inches; 4.16 Ounces', 'UPC': '795853588163'}\nI mainly got these for a \u201chome-made\u201d gel soak off (using foil).<br /><br />And, they worked!
