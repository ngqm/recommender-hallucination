This is indeed acrylic powder in VERY small jars.<br /><br />This does not come with instructions though \u2013 at least mine didn\u2019t. So that could make this a bit hard to work with.<br /><br />The colors are pretty though.<br /><br />This isn\u2019t the best kit out there, I have seen better ones. The packaging isn\u2019t that stable or durable. I ended up putting the jars in a pencil case.<br /><br />I honestly wouldn\u2019t get it again. As far as durability, I usually do my manicure every week or so.\nReview Title: Not The Best Set Out There\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Biutee Starry Sky Nail Gel Firework Nail Gel With black Nail Polish Gel 8ml UV LED\nBiutee\n{'Brand': 'Biutee', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'Gel', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '3.5274 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Liquid Volume': '0.27 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '4.92 x 3.31 x 1.77 inches; 4.59 Ounces'}\nThank you in advance to the Amazon VINE program for providing an item to review. A positive review was not required, nor was it requested, and all words are my own.<br /><br />Getting my nails done is not just a relaxing experience, but it is also an expressive/creative one.<br /><br />Seeing this colorful and glittery set \u2013 I had to get it.<br /><br />I don\u2019t know about others\u2019 experiences \u2013 mine did not come with a brush or applicator for the little \u201cgel pots\u201d. I remembered what my nail techs used to use \u2013 small make-up brushes \u2013 and thankfully I had some. That seemed to work.<br /><br />The black polish is necessary to get the desired effect. I chose the purple glitter gel and after a few awkward moments \u2013 I got a pretty decent manicure. More of the black showed through, there were moments when the purple glitter reflected, but it wasn\u2019t what I thought.<br /><br />I haven\u2019t tried the other colors. But, this is fairly decent and easy to use. Not my favorite as there are other brands out there that are even easier to use.<br /><br />Overall, I\u2019m not too unhappy with it. It\u2019s not something I would likely purchase again.\nNot so Starry\nSTYLEAGAL Portable Electric Nail Drill, Manicure Pedicure Drill Kit Professional nail starter kit for beginners acrylic with drill\uff082020 Upgraded\uff09\nstyleagal\n{'Brand': 'styleagal', 'Voltage': '5 Volts', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.8 x 4.5 x 2 inches; 8.01 Ounces', 'UPC': '782913461771', 'Manufacturer': 'STYLEAGAL'}\nPretty standard nail drill.<br /><br />This is similar, if not identical to most of the nail drills used in the salon.<br /><br />Best used to remove gel polishes and/or nail tips to prepare them for other polishes or plain removal.\nStandard Nail Drill\n20pcs Nail Tips Clips for Quick Building Polygel Nail Forms Nail Tips Clip for Finger Nail Extension DIY Manicure Nail Art Tool\ntiggell\n{'Size': '20 Count (Pack of 1)', 'Material': 'Plastic', 'Brand': 'Tiggell', 'Style': 'French', 'Coverage': 'Full Well Tips', 'Package Dimensions': '8.98 x 6.85 x 2.2 inches; 4.16 Ounces', 'UPC': '795853588163'}\nI mainly got these for a \u201chome-made\u201d gel soak off (using foil).<br /><br />And, they worked! They don\u2019t pinch at all; even my mom used them and said she could barely feel them.<br /><br />Light weight and fairly durable. There are enough for two people to use at the same time, or extras on hand if they ever break.<br /><br />If used for poly gels, I\u2019m sure they would work just as well.\nNail Clips\nAcrylic Nail Powder Set Vcedas 24 Colors Acrylic Nail Art Tips UV Gel Carving Powder Dust Design Decoration 3D Manicure\nVcedas\n{'Product Dimensions': '5.91 x 3.94 x 0.79 inches; 1.3 Pounds'}\nBe warned, this is NOT \u201cdip powder\u201d.
