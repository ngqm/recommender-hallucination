Not the easiest thing to get on when you have long hair but I managed. Then after the time required I wash my hair and couldn't believe how soft it was. It hasn't been that soft in a long time. So I definitely think it was worth the trouble stuffing all my hair in there and letting it sit plus it doesn't smell the greatest, nor does it smell bad I'm just used to very perfumed shampoos. But I'll definitely be using it again.\nSoftness again!\nSea Salt Soap, Sea Mineral Soap, Invigorating Bath Soap, Cleaner Removal Pimple Pores Acne Goat Milk Moisturizing Face Care Soap, for All Skin type\nAMINZER\n{'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Brand': 'AMINZER', 'Scent': 'Coconut', 'Material Feature': 'Natural, Cruelty Free, Paraben Free', 'Package Dimensions': '3.43 x 3.27 x 1.42 inches; 4.27 Ounces', 'Item model number': '1107-149'}\nGreat for your pores and acne.
