Not only is this product lightweight, it smells nice, plus it blends in with my skin tone almost perfectly. This is definitely going to be my go to Foundation.\nAwesome foundation!\nHair Mask,Natural Repair Rejuvenating Hair Mask,Moisturizing Nourishing Hair for Dry and Damaged Hair,Professional Heating Deep Conditioning Hair Treatment\nLDREAMAM\n{'Brand': 'LDREAMAM', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Hair Type': 'Dry', 'Unit Count': '2 Count', 'Package Type': 'Jar', 'Package Dimensions': '7.52 x 5.08 x 0.79 inches; 4.23 Ounces'}\nMade my hair soft again! Not the easiest thing to get on when you have long hair but I managed. Then after the time required I wash my hair and couldn't believe how soft it was. It hasn't been that soft in a long time. So I definitely think it was worth the trouble stuffing all my hair in there and letting it sit plus it doesn't smell the greatest, nor does it smell bad I'm just used to very perfumed shampoos. But I'll definitely be using it again.\nSoftness again!\nSea Salt Soap, Sea Mineral Soap, Invigorating Bath Soap, Cleaner Removal Pimple Pores Acne Goat Milk Moisturizing Face Care Soap, for All Skin type\nAMINZER\n{'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Brand': 'AMINZER', 'Scent': 'Coconut', 'Material Feature': 'Natural, Cruelty Free, Paraben Free', 'Package Dimensions': '3.43 x 3.27 x 1.42 inches; 4.27 Ounces', 'Item model number': '1107-149'}\nGreat for your pores and acne. My husband's back started breaking out and after using this for a few days it's clearing up and looks less irritated. Plus it came with a bag which I didn't know what for until I read the instructions and it is a foaming bag and it really makes the soap foam!\nGood for your pores \ud83e\uddfc\ud83e\uddfc\ud83e\uddfc\nColor Changing Nail Polish, Gel Nail Polish Set, Nail Thermal Sensitive Liquid, Black Nail Polish Gel, Nail Art Brush Changeable Color Changing Liquid Kit 4Parts\nCherioll\n{'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'Cherioll', 'Included Components': 'Gel Nail polish', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Package Dimensions': '8.3 x 6 x 1.2 inches; 3.99 Ounces'}\nI've had an obsession with gels with my time off from work these past months and I wanted to try this color changing polish.<br />It comes with designs and while the color itself is dark it does change.<br />I am enjoying trying the designs but man it does take practice!!!\nBeen obsessed with gels \ud83d\udc85\ud83c\udffb",
