  "reference_summary": "BeautyBio GloPRO Regeneration Tools\n{'Product Dimensions': '9.88 x 2.38 x 7.88 inches; 1.3 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'ZumYu', 'Batteries': '2 AAA batteries required. (included)', 'UPC': '810813030237 851262002673', 'Manufacturer': 'BeautyBio', 'Country of Origin': 'China'}\nThis is a very nice Microneedling tool.  Although it is probably more of an exfoliation than a true microneedling session by a pro, it definitely makes a difference.  No redness, no swelling and no bleeding.  Skin was definitely softer after use and moisturizer was absorbed better and more thoroughly.<br /><br />The 2 different sized rollers and red light therapy are a nice bonus.<br /><br />Recommend.\nReally nice\nReplacement Toothbrush Heads Compatible For Oral-B Braun Electric Toothbrush ,Sensitive brush heads Extra soft bristles. 8 Count\nYuanJian\n{'Brand': 'YuanJian', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Kid', 'Item Firmness Description': 'Extra Soft', 'Number of Pieces': '8', 'Item Form': 'ROUND', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '0.43 x 0.39 x 2.76 inches; 0.81 Ounces', 'UPC': '633337444805'}\nOverall a decent alternative to the originals.  My brush's didn't feel extremely soft but they weren't stiff or hard either.  To me they compare the normal brush head stiffness of original Oral B heads.<br /><br />I still prefer the floss head type, but these will work just fine.\nGood replacement brush\n1 Ounce Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Skin \u2013 Hydrating Facial Moisturizer with Anti-Aging Skin Care Properties.
