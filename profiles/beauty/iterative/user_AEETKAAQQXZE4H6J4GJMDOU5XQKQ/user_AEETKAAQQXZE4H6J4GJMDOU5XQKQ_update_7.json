  "reference_summary": "BeautyBio GloPRO Regeneration Tools\n{'Product Dimensions': '9.88 x 2.38 x 7.88 inches; 1.3 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'ZumYu', 'Batteries': '2 AAA batteries required. (included)', 'UPC': '810813030237 851262002673', 'Manufacturer': 'BeautyBio', 'Country of Origin': 'China'}\nThis is a very nice Microneedling tool.  Although it is probably more of an exfoliation than a true microneedling session by a pro, it definitely makes a difference.  No redness, no swelling and no bleeding.  Skin was definitely softer after use and moisturizer was absorbed better and more thoroughly.<br /><br />The 2 different sized rollers and red light therapy are a nice bonus.<br /><br />Recommend.\nReally nice\nReplacement Toothbrush Heads Compatible For Oral-B Braun Electric Toothbrush ,Sensitive brush heads Extra soft bristles. 8 Count\nYuanJian\n{'Brand': 'YuanJian', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Kid', 'Item Firmness Description': 'Extra Soft', 'Number of Pieces': '8', 'Item Form': 'ROUND', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '0.43 x 0.39 x 2.76 inches; 0.81 Ounces', 'UPC': '633337444805'}\nOverall a decent alternative to the originals.  My brush's didn't feel extremely soft but they weren't stiff or hard either.  To me they compare the normal brush head stiffness of original Oral B heads.<br /><br />I still prefer the floss head type, but these will work just fine.\nGood replacement brush\n1 Ounce Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Skin \u2013 Hydrating Facial Moisturizer with Anti-Aging Skin Care Properties. Beauty and Skin Care\nTemer\n{'Brand': 'Temer', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Active Ingredients': 'Hyaluronic_acid', 'Unit Count': '1 Fl. Oz', 'Number of Items': '1'}\nI really like this Hyaluronic Acid Serum for the face.  I haven't used it long enough to comment on the anti-aging effectiveness, but it does sink into my skin very fast.  It does not leave a sticky feeling and makes your skin soft and smooth.\nAbsorbs quickly!\nMountain Falls Regular Dip-It Nail Polish Remover for Natural Nails, with Vitamin E and Panthenol, 6 Fluid Ounce\nMountain Falls\n[\"Don't wait for your next spa day to treat yourself.

Nice, convenient and a great price!\nQuick results!\nNatwag Makeup Remover Pads,18 Pack 3.74 Inch Reusable Microfiber Cleansing Pad with Laundry Bag Suitable for All Skin Types,3 Color Facial Cleansing Pad Set.\nNatwag\n{'Brand': 'Natwag', 'Skin Type': 'All Skin,Dry', 'Material Feature': 'Reusable', 'Unit Count': '18.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '18', 'Package Dimensions': '4.4 x 4.37 x 2.59 inches; 3.84 Ounces', 'UPC': '745103569701'}\nI love these makeup remover pads from Natwag!  My college age daughter bought some and they worked great for her, so I decided to try them too.  I was surprised at how easily they remove makeup.  I really like that I will not have to buy cotton pads anymore.  They come will a really nice zippered bag to wash them in.  Overall, I'm very happy and would recommend to anyone!\nAwesome!\nFoot Peel Mask For Cracked Heels, Dead Skin & Calluses - Make Your Feet Baby Soft & Get a Smooth Skin, Removes & Repairs Rough Heels\nMonikahair\n{'UPC': '739515020639'}\nI live in a really dry climate so my skin gets dry and cracked easily.  I also like to wear flip flops a lot which makes my feet especially dried out.  I used the Baby Feet and two days later the peeling began.  I think Im on day four now and they are almost done peeling.  My feet already look so much better and feel so much softer.  I would definitely use again in the future!\nWorks amazingly well!\n[Marshique] Eyelash & Eyebrow Growth Serum 0.25 Fl Oz - Oil Free Formula Essence Conditioner for Extension & Perm Treatment Care\nMarshique\n{'Brand': 'Marshique', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Package Information': 'Tube', 'Package Type': 'Box', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.59 x 1.54 x 0.75 inches; 0.63 Ounces', 'Item model number': '0000'}\nThis eyelash serum from Marshique is super simple to use and easy to make part of your nightly routine.
