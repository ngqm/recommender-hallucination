The blonde has so much brass in it! It's almost red in color. (I put a few pictures with my review. The lighter blonde is the color that I expect when I order blonde.) There are also more dark black strands coursing thru these pieces than any other brand I've used. Maybe it's just this particular color?  Comes with clips, which is nice. And hair is soft.\nReview Title: Not my favorite blonde\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

That said, it moisturizes and hydrates beautifully. Everything dissolves and washes off completely and it smells so light and fresh!\nSmells great! Works ok.\nC.O.

It's been a game changer for my hands this winter. There is very little scent. Which suprised me because it's filled with so many natural extracts like apple, lemon, carrot, aloe, grapefruit.  The directions suggest to put on before bed and slip cotton gloves on. I'm not planning on doing that because I'm not 80, but am still very impressed at how long my hands feel protected and moisturized.\nAwesome product\nOrganic Labs - Eyelash & Eyebrow Growth Serum - Enhancer Treatment to Grow Natural, Lush, Lavish Eyelashes & Eyebrows - Best Rapid Brow & Lash Boost for Longer, Fuller Lashes and Thicker Brows\nOrganic Labs\n{'Brand': 'Organic Labs', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Item Weight': '0.04 Pounds', 'Package Type': 'Box', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.79 x 5 x 0.59 inches; 0.64 Ounces', 'UPC': '600291368584'}\nI only received 1 tube of eyelash serum. I apply it right at my lash line, as directed, on a clean face. Have not seen any notable  difference.
