That said, it moisturizes and hydrates beautifully. Everything dissolves and washes off completely and it smells so light and fresh!\nSmells great! Works ok.\nC.O. Bigelow No. 007 Dr Hiosous Quince Hand Lotion, 4 Ounces\nC. O. Bigelow\n{'Brand': 'C. O. Bigelow', 'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Unit Count': '4 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Use for': 'Hands', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.6 x 2 x 0.7 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'Item model number': '20002240'}\nThis stuff is wonderful. It's been a game changer for my hands this winter. There is very little scent. Which suprised me because it's filled with so many natural extracts like apple, lemon, carrot, aloe, grapefruit.  The directions suggest to put on before bed and slip cotton gloves on. I'm not planning on doing that because I'm not 80, but am still very impressed at how long my hands feel protected and moisturized.\nAwesome product\nOrganic Labs - Eyelash & Eyebrow Growth Serum - Enhancer Treatment to Grow Natural, Lush, Lavish Eyelashes & Eyebrows - Best Rapid Brow & Lash Boost for Longer, Fuller Lashes and Thicker Brows\nOrganic Labs\n{'Brand': 'Organic Labs', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Item Weight': '0.04 Pounds', 'Package Type': 'Box', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.79 x 5 x 0.59 inches; 0.64 Ounces', 'UPC': '600291368584'}\nI only received 1 tube of eyelash serum. I apply it right at my lash line, as directed, on a clean face. Have not seen any notable  difference. Does not sting or irritate my eyes.\nNot sure if this works.\nLovrio 20\" 20 Pcs 50g Glue Hair Extensions Piano Color Dirty Blonde mixed with Light Golden Blonde P18-22 Seamless in Human Hair Hair Extensions With Adhensive Tape\nLovrio\n{'Brand': 'Lovrio', 'Hair Type': 'Oily', 'Installation Type': 'tape', 'Package Dimensions': '10.24 x 4.25 x 1.89 inches; 6.7 Ounces', 'UPC': '633085357099'}\nOf all the extensions I've ordered, this is my least favorite. The blonde has so much brass in it! It's almost red in color. (I put a few pictures with my review. The lighter blonde is the color that I expect when I order blonde.) There are also more dark black strands coursing thru these pieces than any other brand I've used. Maybe it's just this particular color?  Comes with clips, which is nice. And hair is soft.\nNot my favorite blonde\nI WOKE UP LIKE THIS Turn-over Rice Perfect Oil Foam Cleanser \u2013 A Hypoallergenic Cleansing oil, Foaming Face Wash with Rice Bran Extract. Makeup Removal, Deep Facial Cleansing for Sensitive Skin\nI WOKE UP LIKE THIS\n{'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Brand': 'I WOKE UP LIKE THIS', 'Scent': 'Rose', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '5.39 x 3.31 x 1.54 inches; 2.43 Ounces'}\nI love oil based cleansers and don't use anything else. But they are not for everyone. My 20 year old daughter doesn't like this product, while I think it's one of the best I've used. The smell is subtle and I love the suppleness of my skin after cleaning!\nTop quality cleanser\nlilah b. - Bronzed Beauty Bronzer Duo - b. sunkissed - Multipurpose Bronzer Duo to Highlight + Contour and Blend\nLILAH B\n{'Brand': 'LILAH B', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Style': 'Compact', 'Package Dimensions': '3.8 x 3.5 x 1 inches; 0.32 Ounces', 'UPC': '851078006100'}\nThis is such a high end product. The weighted compact feels sleek and heavy in your hand. The slide/pivot opening is clever and works smooth. The color saturation is rich and deep and looks flawless on many skin tones. Not too much shimmer, so it actually looks like you've been sun kissed after application. Buildable color if you want a more intense look. You can use both colors together, which is what I do. I am medium complexion, blonde, 48 years old. This product doesn't increase pores size, nor does it settle into any wrinkles. In my opinion, deserving of more than 5 stars.\nTHE BEST BRONZER I'VE EVER USED\nCESTLV Bamboo Charcoal Toothbrush + Toothpaste Kit (10 Pack Bulk), Hotel Amenities for Guest & Travel, BPA Free, Individually Boxed Dental Kits, Recyclable\nC'est La Vie\n{'Brand': \"C'est La Vie\", 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Special Feature': 'Charcoal Toothbrush', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Material Feature': 'Recyclable', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.4 x 3.62 x 2.2 inches; 7.05 Ounces', 'Item model number': '0011', 'UPC': '703980635810'}\nVery decent bamboo toothbrush. Generally the bristles are too soft for me. This one is medium-soft. So at least it feels like my mouth is clean after brushing. Lightweight, no guilt. Even the packaging is made from recycled material. Great to have multi pack!\nVery nice brush\nPurple Hair Mask for Blonde with Keratin & Jojoba Oil - Platinum & Silver Hair - Instantly Eliminate Brassiness & Yellows - Made in USA - Hair Toner - Bleached & Highlighted Hair - Sulfate Free - 8 oz\nWELLUTION\n{'Brand': 'WELLUTION', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Hair Type': 'Damaged,Dry,Color-treated', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating Treatment', 'Package Dimensions': '3.07 x 2.9 x 2.8 inches; 8 Ounces', 'UPC': '749715278440'}\nThis masks works great! My hair is blonde and fine and tends to go brassy if not processed correctly. Using this mask is an easy way to freshen and brighten. Not too thick, almost whipped in texture. Totally moisturizes and rinses out without heavy residue.\nVery happy with results\nJDO Eyelash Curler and 4D Silk Fiber Lash Mascara Value Set-Lash Curler with Refill Pads for No Pinching or Pulling, Mascara Natural Thickening- Long Lasting Waterproof & Smudge-Proof\nJDO\n{'Package Dimensions': '6 x 4 x 1 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nMy 14 yo is using this set and she loves it. The mascara is a deep black and it doesn't flake off. She also has had no problems removing this product with just a wet makeup wipe.  The curler has rubber grips at the end so it is easy for her to hold and use. Very happy with this.\nHappy with this\nLaloirelle Luminous Face Oil - Organic Pomegranate Oil, Cacao Oil Infused W/Brightening White Peony Root, Marigold Flower, Lotus Leaf - Glowing Skin That Feels Hydrated, Plump and Firm - 1.0 fl oz\nLaloirelle\n{'Brand': 'Laloirelle', 'Scent': 'Pomegranate', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Fl Oz', 'Use for': 'Face', 'Package Dimensions': '5.67 x 2.36 x 2.32 inches; 4.55 Ounces'}\nThis serum is so very very good! Smells warm and woodsy in a way, not floral or soapy. Very viscous, medium-heavy. The dropper only dispenses about 4 drops, which is enough for face and neck. I use a roller after applying too, which I highly recommend. I'm happy with the glow and hydration my skin has. The longer I use it, the better my skin looks.\nExtremely happy with this\nPanama Jack Sunscreen Lip Balm - SPF 45, Tropical & Mango 6 Pack Plus, Broad Spectrum UVA-UVB Sunscreen Protection, Prevents & Soothes Dry, Chapped Lips\nPanama Jack\n{'Scent': 'Mango', 'Product Benefits': 'Soothing', 'Item Weight': '4.25 Grams', 'Number of Items': '6', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '5.08 x 4.72 x 1.34 inches; 0.15 Ounces'}\nWonderful lip balm. Creamy, not waxy and stayed put. Smells luscious and sweet. I feel like this hydrates for at least an hour too. No stinging upon application. The lids audibly \"clicks\" when closed so you know it shut. 45 spf too.\nThis stuff is your friend!\nPermanent Hair Removal for Women,Painless Hair Removal device with 500000 flashes ice function,Laser Hair Removal is used for Body Armpits Back Legs Arms Face Bikini Line (Green)\nHibeauty\n{'Brand': 'Hibeauty', 'Included Components': 'Charger', 'Item Weight': '185 Grams', 'Head Type': 'Foil', 'Package Dimensions': '7.7 x 4.6 x 3.9 inches; 6.53 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'H-003', 'UPC': '087978165764', 'Manufacturer': 'hibeauty'}\nI don't know if this is helping my hair regrowth but, I feel like it's helping my spider veins. It's easy to hold even for extended periods of time. It's not a rechargeable product. It must be plugged in while using. It is painless. I don't wear the super dark glasses. I just close my eyes. I use on underarm too. I will keep it up, I'm just sorta lazy.\nNot sure yet.\nSolpri Shield Lemongrass & Tea Tree Foot Salt Soak for Fungus Athlete's Foot Dry Cracked Feet 1 lb (16 oz)\nSolpri\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.56 x 5.67 x 2.09 inches; 1.04 Pounds', 'UPC': '850000593053'}\nGreat product. Made in USA and right upon opening, smells fresh and clean. Like lemons and sunshine. The ziplock bag seals so you can store upright maintain freshness.\nVery invigorating!\nikoo Don't Apologize Volumizing Conditioner for Fine, Thin or Flat Hair, Adds Volume, Body & Thickens, Cruelty Free, Vegan, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, Travel Size - 3.4 Fl Oz\nikoo\n[\"Effortless hair starts in your shower.

All formulas are packed with specific extracts and infusions that will get you the results you were always supposed to be born with. Big is always better, even if you're not in Texas. This formula helps to thicken hair without the need for a gym.\"]\n{'Brand': 'ikoo', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Material Feature': 'Natural, Cruelty Free, Vegan', 'Hair Type': 'Thin', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '1.5 x 1.5 x 5.2 inches; 4.37 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Ikoo'}\nSmall travel size of so-so conditioner. Smells great and feels like it rinses out completely but as for conditioning? It just sort of works. So, nothing too special but it doesn\u2019t suck.\nAverage product\nJade Roller for Face, Eye, Neck Stone Face Massager for Women Skin Care at Home Anti-Aging Gemstone Face Roller\nFANGQUN\n{}\nThis is the lightest face roller I\u2019ve used and held. It feels flimsy and like the metal holder will bend/pop out if you push the roller too hard on your face. The smaller roller is really nice to roll over eyes. Feels great! I wish everything felt weighted though. I think there are much better options out there.\nJust ok.\nMsmofei Make up Brushes 14PCs Makeup Brush Set Professional Premium Synthetic Foundation Blending Face Powder Eye Shadows Blush Makeup Brush Kit Green Comestic Brushes with Green leather Case\nMSmofei\n{'Brand': 'MSmofei', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'For Eyeshadow, Contour, For Setting Powder, For Blush, For Foundation, Eyebrow', 'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Number of Pieces': '14', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Ferrule Material': 'Copper', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '137.52 x 106.32 x 28.32 inches', 'Product Dimensions': '137.52 x 106.32 x 28.32 inches; 8.15 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'AA1', 'UPC': '608571247291'}\nI travel with these and they are pretty good.
