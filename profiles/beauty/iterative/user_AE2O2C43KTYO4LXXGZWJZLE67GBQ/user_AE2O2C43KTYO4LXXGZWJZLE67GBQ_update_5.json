There is a tab that I press in to open the case; to close the case, I press both parts of the case together.<br /><br />b) One compartment (the side with the tab) holds:<br />  --- Nail File<br />  Works well to smooth out my nails after I trimmed them.<br />  --- Fingernail Clipper<br />  The curved blades cut my nails well. The lever has square-shaped divots that give good<br />  grip. It is a bit hard to rotate the lever around the pin; but, with continued use, it should<br />  be easier to open and close the lever. There is no nail file attached to the clipper<br />  --- Nose trimmer<br />  I did not find this to be as good at cutting my nose hairs.<br />  ---.Cuticle nipper<br />  This trims my cuticles well.<br />  --- Eyebrow trimmer<br />  This does a decent job in trimming eyebrow<br />  ---  Cuspidal/Obtuse push-type broach<br />  I didn't have a need to use this; but several family members used this, and they say it<br />  does an adequate job with their nail polish routine<br />  --- Ear pick<br />  I tried it, but I didn't like the sensation of it scraping against the inside of my ear.<br /><br />c) The other compartment holds:<br />  --- Toenail clipper<br />  Curved blades cut my toenails well; however, it does not cut my big toenail because<br />  that nail has too much fungus and is too thick. I used a different toenail clipper<br />  recommended by my foot doctor.<br />  --- Oblique nail clipper<br />  I don't use this often for cutting my nail; but I like how easily it cuts the nails. Other<br />  family members love it, and are more familiar in using it<br />  --- Nail cleaning knife<br />  I don't use this; others in my family say it works well to remove the debris under their nails.<br />  --- Tweezers<br />  My family members do not like this, because it doesn't open enough for them to use; so they went<br />  back to using their preferred tweezers<br />  --- Zig Zag callus remover<br />  --- Oblique callus remover<br />  --- Flat callus remover<br />  note: so far, those of us with calluses (including me) do not have them so thick that<br />  they need removal using these instruments.<br />  --- Dead skin fork<br />  a family member used it; she says it is quite useful in removing the loose skin right<br />  around her cuticle area<br />  --- Ear pick (has something like a serrated shape, perhaps)<br />  I much prefer this ear pick; it felt more natural and is like what I used in the past.<br />  --- Acne tool (one end with a circular loop; other end with a pick)<br />  --- Acne tool (one end with a circular loop; other end with a scoop)<br />  None of our family members currently have acne, so we haven't had a chance to try it;<br />  but, we have similar instruments just like these, and those worked well when we've<br />  needed to deal with our skin issues.<br /><br />Lastly: I would have liked the case to be slightly larger, so that it is easier to remove all these instruments. When I removed all the instruments, some of which I used, others which my family members used, and then put the instruments back into the case, we couldn't get it to close. Finally, we removed the toenail clippers, and that easily closed the case.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good manicure set, with instruments that I and/or my family members find to be very useful for our particular needs.\nReview Title: Has the tools needed to handle our face/hands/feet/skin issues.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

The floss moves between my teeth in a smooth manner.<br /><br />This dental floss has no flavor.<br /><br />I used these dental floss at home, and took a bag with me to work so that I can discreetly used them after eating lunch.<br /><br />This dental floss works as intended to help me keep my teeth and gums healthy.\nDental floss moves easily between my teeth.

This salon-strength formula quickly removes nail tips as well as glue and gel nail polish in a convenient dip-it container.']\n{'Brand': 'Mountain Falls', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Item Weight': '0.5 Pounds', 'Unit Count': '9 Fl Oz', 'Package Dimensions': '3.15 x 3.07 x 2.6 inches; 8 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Vi-Jon'}\nThis product - 100% acetone nail polish remover - comes with an inner protective foil seal.<br /><br />When I twisted the lid to open it, even with the seal intact, I could feel slight amounts of nail polish remover around the neck of the bottle and also smelled the remover.<br />Upon removing the seal, there is a transparent plastic seal that also needs to be removed prior to being able to dip a finger into this container.<br /><br />Two of my family members used this product. I watched them dip their finger down into the brush area, twist the finger right and left. Then, move the finger up and down against the brush.<br />They say it's effective in removing the nail polish.\nEffective nail polish remover. Strong acetone smell, even with intact protective seal.\nPick & Pick (Gentle/metal allergy free material)\nMIND UP\n{'Package Dimensions': '7 x 1.2 x 0.5 inches; 0.63 Ounces'}\n[[VIDEOID:4ec0f08a9d346155d134f855861e62]] This tooth cleaning tool - Pick & Pick - measures about 6-1/4 inches long.<br /><br />At one end of the tool is a flexible, sharp pick, which I use to remove debris from in between my teeth.<br />At the other end of the tool is a flexible, flat-shaped pick, which I use to scrape unwanted particles and debris from between my gum lines and teeth.<br /><br />The flat end of the pick is too flexible for me to remove most of the stubborn particles in the areas between my teeth and gums. I needed to hold my fingers as close to the flat end as possible to get good leverage. Even then, I couldn't remove the debris.<br /><br />The sharp end of the pick works a bit better in removing debris from between my teeth; but for those debris that are really stuck, this pick can't get the debris out because the end keeps flexing.<br /><br />This tool doesn't do a good job of removing resistant particles/debris from my teeth.\nToo flexible to remove stubborn particles from between teeth or between teeth and gums.\nTeeth Whitening Powder Kit 2.1oz Activated Charcoal Toothpaste Powder Teeth Whitener Remove Coffee Wine Tobacco Stains Gum Health and Fresh Breath with Toothbrush & Tongue Cleaner\nBeaGirl\n{'Brand': 'BeaGirl', 'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Item Weight': '2.1 Ounces', 'Flavor': 'Mint', 'Package Dimensions': '8.98 x 6.93 x 2.24 inches; 2.1 Ounces', 'UPC': '192242892311'}\nThis Activated Charcoal Powder comes in a 2.1-oz round can.<br />A soft bristle toothbrush (with a wood handle) and a tongue scraper is also included.<br /><br />After opening the cap, there is a tear-drop shaped \"pick\" that can be used to lift up the inner lid to reveal the charcoal powder.<br /><br />This is my first time using activated charcoal as a means to whiten my teeth.<br /><br />I wet the toothbrush, dipped it into the charcoal, and started brushing my teeth in my normal manner. Bits of the powder sprayed over various areas of the bathroom sink, and as I continued to brush and spit, the sink itself was covered with a combination of water/saliva/charcoal.<br />There was a taste of the powder (a bit bitter taste) on my tongue as I brushed.<br /><br />Rinsing with water did not remove all the charcoal in my mouth; so I brushed again with toothpaste, and rinsed with more water. That did the trick.<br />It took a bit of time to clean up the mess I made.<br /><br />The next occasions that I brushed using this activated charcoal, I did not brush as vigorously, and made less of a mess, as I adjusted to how to use the product.<br /><br />In the last 3 weeks since using this, I have noticed the top part of a teeth (the top 5% of it) of the front four teeth are slightly brighter than the rest of the teeth.<br /><br />The tongue scraper is a helpful addition to my dental hygiene routine.\nSlight whitening at very tips of my teeth.
