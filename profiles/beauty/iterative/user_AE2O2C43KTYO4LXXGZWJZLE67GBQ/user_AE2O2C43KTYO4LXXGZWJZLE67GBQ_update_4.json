That did the trick.<br />It took a bit of time to clean up the mess I made.<br /><br />The next occasions that I brushed using this activated charcoal, I did not brush as vigorously, and made less of a mess, as I adjusted to how to use the product.<br /><br />In the last 3 weeks since using this, I have noticed the top part of a teeth (the top 5% of it) of the front four teeth are slightly brighter than the rest of the teeth.<br /><br />The tongue scraper is a helpful addition to my dental hygiene routine.\nReview Title: Slight whitening at very tips of my teeth.

I needed to hold my fingers as close to the flat end as possible to get good leverage. Even then, I couldn't remove the debris.<br /><br />The sharp end of the pick works a bit better in removing debris from between my teeth; but for those debris that are really stuck, this pick can't get the debris out because the end keeps flexing.<br /><br />This tool doesn't do a good job of removing resistant particles/debris from my teeth.\nToo flexible to remove stubborn particles from between teeth or between teeth and gums.\nTeeth Whitening Powder Kit 2.1oz Activated Charcoal Toothpaste Powder Teeth Whitener Remove Coffee Wine Tobacco Stains Gum Health and Fresh Breath with Toothbrush & Tongue Cleaner\nBeaGirl\n{'Brand': 'BeaGirl', 'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Item Weight': '2.1 Ounces', 'Flavor': 'Mint', 'Package Dimensions': '8.98 x 6.93 x 2.24 inches; 2.1 Ounces', 'UPC': '192242892311'}\nThis Activated Charcoal Powder comes in a 2.1-oz round can.<br />A soft bristle toothbrush (with a wood handle) and a tongue scraper is also included.<br /><br />After opening the cap, there is a tear-drop shaped \"pick\" that can be used to lift up the inner lid to reveal the charcoal powder.<br /><br />This is my first time using activated charcoal as a means to whiten my teeth.<br /><br />I wet the toothbrush, dipped it into the charcoal, and started brushing my teeth in my normal manner.
