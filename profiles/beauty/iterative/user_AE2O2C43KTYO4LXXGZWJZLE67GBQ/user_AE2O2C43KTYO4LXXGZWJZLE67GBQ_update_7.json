I did not find the scent to be pleasant nor unpleasant. When I am done showering, the scent disappears from my body soon after.<br /><br />The soap bar does not have a smooth appearance; I can see various swirls and indentations through the surfaces of the soap. The bar is slippery to hold when wet.<br />The soap gives a generous, rich lather.<br /><br />Although charcoal is one of the ingredients, this soap did not feel harsh on my skin. I've used other soaps with ingredients (sea salt granules, for instance) that I could feel on my skin as I was using the soap and exfoliated better than this soap. But, I do like how fresh and clean my body feels after using this soap.<br /><br />I did not notice my skin being significantly better moisturized after using this bar of soap for the past 3 weeks versus how my skin felt before using the soap.<br /><br />While the box shows stains from the soap (see pic I took), it does not leave stains on the shower stall once I was done rinsing off.<br /><br />Lastly, expiration date can be found on the side of the box. Mine expires 01/2023.\nReview Title: Generous, rich lather; skin feels fresh and clean after use\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

This salon-strength formula quickly removes nail tips as well as glue and gel nail polish in a convenient dip-it container.']\n{'Brand': 'Mountain Falls', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Item Weight': '0.5 Pounds', 'Unit Count': '9 Fl Oz', 'Package Dimensions': '3.15 x 3.07 x 2.6 inches; 8 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Vi-Jon'}\nThis product - 100% acetone nail polish remover - comes with an inner protective foil seal.<br /><br />When I twisted the lid to open it, even with the seal intact, I could feel slight amounts of nail polish remover around the neck of the bottle and also smelled the remover.<br />Upon removing the seal, there is a transparent plastic seal that also needs to be removed prior to being able to dip a finger into this container.<br /><br />Two of my family members used this product. I watched them dip their finger down into the brush area, twist the finger right and left. Then, move the finger up and down against the brush.<br />They say it's effective in removing the nail polish.\nEffective nail polish remover. Strong acetone smell, even with intact protective seal.\nPick & Pick (Gentle/metal allergy free material)\nMIND UP\n{'Package Dimensions': '7 x 1.2 x 0.5 inches; 0.63 Ounces'}\n[[VIDEOID:4ec0f08a9d346155d134f855861e62]] This tooth cleaning tool - Pick & Pick - measures about 6-1/4 inches long.<br /><br />At one end of the tool is a flexible, sharp pick, which I use to remove debris from in between my teeth.<br />At the other end of the tool is a flexible, flat-shaped pick, which I use to scrape unwanted particles and debris from between my gum lines and teeth.<br /><br />The flat end of the pick is too flexible for me to remove most of the stubborn particles in the areas between my teeth and gums. I needed to hold my fingers as close to the flat end as possible to get good leverage. Even then, I couldn't remove the debris.<br /><br />The sharp end of the pick works a bit better in removing debris from between my teeth; but for those debris that are really stuck, this pick can't get the debris out because the end keeps flexing.<br /><br />This tool doesn't do a good job of removing resistant particles/debris from my teeth.\nToo flexible to remove stubborn particles from between teeth or between teeth and gums.\nTeeth Whitening Powder Kit 2.1oz Activated Charcoal Toothpaste Powder Teeth Whitener Remove Coffee Wine Tobacco Stains Gum Health and Fresh Breath with Toothbrush & Tongue Cleaner\nBeaGirl\n{'Brand': 'BeaGirl', 'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Item Weight': '2.1 Ounces', 'Flavor': 'Mint', 'Package Dimensions': '8.98 x 6.93 x 2.24 inches; 2.1 Ounces', 'UPC': '192242892311'}\nThis Activated Charcoal Powder comes in a 2.1-oz round can.<br />A soft bristle toothbrush (with a wood handle) and a tongue scraper is also included.<br /><br />After opening the cap, there is a tear-drop shaped \"pick\" that can be used to lift up the inner lid to reveal the charcoal powder.<br /><br />This is my first time using activated charcoal as a means to whiten my teeth.<br /><br />I wet the toothbrush, dipped it into the charcoal, and started brushing my teeth in my normal manner. Bits of the powder sprayed over various areas of the bathroom sink, and as I continued to brush and spit, the sink itself was covered with a combination of water/saliva/charcoal.<br />There was a taste of the powder (a bit bitter taste) on my tongue as I brushed.<br /><br />Rinsing with water did not remove all the charcoal in my mouth; so I brushed again with toothpaste, and rinsed with more water. That did the trick.<br />It took a bit of time to clean up the mess I made.<br /><br />The next occasions that I brushed using this activated charcoal, I did not brush as vigorously, and made less of a mess, as I adjusted to how to use the product.<br /><br />In the last 3 weeks since using this, I have noticed the top part of a teeth (the top 5% of it) of the front four teeth are slightly brighter than the rest of the teeth.<br /><br />The tongue scraper is a helpful addition to my dental hygiene routine.\nSlight whitening at very tips of my teeth. A bit messy to use.\nNail Clipper Set, GIDIBII Luxury 18 in 1 Stainless Steel Nail Clipper Kit, Manicure Pedicure Care Tools with Portable Travel Case\nGIDIBII\n{'Brand': 'GIDIBII', 'Blade Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '5.8 x 3.8 x 0.8 inches', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '5.8 x 3.8 x 0.8 inches; 11.99 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'Manicure Set', 'UPC': '799445199218', 'Manufacturer': 'GIDIBII'}\nShort summary: I like a number of the instruments available in this set; they work well for my needs, and for the needs of our family members.<br />The case securely holds each instrument in its slot; but some instruments are tough to remove from their slots.<br /><br />More details:<br /><br />a) Case is soft to the touch and comfortable to hold. There is a tab that I press in to open the case; to close the case, I press both parts of the case together.<br /><br />b) One compartment (the side with the tab) holds:<br />  --- Nail File<br />  Works well to smooth out my nails after I trimmed them.<br />  --- Fingernail Clipper<br />  The curved blades cut my nails well. The lever has square-shaped divots that give good<br />  grip. It is a bit hard to rotate the lever around the pin; but, with continued use, it should<br />  be easier to open and close the lever. There is no nail file attached to the clipper<br />  --- Nose trimmer<br />  I did not find this to be as good at cutting my nose hairs.<br />  ---.Cuticle nipper<br />  This trims my cuticles well.<br />  --- Eyebrow trimmer<br />  This does a decent job in trimming eyebrow<br />  ---  Cuspidal/Obtuse push-type broach<br />  I didn't have a need to use this; but several family members used this, and they say it<br />  does an adequate job with their nail polish routine<br />  --- Ear pick<br />  I tried it, but I didn't like the sensation of it scraping against the inside of my ear.<br /><br />c) The other compartment holds:<br />  --- Toenail clipper<br />  Curved blades cut my toenails well; however, it does not cut my big toenail because<br />  that nail has too much fungus and is too thick. I used a different toenail clipper<br />  recommended by my foot doctor.<br />  --- Oblique nail clipper<br />  I don't use this often for cutting my nail; but I like how easily it cuts the nails. Other<br />  family members love it, and are more familiar in using it<br />  --- Nail cleaning knife<br />  I don't use this; others in my family say it works well to remove the debris under their nails.<br />  --- Tweezers<br />  My family members do not like this, because it doesn't open enough for them to use; so they went<br />  back to using their preferred tweezers<br />  --- Zig Zag callus remover<br />  --- Oblique callus remover<br />  --- Flat callus remover<br />  note: so far, those of us with calluses (including me) do not have them so thick that<br />  they need removal using these instruments.<br />  --- Dead skin fork<br />  a family member used it; she says it is quite useful in removing the loose skin right<br />  around her cuticle area<br />  --- Ear pick (has something like a serrated shape, perhaps)<br />  I much prefer this ear pick; it felt more natural and is like what I used in the past.<br />  --- Acne tool (one end with a circular loop; other end with a pick)<br />  --- Acne tool (one end with a circular loop; other end with a scoop)<br />  None of our family members currently have acne, so we haven't had a chance to try it;<br />  but, we have similar instruments just like these, and those worked well when we've<br />  needed to deal with our skin issues.<br /><br />Lastly: I would have liked the case to be slightly larger, so that it is easier to remove all these instruments. When I removed all the instruments, some of which I used, others which my family members used, and then put the instruments back into the case, we couldn't get it to close. Finally, we removed the toenail clippers, and that easily closed the case.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good manicure set, with instruments that I and/or my family members find to be very useful for our particular needs.\nHas the tools needed to handle our face/hands/feet/skin issues.\nDisposable Hair Cutting/Barber Capes for Home Haircutting Kit Men,Mercijzyasang Waterproof Disposable Shampoo/Hair Capes/Cover for Salon Barber Supplies Kits (50PCS)\nMercijzyasang\n{'Package Dimensions': '13.7 x 11.93 x 2.05 inches; 2.05 Pounds'}\nThese 50 disposable capes (for hair cutting, hair styling, etc) come neatly folded in one package. All 50 capes were placed on top of each other. Then, it was folded lengthwise in half, then folded multiple times so that the resulting product fit neatly inside a rectangular-shaped plastic bag.<br /><br />To get 1 cape, I unfold the entire 50 capes, get one cape, and fold the rest of the capes back in their original form. Once I got a cape, then re-folded the rest of the capes, I could not get it to fit back into the plastic bag. So, we put the capes in a grocery bag.<br /><br />A cape measures 59 inches in length x 50-1/4 inches in width.<br /><br />I smelled no odors emanating from these capes.<br /><br />These capes are thin, fragile, see-through, and when a family member tied the top part of the cape around my neck (much like how a barber would do at the barber shop), the plastic \"string\" broke. So, with the next cape, he was more cautious in tying the string. We are able to carefully tie the string tightly around the neck, and then use clips to tie other parts of the cape around the back of my neck and shoulders. This way, I could get a hair cut, and not have hair falling down on my neck/shoulders/clothes.<br /><br />These capes work best when I sit in a chair, have it on me and tied around my neck, then get a haircut. If I have the cape on, and the phone rings, and I need to get up from the chair and go to another room to answer the phone, the cape floats around randomly as I am moving. The cape gets tangled and wrinkled unto itself.<br /><br />Overall, these are functional capes to use for when we get hair cuts at home.\nPlastic cape that is fragile, thin, see-through.\nHeyedrate Activated Charcoal Soap Bar and Face Wash | Organic, Vegan, Natural Soap made with Dead Sea Mud and Our Essential Oil Blend (1 Pack (5 Ounces))\nEye Love\n{'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Brand': 'Eye Love', 'Scent': 'Eucalyptus, Coconut, Grapefruit, Rosemary', 'Material Feature': 'Organic, Natural, Vegan', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '4 x 1 x 1 inches; 4.97 Ounces', 'UPC': '850436007827'}\nThis activated charcoal soap bar comes in a product box that has a tamper-evident seal on the top and bottom part of the opening.<br /><br />The soap has a mild scent, and while I don't know how to describe the scent, the product description says the scent consists of Eucalyptus, Coconut, Grapefruit, Rosemary.
