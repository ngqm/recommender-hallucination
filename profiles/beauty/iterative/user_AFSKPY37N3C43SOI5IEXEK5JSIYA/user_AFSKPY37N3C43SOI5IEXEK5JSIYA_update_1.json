Clinically proven to reduce stains.']\nAverage Rating: 3.4\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Panasonic', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Special Feature': 'Brushing Timer', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric, Battery Powered', 'Item Firmness Description': 'Soft', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.2 x 1 x 8.3 inches; 3.2 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'EW-DL82-W', 'Batteries': '1 Lithium Ion batteries required.', 'UPC': '885170124196', 'Manufacturer': 'Panasonic - Beauty'}\nReview Text: I don't see the fuss with this toothbrush. As was mentioned in other reviews, it is smaller and more lightweight than other rechargeable toothbrushes. But, beyond that, I just don't get i. I stopped using my older Phillips Sonicare to use this for the past two+ weeks. The vibrations on this brush are very small and I find myself pushing the toothbrush into my teeth and scrubbing to be sure they are getting clean. Maybe there is some secret sonic vibration thing going on, but it didn't happen for me. If I didn't actually have to still 'brush my teeth' manually with this electric toothbrush, maybe it would be fine. However, it's not the case. Without manual intervention, my teeth did not feel clean. As an fyi, I stopped using it this morning and went back to my Phillips.\nReview Title: I just don't get it\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
