I have been 'using' this for almost three weeks and I am not happy with it. First, it's almost impossible for me to keep it in place under my eyes. They come wet out of the packet and I was unsure what side was supposed to be placed on my skin. They do not stay in place and I found them falling off easily. Of course, maybe it was me or my skin, so please don't just rely on my review (read others). I will not be reordering.\nReview Title: Didn't do much and difficult to place and maintain on your face\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Panasonic EW-DL82 Sonic Vibration Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush, White\nPanasonic\n['Sonic vibration rechargeable toothbrush. Clinically proven to reduce stains.']\n{'Brand': 'Panasonic', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Special Feature': 'Brushing Timer', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric, Battery Powered', 'Item Firmness Description': 'Soft', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.2 x 1 x 8.3 inches; 3.2 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'EW-DL82-W', 'Batteries': '1 Lithium Ion batteries required.', 'UPC': '885170124196', 'Manufacturer': 'Panasonic - Beauty'}\nI don't see the fuss with this toothbrush. As was mentioned in other reviews, it is smaller and more lightweight than other rechargeable toothbrushes. But, beyond that, I just don't get i. I stopped using my older Phillips Sonicare to use this for the past two+ weeks. The vibrations on this brush are very small and I find myself pushing the toothbrush into my teeth and scrubbing to be sure they are getting clean. Maybe there is some secret sonic vibration thing going on, but it didn't happen for me. If I didn't actually have to still 'brush my teeth' manually with this electric toothbrush, maybe it would be fine. However, it's not the case. Without manual intervention, my teeth did not feel clean. As an fyi, I stopped using it this morning and went back to my Phillips.\nI just don't get it\nPhilips Sonicare Essence+ Gum Health & Airfloss Rechargeable Electric Flosser, Bundle Value Pack, HX8218/02\nPhilips Sonicare\n['Improve your oral health with the new Philips Sonicare Essence+ Gum Health & Airfloss Rechargeable Electric Flosser Value Bundle. This value bundle features a rechargeable toothbrush with unique and effective Sonicare technology. The Essence+ Gum Health toothbrush reduces the amount of plaque at the gum line versus a manual toothbrush, and is designed to help prevent gingivitis and gently lifts away stains for naturally whiter teeth. Included in your value pack is the Philips Sonicare Airfloss Rechargeable Electric Flosser, which offers an easy, fast routine to help prevent cavities and improve long term gum health in between teeth.

It is most ideal for inconsistent flossers;Voltage: Multi-voltage charge. Comfortable ergonomic handle. Designed to be easy to maneuver in tight spaces, AirFloss has a comfortable ergonomic handle and a non-slip grip.']\n{'Brand': 'Philips Sonicare', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Special Feature': 'Portable, Timer', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Color': 'Green, Dark Blue', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2.68 x 6.85 x 8.69 inches; 1.2 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'HX8218/02', 'Batteries': '1 Lithium Ion batteries required. (included)', 'UPC': '075020064738', 'Manufacturer': 'Philips Oral Healthcare'}\nI love this combo package, particularly the flosser. This makes a great gift package for someone you love, giving them everything they need to keep their mouth/gum health optimal. I have had issues (particularly gums) for the past 5 years. No ones fault but my own for not taking care of my mouth the way I should have all these years. This flosser is great. I fill it with Act Restoring mouthwash and use it after brushing. It amazes me how much stuff this flosser removes with a simple puff of air. Of course, you can purchase both these items separately, but you save in getting them together. Sonicare  makes the best tooth/gum care products on the market bar none!\nGreat combo pack. Wish I had been using this years ago!\nManicure and Pedicure Nail Clipper from POWERGROOMING - Powerful Trimmer for Thick and Thin Finger Nails and Toe Nails - Included Nail File and\"Catcher\" for Easy Cleanup (1 Pack)\nPOWERGROOMING\n{'Brand': 'POWERGROOMING', 'Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Blade Edge': 'Straight', 'Blade Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Target Audience': 'Women, Men', 'Package Dimensions': '3.8 x 1.3 x 1 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'UPC': '653233212735', 'Manufacturer': 'POWERGROOMING'}\nThis a really cute kit which would make for a great gift for someone. It is in a little leather like pouch and has everything you need to give yourself a quality manicure. The nail clipper is a perfect size and works just as well on a women or man's nails. The file is nice as well (although I still prefer to use emory boards on mine). I actually bought another one of these to give to my son as a stocking stuffer this last Christmas for him to use at college. Just a nice, quality made kit at a reasonable price.\nNice manicure set for men or women\nSpa Grade Jade Roller for Face with Gua Sha | Jade Face Roller Massager | Jade Facial Roller | Face Roller Massager | Jade Rollers | Wrinkle Roller\nJane Cosmetics\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.1 x 3.4 x 1.2 inches; 4.8 Ounces', 'UPC': '814689026516', 'Manufacturer': 'Jane & Co.'}\nAt first when I saw this, I wasn't sure what this. I looked at the reviews (which were mostly positive) and thought I would give it a try. My skepticism was quickly diminished after trying this for just a few days. I typically shower every morning and I have Vitamin C and Retinol that I apply to my face. So, when I got this I put it in the freezer and followed the instructions. So, instead of just applying the serums to my face, I started using this roller along with the serums. After less than a week I noticed much less puffiness around my eyes (and I am prone to that area to have bags and puffiness). I also noticed my skin looking noticeably better overall. I think applying this roller to my skin allows the pores to absorb the serums faster and deeper. I will continue to use this going forward. I am really impressed with the results!\nThis really works!\nIryasa Night Indulge Cream - Natural Face Cream for Dry Skin - Vegan Anti Aging Night Cream for Women - Firming Cream for Face and Neck - Organic Vitamin C Moisturizer for Face - 1.7oz\nIRYASA\n{'Brand': 'IRYASA', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '1.7 Ounce', 'Use for': 'Face', 'Skin Type': 'Mature', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2.76 x 2.76 x 2.2 inches; 1.76 Ounces'}\nTo be honest, I rarely have used an overnight cream. Typically, my skin care routine is the same morning and night (wash, apply hyalauronic serum, and some kind of moistutrizer). So, when I saw this Iryasa cream I wanted to try it. Easy to apply, you can immediately feel the moisture starting to work. I do apply this about 30 minutes before I actually go to sleep to allow it time to be absorbed (before putting my face on my pillow) as it is a thicker type of cream and needs time. My skin in the morning feels better than ever. Soft and supple, I definitely feel a difference after using this for over 2 weeks now. I highly recommend this cream for women and men.\nWonderful overnight cream!\nOrganic Bamboo Cotton Ear Swabs by Bali Boo - 200 - Natural Wooden Qtips Cotton Swabs for Cleaning Ears, Baby or Makeup and Nails - Sustainable & Vegan Buds Sticks - Eco Friendly & Biodegradable\nBali Boo\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '3.8 x 3.3 x 2.1 inches; 2.4 Ounces'}\nI really like these ear swabs. First they come in a large, handy box and are easy to store (will last a long time). Second, they are all organic and good for the environment. Third, they are strong and don't fall apart very easily. I highly recommend these over Q-Tips (which I have used for years).\nGreat all natural ear swabs!\nBellezza Versa Styler 1 Inch Titanium Plates Flat Iron Twisted Hair Straighteners (Blush Pink)\nBellezza\n['Bellezza Versa Styler 1 Inch Titanium Plates Flat Iron Twisted Hair Straighteners (Blush Pink)']\n{'Shape': 'Flat', 'Brand': 'Bellezza', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Material': 'Titanium', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '12.64 x 3.66 x 3.46 inches; 1.52 Pounds', 'Manufacturer': 'Cortex USA INC.'}\nThis is a great hair straightener. Heats up quickly and evenly, makes it easy to take the curl out of my naturally wavy hair. It fits easily in my hand and maneuvers around the front and back of my head easily. Does not heat up my countertop (keeps the heat on the iron). I love this pink, too, it matches my decor perfectly. I highly recommend this Bellezza styler.\nQuality hair iron, works perfectly to straighten my hair!\n24K Gold Under Eye Mask\u2013 20 Pairs- Under Eye Patches with Face Massager Roller, Anti-Aging Hyaluronic Acid Collagen Eye Masks for Dark Circles and Puffiness Dark Under Eyes Treatment\nFRLEDM\n{'Brand': 'FRLEDM', 'Special Feature': 'Anti Aging', 'Unit Count': '21.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '40', 'Package Dimensions': '7.5 x 7 x 1.5 inches; 11.99 Ounces', 'Batteries': '1 AA batteries required.
