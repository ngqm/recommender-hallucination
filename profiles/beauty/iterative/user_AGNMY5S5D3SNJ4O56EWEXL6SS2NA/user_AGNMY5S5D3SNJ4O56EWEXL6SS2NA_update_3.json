The scent isn't bad, and it's overall decent, but it's far too expensive for the size.\nTiny bottles, good product...\nX5 Superlite Advanced Ionic Cushion Hairbrush - Frizz-free Styler & Detangler for Wet or Dry Hair - Silver Black\nX5 Superlite\n{'Brand': 'X5 Superlite', 'Color': 'Black,Silver', 'Shape': 'Oval', 'Special Feature': 'Vented, Ionic, Non Slip', 'Product Benefits': 'Smoothing', 'Product Dimensions': '3 x 1 x 10 inches; 4.66 Ounces', 'UPC': '705320126538'}\nSo I'm used to hairbrushes being heavy and making brushing my long hair even more of a chore than it already is to get all the tangles out, but this brush is extremely light and it doesn't compromise on quality to get that light... I'm thoroughly impressed at how well this brush performs with my mess of hair. ^.^\nWell that's a light hairbrush!\n24 Inches Synthetic Long Curly Blonde Wig Natural Wavy Hair NONE Lace Heat Resistant Wigs for Women Cosplay Costume\nAILIWEI\n{'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '6.69 x 3.94 x 1.97 inches', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy, Curly', 'Special Feature': 'Heat Resistant', 'Brand': 'AILIWEI', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '6.69 x 3.94 x 1.97 inches; 9.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '710731915817'}\nSo for me this wig looks different than the photos but it's okay enough for me.
