  "reference_summary": "Taya Beauty Buriti Nut Intensive Repair Shampoo & Conditioner Duo \u2013 Organic Hydrating Shampoo and Conditioner for Dry Damaged Hair - Restorative Hair Care \u2013 Travel Size 2 fl oz\nTAYA I AM.\n{'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Brand': 'TAYA I AM.', 'Hair Type': 'All, Dull, Color Treated, Dry, Chemically Treated, Damaged', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Package Dimensions': '5.25 x 3.5 x 1.1 inches; 2 Ounces', 'UPC': '858308002635'}\nFor the price of shampoo and conditioner, I buy all natural and still get bottles easily 10-20x the size of these, this would be a good travel kit, but it's not worth the money... The scent isn't bad, and it's overall decent, but it's far too expensive for the size.\nTiny bottles, good product...\nX5 Superlite Advanced Ionic Cushion Hairbrush - Frizz-free Styler & Detangler for Wet or Dry Hair - Silver Black\nX5 Superlite\n{'Brand': 'X5 Superlite', 'Color': 'Black,Silver', 'Shape': 'Oval', 'Special Feature': 'Vented, Ionic, Non Slip', 'Product Benefits': 'Smoothing', 'Product Dimensions': '3 x 1 x 10 inches; 4.66 Ounces', 'UPC': '705320126538'}\nSo I'm used to hairbrushes being heavy and making brushing my long hair even more of a chore than it already is to get all the tangles out, but this brush is extremely light and it doesn't compromise on quality to get that light... I'm thoroughly impressed at how well this brush performs with my mess of hair. ^.^\nWell that's a light hairbrush!\n24 Inches Synthetic Long Curly Blonde Wig Natural Wavy Hair NONE Lace Heat Resistant Wigs for Women Cosplay Costume\nAILIWEI\n{'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '6.69 x 3.94 x 1.97 inches', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy, Curly', 'Special Feature': 'Heat Resistant', 'Brand': 'AILIWEI', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '6.69 x 3.94 x 1.97 inches; 9.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '710731915817'}\nSo for me this wig looks different than the photos but it's okay enough for me. I'm not picky but it's not a 5 star item because of the differences between the photos and the item. though for the price it does look great and realistic.\nHmmm....\nMakeup Headband 4 Pack Bow Hair Band Women Cat Ears Facial Spa Headband Soft Carol Fleece Hair Stuff Hairlace Party Favors Skincare Headbands for Girls Washing Face Shower Mask (Blue,Purple,Pink,Gray)\nYanJie\n{'Color': 'Blue,Gray,Pink,Purple', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Occasion': 'Party', 'Material': 'Microfiber', 'Fabric Type': 'Microfiber,Fleece', 'Package Dimensions': '11.73 x 7.8 x 2.68 inches; 9.14 Ounces', 'UPC': '751300682587'}\nI specifically use these to keep hair off my face when washing, and it works very well for that... makes it much easier to wash up! quality seems to be good too, I have no complaints.\nSo...\nTCM Mancode 101 Men's Hair Conditioner 16oz\nTCM\n{'Brand': 'TCM', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Material Feature': 'Cruelty Free', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'UPC': '851058008421'}\nI am unimpressed. It doesn't do the job for my long hair, I assume it's better catered to the man with short hair... which I am not. but through my testing it doesn't work well... which warrants a lower score >.> Overall I like the scent and the pump bottle, but it doesn't seem up to the task of the long hair... which is upsetting.\nAs a man with long hair...\nYinMer Lavish Lash \u2013 Eyelash Growth Enhancer & Brow Serum with Biotin & Natural Growth Peptides for Long, Thick Lashes and Eyebrows\nOUZIFISH\n{'Package Dimensions': '6.61 x 2.8 x 1.26 inches; 3.53 Ounces'}\nI don't know if this made a difference or not... I really don't think it did. It comes packaged pretty and promises good results, but I didn't seem to notice any in the time I've been using it. Your mileage may vary though, I assume it works different depending on how your eyelashes already are...\nHere's the thing... does it actually work?\n5PCS Spiral Hair Ties, Hair Coils, Power Coil Hair Ties, No Crease Hair Ties, Phone Cord Hair Ties, Extra Strong Elastic Grip Elastic Coil Hair Ties for Women Girls\nUDIKEFO\n{'Material': 'Plastic, Thermoplastic Polyurethane', 'Item Form': 'Spiral', 'Brand': 'UDIKEFO', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '1.57 x 1.18 x 1.18 inches', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Product Dimensions': '1.57 x 1.18 x 1.18 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '783710515780'}\nI'm a woodworker with long hair, so I have to tie my hair back in the wood shop, and these are perfect for it, they don't slip around, they're plastic so if they get dirty I can rinse them off, and overall I'm really happy with them.\nI like them",
