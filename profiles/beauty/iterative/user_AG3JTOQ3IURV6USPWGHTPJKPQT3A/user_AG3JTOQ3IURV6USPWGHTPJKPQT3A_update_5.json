  "reference_summary": "Zen Rituals Pure Minerals Sea Bath Salts Set for Relaxation with Premium Essential Oils Aromatherapy Lavender, Tea Tree and Epsom Eucalyptus, Bundle Pack of 3 Bottles\nZen Rituals\n{'Brand': 'Zen Rituals', 'Scent': 'Lavender, Tea Tree', 'Product Benefits': 'Relaxation,Aromatherapy', 'Unit Count': '105.6 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '3', 'Product Dimensions': '6.79 x 8.98 x 2.99 inches; 7.12 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'SEASETLAVTEATREAEUCALYPT', 'UPC': '791109148211', 'Manufacturer': 'Zen Rituals Product'}\nI wish all bath salts were like these. They dissolve fast and have a great aromatherapy effect in a hot tub. Plus they actually feel beneficial on my skin. Love them! I want more!\nRecieved as a gift, but LOVE the bath salts\nButterfly Nail Art Decals Water Transfer Stickers, 22 Sheets Butterfly Nail Sticker DIY Nail Decals, 2 Set Butterfly Nail Glitter Holographic Stickers Reflected Butterfly Designs for Nails Supply\nB bangcool\n{'Surface Recommendation nail': '', '': 'Unit Count 1.00 Count', 'Shape Irregular': '', 'Brand': 'B bangcool', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '6.3 x 3.54 x 1.57 inches', 'Theme': 'Butterfly', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Reusability': 'Single Use', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Pattern': 'Insects', 'Product Dimensions': '6.3 x 3.54 x 1.57 inches; 5.61 Ounces'}\nThis set is just mammoth...haha Perfect for anyone who is really into butterflies. And the sticky glue on the back of the butterflies is good enough that they can be used on more then just finger/toe nails, like cell phones, school books, lunch boxes, and places you might rather they didn't start showing up.<br /><br />The collection is widely varied with silver, gold, multi colored, and different sizes and shapes, they are all relatively small to tiny, and there are no tweezers included, not that most folks don't have plenty of pairs lying around...<br /><br />The butterfly stick on nail art is an excellent value and an easy 5 stars.\nA Flutter of Butterflies\nUV LED Nail Lamp \u2013 128W Rapid-Curing Gel Nails Dryer for Manicures and Pedicures \u2013 Dual-Voltage with Extra-Long Cable, Multi-Language Manual \u2013 Professional Gel Lamp for Homes or Salons by OVLUX, Gold\nOVLUX\n{'Brand': 'OVLUX', 'Special Feature': 'Energy Efficient', 'Light Source Type': 'LED', 'Material': 'Gel', 'Connectivity Technology': 'USB', 'Package Dimensions': '9.4 x 8.3 x 4.3 inches; 1.55 Pounds', 'UPC': '765453999881'}\nWhat I like best is this is very easy to setup and use. The timer buttons turn it on and start the timer, press again and time is extended. The buttons are easy to press as well so I was able to get at them with wet nails. One thing that surprised me was the top and bottom come apart and are only lightly held together with magnets. I do wish they stayed together a little tighter, but they snap together easily so in the end its no big deal...I guess. This is my first at home nail dryer and I would say this drys about as fast as dryers at good nail salons, and  its small enough that it stores in a drawer easily.\nsuper easy to use\nVertra Black Lava Body Scrub - Exfoliating & detoxing body scrub with volcanic ash and charcoal, 3.4 Oz, purifying & softening with coconut and avocado oil\nVertra\n{'Brand': 'Vertra', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Product Benefits': 'Softening,Detox,Exfoliating', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Material Type Free': 'Paraben Free', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2.88 x 2.88 x 1.75 inches; 3.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '889297004621'}\nThis isn't that scrub that you use every single day, its more for those occasional deep cleanings, and exfoliating. Or just for a good at home spa treatment. The size of the jar, and the amount of product is fairly small but it doesn't take much to get a good facial cleansing.  To me, it smells very much like a Pina Coloda, but not over powering just a nice fresh scent.<br /><br />The scrub itself is has a medium sized grit, and its feels fairly \"sharp\" against the skin.  Also, this isn't great for rubbing on and then taking a long soak in a tub, it turns the water black. I was worried it would stain my towels, the floor, tub something, but it didn't.<br /><br />This scrub is fairly specialized and is one of those love it or hate it things. I gave it 5 stars because the quality is excellent, the ingredients are top notch, and it has a pleasant smell. But it has to be tried before you'll know if its right for you.\nPina Colada-ish smell, Very Gritty, Good Scrub\nHandmade Natural Sandalwood Hair Comb Anti-static Natural Logs Sandalwood Comb Protect Hair Untie Knotted Hair Vintage Design Comb (B)\nJAVENPROLIU\n['Natural anti-static sandalwood comb can promote blood circulation on the head and prevent hair from drying out and breaking.
