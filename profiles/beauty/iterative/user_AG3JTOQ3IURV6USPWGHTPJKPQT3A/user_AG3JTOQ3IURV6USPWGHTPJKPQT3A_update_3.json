The timer buttons turn it on and start the timer, press again and time is extended. The buttons are easy to press as well so I was able to get at them with wet nails. One thing that surprised me was the top and bottom come apart and are only lightly held together with magnets. I do wish they stayed together a little tighter, but they snap together easily so in the end its no big deal...I guess. This is my first at home nail dryer and I would say this drys about as fast as dryers at good nail salons, and  its small enough that it stores in a drawer easily.\nReview Title: super easy to use\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
