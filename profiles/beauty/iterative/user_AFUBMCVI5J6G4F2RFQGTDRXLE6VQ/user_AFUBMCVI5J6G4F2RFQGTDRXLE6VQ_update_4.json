I bought the two paid sandwich style. I tried the videos, and the hacks that say cut them ...I tried applying with special lash tweezers... Nothing works to get them close to the lash lid. The magnetic is strong so I'm sure it won't fall off, but it's so strong that when you start to move the under lash toward your eye with the upper lash laying on top of your lashes, the magnetic pulls and moves is soil quickly that it always ends up locked half way through your natural lashes. And I'm a contact wearer...so it's not like I have  fear of putting stuff near my eyes. These probably will work well with lash liners. The lashes themselves look nicely constructed. It's just the application as intended is impossible.\nReview Title: The lashes look beautiful but you'll never get them on\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
