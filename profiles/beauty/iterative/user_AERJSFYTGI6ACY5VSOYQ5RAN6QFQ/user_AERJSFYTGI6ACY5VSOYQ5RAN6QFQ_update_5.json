When it comes to the gels alone: they have a very nice smooth texture that is easy to manipulate and use.  They fill the dual forms nicely, but also are able to move and smooth well enough to use the nail extension wraps instead.  The have enough give in them to allow for some self leveling, and dry easily in about 60-90 seconds a side (I always dry under LED on the top then flip the finger and get the underside of the extension just to make sure it solidifies perfectly).  Once dry, they are able to very nicely file down and smooth in place, which is great considering some are truly jam backed with various sized glitters.  They need a good wipe down with alcohol after cooking though, having a fair amount of tacky surface, but that's fine with me.<br /><br />The cremes are fairly solid in color, and opaque.  I love the various pinks, and the white is a nice solid color that isn't too harsh making it perfect for a nice soft french tip.  The #03 pink is a great neutral and classic pink color, which is great for either a base color for extensions or for turning into a french tip with the white.<br /><br />As for the glitters, they are nice and shiny.  My only complaint is I wish the matrixes had a touch more color added to them.  The various colors of glitters make it clear what the effect/color  should be, I just think they would pack a bit more punch if there was a bit more dye in the matrix.<br /><br />Overall, this is a nice set.  Keep in mind, all the bottles are small except for the #3 pink.  But its a nice little starter kit, and the glitter is a nice addition.  I'll definitely keep these in mind going forwards!\nReview Title: Easy to use, gorgeous colors\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

This offers people the opportunity to play with both gel and polygel, while coming with a small light.  Being honest - when I first started working with gel I wasn't sure if I liked it or not, so a kit like this would have been super helpful.<br /><br />The gels themselves have nice self leveling.  The colors are nicely pigmented two coaters.  They are fairly tacky, so make sure you put on a top coat (which I always recommend) or be prepared to wipe down with alcohol.  They do take a bit longer to set, but they do set nicely.<br /><br />The sequins are a nice touch, and the top coat and base coats are very close quality to others I have (similar to Beetles).  The top coat isn't quite a no wipe, but it shines up beautifully with a little bit of alcohol.<br /><br />The tools are perfect, and the polygel colors are beautiful.  They set nicely, and file perfectly.  The duoforms are in lots of good sizes, so I don't have any issues finding the perfect sizes (my hands are weird, each finger has different size which is annoying to need 10 different sizes, but hey.<br /><br />I don't quite understand why there's the nail foils since there's no glue for the foils.  The top coat isn't quite tacky enough for foils.  The striping tape is a very nice touch.<br /><br />The light works fairly well.  The onyl problem is its a one button, so its only 45 seconds or 60 seconds.  I have a lot of other lights, so while I was happy to try this one out, and it'll be great for travel, I like my bigger lights for other  daily use.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great little kit for trying out gels and polygels.  I would advise that you pick up more files and a bigger light in the future with more settings and timers, but overall, this is great for getting started.  The travel case fits everything nicely, and makes it convenient to take on vacation.  The gels also last about 2 weeks which is a huuuuuge plus.\nGreat Little Starter Kit\nPoly Nail Gel Kit, 7 Colors Nail Extension Gel with UV Lamp, Poly Extension Decoration Kit, Base Top Coat Set with Rhinestone, Nail Molds, Nail Art Gel Kits for Home DIY Manicure, Blue Nude Series\nAIFAIFA\n{'Color': 'Blue', 'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'AIFAIFA', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Product Dimensions': '5.9 x 5.9 x 5.9 inches; 1.48 Pounds'}\nTo start with: this is an actual great little starter kit.

On one hand, they are very cost effective, and you get four rhinestone pickers instead of one which is a huge plus.<br /><br />However, I find I go through the soft end of the rhinestone picker faster than I do other units.  For instance, I have one rhinestone picker from UberChic beauty which I have had for over 6 months, and it still maintains its original shape and is only showing slight dulling at the tip.  However, these units are very soft on the white end, and have actually chipped/worn away quickly.  In a month and a half I have already used up one and the majority of a second.<br /><br />They do a good job at what they are meant for, and I have not had any issues at all with picking up rhinestones.  However, the white end is just too soft, and considering tips have broken off/worn away so quickly I have to give this 3/5.\nTips are very weak\nlorelo 20 pieces Hair Curlers, Hair Rollers Spiral Curls Styling Kit No Heat Hair Curlers with Styling Hooks for Girls Woman\nlorelo\n{'Number of Items': '20', 'Material': 'Silicone', 'Brand': 'Lorelo', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '10.59 x 9.02 x 2.8 inches; 9.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '619156721396'}\nI have major issues with curling my hair.  I am TERRIBLE at it.  I struggle with a curling iron, and never seem to get uniform curls.  I also have very straight and fine blonde hair that does not naturally hold any sort of shape besides straight.<br /><br />These curlers do the trick, and they aren't uncomfortable to sleep on like I was expecting.  Now I take a shower before I go to bed, apply the curlers with the easy to use wand, and go to bed.  By the morning I can pull these out of my hair easily, and find that I have beautiful tight curls that I can set with hair spray or brush lightly before applying spray.  If I do not apply spray they last for about 2 hours, but if I apply a good light weight hairspray they last the entire workday.  I also do not have any issues with any kinks or lines in the curls, even at the top, which is a HUGE plus.<br /><br />Overall these units apply easily to my damp hair using the attached wand, and curl the hair nicely.\nHello curls!\nGlitter Poly Nail Gel Extensions Builder Gel UV/LED Soak Off Acrylic Fashion Gel Polish Set for Nails Beginner DIY Nail Art at Home 8 colors-15g (Pink series)\nMIZHSE\n{'Brand': 'MIZHSE', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '478.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '9', 'Package Dimensions': '9.76 x 4.88 x 1.42 inches; 12.8 Ounces'}\nThis polygel set is surprisingly delightful.
