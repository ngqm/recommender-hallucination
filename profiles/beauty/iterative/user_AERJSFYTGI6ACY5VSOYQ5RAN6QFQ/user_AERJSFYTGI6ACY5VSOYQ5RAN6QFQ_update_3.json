On one hand, they are very cost effective, and you get four rhinestone pickers instead of one which is a huge plus.<br /><br />However, I find I go through the soft end of the rhinestone picker faster than I do other units.  For instance, I have one rhinestone picker from UberChic beauty which I have had for over 6 months, and it still maintains its original shape and is only showing slight dulling at the tip.  However, these units are very soft on the white end, and have actually chipped/worn away quickly.  In a month and a half I have already used up one and the majority of a second.<br /><br />They do a good job at what they are meant for, and I have not had any issues at all with picking up rhinestones.  However, the white end is just too soft, and considering tips have broken off/worn away so quickly I have to give this 3/5.\nReview Title: Tips are very weak\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Poly Nail Gel Kit, 7 Colors Nail Extension Gel with UV Lamp, Poly Extension Decoration Kit, Base Top Coat Set with Rhinestone, Nail Molds, Complete Nail Art Gel Kits for DIY Manicure, Pink Nude Series\nAIFAIFA\n{'Color': 'Pink', 'Brand': 'AIFAIFA', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Product Dimensions': '5.9 x 5.9 x 5.9 inches; 1.5 Pounds'}\nTo start with: this is an actual great little starter kit.  This offers people the opportunity to play with both gel and polygel, while coming with a small light.  Being honest - when I first started working with gel I wasn't sure if I liked it or not, so a kit like this would have been super helpful.<br /><br />The gels themselves have nice self leveling.  The colors are nicely pigmented two coaters.  They are fairly tacky, so make sure you put on a top coat (which I always recommend) or be prepared to wipe down with alcohol.  They do take a bit longer to set, but they do set nicely.<br /><br />The sequins are a nice touch, and the top coat and base coats are very close quality to others I have (similar to Beetles).  The top coat isn't quite a no wipe, but it shines up beautifully with a little bit of alcohol.<br /><br />The tools are perfect, and the polygel colors are beautiful.  They set nicely, and file perfectly.  The duoforms are in lots of good sizes, so I don't have any issues finding the perfect sizes (my hands are weird, each finger has different size which is annoying to need 10 different sizes, but hey.<br /><br />I don't quite understand why there's the nail foils since there's no glue for the foils.  The top coat isn't quite tacky enough for foils.  The striping tape is a very nice touch.<br /><br />The light works fairly well.  The onyl problem is its a one button, so its only 45 seconds or 60 seconds.  I have a lot of other lights, so while I was happy to try this one out, and it'll be great for travel, I like my bigger lights for other  daily use.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great little kit for trying out gels and polygels.  I would advise that you pick up more files and a bigger light in the future with more settings and timers, but overall, this is great for getting started.  The travel case fits everything nicely, and makes it convenient to take on vacation.  The gels also last about 2 weeks which is a huuuuuge plus.\nGreat Little Starter Kit\nPoly Nail Gel Kit, 7 Colors Nail Extension Gel with UV Lamp, Poly Extension Decoration Kit, Base Top Coat Set with Rhinestone, Nail Molds, Nail Art Gel Kits for Home DIY Manicure, Blue Nude Series\nAIFAIFA\n{'Color': 'Blue', 'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'AIFAIFA', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Product Dimensions': '5.9 x 5.9 x 5.9 inches; 1.48 Pounds'}\nTo start with: this is an actual great little starter kit.
