It measured longer than 18\u201d but it has short hairs throughout as shown in the photos. The lace is more of a light brown with small knots and the hairline is pre-plucked. The cap is well constructed and it\u2019s small head friendly (circumferences less than 22\u201d). Overall, it\u2019s soft with a silky straight texture but the density is just too thin for my personal preference.\nReview Title: Soft but thin\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
