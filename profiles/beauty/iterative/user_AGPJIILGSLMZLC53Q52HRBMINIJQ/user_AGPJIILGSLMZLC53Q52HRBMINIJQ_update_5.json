It measured longer than 18\u201d but it has short hairs throughout as shown in the photos. The lace is more of a light brown with small knots and the hairline is pre-plucked. The cap is well constructed and it\u2019s small head friendly (circumferences less than 22\u201d). Overall, it\u2019s soft with a silky straight texture but the density is just too thin for my personal preference.\nSoft but thin\nAOA Studio Collection Makeup Sponge Set Makeup Blender Latex Free and High-definition Set of 5 Makeup Blender For Powder Cream and Liquid, Super Soft Wonder Blender Beauty Cosmetic Beveled\nAOA STUDIO\n{'Brand': 'AOA STUDIO', 'Color': 'Ivory', 'Material': 'Rubber', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Makeup', 'Package Dimensions': '6.85 x 5.39 x 1.97 inches; 1.45 Ounces', 'UPC': '850022931338'}\nThese makeup sponges are super soft which makes it great for a flawless makeup application.<br /><br />The flat side allows me to dab my liquid foundation before evenly applying it over my face.

It includes the mask, a silicone brush & a super soft headband that my daughter confiscated for her personal use\u2026<br /><br />The mask has a very thick consistency but it surprisingly glided on smoothly with the silicone brush. It felt cool and soothing initially but I did experience a lil tingling sensation during my 15 min wait time. When it was time to rinsing it off, it had harden so it was dry, flakey and quite messy. However, my skin in that small test area did feel softer & more moisturized.<br /><br />With that said, it effectively works to hydrate & soften my skin. But just be mindful that it is as messy as it looks\u2026but it does work marvelously well tho.\nMarvelous \u201cMessy\u201d  Mask Set\nOGC Cosmetics Hair Mask Anti Frizz 8.5 Fl Oz - 250 Milliliters\nOGC Cosmetics\n{'Brand': 'OGC Cosmetics', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Material Feature': 'Cruelty Free', 'Hair Type': 'Frizzy', 'Product Benefits': 'Frizz Control', 'Product Dimensions': '7.09 x 2.36 x 2.36 inches; 0.01 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'OGC Cosmetics'}\nThis product works perfectly well to reduce the frizz!
