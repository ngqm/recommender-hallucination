It includes the mask, a silicone brush & a super soft headband that my daughter confiscated for her personal use\u2026<br /><br />The mask has a very thick consistency but it surprisingly glided on smoothly with the silicone brush. It felt cool and soothing initially but I did experience a lil tingling sensation during my 15 min wait time. When it was time to rinsing it off, it had harden so it was dry, flakey and quite messy. However, my skin in that small test area did feel softer & more moisturized.<br /><br />With that said, it effectively works to hydrate & soften my skin.
