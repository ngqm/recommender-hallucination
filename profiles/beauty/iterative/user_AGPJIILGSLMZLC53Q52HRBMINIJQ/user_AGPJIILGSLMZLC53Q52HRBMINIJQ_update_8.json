It measured longer than 18\u201d but it has short hairs throughout as shown in the photos. The lace is more of a light brown with small knots and the hairline is pre-plucked. The cap is well constructed and it\u2019s small head friendly (circumferences less than 22\u201d). Overall, it\u2019s soft with a silky straight texture but the density is just too thin for my personal preference.\nSoft but thin\nAOA Studio Collection Makeup Sponge Set Makeup Blender Latex Free and High-definition Set of 5 Makeup Blender For Powder Cream and Liquid, Super Soft Wonder Blender Beauty Cosmetic Beveled\nAOA STUDIO\n{'Brand': 'AOA STUDIO', 'Color': 'Ivory', 'Material': 'Rubber', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Makeup', 'Package Dimensions': '6.85 x 5.39 x 1.97 inches; 1.45 Ounces', 'UPC': '850022931338'}\nThese makeup sponges are super soft which makes it great for a flawless makeup application.<br /><br />The flat side allows me to dab my liquid foundation before evenly applying it over my face.
