You wash once they're full of makeup, putting them in a garment bag, and I try to put them in a wash with no fabric softener.\nReview Title: works great\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "LumaRx Facial Cleansing Brush with 1-Minute Pulsing Timer and LED Speed Indicator Light, Rechargeable and Showerproof, White/Silver\n{'Material': 'Silver', 'Brand': 'LumaRx', 'Color': 'White/Silver', 'Power Source': 'electric', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '3.88 x 7 x 10 inches', 'Product Dimensions': '3.88 x 7 x 10 inches; 5.6 Ounces', 'Item model number': '1', 'UPC': '074590543216', 'Manufacturer': 'LumaRx'}\nI'm pretty happy about the LumaRx facial cleansing brush. It is designed very ergonomically and is very comfortable to hold during use. The tool is extremely lightweight and has a tapered design which makes it so comfortable to use. The instructions are to use it for a minute each morning and evening. It has illustrations which show you to spend 20 seconds on the right side and 20 seconds on the left side and 20 seconds on the T-zone. The tool will actually buzz gently when you should move to the next area. This is a great feature! It also comes with 3 brush heads; massage, sensitive and normal skin. I am using the sensitive for now and it is perfect for a gentle exfoliation. When I am finished with that minute, my skin just glows and feels so clean! Hopefully the heads do not need replaced quickly as I do not think they are yet available on Amazon or online. It also comes with a sleek charger that does not take up any room at all on the counter \u2013 this is important to me as I have a small bathroom. Also, the LumaRx comes with a very nice carrying case that will come in handy for an upcoming vacation.\nExciting product for smooth and glowing skin\nIt\u2019S SKIN Signature D\u2019escargot Unwrinkle Snail Cream 55ml 1.86 fl. oz. - Anti Aging Wrinkle Care Skin Tightening Repair Moisturizing Essence for Youthful Appearance Mucin Serum Gel\nIt\u2019s Skin\n{'Brand': 'It\u2019s Skin', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '1.8598 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Type': 'Mature', 'Package Dimensions': '3.6 x 3.6 x 3.3 inches; 8.78 Ounces'}\nI've heard of face cream made from snails (or their secretions) and was a bit hesitant to give it a try. This is from Korea so perhaps that's not so surprising, and has a nice citrus scent to it, is a nice thick cream (no SPF) that does a really good job moisturizing my skin. It absorbs quickly and gives it a nice, dewy look and does seem to provide some tightness to it.\nyes, snail cream\nThe Sunset Dusk Palette | 15 Color Eye Shadow of BEAUTY GLAZED Eyeshadow Palette | QyeeCosmetics. - Amazon Vine\nQyee Cosmetics\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.1 x 4.1 x 0.6 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'UPC': '725714076539'}\nOkay, I love eyeshadow palettes and probably have too many, and they range in price and brand. I definitely love the 'sunset/rose gold' palettes, and this reminds me of a Huda palette I have with similar shades. It's in a slim, cardboard palette without a mirror, but this is a lower price point for all the shades you get. The shadow itself is a creamy powder blend, and it suggests that you use your fingers for the metallic shades (I find a small crease blush works fine and tends to have less loose powder that way).<br /><br />You have a nice mix of matte and metallic shades this way, with a lot of earth tones. Definitely a lot of copper and reds here, some golds and rose golds and pinks. Colors that will stand out but not all of them. These felt nice on the skin and blended well. Why the three stars?<br /><br />I tried this with and without primer, and this kit definitely needs primer to last more than a couple of hours on my skin. Also? The mattes will last several hours, but not the metallics even with primer (as well as a setting spray on top). I love the metallic colors, but they just fade on me somehow - even if I layer them on top of the matte. I'm used to eyeshadow blending on me after a few hours, but never have I seen metallics melt away on me like this. That's not to mean it won't work better on other people.<br /><br />Still, for the price it's a nice range of colors and a fun palette to play with, so it's worth a try.\npretty colors, some staying power\nSnowflakes Beauty Sponge Makeup Blender-Latex Free\uff0c Tear Drop Shape Sponge Flawless Coverage of Powder, Cream, Liquid. (Pink)\nSnowflakes\n{'Brand': 'Snowflakes', 'Material': 'Rubber', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Makeup', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '2.3 x 1.8 x 1.7 inches; 0.81 Ounces', 'UPC': '738598331618'}\nThis is a great makeup sponge and works just as well as others that cost a lot more. You can use it damp or dry (I moisten it when I'm applying liquid foundation, but can use it dry when cleaning up eye shadow or applying some blush). It's nice and soft so it feels good against the skin, and applies the makeup in an even fashion.\ngreat at blending makeup\nNATWAG Reusable Update Makeup Remover Cloths for Sensitive Skin - Microfiber Face Cloth Makeup Remover | Washable Round Makeup Remover Pads | Natural Facial Towels (2 Pads,2 Cloth) (Purple)\nNatwag\n{'Brand': 'Natwag', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive,All Skin Types', 'Material Feature': 'Reusable', 'Unit Count': '4.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Package Dimensions': '12.75 x 9.88 x 0.59 inches; 2.08 Ounces', 'UPC': '745103569978'}\nI've read about these and wanted to give them a try; you wet them with warm water (or micellar water) then wipe with off your makeup with them.
