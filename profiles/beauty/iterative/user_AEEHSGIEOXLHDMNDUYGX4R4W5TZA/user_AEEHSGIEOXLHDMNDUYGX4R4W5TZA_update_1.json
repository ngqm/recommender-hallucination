It is designed very ergonomically and is very comfortable to hold during use. The tool is extremely lightweight and has a tapered design which makes it so comfortable to use. The instructions are to use it for a minute each morning and evening. It has illustrations which show you to spend 20 seconds on the right side and 20 seconds on the left side and 20 seconds on the T-zone. The tool will actually buzz gently when you should move to the next area. This is a great feature! It also comes with 3 brush heads; massage, sensitive and normal skin. I am using the sensitive for now and it is perfect for a gentle exfoliation. When I am finished with that minute, my skin just glows and feels so clean! Hopefully the heads do not need replaced quickly as I do not think they are yet available on Amazon or online. It also comes with a sleek charger that does not take up any room at all on the counter \u2013 this is important to me as I have a small bathroom. Also, the LumaRx comes with a very nice carrying case that will come in handy for an upcoming vacation.\nReview Title: Exciting product for smooth and glowing skin\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
