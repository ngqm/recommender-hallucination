I should note the bottom portion is large enough. I just prefer to put my brushes and sponges in it. I wish the black compartments were just a bit wider. Despite me loving this so much, I wouldn\u2019t purchase this again. It\u2019s too expensive. The arcrylic is thin, the metal is cheap, handle is plastic, and it\u2019s difficult to get things to aglin. I fear this won\u2019t hold up for more than a year or two.\nReview Title: I love it, but poor quality\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
