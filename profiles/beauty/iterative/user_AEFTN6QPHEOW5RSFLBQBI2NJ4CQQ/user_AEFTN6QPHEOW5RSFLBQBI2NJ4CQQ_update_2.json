However, this is an excellent value and totally worth purchasing. I use the larger ones to mix gels and lotions together. I tried using them to apply lotion and clay masks but I get better coverage with my fingers and I don\u2019t have to worry about cleaning anything off. The other ones work fine for makeup application, I just prefer traditional brushes. I can being of use with cream, gel, or getting the last of a product out. Also, for the price these are really good quality.\nReview Title: Nice product\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Beautify Professional Large Lockable Acrylic Vanity Makeup & Cosmetic Storage Display Case with Frame (Rose Gold)\nBeautify\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '11.8 x 6.3 x 7.5 inches; 2.8 Pounds'}\nI love this case it is so beautiful and I can fit everything but my eyeshadow pallets in it. I should note the bottom portion is large enough. I just prefer to put my brushes and sponges in it. I wish the black compartments were just a bit wider. Despite me loving this so much, I wouldn\u2019t purchase this again. It\u2019s too expensive. The arcrylic is thin, the metal is cheap, handle is plastic, and it\u2019s difficult to get things to aglin. I fear this won\u2019t hold up for more than a year or two.\nI love it, but poor quality\nLORMAY Silicone Makeup Brush Set(7pcs, Mint Green)\nLORMAY\n['Set contains:', '7 pieces of silicone makeup brushes', 'Product Highlights:', '1.
