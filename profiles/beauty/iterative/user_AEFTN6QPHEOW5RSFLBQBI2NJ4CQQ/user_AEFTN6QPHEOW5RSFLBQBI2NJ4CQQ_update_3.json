I get excellent results with them and the are so comfortable to use. The only thing I don\u2019t like is the silver name stamped into the handles- really ruins the whole look. That\u2019s such a trivia reason but I\u2019m not sure I would have bought these if I saw that.\nReview Title: Love them\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Beautify Professional Large Lockable Acrylic Vanity Makeup & Cosmetic Storage Display Case with Frame (Rose Gold)\nBeautify\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '11.8 x 6.3 x 7.5 inches; 2.8 Pounds'}\nI love this case it is so beautiful and I can fit everything but my eyeshadow pallets in it. I should note the bottom portion is large enough. I just prefer to put my brushes and sponges in it. I wish the black compartments were just a bit wider. Despite me loving this so much, I wouldn\u2019t purchase this again. It\u2019s too expensive. The arcrylic is thin, the metal is cheap, handle is plastic, and it\u2019s difficult to get things to aglin. I fear this won\u2019t hold up for more than a year or two.\nI love it, but poor quality\nLORMAY Silicone Makeup Brush Set(7pcs, Mint Green)\nLORMAY\n['Set contains:', '7 pieces of silicone makeup brushes', 'Product Highlights:', '1. Silicone brushes have become popular in the last five years. Unlike hair brushes, silicone brushes are easy to clean, easy to dry. They can be used repeatedly and have a long service life. 2. Silicone brushes can significantly reduce the consumption of makeup. We know that hair brushes easily soak up expensive beauty products. This is a waste.However, silicone brushes can minimize waste, as they do not soak up any fluids. 3. Silicone brushes are perfect for applying face masks, gels, creams, or liquid-like beauty products. 4. Silicone brushes are portable and easy to use, whether you are on the go, at home, or in the office. 5. 5. The big brush is used to apply facial mask and foundation makeup. The small brushes are used for the eye shadow, eyeliner, eyebrow, and lip makeup. 6. Silicone material is nontoxic and odorless, which meets FDA standards for quality, safety, and efficacy.', 'Tips:', '1. Clean these brushes with a small amount of soap or makeup remover and rinse them under lukewarm water. 2. Keep away from sharp objects like tweezers or brow scissors.', 'About LORMAY:', 'LORMAY is a professional beauty & personal care product supplier, focusing on supplying all kinds of high-quality, stylish and attractive makeup brushes and cosmetics.

However, this is an excellent value and totally worth purchasing. I use the larger ones to mix gels and lotions together. I tried using them to apply lotion and clay masks but I get better coverage with my fingers and I don\u2019t have to worry about cleaning anything off. The other ones work fine for makeup application, I just prefer traditional brushes. I can being of use with cream, gel, or getting the last of a product out. Also, for the price these are really good quality.\nNice product\nMakeup Brushes 12PCs- CLOWII Professional Premium Birch Handle Makeup Brush Foundation Concealer Brush Set of 12 with 1 Makeup Cleaner(Black)\nCLOWII\n{'Brand': 'CLOWII', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'For Concealing, For Foundation', 'Material': 'Silicone, Wool', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Item Form': 'Wand', 'Number of Pieces': '12', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Handle Material': 'Silicone', 'Ferrule Material': 'Aluminum', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '8.03 x 4.41 x 1.69 inches; 9.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '741818684043'}\nI love the quality of these brushes.
