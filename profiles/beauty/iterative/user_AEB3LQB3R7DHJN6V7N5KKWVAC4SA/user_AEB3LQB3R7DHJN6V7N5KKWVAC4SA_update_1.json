A few are way off, but still pretty colors. All of my swatches are two coats. The only issue I had was with the black, which isn't shown in my photos. Even after at least 5 minutes, I couldn't get the color to cure. The bottles seem to be pretty full and none are goopy or thick. Although there are quite a few reds and pinks, it's still a good selection, especially for the price.\nReview Title: Good set of gel polishes at a great price!\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
