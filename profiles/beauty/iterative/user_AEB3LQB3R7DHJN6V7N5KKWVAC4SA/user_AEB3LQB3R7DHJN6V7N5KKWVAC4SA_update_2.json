Some of the colors aren't close to the colors in the sellers photos, but they are still nice. The opaque colors looked pretty good with just one coat, but I used two coats. The glitter swatches have two coats on as well. The matte top coat has a very strong smell, but seems to work really well. The regular top coat cures to a shiny finish and seems good too. All of the layers cured in two minutes each with my lamp.\nReview Title: Nice set of reds/pinks. Good coverage.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

A few are way off, but still pretty colors. All of my swatches are two coats. The only issue I had was with the black, which isn't shown in my photos. Even after at least 5 minutes, I couldn't get the color to cure. The bottles seem to be pretty full and none are goopy or thick. Although there are quite a few reds and pinks, it's still a good selection, especially for the price.\nGood set of gel polishes at a great price!\nAIFAIFA 9Pcs Gel Nail Polish Set, Burgundy Nail Polish Kits Red Colors Soak Off UV/LED Nail Polish Set, Gel Polish with Base Coat & Glossy & Matte Top All-Season Salon Manicure Art Design Red\nAIFAIFA\n{'Brand': 'AIFAIFA', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Color': 'Burgundy,Red', 'Type': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Glossy, Matte', 'Special Feature': 'Long Lasting', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic', 'Unit Count': '9.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '9', 'Package Dimensions': '7.99 x 4.21 x 2.83 inches; 11.99 Ounces'}\nThis is a nice set of gel polishes.
