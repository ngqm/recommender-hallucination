It's not an overly thick cream. I would say somewhere between a lotion and cream consistency. I really like how well it absorbs into my dry skin. It doesn't leave my hands feeling greasy. I also really like the scent.\nReview Title: I love this hand cream!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Rosalind Neon Nail Polish Set,Classic Neon Color Series Soak Off UV LED Lamp,Soak Off UV/LED (Neon Color Series)\nnonbranded\n{'Brand': 'nonbranded', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '24.00 Count', 'Liquid Volume': '0.33 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '11.26 x 10.51 x 3.7 inches; 2.23 Pounds'}\nI did my test swatches and most of the colors are a close match to what they show. A few are way off, but still pretty colors. All of my swatches are two coats. The only issue I had was with the black, which isn't shown in my photos. Even after at least 5 minutes, I couldn't get the color to cure. The bottles seem to be pretty full and none are goopy or thick. Although there are quite a few reds and pinks, it's still a good selection, especially for the price.\nGood set of gel polishes at a great price!\nAIFAIFA 9Pcs Gel Nail Polish Set, Burgundy Nail Polish Kits Red Colors Soak Off UV/LED Nail Polish Set, Gel Polish with Base Coat & Glossy & Matte Top All-Season Salon Manicure Art Design Red\nAIFAIFA\n{'Brand': 'AIFAIFA', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Color': 'Burgundy,Red', 'Type': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Glossy, Matte', 'Special Feature': 'Long Lasting', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic', 'Unit Count': '9.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '9', 'Package Dimensions': '7.99 x 4.21 x 2.83 inches; 11.99 Ounces'}\nThis is a nice set of gel polishes. Some of the colors aren't close to the colors in the sellers photos, but they are still nice. The opaque colors looked pretty good with just one coat, but I used two coats. The glitter swatches have two coats on as well. The matte top coat has a very strong smell, but seems to work really well. The regular top coat cures to a shiny finish and seems good too. All of the layers cured in two minutes each with my lamp.\nNice set of reds/pinks. Good coverage.\n10 Pcs Gel Nail Polish Kit, Unicorn Collection Soak off Nail Gel Polish Pastel Pink Yellow Blue Nail Polish Purple Green Glitter Gel Polish Starter Kit with Glossy & Matte Top and Base Coat\nMOCMAKI\n{'Brand': 'MOCMAKI', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Color': 'Pastel,Purple Green,Silver,White', 'Finish Type': 'Glossy', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '10', 'Package Dimensions': '11.5 x 3 x 1 inches; 7.2 Ounces', 'UPC': '774494158270'}\nThe colors are fine and cover pretty well with one coat. The glitter swatches have 2 coats. All swatches were cured for 2 minutes between each coat. The main issue I have with the set is that the bottles are plastic and don't seem to have very much polish in them. For the price, I think a buyer would be expecting more. This set does not come with a base and top coat.\nNot overly impressed, especially for the price...\nMagnetic Eyelashes with Eyeliner Kit, SOTICA 10Pairs Magnetic Lashes Natural False Eyelashes with Tweezers DIY Eyelash Extension Kit Authentic Eyelash Extension Look Easy to Use No Glue Needed\u2026\nSotica\n{'Package Dimensions': '9.26 x 5.95 x 0.83 inches; 2.89 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'CS-JM-8'}\nI wanted to try magnetic eyelashes for awhile now, but am unimpressed with this set. I don't think they are any easier to apply than glue on lashes. Why in the world would you use a pair of metal tweezers with magnets? They just kept attaching to each other, making it difficult to set the lashes. I got frustrated and gave up. The liner did remove easily with water and a q-tip.\nI wanted to love these, but the application is annoying\nKRISNICE Press On Nails Short Square, 30pcs Fake Nails Petite Pure Fit Grass Green Olive Summer Set Acrylic Nails with Nail Glue for Women and Girls Gel Nail Kit(KCD016)\nKRISNICE\n{'Color': 'Olive', 'Size': 'Small', 'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'KRISNICE', 'Style': 'French', 'Product Dimensions': '4.33 x 2.76 x 0.59 inches; 0.35 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'KCD016'}\nI'm kind of surprised by all of the positive reviews for this brand of nails. You only receive 6 designed nails in the set I received. The one design is a slightly blurry image that makes them look cheap. They are pretty flimsy and need filed in areas other than just the tip where it came off the mold. I think you'll have better luck going to a local store and getting nicer ones.\nNot very im'pressed'\nHempz Triple Moisture Hydrating Herbal Hand Creme, 4 oz\nHempz\n['We put hemp seed oil into everything we make, so you get vitamin E, amino acids, and omega fatty acids in every squeeze or swipe.']\n{'Product Dimensions': '2.13 x 1.38 x 7.25 inches; 4 Ounces', 'Item model number': '110-2758-03', 'UPC': '676280046580', 'Manufacturer': 'Hempz'}\nI guess I should've read the description better because I wasn't expecting such a large bottle, but that's not a bad thing!
