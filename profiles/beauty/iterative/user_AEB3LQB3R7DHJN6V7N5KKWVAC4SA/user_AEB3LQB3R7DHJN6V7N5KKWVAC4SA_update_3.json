The glitter swatches have 2 coats. All swatches were cured for 2 minutes between each coat. The main issue I have with the set is that the bottles are plastic and don't seem to have very much polish in them. For the price, I think a buyer would be expecting more. This set does not come with a base and top coat.\nReview Title: Not overly impressed, especially for the price...\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Rosalind Neon Nail Polish Set,Classic Neon Color Series Soak Off UV LED Lamp,Soak Off UV/LED (Neon Color Series)\nnonbranded\n{'Brand': 'nonbranded', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '24.00 Count', 'Liquid Volume': '0.33 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '11.26 x 10.51 x 3.7 inches; 2.23 Pounds'}\nI did my test swatches and most of the colors are a close match to what they show. A few are way off, but still pretty colors. All of my swatches are two coats. The only issue I had was with the black, which isn't shown in my photos. Even after at least 5 minutes, I couldn't get the color to cure. The bottles seem to be pretty full and none are goopy or thick. Although there are quite a few reds and pinks, it's still a good selection, especially for the price.\nGood set of gel polishes at a great price!\nAIFAIFA 9Pcs Gel Nail Polish Set, Burgundy Nail Polish Kits Red Colors Soak Off UV/LED Nail Polish Set, Gel Polish with Base Coat & Glossy & Matte Top All-Season Salon Manicure Art Design Red\nAIFAIFA\n{'Brand': 'AIFAIFA', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Color': 'Burgundy,Red', 'Type': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Glossy, Matte', 'Special Feature': 'Long Lasting', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic', 'Unit Count': '9.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '9', 'Package Dimensions': '7.99 x 4.21 x 2.83 inches; 11.99 Ounces'}\nThis is a nice set of gel polishes. Some of the colors aren't close to the colors in the sellers photos, but they are still nice. The opaque colors looked pretty good with just one coat, but I used two coats. The glitter swatches have two coats on as well. The matte top coat has a very strong smell, but seems to work really well. The regular top coat cures to a shiny finish and seems good too. All of the layers cured in two minutes each with my lamp.\nNice set of reds/pinks. Good coverage.\n10 Pcs Gel Nail Polish Kit, Unicorn Collection Soak off Nail Gel Polish Pastel Pink Yellow Blue Nail Polish Purple Green Glitter Gel Polish Starter Kit with Glossy & Matte Top and Base Coat\nMOCMAKI\n{'Brand': 'MOCMAKI', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Color': 'Pastel,Purple Green,Silver,White', 'Finish Type': 'Glossy', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '10', 'Package Dimensions': '11.5 x 3 x 1 inches; 7.2 Ounces', 'UPC': '774494158270'}\nThe colors are fine and cover pretty well with one coat.
