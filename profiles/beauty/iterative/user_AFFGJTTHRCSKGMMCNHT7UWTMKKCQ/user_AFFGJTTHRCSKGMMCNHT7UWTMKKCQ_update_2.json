Unlike most fiber mascaras this didnt give me much volume or length. And it flaked off after a full day of wear. I really love the packaging. I think this may be ok on fake lashes but not so great on real or short lashes.\nNot a true fiber mascara.\nPoly Nail Gel Kit, 7 Colors Nail Extension Gel with UV Lamp, Poly Extension Decoration Kit, Base Top Coat Set with Rhinestone, Nail Molds, Nail Art Gel Kits for Home DIY Manicure, Blue Nude Series\nAIFAIFA\n{'Color': 'Blue', 'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'AIFAIFA', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Product Dimensions': '5.9 x 5.9 x 5.9 inches; 1.48 Pounds'}\nI like that it comes in a case.
