Did a great job at smoothing the hairs especially nearly the cheekbones. The comb was great for the chin and under areas to reach the thicker hairs. The brush has a good weight to it and is pretty thick! I did feel like, if the comb were to go through a bad enough tangle, it may cause damage. Works best with a little oil too!\nReview Title: Loved the brush weight\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "4D Silk Fiber Lash Mascara Black, Natural Waterproof Mascara Extra Long Lash,Thick Thickening and Lengthening, No Clumping, No Smudging, Lasting Voluminous Eyelashes Dramatic Extension Mascara\nSIKEMAY\n{'Color': 'Black', 'Special Feature': 'Smudge Proof, Non Clumping', 'Brand': 'SIKEMAY', 'Specialty': 'Waterproof, Hypoallergenic', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '8.9 x 4 x 1.1 inches; 2.57 Ounces', 'UPC': '764690676852', 'Manufacturer': 'SIKEMAY'}\nI really wanted to like this. Unlike most fiber mascaras this didnt give me much volume or length. And it flaked off after a full day of wear. I really love the packaging. I think this may be ok on fake lashes but not so great on real or short lashes.\nNot a true fiber mascara.\nPoly Nail Gel Kit, 7 Colors Nail Extension Gel with UV Lamp, Poly Extension Decoration Kit, Base Top Coat Set with Rhinestone, Nail Molds, Nail Art Gel Kits for Home DIY Manicure, Blue Nude Series\nAIFAIFA\n{'Color': 'Blue', 'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'AIFAIFA', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Product Dimensions': '5.9 x 5.9 x 5.9 inches; 1.48 Pounds'}\nI like that it comes in a case. The colors are vibrant. No strong smell. Only thing that disappointed me was the light. I had to do one finger at a time, flip it twice under it's own time in order to get fully dry. The light did not extend to all my fingers without some odd maneuvering.\nNice except the light.\nMini Rubber Bands Soft Elastic Bands for Kids Hair Non-slip Rubber Hair Bands Soft Hair Elastics Ties Bands Braids Hair for Girls - STRONG - REUSEABLE (Colorful1000+Black1000)\nOLEWELL\n{'Material': 'Rubber', 'Item Form': 'Elastic', 'Brand': 'OLEWELL', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Number of Pieces': '2', 'Package Dimensions': '7 x 5 x 1 inches; 0.81 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'SML'}\nHave quite a bit of stretch. They didnt slip down the hair and they seem pretty strong. Love the multicolored ones, they were great to add color to different styles.\nBigger than most but work great\n20pcs Nail Tips Clips for Quick Building Polygel Nail Forms Nail Tips Clip for Finger Nail Extension DIY Manicure Nail Art Tool\ntiggell\n{'Size': '20 Count (Pack of 1)', 'Material': 'Plastic', 'Brand': 'Tiggell', 'Style': 'French', 'Coverage': 'Full Well Tips', 'Package Dimensions': '8.98 x 6.85 x 2.2 inches; 4.16 Ounces', 'UPC': '795853588163'}\nDid their job! Fit the finger well, did not pinch and weren't overly tight. Had just enough squeeze to it to hold the form on so instead of doing one at a time you can do multiple. Had no issues curing through the clip. I also used it to pinch the end of an acrylic nail as well and it worked nicely for the as well.\nDoesnt hinder curing\nBeard Brush, Comb, Scissors Grooming Kit for Men's Care, Perfect to Distribute Balm or Oil for Growth & Styling, Adds Shine & Softness Black Color\nGROW ALPHA BEARD\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.4 x 3.4 x 2.3 inches; 7.2 Ounces', 'UPC': '300875400470 719279662702'}\nThe brush is really nice.
