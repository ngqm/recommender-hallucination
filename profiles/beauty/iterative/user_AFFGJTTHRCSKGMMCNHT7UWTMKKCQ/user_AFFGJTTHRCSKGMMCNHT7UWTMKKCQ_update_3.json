Unlike most fiber mascaras this didnt give me much volume or length. And it flaked off after a full day of wear. I really love the packaging. I think this may be ok on fake lashes but not so great on real or short lashes.\nNot a true fiber mascara.\nPoly Nail Gel Kit, 7 Colors Nail Extension Gel with UV Lamp, Poly Extension Decoration Kit, Base Top Coat Set with Rhinestone, Nail Molds, Nail Art Gel Kits for Home DIY Manicure, Blue Nude Series\nAIFAIFA\n{'Color': 'Blue', 'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'AIFAIFA', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Product Dimensions': '5.9 x 5.9 x 5.9 inches; 1.48 Pounds'}\nI like that it comes in a case. The colors are vibrant. No strong smell. Only thing that disappointed me was the light. I had to do one finger at a time, flip it twice under it's own time in order to get fully dry. The light did not extend to all my fingers without some odd maneuvering.\nNice except the light.\nMini Rubber Bands Soft Elastic Bands for Kids Hair Non-slip Rubber Hair Bands Soft Hair Elastics Ties Bands Braids Hair for Girls - STRONG - REUSEABLE (Colorful1000+Black1000)\nOLEWELL\n{'Material': 'Rubber', 'Item Form': 'Elastic', 'Brand': 'OLEWELL', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Number of Pieces': '2', 'Package Dimensions': '7 x 5 x 1 inches; 0.81 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'SML'}\nHave quite a bit of stretch.
