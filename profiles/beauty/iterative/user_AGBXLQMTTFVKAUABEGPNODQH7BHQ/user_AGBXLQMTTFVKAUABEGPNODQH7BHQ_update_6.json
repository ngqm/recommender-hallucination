The ombr\u00e9 color was perfect . It came with six packs which was enough for my whole head. The hair was pretty good. My only dislike is that the styles only last for two weeks because the hair unravels. The price point is pretty good for six packs of hair.\nReview Title: Ombr\u00e9 burgundy pre looped hair\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
