The crown itself wasn\u2019t that thick. But in the jewel part of the crown it has thickness. Warmth from the crown was low. I feel like the quality of this crown is awesome. The color is nice and dark. I live the mysterious look of the crown. The price point was good. I recommend this.\nReview Title: Ambari black crown\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
