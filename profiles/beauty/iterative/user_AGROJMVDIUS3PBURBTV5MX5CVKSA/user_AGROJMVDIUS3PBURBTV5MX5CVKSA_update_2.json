The button placement is fine for my mask but it could easily be adjusted to your liking with some basic sewing skills. The fabric is soft and stretchy. I would've liked it to be slightly smaller to begin with because it does feel like it will get stretched out too easily with prolonged use. It is a bold pattern but with the mixed colors, it would be easy to coordinate with different scrubs. This definitely helps alleviate discomfort on your ears from wearing facemasks.\nReview Title: Cute headband to use with face masks\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "BJ\u00d6RN HALL Nurse Headband with Buttons for Face Mask | Elastic Swimsuit Material, Smooth & Stretchy | Ear Saver Headband with Buttons | Perfect for Nurses, Doctors & Medical Students\nBj\u00f6rn Hall\n{'Package Dimensions': '5.4 x 4.9 x 0.5 inches; 0.81 Ounces'}\nThis is a nice simple headband that's made out of stretchy swimsuit material. It is single layered so you won't get too warm wearing it. The part that goes behind the back of your head is narrower than the part that goes above your forehead. I wished the forehead part was narrower. I found the button placement fine for my mask (but it would be easy to adjust to your liking with some basic sewing skills). I like that the headband is snug but not uncomfortable. It does slide up a little in the back after a while. Something anti slip on the back would be nice to help keep the headband in place. It may be too tight if you have a larger head. The only thing I don't really like is the large logo. If it couldn't be eliminated it should be smaller or the color of the font be darker so it's not as obvious. Personally, I like the black because it blends into my hair for an inconspicuous look.\nNice headband material and your ears will thank you.\nBJ\u00d6RN HALL Button Knotted Nurse Headbands for Women with Buttons | Ear Saver Headband with buttons | Headband with Buttons for Face Mask for Nurses & Doctors | Elastic Hair Band with Buttons | Protect Your Ears with this Headband | Floral Blue\nBj\u00f6rn Hall\n{'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Brand': 'Bj\u00f6rn Hall', 'Size': 'One Size', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '4.29 x 3.11 x 1.61 inches; 1.34 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'KAL-500'}\nThis is a cute twisted knot headband.
