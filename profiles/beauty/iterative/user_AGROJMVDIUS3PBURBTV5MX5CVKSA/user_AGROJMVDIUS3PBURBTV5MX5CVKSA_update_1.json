It is single layered so you won't get too warm wearing it. The part that goes behind the back of your head is narrower than the part that goes above your forehead. I wished the forehead part was narrower. I found the button placement fine for my mask (but it would be easy to adjust to your liking with some basic sewing skills). I like that the headband is snug but not uncomfortable. It does slide up a little in the back after a while. Something anti slip on the back would be nice to help keep the headband in place. It may be too tight if you have a larger head. The only thing I don't really like is the large logo. If it couldn't be eliminated it should be smaller or the color of the font be darker so it's not as obvious. Personally, I like the black because it blends into my hair for an inconspicuous look.\nReview Title: Nice headband material and your ears will thank you.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
