I'm currently using this as a jewelry ring holder. I wish there was a cover, I think that would've been cute. This is versitile since you could use this for anything. It can also just be for display and it looks lovely the way it is. The size is good for the purpose I'm using it for.\nReview Title: Iridescent colored crown shaped dish for multi purpose use\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "BJ\u00d6RN HALL Nurse Headband with Buttons for Face Mask | Elastic Swimsuit Material, Smooth & Stretchy | Ear Saver Headband with Buttons | Perfect for Nurses, Doctors & Medical Students\nBj\u00f6rn Hall\n{'Package Dimensions': '5.4 x 4.9 x 0.5 inches; 0.81 Ounces'}\nThis is a nice simple headband that's made out of stretchy swimsuit material. It is single layered so you won't get too warm wearing it. The part that goes behind the back of your head is narrower than the part that goes above your forehead. I wished the forehead part was narrower. I found the button placement fine for my mask (but it would be easy to adjust to your liking with some basic sewing skills). I like that the headband is snug but not uncomfortable. It does slide up a little in the back after a while. Something anti slip on the back would be nice to help keep the headband in place. It may be too tight if you have a larger head. The only thing I don't really like is the large logo. If it couldn't be eliminated it should be smaller or the color of the font be darker so it's not as obvious. Personally, I like the black because it blends into my hair for an inconspicuous look.\nNice headband material and your ears will thank you.\nBJ\u00d6RN HALL Button Knotted Nurse Headbands for Women with Buttons | Ear Saver Headband with buttons | Headband with Buttons for Face Mask for Nurses & Doctors | Elastic Hair Band with Buttons | Protect Your Ears with this Headband | Floral Blue\nBj\u00f6rn Hall\n{'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Brand': 'Bj\u00f6rn Hall', 'Size': 'One Size', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '4.29 x 3.11 x 1.61 inches; 1.34 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'KAL-500'}\nThis is a cute twisted knot headband. The button placement is fine for my mask but it could easily be adjusted to your liking with some basic sewing skills. The fabric is soft and stretchy. I would've liked it to be slightly smaller to begin with because it does feel like it will get stretched out too easily with prolonged use. It is a bold pattern but with the mixed colors, it would be easy to coordinate with different scrubs. This definitely helps alleviate discomfort on your ears from wearing facemasks.\nCute headband to use with face masks\nBEPHOLAN Facial Skin Massager For Slimming Firming Reduce Wrinkles and Skin Rejuvenate\nBEPHOLAN\n{'Package Dimensions': '8.03 x 4.05 x 1.77 inches; 8.15 Ounces', 'UPC': '748966387468'}\nThis is a nice quality rose quartz facial roller. The massaging feature is nice and relaxing. There is a AA battery already installed (I didn't know that until I just happened to turn it on and it started vibrating). I wish the on/off was actually printed or engraved onto the handle. It's just a little gold sticker that could easily fall off if wet or from regular use. To remove/replace the battery you have to turn it to the \"on\" position and keep turning until the cap comes off. I wish the large roller actually rolled easily. The stone is smooth so it does glide over my skin nicely and with the vibration on, I can't even tell that the stone isn't actually rolling. The smaller stone attachment is nice to use around the eye area and that stone is also smooth. This set comes in a box and also a velour pouch to store it in.\nGive yourself a relaxing facial massage\nGOGALLJUG Jade Roller and Gua Sha,100% Natural Jade Facial Body Eyes Neck Massager Tool Reduce Wrinkles Aging\nGOG ALLJUG\n{'Material': 'nature stone', 'Brand': 'GOG ALLJUG', 'Is Cordless?': 'Yes', 'Product Grade': 'Home', 'Product Dimensions': '6.69 x 3.15 x 1.38 inches; 7.2 Ounces', 'UPC': '769390652212', 'Manufacturer': 'TOPTIP'}\nThis is a nice jade facial roller and Gua Sha. Both ends roll smoothly and the Gua Sha is smooth all around. I do wish the stone itself in both pieces felt even smoother, I can feel slight texture in the stones in some spots (it's just not as smooth as a rose quartz roller and Gua Sha that I have but maybe that's just the nature of the stone itself).  Otherwise the stone does feel nice on my face especially when it's taken out of the fridge so it feels cool and refreshing.\nGive yourself a relaxing facial massage with this jade set\n4 Pcs Portable Silicone Travel Bottles Keychain Set 1.3oz Empty Hand Sanitizer Bottles Container Leakproof Squeeze Bottles with Flip Cap - Refillable Containers for Toiletries, Shampoo, Liquid ect\nXITENBAO\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.4 x 7.01 x 1.85 inches; 7.05 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'hk-099', 'UPC': '650245716459'}\nThis is a nice set of 4 silicone travel bottles. They are soft and flexible. I am using them for hand sanitizer but you could use it for anything (like shampoo, body wash, hand soap, etc). So far there has not been any leaks but I wished there was an additional silicone anti-leak flap where the product comes out (like on certain ketchup or honey bottles) so the more liquidy contents doesn't flow right out when you open the cap. I usually turn the bottle cap side up for a few seconds so the contents are away from the cap before I open and then I turn it upside down to squeeze out. I like the retractable clip (it's essentially an identification badge clip or a keychain). Included are small carabiner clips which will allow you to hook the bottle to the retractable clip. It does look a little bulky with that setup but it works. At least you can use all 3 pieces separately if needed and it wasn't made for just one purpose. The bottles and retractable clips are individually packaged and then those items plus the carabiner clips are all packaged into a zip lock bag.\nMulti use silicone bottles with multi purpose accessories\nReusable Ear Swab and Last Swab Washable Silicone Swabs Double Tipped Silicone Cotton Buds with Portable Makeup Mirror - Green\nJAOYU\n{'Product Dimensions': '3.2 x 3.2 x 0.39 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'UPC': '739232135937'}\nI like the concept of these reusable silicone Q-tips, I didn't know it existed until I stumbled across this set. My set came with everything that's pictured in the description. The whole case is silicone but I wish it had a normal hinge so that it can stay open but it's just a thin piece of silicone. Yes, there is a kick stand that you can pull out to keep the mirror/lid open at an angle. I don't plan on using this like a makeup compact so that doesn't really bother me. The variety of tips that come with this set is nice and you get extra tips. It does take a little bit of effort to pull the tip off (which is a good thing). I'm not sure what the tweezers are for, maybe it's to pull the tips off the stick but I found it was just easier to pull it off with my fingers. The brush that comes in this set seems a bit large for cleaning parts that are tiny. A smaller brush with shorter and more rigid bristles would've been better. They are easy<br />enough to clean with soap and water. Just be sure to dry everything completely before putting it back in the case. These should be readily available in stores so we can get away from using disposable Q-tips.\nEnvironmentally friendly reusable & washable Q-tips\nPortable Travel Bottles Set,Leak Proof Squeezable Silicon Tubes Travel Size Toiletries Containers,TSA Approved Refillable Travel Accessories for Shampoo Liquids (1.3Oz,4 Pack)\nZAYOR\n{'Brand': 'ZAYOR', 'Material': 'Silicone', 'Capacity': '1.3 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '4', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '1.97 x 1.38 x 3.54 inches', 'Product Dimensions': '1.97 x 1.38 x 3.54 inches; 4.02 Ounces', 'UPC': '729993071100'}\nThis is a set of 4 small silicone travel bottles.

I thought I had a defective one since nothing was coming out. The plunger on the syringe doesn't press down all the way as one would expect, it goes down less than using a click pen. There's no way to open the thing up to get the gel out either. I almost gave up but I kept clicking and finally the gel was coming out. I applied it to a pimple 3 nights in a row but unfortunately nothing happened. I'm not sure if I didn't have the right type of pimple since it never came to a head and it's more cystic. I'll try again on a different type of pimple. The gel is best used at bedtime because it leaves a slightly sticky feeling on the pimple (instructions say to apply it directly to the pimple and not to spread it). Each night that I used it, I had to continuously press the plunger only for a tiny amount of gel to come out. Who knows how much product is actually in the tube.\nCute packaging but not the easiest to get the gel out\nLXIANGN Colorful Dappen Dish Glass Crown Candle Holder Mini Nail Art Dappen Dish 2 In 1 Crystal Dipping Bowls for Nails (Colorful)\nLXIANGN\n{'Product Dimensions': '3.03 x 1.97 x 2.24 inches; 5.33 Ounces'}\nThis is a cute iridescent colored glass crown shaped dish.
