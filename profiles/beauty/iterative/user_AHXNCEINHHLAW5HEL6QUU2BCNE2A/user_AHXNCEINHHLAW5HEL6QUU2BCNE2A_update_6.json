However, when I received it, I realized I don't have time to just lay down and relax for 15 mins!  (unless I was in a tanning bed, and I might be able to encorporate this into that time).  So, I gave this to a girlfriend of mine at work because she had been talking about wanting one.  She's had it for a little over a month and she's loving it.  I have been able to tell a difference in the texture of her skin.  She says it's softened and tightened and is diminishing some of the fine lines around her eyes.  She has some pimples pop up now and again but since she's been using this she hasn't had a breakout.<br />The equipment itself is very good quality and well made.  It has multiple colors for different effects.  It's very nice that it comes with it's own dermaroller.  She hasn't had any trouble with it, but I'm glad to see from other reviews that customer service is fantastic.<br />She told me to give 5 stars and absolutely recommend this.  Just think seriously if you are going to have the time to lay down and do nothing for at least 15 Mins daily.\nReview Title: Great product, works well!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "HAIRCUBE Natural Looking Short Blonde Wigs Pixie Cut Dark Root Ombre Blonde Wigs with Bangs Wigs for Women\nHAIRCUBE\n{'Material': 'Memory Fiber', 'Hair Type': 'Pixie Cut', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Brand': 'HAIRCUBE', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '10.4 x 7.8 x 3.2 inches; 3.99 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'aswig61-wm3045'}\nI love this!  This is the best short wig I've come across. It looks so real, especially the coloring and the quality of the hair.  Straight from the box it was ready to go on and wear.  You can style it many different ways.  It has 3 clips inside and there is enough room to hide my long hair.  I absolutely recommend it.\nLove! So natural looking, easy to style, great color\nMagnetic Eyelashes with Eyeliner Kit - 8 Pairs Invisible Magnetic False Eyelashes and Black Eyeliner of 2 Tubes Sets, Auchois 3D Reusable Natural Look Fake Eyelashes, Faux Mink Lashes Pack\nAUCHOIS\n{'Brand': 'AUCHOIS', 'Material': 'Faux Mink', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '9.2 x 5.7 x 0.78 inches', 'Material Feature': 'Latex Free', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Product Dimensions': '9.2 x 5.7 x 0.78 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'BME001'}\nThis is a nice set for all the options you get and most look really natural.  They're decent pairs for the price.  I just don't prefer this thin magnetic strip, I like having individual magnets on the lashes.  The thin strip is not as strong magnetically and you can't re-use these as often because it's difficult to keep the strip clean. The liner is basic like all the other kits have, I have found a different liner I really like that I use with all my lashes.  Personally I wouldn't order these again.\nNatural looking, thin magnetic strip\nHair Extensions Tape in Human Hair Moresoo Real Hair Extensions Glue in Seamless Double Sided Tape 18inch Human Tape in Hair Extensions 20Pieces 50Grams Blonde Hair Extensions\nMoresoo\n{'Brand': 'Moresoo', 'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Extension Length': '18 Inches', 'Hair Type': 'Normal', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '7.4 x 4 x 1.5 inches; 11.22 Ounces'}\nI'm really happy with these extensions, the hair is beautiful.  The color is fantastic and really matches mine.  Each weft has good thickness and this really feels like a full 50g.  It added a lot of fullness to my hair.  The tape is great, they've stayed in for many washes now.  I don't think I've had to replace any of them yet.  The hair has stayed healthy looking and feeling.  I will definitely order these again.  I recommend.\nGorgeous hair color & quality\nRichsky Magnetic with Eyeliner Kit,5 Pairs Natural Looking Magnetic lashes,Easy to Wear False Eyelash Set,No Glue Needed and Waterproof.\nRICHSKY\n{'Brand': 'RICHSKY', 'Material': 'Cotton', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '5.75 x 0.01 x 0.59 inches', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Product Dimensions': '5.75 x 0.01 x 0.59 inches; 2.89 Ounces', 'UPC': '724976709162'}\nI actually got these for a friend who had never tried magnetic lashes and always compliments mine.  I hadn't tried this particular set before either.  Unfortunately she really didn't like these and it made her go back to glue on lashes.  The magnets weren't very strong and the band that has the magnets was very stiff and difficult to get them to apply quickly.  The styles are very unnatural looking and so are the lashes, very shiny.  The liner I also very basic.  I would pass on this set and spend the money for a good pair.\nToo stiff, very faux\nWALRUS OIL - Preserver Tattoo Balm, 2oz, Nourishes Skin & Enhances Ink, 100% Vegan, Unscented\nWalrus Oil\n{'Brand': 'Walrus Oil', 'Water Resistance Level': 'Water Resistant', 'Number of Pieces': '2', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '3 x 3 x 1 inches; 2.01 Ounces', 'UPC': '658294277020'}\nI'm not really impressed with this.  I have a few tattoos and I didn't notice much difference except when you very first put this on.  It is rather Greasy and leaves that on your skin.  Not something I will get much use out of and I personally wouldn't recommend it.\nGreasy & didn't notice much difference\nDarnlight LED Light Therapy Mask - 7 Color LED Face Mask Light Therapy Facial Treatment - Blue & Red Light Therapy Mask for Acne Fine Lines Wrinkles & Rosacea\nDarnlight\n{'Brand': 'Darnlight', 'Item Form': 'Pads', 'Skin Type': 'Acne Prone', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '7', 'Product Dimensions': '7.4 x 7.9 x 5.7 inches; 3.57 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'D-1'}\nI love the idea of having this product available to use at a reasonable price.
