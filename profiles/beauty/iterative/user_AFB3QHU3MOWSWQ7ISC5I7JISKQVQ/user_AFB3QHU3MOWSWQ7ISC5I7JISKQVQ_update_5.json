I wear makeup every day and use cotton rounds to remove my makeup which can cost a lot overly time. I switched to these reusable wash pads and not only are they easy to hold because of the hook but they remove my makeup without being harsh on my skin. The wash bag makes it easy to just throw in the washer and protect the quality of the cloths just as I would use for delicates.\nDurable pads for everyday makeup use\nAmtidy Solid Color Vintage Modern Style Elastic Women's Rhinestone Crown Tiara, Bridal Wedding Dance Party Birthday Party Women's Headband Tiara, Queen Tiara With Comb\uff08Silver\uff09\nAmtidy\n{'Material': 'Rubber', 'Fabric Type': 'Elastic', 'Brand': 'Amtidy', 'Item Form': 'Spiral', 'Unit Count': '10.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '11.65 x 5.63 x 3.23 inches; 12.03 Ounces', 'UPC': '782931993780'}\nI love the variety of colors that can fit through the whole year. Living in Florida is very humid most of the year so having headbands to keep your hair away from your face but still adds style to your outfits. They are double lined and super stretchy. I love the vibrant colors and the warmer tones.\nComfortable + great for all seasons\nBEYELIAN Lash Shampoo with Brush Eyelash Extension Cleanser Eyelid Foaming Cleanser Lash Foam Shampoo Makeup Remover - For Home & Salon Use\nBEYELIAN\n{'Package Dimensions': '6.5 x 1.7 x 1.1 inches; 1.94 Ounces'}\nI\u2019ve recently had lash extensions put on for the first time and it\u2019s been an adjustment to care for them and find a product that doesn\u2019t pull lashes while cleaning my makeup off. This is perfect for traveling or carrying in your purse! I highly recommend this because it doesn\u2019t irritate my sensitive eyes and wipes away my makeup after one wash!\nGood lash cleaner!\nFacial Skincare,Cucumber Essence Hydrating Moisturizing Revitalizing Hydration Fruit Extract Deep Cleaning Facial Skincare Sheet for All Skin Type Care, 35ml/1.18oz, Pack of 5\nPalNour\n{}\nSmells good and works wonders on your skin!<br /><br />Having combination skin I lack moisture in my t-zone so this mask really helped to rehydrate my skin!\nHydrating!\nDr.Althea Multi-Action Infusion Serum - 56 Packets of Light weight Gel Serum\nDr.Althea\n{'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'Dr.Althea', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Protein,Calluses,Anti-aging', 'Package Dimensions': '6.8 x 5.7 x 1.3 inches; 5.61 Ounces'}\nI\u2019ve been carrying these individually packaged serums for after a workout.
