I wear makeup every day and use cotton rounds to remove my makeup which can cost a lot overly time. I switched to these reusable wash pads and not only are they easy to hold because of the hook but they remove my makeup without being harsh on my skin. The wash bag makes it easy to just throw in the washer and protect the quality of the cloths just as I would use for delicates.\nDurable pads for everyday makeup use\nAmtidy Solid Color Vintage Modern Style Elastic Women's Rhinestone Crown Tiara, Bridal Wedding Dance Party Birthday Party Women's Headband Tiara, Queen Tiara With Comb\uff08Silver\uff09\nAmtidy\n{'Material': 'Rubber', 'Fabric Type': 'Elastic', 'Brand': 'Amtidy', 'Item Form': 'Spiral', 'Unit Count': '10.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '11.65 x 5.63 x 3.23 inches; 12.03 Ounces', 'UPC': '782931993780'}\nI love the variety of colors that can fit through the whole year. Living in Florida is very humid most of the year so having headbands to keep your hair away from your face but still adds style to your outfits. They are double lined and super stretchy.
