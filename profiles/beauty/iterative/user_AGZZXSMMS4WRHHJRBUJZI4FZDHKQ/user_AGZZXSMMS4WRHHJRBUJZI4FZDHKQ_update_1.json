All my razors were expensive, they were all the best in the bunch.  This is the best by far.<br /><br />This razor shaves close, I have never felt my skin so smooth except when I used to use a blade.  It conforms to your skin, even my neck comes out smooth (about 4 minutes to completely shave smooth, or I'll usually shave for less than a minute and get a shave that lasts until I get home from work).  It has a timer that not only tells you exactly how many minutes of battery are left, but it also tells you how many minutes you shaved for (which comes in handy more than I thought it would).  The best feature is that you can pop the top up and rinse it in water!  My brauns cleaned with refil cartridges that were hard to find and expensive and a hassel; whereas my old Norelco cleaned with a brush and never got really clean.  This one cleans easily and quickly, and even beeps to tell you when to clean it!  Also, this razor doesn't give me razor burn like my Brauns did!!<br /><br />If you are a first time shaver, or an expierenced shaver looking for a better shave from an electric razor, this is the one for you!  I will never buy any other brand of razor again and I'll probably have this one for years to come...\nReview Title: The best razor ever!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
