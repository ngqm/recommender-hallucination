  "reference_summary": "Norelco 8894XL\nNorelco\n['Product Description', 'James Bond\\'s razor of choice, this rechargeable Norelco Spectra shaver features a sleek design with 3 individually floating heads adjustable to your skin type.The selector dial adjusts spring and pressure of floating heads with 9 settings for sensitive to normal skin. A 2-stage cutting action with lift and cut technology uses slots to cut long hairs and holes to shave stubble smooth, while the full-width pop-up trimmer handles the detail work. The integrated LED display shows shaving minutes remaining, plus cleaning and head replacement indicators. A 1-hour full-charge gives you 100 shaving minutes, while the 2-minute power-charge provides a 3-minute shave. When you\\'re done, simply rinse clean. Includes deluxe leather pouch, stand, recharging power cord, cleaning brush and travel pouch. Automatic worldwide voltage adjustment. No. 8894XL. Imported. 5-1/2L\".', 'Amazon.com', \"Licensed to shave closely and painlessly, this cord/cordless electric shaver is designated Norelco's James Bond model not only because it's high-tech but also because its heads can be adjusted to suit the sensitivity of 00-anyone's skin. The shaver has a comfort-control dial that varies the spring and pressure of the three floating heads through nine settings. Roger Moore might opt for a gentle setting, while Sean Connery surely would choose a firmer setting--and novices to grizzled veterans can please their faces as well. For this model, Norelco has also improved the lift and cut, below-skin shaving technology of its two-stage cutting system, which provides slots for longer hairs and holes for stubble while the floating heads are adjusting individually to facial contours. A full-width trimmer pops up for neat work on sideburns and mustaches.\", 'More tech-chic comes in the form of a polymer LED display that tells how many minutes of shaving time remain when the shaver is operating cordless on its lithium-ion battery. The LED display also warns when the heads need cleaning (all it takes is a rinsing under running water) or replacing (replacement heads available separately). An audible alarm sounds when the shaver requires recharging on its storage stand. A six-minute quick charge is good for a single shave, and a one-hour full charge provides 100 minutes of cordless shaving. The shaver fits the hand beautifully and goes on the road stylishly in its leather travel pouch, while automatically adjusting to worldwide voltage variances. It carries a 60-day, full-satisfaction, money-back guarantee and a two-year warranty against defects.', '--Fred Brack']\n{'Brand': 'Norelco', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Included Components': 'Attachment, Charger', 'Item Weight': '1.25 Pounds', 'Head Type': 'Rotary', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'Yes', 'Product Dimensions': '6.69 x 4.02 x 10.53 inches; 1.25 Pounds', 'Item model number': '8894XL', 'Manufacturer': 'Norelco'}\nI had a Norelco years ago, then I went through three Brauns (the micro-foil ones that a straight instead of having three circular blades like this one).  All my razors were expensive, they were all the best in the bunch.  This is the best by far.<br /><br />This razor shaves close, I have never felt my skin so smooth except when I used to use a blade.  It conforms to your skin, even my neck comes out smooth (about 4 minutes to completely shave smooth, or I'll usually shave for less than a minute and get a shave that lasts until I get home from work).  It has a timer that not only tells you exactly how many minutes of battery are left, but it also tells you how many minutes you shaved for (which comes in handy more than I thought it would).  The best feature is that you can pop the top up and rinse it in water!  My brauns cleaned with refil cartridges that were hard to find and expensive and a hassel; whereas my old Norelco cleaned with a brush and never got really clean.  This one cleans easily and quickly, and even beeps to tell you when to clean it!  Also, this razor doesn't give me razor burn like my Brauns did!!<br /><br />If you are a first time shaver, or an expierenced shaver looking for a better shave from an electric razor, this is the one for you!  I will never buy any other brand of razor again and I'll probably have this one for years to come...\nThe best razor ever!\nPARWIN Wet & Dry Flat Iron 1 1/4 Inch Hair Straightener for Women with Tourmaline Ceramic and PTC Heating, Professional Straightening Iron, Black\nNuonove\n{'Shape': 'Flat', 'Brand': 'Nuonove', 'Hair Type': 'Coarse, Color Treated, Fine, Normal, Damaged', 'Material': 'Ceramic', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '13.86 x 3.82 x 1.93 inches; 1.23 Pounds', 'UPC': '605826620632', 'Manufacturer': 'Parwin'}\nThis did a good job with my hair.
