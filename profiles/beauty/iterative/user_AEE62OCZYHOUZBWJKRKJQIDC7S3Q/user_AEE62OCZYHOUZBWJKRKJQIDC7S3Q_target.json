A pocket size beard brush shouldn\u2019t be impressive, but it really is. If this was plastic, it wouldn\u2019t work. If it was a soft plastic, it wouldn\u2019t help shape a straggly beard, or mustache. If it was hard plastic, it would probably snap. Instead, it is an excellent stainless steel, with enough strength to work perfectly, but is is small enough that you wouldn\u2019t notice any extra weight on your keychain. I have to give the person that designed this a lot of credit. What a practical, and brilliant idea. Completely awesome!\nReview Title: Brilliant!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "YinMer Lavish Lash \u2013 Eyelash Growth Enhancer & Brow Serum with Biotin & Natural Growth Peptides for Long, Thick Lashes and Eyebrows\nOUZIFISH\n{'Package Dimensions': '6.61 x 2.8 x 1.26 inches; 3.53 Ounces'}\nI love the idea of this product , have always been looking for something to promote growth in the eyelash/eyebrow area. So far in the process, so good. it is easy to apply and has very nice packaging.\nCool product !\nDip Powder Nail Starter Kit 8 Colors Acrylic Dipping Powder System for French Nail Manicure Nail Art Set, Portable Kit for Trave, No LED Nail Lamp Needed\u2026\nColorfairy\n{'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'Colorfairy', 'Included Components': 'Dip Powder, Nail Lamp', 'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Package Dimensions': '5.98 x 4.17 x 2.72 inches; 9.77 Ounces'}\nThis set makes doing your own nails creative and fun, I love this kind of polish , it is very enjoyable to work with . Dip powder is a great and innovative trend .\nLovely set\nMagnetic Eyelashes With Eyeliner Kit,10 Pairs Eyelashes Magnetic 2021 Upgraded 3D Fluffy Natural Waterproof Reusable Fox Eyes Kit False Eyelashes And Eyeliner.\nAlyxxndra\n{'Color': 'Black', 'Brand': 'Alyxxndra', 'Material': 'Faux Mink', 'Material Feature': 'Disposable', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Package Dimensions': '9.21 x 6.1 x 0.71 inches; 2.89 Ounces', 'UPC': '788402874992', 'Manufacturer': 'Alyxxndra'}\nI am a huge fan of magnetic lashes in general , and these are great . These are an ideal solution to the lash dilemma many of us face. Mascara is a process to apply and still doesn\u2019t give the dramatic results so many of us desire, regular false lashes have sticky glue to deal with and lead us to lose real lashes too. Then extensions are such a commitment. Magnetic lashes , like these especially are the solution.\nBig fan\n8PCS Headbands for Women Twist Knotted Boho Stretchy Hair Bands for Girls Criss Cross Turban Plain Headwrap Yoga Workout Vintage Hair Accessories, Solid Color\uff0cNo Slip\nMOLANLY\n{'Color': 'Assorted', 'Material': 'Cloth', 'Fabric Type': 'Cloth', 'Brand': 'MOLANLY', 'Size': 'One size fits most', 'Package Dimensions': '10.43 x 6.42 x 2.09 inches; 6.74 Ounces'}\nJust by chance, I got these at the same time as a set of colored scrunchies. Obviously you know when you would wear these, and like the other set of scrunchies, this has a nice variety of colors, so coordinating with your outfit has never been easier. I don\u2019t think I will ever just buy a set of dark neutral colors again. I would rather have the option to match my outfit, and also my mood! Highly recommended!\nPerfect set of many different colors\nMagnetic Eyelashes with Eyeliner, 10 Pairs Magnetic Eyelash Natural Look, Upgraded 3D False Lashes Magnetic Eyeliner Kit with Tweezers and 2pcs Magnetic Eyeliner, Reusable, No Glue\nMussozy\n{'Brand': 'Mussozy', 'Material': 'Silk', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '9 x 6 x 0.6 inches', 'Material Feature': 'Cruelty Free', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Product Dimensions': '9 x 6 x 0.6 inches; 2.89 Ounces', 'UPC': '766779448732'}\nI have been using magnetic lashes for about a year, and I never thought they would look, and work so well. Once you apply the liquid magnetic base, you can try different lashes, to see which pair matches up with your makeup, and wardrobe. This might sound like extra work, but that is the whole point of these. They are extremely easy to apply, and swap. They really look great, and I finally gave them a try, and wear them all the time.\nReally great set of magnetic eyelashes\nAJOKE 10 pcs Soft Makeup Sponge set Blender,Flawless Beauty Sponge Blenders for Dry & Wet Use,for Cream,Powder and Liquid,Multi-colored Makeup Sponges\nAJOKE\n{'Brand': 'AJOKE', 'Color': 'Ivory', 'Material': 'Sponge,Foam', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Makeup Sponge', 'Specific Uses For Product': 'Blender', 'Package Dimensions': '7.95 x 5.12 x 1.73 inches; 5.61 Ounces'}\nExcellent blenders, really are easy to use, and allows you to apply foundations, etc. with a perfect touch. Makeup goes on perfectly, and you can apply it exactly as you prefer. After use, they rinse out perfectly, so this set of ten should last a very long time. Highly recommended!\nPerfect blenders and applicators\nMagnetic Eyelashes with Eyeliner Kit, SOTICA 10Pairs Magnetic Lashes Natural False Eyelashes with Tweezers DIY Eyelash Extension Kit Authentic Eyelash Extension Look Easy to Use No Glue Needed\u2026\nSotica\n{'Package Dimensions': '9.26 x 5.95 x 0.83 inches; 2.89 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'CS-JM-8'}\nI have become a huge fan of magnetic eyelashes. The easy application is so great, it is hard to believe, until you try it yourself. It is as easy as applying eyeliner. The liquid liner has a the base in it that the magnetic lashes stick to. It doesn\u2019t sound like that would work as well as it should, but it does. The best thing after the easy application is you can try different types of lashes, included in the set, to see which one is perfect for your makeup and wardrobe choice. I have friends that didn\u2019t believe how great these are until I let them see them in person. I have tried many different brands, and this is an excellent choice if you are going to try them for the first time, or you have been using them already. Highly recommended!\nAwesome magnetic lashes, easy to use, and look great!\nBeard Comb Or Fine Tooth Mustache Pocket Stainless Steel Metal Powder Coated Black Keychain Comb For Men - 3.25 x 1 Inches by Death Grip\nTHE VINTAGE GROOMING CO.\n{'Material': 'Metal', 'Brand': 'Death Grip', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Color': 'Black', 'Size': 'Small', 'Product Dimensions': '3 x 1 x 0.1 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Department': 'mens', 'UPC': '710702883497', 'Manufacturer': 'The Vintage Grooming Co'}\nExtremely well made, and well designed.
