However, once she did try it, she liked it. She said that it left her<br />skin softer and well hydrated. It doesn\u2019t have a bad smell, which she was concerned about, and<br />the consistency was smooth and not sticky. She has combination skin, so this cream will be<br />good during the winter months when her skin is dryer. However, she said she will use a lighter<br />cream for the warmer months.

She suffers from allergies, so her skin is dry and sensitive during those times.  This face mask contains clean ingredients, and is perfect to get someone with allergies and sensitive through harsher weather months.\ncontains clean ingredients\nHylunia Facial Day Lotion - 1.7 fl oz - Anti-Aging for Wrinkles - with Shea Butter, Hyaluronic Acid Serum, Zinc - Natural Vegan Moisturizer - Rapid Skin Repair\nHylunia\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.81 x 4.8 x 1.81 inches; 4.16 Ounces', 'UPC': '185449000221', 'Manufacturer': 'Hylunia'}\nHylunia Facial Day Lotion - 1.7 fl oz - Anti-Aging for Wrinkles - with Shea Butter, Hyaluronic Acid Serum, Zinc - Natural Vegan Moisturizer - Rapid Skin Repair<br /><br />My wife has recently started using Hylunia skin care products.  So when she saw their Day Lotion, she thought she would give it a try.  She is very happy with the results of this product. She said it plumps and smooths her skin and absorbs really well.  It goes on well under her makeup and does not cause her foundation to streak.  Even though it is a little pricey at around $67.00, it is definitely a product worth paying for.\nPlumps and smooths skin\nMD Complete Bright & Healthy Citrus-C Refresh Retinol + Vitamin C Multitasking Treatment\nMD Complete by Dr. Brian Zelickson\n{'Brand': 'MD Complete by Dr. Brian Zelickson', 'Scent': 'Citrus', 'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Unit Count': '1.0 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Product Dimensions': '2 x 1.25 x 4.5 inches; 2.26 Ounces', 'UPC': '850458005719'}\nMD Complete Bright & Healthy Citrus-C Refresh Retinol + Vitamin C Multitasking Treatment<br /><br />My wife got this multitasking treatment of vitamin C and retinol, to combat uneven skin texture and fine lines.  She used it for a while and afterward said that at least for her skin, she didn\u2019t notice that much of a difference.  There was some brightening, but not effective enough as some other skincare products that she\u2019s tried.  Overall, it may be good with those with minor skin issues, or maintaining good skin, but not if there\u2019s a skin issue that is trying to be reversed.\nNot effective enough as some other skincare products\nFacial Cleansing Brush, Sonic Ultrasonic Vibration Facial Brush, Red-light for Deep Cleaning, Discharge Makeup, Gentle Exfoliating, Blackhead Removing, Massaging with 3 Adjustable Modes and Speeds\nLKV\n{'Material': 'Silicone', 'Brand': 'LKV', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Product Care Instructions': 'Wash with Warm Water', 'Number of Speeds': '3', 'Package Dimensions': '4.7 x 3.1 x 1.7 inches; 3.99 Ounces', 'UPC': '193499829655', 'Manufacturer': 'LKV'}\nFacial Cleansing Brush, Sonic Ultrasonic<br />Vibration Facial Brush, Red-light for Deep<br />Cleaning, Discharge Makeup, Gentle<br />Exfoliating, Blackhead Removing, Massaging<br />with 3 Adjustable Modes and Speeds<br /><br />My wife has used many facial cleansing tools in the past, but wanted something with a little<br />more portability. After reading more about this brush, she liked the features it mentioned and<br />decided to try it. It arrived well packaged, and undamaged. It came with instructions and a usb<br />cord. After trying it for a while, my wife said she really likes the shape and the way it feels in her<br />hand. It is easy to maneuver around the contours of her face and she feels her face is getting<br />cleaner after using it. Although she likes the red light feature, it is not something she uses<br />regularly. She does like that it is small enough to carry in her purse. However, one of the main<br />reasons she wanted this is because of the waterproof capability. But with the usb port open, she<br />really does not feel comfortable using it in the shower. That was a disappointment. Also, it<br />does not come with a carrying case or bag, which would have been nice. I am giving it four<br />stars because the features we are left with are good ones and my wife feels that her skin has<br />improved since using this brush.\nsays water proof but has an open usb port\nFacial Steamer with Portable Mini Cold Facial Mister, Face Steamer for Facial Deep Cleaning, Nano Ionic Face Hot Steaming Machine for Home Facials Personal Moisturizing Skincare Beauty\nROSEFEAST\n{'Material': 'Cotton', 'Brand': 'ROSEFEAST', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Product Benefits': 'Cold,Moisturizing,Relaxing,Clean,Aromatherapy', 'Package Dimensions': '8.31 x 7.87 x 4.57 inches; 1.57 Pounds', 'Manufacturer': 'ROSEFEAST'}\nFacial Steamer Nano Hot Steam Face Spa<br />Device Ionic Face Steaming Machine for<br />Home Facials Personal Moisturizing<br />Humidifier Vaporizer for Skincare Beauty<br /><br />My wife has always wanted a facial steamer but didn\u2019t want to spend too much money. So,<br />when I saw this one, I thought it was a good deal. So far, she really likes it. She says that the<br />water heats up quickly and the steam coming out is smooth and doesn\u2019t spit out any water. The<br />little cool mist steamer will come in handy on hot days, which will be coming up soon here in<br />California. Even though this comes with some acne removing tools, my wife has not used those<br />so cannot comment on whether they are effective or not. The steamer and mister, however, has<br />been something she really loves.
