She used it for a while and afterward said that at least for her skin, she didn\u2019t notice that much of a difference.  There was some brightening, but not effective enough as some other skincare products that she\u2019s tried.  Overall, it may be good with those with minor skin issues, or maintaining good skin, but not if there\u2019s a skin issue that is trying to be reversed.\nReview Title: Not effective enough as some other skincare products\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
