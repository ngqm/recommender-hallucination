The pump is easy to use and my skin feels great after using it. There is also a lot of product in this, so I will be getting a lot of use out of it.<br /><br />This came arrived and the safety cap was cracked, so it leaked out of the top and was a bit of a mess to clean up. There wasn't too much of product loss, but it still was annoying to clean up.\nReview Title: Smells Great!\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I was so surprised when I took these out of the package. They are very sturdy and look amazing. I wasn't expecting them to be as heavy as they were, but they really are pieces of art. There were a few loose hairs, but once those fell out (as most brushes do), they worked great. The carrying case they came with was also very cute. These are perfect for any Harry Potter fan. I am still so happy with how great these are.\nQuality!\nMaya Mari Hydrating Argan Oil Shampoo \u2013 Rich in Nutrients, Restores Moisture & Shine, 32 oz\nMAYA MARI\n{'Brand': 'MAYA MARI', 'Hair Type': 'Damaged,Curly Hair', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material Type Free': 'Paraben Free', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating', 'Product Dimensions': '3.25 x 3.25 x 10 inches; 1.94 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'MMAROILSP', 'UPC': '850004068267'}\nI love the pump that this shampoo comes with.

I feel like I can use this everyday without drying out my hair. The shampoo smells really nice and I love the scent - it's not too strong. I had to use maybe two pumps to fully cover my hair while showering.\nLove the pump\nButterfly Nail Art Decals Water Transfer Stickers, 22 Sheets Butterfly Nail Sticker DIY Nail Decals, 2 Set Butterfly Nail Glitter Holographic Stickers Reflected Butterfly Designs for Nails Supply\nB bangcool\n{'Surface Recommendation nail': '', '': 'Unit Count 1.00 Count', 'Shape Irregular': '', 'Brand': 'B bangcool', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '6.3 x 3.54 x 1.57 inches', 'Theme': 'Butterfly', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Reusability': 'Single Use', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Pattern': 'Insects', 'Product Dimensions': '6.3 x 3.54 x 1.57 inches; 5.61 Ounces'}\nOverall these stickers are very cute, and they stick on the nail easily. I feel like some of the stickers are very blurry, and it's hard to see what exactly the details are, which is a bit disappointing.
