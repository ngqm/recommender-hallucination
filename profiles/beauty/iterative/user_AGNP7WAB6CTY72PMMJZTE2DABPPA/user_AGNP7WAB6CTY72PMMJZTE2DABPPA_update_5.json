The smell isn't too overwhelming, and honestly I could use a bit more smell. It foams up really well, and glides on the skin. You can use not a lot and still cover your entire body. It washes off nicely, and you don't really smell it afterward. I have been using this for about a week and the container hasn't rusted or anything either, which is something that tends to happen with products in a metal container. I wish there was a way to know how much was left, so I know when to get a new one, but overall I am happy with this body wash.\nReview Title: Smells Great, Good Foaming\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I was so surprised when I took these out of the package. They are very sturdy and look amazing. I wasn't expecting them to be as heavy as they were, but they really are pieces of art. There were a few loose hairs, but once those fell out (as most brushes do), they worked great. The carrying case they came with was also very cute. These are perfect for any Harry Potter fan. I am still so happy with how great these are.\nQuality!\nMaya Mari Hydrating Argan Oil Shampoo \u2013 Rich in Nutrients, Restores Moisture & Shine, 32 oz\nMAYA MARI\n{'Brand': 'MAYA MARI', 'Hair Type': 'Damaged,Curly Hair', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material Type Free': 'Paraben Free', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating', 'Product Dimensions': '3.25 x 3.25 x 10 inches; 1.94 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'MMAROILSP', 'UPC': '850004068267'}\nI love the pump that this shampoo comes with. It's great to easily add the product to your hand while showering. This is also a nice big size for the price.<br /><br />The shampoo is a bit watery, but it does lather very nicely and my hair feels smooth and silky after using it. I feel like I can use this everyday without drying out my hair. The shampoo smells really nice and I love the scent - it's not too strong. I had to use maybe two pumps to fully cover my hair while showering.\nLove the pump\nButterfly Nail Art Decals Water Transfer Stickers, 22 Sheets Butterfly Nail Sticker DIY Nail Decals, 2 Set Butterfly Nail Glitter Holographic Stickers Reflected Butterfly Designs for Nails Supply\nB bangcool\n{'Surface Recommendation nail': '', '': 'Unit Count 1.00 Count', 'Shape Irregular': '', 'Brand': 'B bangcool', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '6.3 x 3.54 x 1.57 inches', 'Theme': 'Butterfly', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Reusability': 'Single Use', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Pattern': 'Insects', 'Product Dimensions': '6.3 x 3.54 x 1.57 inches; 5.61 Ounces'}\nOverall these stickers are very cute, and they stick on the nail easily. I feel like some of the stickers are very blurry, and it's hard to see what exactly the details are, which is a bit disappointing. The sticker sets also come from different brands, and they have a few different wrappers for each sticker.\nVery cute, some stickers are \"blurry\"\nBouquet Garni Body Shower White Musk - Unique Fragrance Decanting Engineering Method gives Long Lasting Rich Fragrance - Gentle and Mild Cleansing Scented Body Wash with Natural Surfactant 17.85 Fl Oz\nBouquet Garni\n{'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Skin Type': 'All, Dry', 'Brand': 'Bouquet Garni', 'Scent': 'Garni', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '8.23 x 6.34 x 3.66 inches; 1.34 Pounds'}\nThis body wash is very potent and smells great. The pump is easy to use and my skin feels great after using it. There is also a lot of product in this, so I will be getting a lot of use out of it.<br /><br />This came arrived and the safety cap was cracked, so it leaked out of the top and was a bit of a mess to clean up. There wasn't too much of product loss, but it still was annoying to clean up.\nSmells Great!\nKneipp Shower Foam Goodbye Stress Water Mint & Rosemary 6.81 Oz\nKneipp\n{'Item Form': 'Foam', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'Kneipp', 'Scent': 'Rosemary', 'Material Feature': 'Plant Based', 'Package Dimensions': '8.2 x 2.5 x 2.5 inches; 9.59 Ounces'}\nI have been enjoying this body foam.
