However, it doesn\u2019t work as well for me. The structured hold would last maybe 2,3 hours and that\u2019s it. But my hair is usually very, very uncooperative so it could also just be me.\nReview Title: Not for me\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "5 Pack Travel Paper Soaps, Hand Washing Soap Paper Sheets, Portable And Replaceable Pocket Hand Soap For Travel, Outdoor, Camping Hiking, 1.2m/47inch Length Each, 5 Color/Scents\nVEAFX\n{'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'VEAFX', 'Scent': 'Lavender, Tea Tree, Rose, Lemon, Lily', 'Material Feature': 'Biodegradable Warning', 'Package Dimensions': '4.8 x 3.7 x 0.6 inches; 1.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '782912939165'}\nThey\u2019re pocket sized and fit in my palm. So convenient for those public restroom trips that have run out of soap, just pop this out and you\u2019re good to go. Be careful with taking it out though, I thought it came out in sheets but it\u2019s more like foil paper where you cut the size you want. A small sheet should be good enough. It also has a subtle scent to it but it smells good. This is a must have product.\nSo convenient\n8inch Short Afro Puff Synthetic Hair Bun Chignon Hairpiece For Women Drawstring Ponytail Kinky Curly Updo Clip Hair Extensions(1BT-30#)\nBURHAIR\n{'Material': 'synthetic', 'Hair Type': 'Curly, Coily', 'Brand': 'BURHAIR', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'UPC': '782947259672'}\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of the way it was sewn, but no matter what I do, I can\u2019t get this to look right. The base of it always sticks out straight no matter how I situate it. Maybe it\u2019s just me? I gave 3 stars because the hair is soft and the color is ok. I wish there was more black in it though instead of just color.\nNot a fan.\nRAREKIND Fade Matte Lipstick by Amorepacific - 10 Colors, Cruelty-Free Nourishing Lip Stick, Velvety-smooth, Long-Lasting Moisturizing Lipstick - 3.2g Maple Road\nRAREKIND\n{'Package Dimensions': '3.3 x 0.9 x 0.9 inches; 0.95 Ounces'}\nI like how the matte of this (I got maple road) came out on me. I only put a single layer and the color came out great. The color became darker once a couple minutes passed. There is easy transference of this and you\u2019ll definitely need a touch up after eating and drinking. Liked the way it smoothed on and how I barely felt it on.\nLovely color\nUnny Club Black Square Lipstick (Libidream) | matte lipstick\nUNNY CLUB\n{'Brand': 'UNNY CLUB', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Item Form': 'Stick', 'Finish Type': 'Matte', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '3.94 x 188.98 x 35.43 inches; 1.13 Ounces'}\nI like the color or this, but that\u2019s pretty much it. It didn\u2019t come out matte and the color came out way brighter than expected since it was on the darker side (I chose M02). Like most lipsticks, I expected it to transfer and it did, a lot. It practically came all the way off after minor eating. Maybe the color and matte would actually come out on a lighter or fair-skinned person.\nEh.\nNATWAG Reusable Update Makeup Remover Cloths for Sensitive Skin - Microfiber Face Cloth Makeup Remover | Washable Round Makeup Remover Pads | Natural Facial Towels (2 Pads,2 Cloth) (Purple)\nNatwag\n{'Brand': 'Natwag', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive,All Skin Types', 'Material Feature': 'Reusable', 'Unit Count': '4.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Package Dimensions': '12.75 x 9.88 x 0.59 inches; 2.08 Ounces', 'UPC': '745103569978'}\nThis thing is amazing and the material so soft against my skin. It was able to get off my super stay lipstick that I usually need lipstick remover for. I use the small ones for my lips and eyes and the big one (it\u2019s actually a really big cloth) I use for my face.\nSo soft\nGel Nail Polish Set - TOEDO Fall Winter Nail Gel 6 Colors Tan Brown Colors Soak Off LED Nail Lamp Gel Polish Kit for Home DIY Manicure Nail Designs\nTOEDO\n{'Brand': 'TOEDO', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'gel', 'Finish Type': 'Matte,Glossy', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '1.56 FL Oz', 'Liquid Volume': '0.27 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '11.1 x 3.31 x 3.23 inches; 9.14 Ounces'}\nThe fall colors are nice. It days you just need 60 secs but when I did that the first time, they immediately peeled off on their own. So now I use 2 min for every coat and at least 5 min for the top coat and then they don\u2019t peel. It\u2019s a nice set just wish the colors would show on the outside of the bottle but it\u2019s fine.\nNice set\nCOSYMAY 20 inch Human Hair Wig for Women Long Black Wig with Bangs 4x4 Lace Closure Straight Wig Brazilian Virgin Hair Full Wig Average Size 1B\nCOSYMAY\n{'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Brand': 'COSYMAY', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '9.96 x 6.73 x 2.72 inches; 11.99 Ounces', 'UPC': '738627428647'}\nLightweight, most likely due to the relatively thin nature, and soft feeling. The bangs are a little too long for me though, they practically covered my eyes. But other than that, it\u2019s a pretty nice wig.\nSoft\nIMONCE Makeup Brush Set 7 Pcs Premium Synthetic Foundation Powder Concealer Eye shadow Blush Make Up Brushes Silver Glitter Handle With Travel Bag And Silicone 2 in 1 Cleaner & Holder (Glitter Silver)\nIMONCE\n{'Brand': 'IMONCE', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'For Concealing, For Blush, For Foundation', 'Material': 'Synthetic,Silicone', 'Number of Pieces': '7', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Ferrule Material': 'Aluminum', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '1.18 x 9.45 x 5.12 inches', 'Item Weight': '5.6 Ounces', 'Product Dimensions': '1.18 x 9.45 x 5.12 inches; 5.6 Ounces', 'UPC': '708200861338'}\nThe handles are soooo pretty. The bristles on the brushes are thick, feel soft, and hold onto the makeup pretty well. The holder/cleaner works well too. Keeps them upright and gets in between the bristles to clean. The carry pouch it comes with is pretty standard and has a cleanable interior.\nSo pretty\nGot2b Glued Spray Wax with 2-in-1 Dual Nozzle, 8 oz\nGot2B\n['The first dual-finish spray wax has officially hit the shelves!
