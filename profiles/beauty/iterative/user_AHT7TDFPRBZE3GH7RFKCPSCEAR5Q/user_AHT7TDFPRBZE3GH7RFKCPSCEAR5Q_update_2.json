The base of it always sticks out straight no matter how I situate it. Maybe it\u2019s just me? I gave 3 stars because the hair is soft and the color is ok. I wish there was more black in it though instead of just color.\nReview Title: Not a fan.\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

So convenient for those public restroom trips that have run out of soap, just pop this out and you\u2019re good to go. Be careful with taking it out though, I thought it came out in sheets but it\u2019s more like foil paper where you cut the size you want. A small sheet should be good enough. It also has a subtle scent to it but it smells good. This is a must have product.\nSo convenient\n8inch Short Afro Puff Synthetic Hair Bun Chignon Hairpiece For Women Drawstring Ponytail Kinky Curly Updo Clip Hair Extensions(1BT-30#)\nBURHAIR\n{'Material': 'synthetic', 'Hair Type': 'Curly, Coily', 'Brand': 'BURHAIR', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'UPC': '782947259672'}\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of the way it was sewn, but no matter what I do, I can\u2019t get this to look right.
