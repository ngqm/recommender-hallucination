It was able to get off my super stay lipstick that I usually need lipstick remover for. I use the small ones for my lips and eyes and the big one (it\u2019s actually a really big cloth) I use for my face.\nReview Title: So soft\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "5 Pack Travel Paper Soaps, Hand Washing Soap Paper Sheets, Portable And Replaceable Pocket Hand Soap For Travel, Outdoor, Camping Hiking, 1.2m/47inch Length Each, 5 Color/Scents\nVEAFX\n{'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'VEAFX', 'Scent': 'Lavender, Tea Tree, Rose, Lemon, Lily', 'Material Feature': 'Biodegradable Warning', 'Package Dimensions': '4.8 x 3.7 x 0.6 inches; 1.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '782912939165'}\nThey\u2019re pocket sized and fit in my palm. So convenient for those public restroom trips that have run out of soap, just pop this out and you\u2019re good to go. Be careful with taking it out though, I thought it came out in sheets but it\u2019s more like foil paper where you cut the size you want. A small sheet should be good enough. It also has a subtle scent to it but it smells good. This is a must have product.\nSo convenient\n8inch Short Afro Puff Synthetic Hair Bun Chignon Hairpiece For Women Drawstring Ponytail Kinky Curly Updo Clip Hair Extensions(1BT-30#)\nBURHAIR\n{'Material': 'synthetic', 'Hair Type': 'Curly, Coily', 'Brand': 'BURHAIR', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'UPC': '782947259672'}\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of the way it was sewn, but no matter what I do, I can\u2019t get this to look right. The base of it always sticks out straight no matter how I situate it. Maybe it\u2019s just me? I gave 3 stars because the hair is soft and the color is ok. I wish there was more black in it though instead of just color.\nNot a fan.\nRAREKIND Fade Matte Lipstick by Amorepacific - 10 Colors, Cruelty-Free Nourishing Lip Stick, Velvety-smooth, Long-Lasting Moisturizing Lipstick - 3.2g Maple Road\nRAREKIND\n{'Package Dimensions': '3.3 x 0.9 x 0.9 inches; 0.95 Ounces'}\nI like how the matte of this (I got maple road) came out on me. I only put a single layer and the color came out great. The color became darker once a couple minutes passed. There is easy transference of this and you\u2019ll definitely need a touch up after eating and drinking. Liked the way it smoothed on and how I barely felt it on.\nLovely color\nUnny Club Black Square Lipstick (Libidream) | matte lipstick\nUNNY CLUB\n{'Brand': 'UNNY CLUB', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Item Form': 'Stick', 'Finish Type': 'Matte', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '3.94 x 188.98 x 35.43 inches; 1.13 Ounces'}\nI like the color or this, but that\u2019s pretty much it. It didn\u2019t come out matte and the color came out way brighter than expected since it was on the darker side (I chose M02). Like most lipsticks, I expected it to transfer and it did, a lot. It practically came all the way off after minor eating. Maybe the color and matte would actually come out on a lighter or fair-skinned person.\nEh.\nNATWAG Reusable Update Makeup Remover Cloths for Sensitive Skin - Microfiber Face Cloth Makeup Remover | Washable Round Makeup Remover Pads | Natural Facial Towels (2 Pads,2 Cloth) (Purple)\nNatwag\n{'Brand': 'Natwag', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive,All Skin Types', 'Material Feature': 'Reusable', 'Unit Count': '4.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Package Dimensions': '12.75 x 9.88 x 0.59 inches; 2.08 Ounces', 'UPC': '745103569978'}\nThis thing is amazing and the material so soft against my skin.
