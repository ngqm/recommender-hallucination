So convenient for those public restroom trips that have run out of soap, just pop this out and you\u2019re good to go. Be careful with taking it out though, I thought it came out in sheets but it\u2019s more like foil paper where you cut the size you want. A small sheet should be good enough. It also has a subtle scent to it but it smells good. This is a must have product.\nReview Title: So convenient\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
