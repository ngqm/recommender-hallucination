My stylist told me to get Kanekalon pre-stretched hair but I could not find the hair in any of the Sally's stores by my house. I decided to get the hair on Amazon and was not disappointed. When I got to my stylist house, she was braiding another client's hair and she compared the hair. My hair was softer and I got more hair for less than the other client. So far it still looks good even after a day at the beach. This hair does look and feel better than what I've purchased before. Definitely will buy this hair again vs going to the hair supply store.\nReview Title: Just What I Needed\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
