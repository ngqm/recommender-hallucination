The clipper has a nice look and a smooth cut, with a special material on its edge (feels like silicone) that makes it easy and comfortable to grip. There is a storage case with a snap to close it. If you need these simple nail clipping tools this set is fine, though a bit expensive.\nReview Title: A nail clipper and file with storage case\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
