The brushes have points with silicone tips so you can safely stimulate your scalp as you wash your head and hair. They feel OK, though not as good as manually massaging your scalp since the brush doesn't have the dexterity of fingers. These are nice to have although I don't expect to rely on them too much. For what is included in this package it seems reasonably priced.\nReview Title: Silicone tipped scalp massage brushes along with shower hair cap\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
