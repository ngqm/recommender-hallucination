This resealable bag contains 100 of the clips. The spring mechanism on the clips is of adequate strength for use in many arts and crafts applications. Having the mix of colors is useful. These are both attractive and practical, and this is a good value for this number of clips. I was provided a free sample of these for my honest, unbiased review.\nGreat bag of multi-colored wonder clips for crafts\nManicure and Pedicure Nail Clipper from POWERGROOMING - Powerful Trimmer for Thick and Thin Finger Nails and Toe Nails - Included Nail File and\"Catcher\" for Easy Cleanup (1 Pack)\nPOWERGROOMING\n{'Brand': 'POWERGROOMING', 'Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Blade Edge': 'Straight', 'Blade Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Target Audience': 'Women, Men', 'Package Dimensions': '3.8 x 1.3 x 1 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'UPC': '653233212735', 'Manufacturer': 'POWERGROOMING'}\nThis is a basic nail clipping set with a clipper and file. The clipper has a nice look and a smooth cut, with a special material on its edge (feels like silicone) that makes it easy and comfortable to grip. There is a storage case with a snap to close it. If you need these simple nail clipping tools this set is fine, though a bit expensive.\nA nail clipper and file with storage case\nNail Clipper Set, 19 In 1 Manicure Pedicure Ear Picking Tool Set, Tools For Nail, Cutter Kits, Includes Cuticle Remover with Portable, Nail Tools with Luxurious Travel Case\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.22 x 3.31 x 0.91 inches; 9.38 Ounces', 'UPC': '759675599820'}\nThis is a set of manicure and pedicure tools that includes pretty much all the clippers and instruments you would need to use. These function well and they also have an attractive design that will appeal especially to girls. The case is nice and it matches the tools. This would make a nice gift.\nAn attractive, flashy manicure/pedicure tool set\nEye Mask Natural Mulberry 100% Silk Super Smooth Sleep Eye Mask for Eye Mask for Puffy Eyes for Dry Eyes for Dark Circles Sleeping Travel While Camping Multi Purpose Men and Women Eye Mask\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.3 x 1.6 x 0.4 inches; 0.81 Ounces'}\nThis eye mask fits comfortably and feels smooth on your face. It functions as desired for blocking out light and helping you relax and sleep. It is not substantially different than other silk eye masks I have tried, while it is not the least expensive option and it doesn't come with any box or bag to store it in.\nA simple smooth silk eye mask\nWig Head Wig Stands (Purple)\nBAIHONG\n{'Manufacturer': 'XUCHANG BAIHONG HAIR PRODUCTS CO., LTD.'}\nThis package includes a pair of scalp massaging brushes along with a stretchable shower cap. The brushes have points with silicone tips so you can safely stimulate your scalp as you wash your head and hair. They feel OK, though not as good as manually massaging your scalp since the brush doesn't have the dexterity of fingers. These are nice to have although I don't expect to rely on them too much. For what is included in this package it seems reasonably priced.\nSilicone tipped scalp massage brushes along with shower hair cap\nAUGNORYE 13 Pcs Hair Cutting Scissors Kit, Professional Hair Barber Scissors Kit with Thinning Shears, Home Hair Shears for Women, Men, Kids\nAUGNORYE\n{'Brand': 'AUGNORYE', 'Included Components': 'Scissors', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Blade Material': 'Stainless Steel'}\nThis barber kit includes scissors, combs, and other items used by barbers.
