I do not have very long finger nails. These press on nails were shorter than my actual nail. It looked terrible because my finger nail was poking out the other side. I didn\u2019t want to clip my nails down just for a set of press on nails that were way too short. I am not into super long gaudy nails, but these are not even a natural length. However, if you are happy with the length, the stickers included to press the mails on to are pretty good! They lasted well and came off my nail easily when I needed them off.\nGreat stickers, super short nails\nGryph & IvyRose Coat of Arms Hydrating Lotion for Kids - Hydrating Moisturizer with Shea Butter & Coconut Oil - All Natural, Sustainable, Cruelty Free, No Parabens, No Sulfates, Vegan - USA Made - 8oz\nGryph & IvyRose\n{'Brand': 'Gryph & IvyRose', 'Scent': 'Coconut Shea', 'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Active Ingredients': 'Sweet Almond Oil', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '5.67 x 2.28 x 2.24 inches; 8 Ounces', 'UPC': '856991007210'}\nThis lotion has a very subtle scent.
