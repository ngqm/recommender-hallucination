I do not have very long finger nails. These press on nails were shorter than my actual nail. It looked terrible because my finger nail was poking out the other side. I didn\u2019t want to clip my nails down just for a set of press on nails that were way too short. I am not into super long gaudy nails, but these are not even a natural length. However, if you are happy with the length, the stickers included to press the mails on to are pretty good! They lasted well and came off my nail easily when I needed them off.\nReview Title: Great stickers, super short nails\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I am on accutane and have really dry skin. This has been a perfect solution. I like it better than comparable brands like aveeno. It leaves my skin feeling moisturized and NOT oily. It has a slight oatmeal scent that smells good but it is not overpowering at all. It feels like such quality going into my skin. I am obsessed. It is nice it comes in such a large quantity because I have a bottle at work at home and everywhere!\nPerfect!\nYUHFERA Press on Nails Kit 30Pcs Fake Nails Short Coffin Nail Tips with Designs Solid Color Full Cover False Nails Set Artificial Acrylic Nails for DIY Nail Art Salon Women Girls Gift(Blue bird)\nYUHFERA\n{'Size': 'Medium', 'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'YUHFERA', 'Style': 'French', 'Coverage': 'Full Well Tips', 'Package Dimensions': '2.95 x 2.91 x 1.06 inches; 1.45 Ounces', 'UPC': '785382442227'}\nOk.
