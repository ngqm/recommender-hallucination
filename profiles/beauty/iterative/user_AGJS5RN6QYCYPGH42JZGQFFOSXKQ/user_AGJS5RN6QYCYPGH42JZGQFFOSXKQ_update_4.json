It is very solidly made, the handle is sturdy and easy to hold and control. The three rows of bristles are arranged evenly and they are firmly attached within the brush. The bristles are stiff, yet have a bit softness to them. I have had no breakage or shedding of bristles at all with this brush. The arrangement of the bristles also allows for easy cleaning of the brush as well. The tapered handle makes parting and sectioning the hair easy, and the brush as a whole is well-balanced and easy to work with. I think the price is terrific for the quality of this brush, which I use on my natural hair and on wigs. I highly recommend it!\nReview Title: Just a great brush!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Portable Travel Bottles Set,Leak Proof Squeezable Silicon Tubes Travel Size Toiletries Containers,TSA Approved Refillable Travel Accessories for Shampoo Liquids (1.3Oz,4 Pack)\nZAYOR\n{'Brand': 'ZAYOR', 'Material': 'Silicone', 'Capacity': '1.3 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '4', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '1.97 x 1.38 x 3.54 inches', 'Product Dimensions': '1.97 x 1.38 x 3.54 inches; 4.02 Ounces', 'UPC': '729993071100'}\nThese little bottles are exactly what I wanted for hand sanitizer on the go. The silicone bottle is durable and thick, but so easy to squeeze. It isn't going to break and crack like a hard plastic bottle. The cap fits securely and the snap-top stays in place. The carabiner is small, but it's strong enough to keep the bottle where it needs to be as long as there isn't serious weight constantly pulling on it. So far, so good.<br /><br />The thing I worry about most with a little bottle like this is what happens if you put a lot of pressure on it (sit on it, lean against the wall when it's in a pocket or on a belt loop, etc). I was concerned that the flip top would pop open and I'd end up with hand sanitizer all over the place, but I tested these little guys full of liquid before filling with sanitizer. The pliability of the silicone doesn't allow a burst of pressure to push off the flip top-- not even close. Plus, the top screws tightly into place. It's not going anywhere.<br /><br />I've been using one of these hanging from my purse strap for the last few days and it is super easy to flip the cap, squeeze out product, and flip the cap closed with one hand. Wish there were other color options, but the functionality and design of these override any concerns about color. I'm so glad I ordered these! They are totally worth the price.\nPerfect for key chain, purse strap, belt loop\nCanple Self-cleaning Slicker Brush for Medium Long Hair Types Dog and Cat, Removes Loose Hair Undercoat Effectively Reduce Mats & Tanglings Grooming Brush\nCanple\n{'Brand': 'Canple', 'Special Feature': 'Self Cleaning', 'Product Benefits': 'Smoothing', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '10.16 x 6.3 x 2.2 inches; 8.82 Ounces'}\nWith four cats and a large dog, I am always looking for good grooming tools. I liked the idea of this brush, but the actual product really wasn't all that. First of all, this thing is much larger than any other slicker style brush I have. This is a great feature for my large dog, but it was just ridiculous trying to groom my cats with this large, unyielding wire brush. So, not a good choice for the cats.<br /><br />Unfortunately, not a good choice for my dog either, as she has a short coat with little to no undercoat and she was really uncomfortable with wires dragging on her skin. She's more of a rubber curry comb type gal, I guess. Besides the size and wire bristle problems, the plastic itself felt a little brittle and cheap and when you add in the mechanics of retractable bristles... I think higher quality material would have been a better choice because that slider for the bristles is very basic. Finally, while I loved the idea of the easy-to-clean retractable bristles, they really aren't necessary and if those wires become crooked or bent it will cause all kinds of problems with the retraction. I've made it decades by just pulling the fur out of my slicker brushes-- it literally takes 2-3 seconds-- and while the thought of retractable bristles is nice, it totally isn't necessary. It's not a practical tool for me and doesn't work for any of my animals due to its size and the wire bristles. It also doesn't seem terribly well-made nor is it made of high-quality materials, and for the price it should be.\nI liked the idea better than the product\nMagnetic eyelashes with eyeliner\uff0cBeevila False Eyelashes Upgraded 5D Magnetic Eyeliner and Eyelashes Kit, fake eyelashes 5 Pairs with Tweezers, Easy to Wear,No glue!\nBeevila\n{'Brand': 'Beevila', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '5.9 x 5.5 x 0.67 inches', 'Material Feature': 'Gluten Free', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Mounting Type': 'Eyelash Glue', 'Product Dimensions': '5.9 x 5.5 x 0.67 inches; 1.69 Ounces', 'UPC': '788433650299'}\nI'm a false eyelash beginner and I have to say that magnetic lashes are far easier to apply, in my opinion, because the magnetic pull as you get the lashes close to their intended destination help you place them properly. They also seem to be a little more forgiving than traditional adhesive lashes if you need to slightly reposition them. This set has a great variety of styles and lengths and comes with two tubes of magnetic liner and a pair of eyelash calipers to help set them in place. If you're just starting out with lashes, this is a great way to do it.<br /><br />However, there are some downsides. First, I find the eyeliner extremely irritating to my eyes (and my nose, as it is heavily scented). It is also really difficult to remove (I have to soak my eyelids with Bi-Facil on a cotton pad at least twice and then follow up with micellar water and MAYBE that will get all of it off). Be prepared to soak your lashes, because that's the only way this stuff is coming off. Second, I find the lashes somewhat uncomfortable. They feel heavier on the lid than adhesive lashes and I can often feel the metal on the band. I tend to remove these long before I remove a pair of adhesive lashes because I am never NOT aware of them on my lids. Third, if you use a tweezer/caliper thing to place your lashes, do yourself a favor and just buy a decent one. This one is plastic and has no tension, so you have to manually open it to fix the lashes in it, then fiddle with it again to take it away from the lashes. For me this was a bonus, because I got so frustrated with it, I just learned to do it with my hands with much better results.<br /><br />Despite my problems with this set, I would totally recommend trying this out to see if magnetic lashes are for you. The variety of styles will give you a lot of options to experiment with different looks, but do take care of your eyelids and make sure you have appropriate product to remove the tenacious eyeliner.
