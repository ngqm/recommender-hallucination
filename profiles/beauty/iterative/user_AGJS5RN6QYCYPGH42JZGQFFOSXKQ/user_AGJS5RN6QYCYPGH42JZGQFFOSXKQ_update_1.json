The silicone bottle is durable and thick, but so easy to squeeze. It isn't going to break and crack like a hard plastic bottle. The cap fits securely and the snap-top stays in place. The carabiner is small, but it's strong enough to keep the bottle where it needs to be as long as there isn't serious weight constantly pulling on it. So far, so good.<br /><br />The thing I worry about most with a little bottle like this is what happens if you put a lot of pressure on it (sit on it, lean against the wall when it's in a pocket or on a belt loop, etc). I was concerned that the flip top would pop open and I'd end up with hand sanitizer all over the place, but I tested these little guys full of liquid before filling with sanitizer. The pliability of the silicone doesn't allow a burst of pressure to push off the flip top-- not even close. Plus, the top screws tightly into place. It's not going anywhere.<br /><br />I've been using one of these hanging from my purse strap for the last few days and it is super easy to flip the cap, squeeze out product, and flip the cap closed with one hand. Wish there were other color options, but the functionality and design of these override any concerns about color. I'm so glad I ordered these! They are totally worth the price.\nReview Title: Perfect for key chain, purse strap, belt loop\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
