The smell is pretty difficult for me though.  This is a natural product so I understand to a certain point but I know I won't wear this lotion if I'm leaving the house so I most likely won't use it.\nReview Title: Ive smelled better...\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I like to see my skin care's first ingredients be more like the heavy hitters like glycolic or lactic or even natural like aloe so I was disappointed regarding this one's contents.  First is water and second is witch hazel. Which I likr, but three and four are glycerol stearate and peg-100 stearate. Peg 100 is a mixed bag of reviews and some even question the safety of it regarding get use in skin care.  It's disappointing because it leaves my skin feeling amazing but I do like more natural ingredients for the first couple ingredients than this product has.\nNot so sure.\nThe Regenerator Anti Cellulite Cream with 12% Liposomal Vitamin C, 4 fl oz (120 ml)\n{'Package Dimensions': '9.1 x 3.3 x 1.6 inches; 4 Ounces'}\nToo soon to tell long-term results but seems to absorb easily.
