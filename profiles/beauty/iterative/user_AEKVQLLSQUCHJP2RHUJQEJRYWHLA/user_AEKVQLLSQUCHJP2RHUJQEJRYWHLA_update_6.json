It's great.\nSmells great\nAnti Aging Moisturizer - The Best Moisturizer for Anti Wrinkle & Skin Tightening Night Cream. Tempt by Cazbe Skin Care Products Rejuvenate your youthful glow\nATOPAL\n{'Package Dimensions': '5.7 x 3 x 0.3 inches; 0.8 Ounces'}\nThis product leaves the skin soft enough and feels nice but my concern is more about ingredients. I like to see my skin care's first ingredients be more like the heavy hitters like glycolic or lactic or even natural like aloe so I was disappointed regarding this one's contents.  First is water and second is witch hazel. Which I likr, but three and four are glycerol stearate and peg-100 stearate. Peg 100 is a mixed bag of reviews and some even question the safety of it regarding get use in skin care.  It's disappointing because it leaves my skin feeling amazing but I do like more natural ingredients for the first couple ingredients than this product has.\nNot so sure.\nThe Regenerator Anti Cellulite Cream with 12% Liposomal Vitamin C, 4 fl oz (120 ml)\n{'Package Dimensions': '9.1 x 3.3 x 1.6 inches; 4 Ounces'}\nToo soon to tell long-term results but seems to absorb easily.  The smell is pretty difficult for me though.  This is a natural product so I understand to a certain point but I know I won't wear this lotion if I'm leaving the house so I most likely won't use it.\nIve smelled better...\nAnti Aging Eye Wrinkle Cream for Women & Men with Hyaluronic Acid Matrixyl 3000 Complex to Moisturize Your Skin Day And Night \u2013 1.8 Fl.

It has some good ingredients. I like using it on my entire face as I do with most eye creams. I creams tend to be a little more gentle and I have sensitive skin so this is good for that. I like the container. It's one of those that you push down on the top and the product squirts out from underneath the top. If that makes sense anyway. This is along the caliber of something you'd see at a higher-end store.\nGood ingredients and a solid product\nAnti-Aging Peptide MegaMUD - Enhanced with Matrixyl, Argireline, Hyaluronic, Argan Oil, and Green Tea Extract\nVIA Cosmedics\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '2.6 x 2.52 x 2.13 inches; 4.94 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'AAMUD10', 'UPC': '748252100450'}\nI really enjoyed this mud mask. It has awesome anti-aging ingredients but still leaves the skin feeling detoxified. When it dries, it doesn't feel like it is sucking all the moisture out of your face but I do like to wash the product off my face before it completely dries. I do have dry skin & Soul already tried to not let clay mask sit on my skin for too long.
