Tempt by Cazbe Skin Care Products Rejuvenate your youthful glow\nReview Date: 2016/08/06\nStore: ATOPAL\nAverage Rating: 3.2\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '5.7 x 3 x 0.3 inches; 0.8 Ounces'}\nReview Text: This product leaves the skin soft enough and feels nice but my concern is more about ingredients. I like to see my skin care's first ingredients be more like the heavy hitters like glycolic or lactic or even natural like aloe so I was disappointed regarding this one's contents.  First is water and second is witch hazel. Which I likr, but three and four are glycerol stearate and peg-100 stearate. Peg 100 is a mixed bag of reviews and some even question the safety of it regarding get use in skin care.  It's disappointing because it leaves my skin feeling amazing but I do like more natural ingredients for the first couple ingredients than this product has.\nReview Title: Not so sure.\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
