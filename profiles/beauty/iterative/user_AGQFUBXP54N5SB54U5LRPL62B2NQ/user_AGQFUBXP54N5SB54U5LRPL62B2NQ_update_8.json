As for the mascara itself, it\u2019s very thin, almost kind of runny, and I found it didn\u2019t do much for my lashes. It didn\u2019t seem to cling to my lashes. I kept applying more coats, but still didn\u2019t see great results. This one isn\u2019t for me.\nReview Title: No results to speak of\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Bath Tub Pillow Bathtub Pillows Headrest with Neck and Back Support, 4D Air Mesh Bath Accessories, 6 Strong Suction Cups, Hot Tub, Jacuzzi Home Spa for Women Men\nApriluna\n{'Brand': 'Apriluna', 'Material': 'Foam, Mesh', 'Product Care Instructions': 'Hand Wash Only', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '15.75 x 7.95 x 5.55 inches; 15.24 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'BP4D', 'Manufacturer': 'Apriluna'}\nThis pillow is soft and comfy and makes for a relaxing bath. I love the soft fabric that covers the pillow, such an improvement over the plastic pillow I had been using. With six suction cups, it stays in place in my free-standing tub, and it\u2019s just the right size to cradle my head and also cushion my upper back. There is an attached hook to hang the pillow to dry when done bathing. Included with the pillow are a tool to loosen the suction cups from the tub, a storage bag, and a bag of rose petals for your first bath with the new pillow. A very nice pillow!\nSoft and comfortable\nKea Health Manuka Honey Moisturizer Cream - For Cracked Hands and Feet - Eczema and Psoriasis Treatment - Anti Itch Relief for Dry Skin - With Lanolin and Olive Oil\nKea Health\n{'Brand': 'Kea Health', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '7.0 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Use for': 'Hands, Feet', 'Package Dimensions': '2.95 x 2.91 x 2.72 inches; 8.15 Ounces'}\nThis is a thick, rich cream that, for me, has worked wonders on dry, scaly skin. My hands needed some serious help and after using this cream for just a few days, I have seen much improvement. My skin is much soft, the cracks are disappearing, and they feel moisturized. The cream is thick, a little goes a long way, and I\u2019ve found it\u2019s best to really rub it in, not list skim it over the skin and leave it. I have also been using the cream on a particularly itchy patch of skin on my back, again, with excellent results.<br />There is no scent.<br />The cream is made from several natural ingredients, most notably Manuka honey from New Zealand, something new to me, but that has been used for centuries in New Zealand. I\u2019m glad it made its way to me in the USA!\nWonderful!\nSqualane + Cucumber Rapid Eye Lift Cream for Dark Circles and Puffiness, Peptide-Complex Infused - 0.4 oz\nSkin Set Go\n{'Brand': 'Skin Set Go', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Use for': 'Eyes', 'Item Volume': '0.4 Fluid Ounces'}\nWhen I opened this package, I had no idea what I was looking at. Inside the Amazon packaging bag was another bag, a plastic bag with a bubble wrap lining and a ziplock type zipper. Inside that, was what looked like a syringe. Honestly, I was at first convinced I had the wrong order as I had no recollection of ordering anything matching what I was seeing. Upon further investigation, I discovered it was the Play Pretend brand of under eye cream. Yes, the Amazon product page does state the the cream comes in a syringe-like tube, and yes, it does state that it comes with a skincare travel bag, this wasn\u2019t what I had envisioned.<br />On to the product\u2026<br />Once I figured out how to open and operate the syringe (hint: remove the large, clear cap, remove the white tip, turn the plunger to unlock) to dispense the under eye cream, I applied some to my face. The scent is strong, like cucumber with an underlying perfume smell. Not unpleasant, but kind of strong for me, someone who is overly sensitive to scents. My problem, I know, and most people will probably really enjoy the scent. The cream is white, smooth, goes on evenly and is absorbed quickly. There is a bit of a cooling sensation which I found pleasant.<br /><br />The travel bag seems unnecessary to me. It\u2019s really not much more than a heavy ziplock bag lined with bubble wrap with a large logo reading \u201cSkin Set Go.\u201d  If someone needs a bag, great, but I have several and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be using this one.<br /><br />According to the company\u2019s website, Skin Care Go products are made in the USA in small batches. Good. A lot of natural ingredients go into the product, which I like, but the complete list of ingredients from the company\u2019s website is as follows:<br /><br />Water (Aqua), Carthamus Tinctorius Seed Oil, Polyacrylate-13, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Polyisobutene, Squalane, Sodium Hyaluronate, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Butylene Glycol, Polysorbate 20, Acetyl Octapeptide-3, Caprylyl Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance, Yellow 5 (CI 19140), Blue 1 (CI 42090).<br /><br />The final verdict:<br />The product is nice, and while I\u2019d personally prefer something less heavily scented, I like the way the cream works and what it does for my skin. It\u2019s very hydrating and brightening, with nothing that irritated my skin. I understand the idea behind the syringe dispenser: it\u2019s unique, it\u2019s fun, it\u2019s memorable. However, there\u2019s a ton of plastic used that isn\u2019t necessary, and with the design, I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll know when the tube is nearing empty.<br />Overall, this is a good product, does what it says it does, and if you\u2019re looking for something a little unusual, give it a try.\nNice cream, gimmicky packaging\nKIMUSE Lash Enhancing Serum, Castor Oil, Eyelash Growth Serum and Eyebrow Enhancer, Promotes Appearance of Longer, Thicker Eyelashes, Fuller Thicker Lashes & Brows (5ML), Cruelty Free (lash enhancing serum)\nKIMUSE\n{'Use for': 'Face', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'KIMUSE', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Product Dimensions': '5.5 x 0.86 x 0.86 inches; 1.13 Ounces', 'UPC': '887349696800'}\nI\u2019ve been trying out a couple of different lash serums over the past month. With my husband also using it (on his brows), while I use it on my lashes, we\u2019ve been able to try different brands to see if there are any differences in results. This serum, by Kimuse, is very similar to the others in consistency (a thin liquid) and in how it\u2019s applied (with a very thin brush). I have had no negative reactions to the serum, and no irritation to my eyes even when I\u2019ve slipped and gotten some in my eye. This serum boasts results in as little as 3-4 weeks, while most others are more conservative at 6 weeks. In the few weeks we\u2019ve been using the serums, neither of us have noticed any dramatic changes as far as lash or brow growth, but I do think I\u2019m losing fewer lashes which is a definite plus. Honestly, I\u2019m not sure if any serum is going to provide dramatic results, but we\u2019ll continue for at least a few more weeks and see what happens while hoping for the best.Hopefully, I\u2019ll be back with exciting news!<br /><br />Update: After using this, as well as other, lash growth serums for several months, I have noticed a definite improvement in the length of my lashes. I have not noticed as significant an improvement in the thickness, or volume, of my lashes, however. I believe that these types of serums do help promote growth, and I haven't been able to detect much difference between brands except that a couple of them irritated my eyes. Therefore, my conclusion is that this is helpful and the real determination of what works best will be what's most comfortable for you to use, so read the ingredients and watch for any possible allergy triggers or irritants.\nPatience required\nPremium Taza Natural Moroccan Argan Oil Peppermint & Tea Tree Conditioner, 16 fl oz (473 ml) \u2666 For Healthy, Smooth, Silky Hair \u2666 Contains: Moroccan Argan Oil, Broccoli Seed Oil, Pro Vitamin B5, Hydrol\nTaza\n{'Brand': 'Taza', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Hair Type': 'Frizzy', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2.48 x 2.48 x 8.27 inches; 1.06 Pounds', 'UPC': '628451263623'}\nI love the smell of this conditioner so was eager to try it. Unfortunately, it did almost nothing for my hair. I have thick, curly hair and require a lot of conditioner. I used the same amount of this Taza conditioner as I would any other, and it was strange in that it felt like I hadn\u2019t put anything on my hair. There was no silky feel, I could not comb my fingers through may hair. I enjoyed the scent, but my hair felt as if I hadn\u2019t put any conditioner on it. I tried adding more, but it didn\u2019t help. I ended up rinsing it and using a different conditioner. If your hair doesn\u2019t require much conditioning, this may work for you, but if your hair is anything like mine, this probably isn\u2019t for you.\nDid not work for my thick, curly hair\n100% PURE Coconut Body Scrub Exfoliating Deep Cleanse with Sea Salts & Nourishing Oils - Natural Deeply Moisturizing Skincare - Vibrant Radiant Skin Restore & Pore Cleanser - Vegan - 10oz\n100% PURE\n['Crystalline sea salt scrub smoothes while softening skin with rich, supple moisture. Suspended in a base of silky sunflower and apricot oils, this emollient sea salt scrub buffs away bumps and flakes to reveal glowing, rejuvenated skin.']\n{'Brand': '100% PURE', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Scent': 'Coconut', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Exfoliating', 'Package Dimensions': '3.66 x 3.62 x 1.93 inches; 11.99 Ounces', 'UPC': '843585107999', 'Manufacturer': '100% PURE'}\nI\u2019ve used a number of different salt scrubs and love them for how soft they leave my skin feeling after a shower. This one is a little chunkier than most and feels rougher on my skin. It is also quite oily. I like some oil in my scrubs for moisturizing, often I don\u2019t even need to apply lotion after using, but this one seemed extra oily and left the shower slippery. It separates, so needs to be shaken or stirred before using. It does leave my skin feeling smooth and provided you like coconut, the scent is nice.\nKind of chunky and quite oily, but leaves skin feeling soft\nArkology Dog Paw Cleaner & Pet Grooming Brush - Medium Size, Green Portable Pet Paw Washer with Green Towel, Soft Silicone Brush and Green Silicon Strap\nArkology Collection\n{'Brand': 'Arkology Collection', 'Color': 'Light Green', 'Shape': 'Oblong', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Product Dimensions': '4 x 4 x 4 inches; 10.86 Ounces', 'UPC': '768497935563', 'Manufacturer': 'Arkology Collection'}\nThese types of paw washing cups are an excellent way to clean muddy paws. I\u2019m so glad the days of lugging a bucket of water are behind me. I\u2019ve tried a couple different versions and found this one to be good, if it fits your dog\u2019s paws.<br />I have a golden retriever. The box I received said \u201cmedium\u201d and it works for her, though it\u2019s a little tight. There are a lot of silicone bristles inside and while that\u2019s good for cleaning, if you\u2019re on the borderline of it fitting your dog, too many bristles make it difficult to get your dog\u2019s paws in and out and to agitate the cup enough to clean. I didn\u2019t see a size noted when I ordered, so I\u2019m not quite sure if it\u2019s possible to order different sizes since I don\u2019t see that info on the Amazon page, just on the box I received.<br />Cleaning the cup is easy - just rinse if the water isn\u2019t too dirty or unscrew the top and remove the silicone bristle insert for a deeper clean.<br />The included towel is nice and fluffy, but only the size of a standard washcloth. My dogs feet come out pretty wet, so the cloth is soaked by the time I\u2019m done wiping her feet. I use a towel instead.\nWorks well on dirty paws...if it fits\nLOVE CINEMA Curl & Volume-up Mascara 111\nLOVE CINEMA\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.47 x 0.87 x 0.67 inches; 1.02 Ounces', 'UPC': '795827835224'}\nThe bristles on the mascara wand were too long for my liking.
