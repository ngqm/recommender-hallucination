I love the soft fabric that covers the pillow, such an improvement over the plastic pillow I had been using.

There is an attached hook to hang the pillow to dry when done bathing.

A very nice pillow!\nReview Title: Soft and comfortable\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
