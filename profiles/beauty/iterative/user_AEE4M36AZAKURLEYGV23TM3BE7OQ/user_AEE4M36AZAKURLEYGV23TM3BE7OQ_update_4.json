It smells nice, although the scent seems to be fake and not real lavender.  It's still a nice scent, though.  I would get this again if I found a good deal, but there are others that I like better.\nReview Title: Good Exfoliation\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I was surprised at how well it worked for detangling wet hair.  The scent is also nice -- it does not smell like vinegar.  It does help with frizziness, too, on those really humid days.  It also reduces static electricity in your hair on really dry days.  I would definitely use this again.\nDetangles Well\nTaya Beauty Buriti Nut Intensive Repair Shampoo & Conditioner Duo \u2013 Organic Hydrating Shampoo and Conditioner for Dry Damaged Hair - Restorative Hair Care \u2013 Travel Size 2 fl oz\nTAYA I AM.\n{'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Brand': 'TAYA I AM.', 'Hair Type': 'All, Dull, Color Treated, Dry, Chemically Treated, Damaged', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Package Dimensions': '5.25 x 3.5 x 1.1 inches; 2 Ounces', 'UPC': '858308002635'}\nThis shampoo and conditioner set is very moisturizing, but doesn't leave your hair limp or greasy-looking.  It leaves my fine, shoulder-length hair bouncy and shiny.  The travel size is also very convenient.\nNice\n2 Pack Hair Towel Wrap Turban Microfiber Drying Shower and Bath, Twist Head Towels with Button, Magic Quick Dryer, Hair Care for Women and Girls, One Wrap Plus One Cap and Two Velvet Hair Bands\nMEETWIN\n{}\nI like the twist towel a lot, but I found the shower-cap-like towel to be a little hard to use.  My hair is below shoulder-length, and it just didn't work well for me.  The twist towel is great, though.  I didn't care for the hair ties and won't be using those.  If you have longer hair and just want some twist towels, I would go with a different product because the cap probably won't work for you.  But if you're hair is shorter, this set would be a pretty good choice.\nOkay\nLavender Fields Sugar Polish by South of France Clean Body Care | Moisturizing Sugar Scrub for Women | Shea Butter + Sunflower Oil | 8 oz Tube\nSouth of France Natural Body Care\n{'Brand': 'South of France Natural Body Care', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Product Benefits': 'Exfoliating', 'Active Ingredients': 'Lavender', 'Material Feature': 'Gluten Free, Natural', 'Product Dimensions': '20.3 x 7.1 x 5.1 inches; 8.82 Ounces', 'UPC': '856885005155'}\nThis body polish is very good at exfoliating, but not as moisturizing as I would like.
