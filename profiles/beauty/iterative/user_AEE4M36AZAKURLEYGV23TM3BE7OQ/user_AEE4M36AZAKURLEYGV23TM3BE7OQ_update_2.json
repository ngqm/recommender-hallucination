I was surprised at how well it worked for detangling wet hair.  The scent is also nice -- it does not smell like vinegar.  It does help with frizziness, too, on those really humid days.  It also reduces static electricity in your hair on really dry days.  I would definitely use this again.\nDetangles Well\nTaya Beauty Buriti Nut Intensive Repair Shampoo & Conditioner Duo \u2013 Organic Hydrating Shampoo and Conditioner for Dry Damaged Hair - Restorative Hair Care \u2013 Travel Size 2 fl oz\nTAYA I AM.\n{'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Brand': 'TAYA I AM.', 'Hair Type': 'All, Dull, Color Treated, Dry, Chemically Treated, Damaged', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Package Dimensions': '5.25 x 3.5 x 1.1 inches; 2 Ounces', 'UPC': '858308002635'}\nThis shampoo and conditioner set is very moisturizing, but doesn't leave your hair limp or greasy-looking.
