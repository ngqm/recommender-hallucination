I have 4 kids. Hand sanitizers are a must. These are absolutely adorable.<br /><br />Let\u2019s start with the packaging. It\u2019s not just regular sanitizer thrown in a box and sent out. This looks like a promo box. It\u2019s adorable!! The box\u2019s sides slide outward!! (This actually took me a bit to figure out on my own but mannnnnn was it worth it. It\u2019s adorable!!) The box opens up to 4 sanitizers, all different colors, and a Mickey Mouse logo in the middle\u2026 so you know it\u2019s real ;) They sanitizers are all spray, Each a different scent. (Lavender, citrus, aloe and unscented) and each are supposedly worth 500 sprays. I love these. The aesthetics, The style, the scent, THE MICKEY!! Just everything yes!! It is a little pricey but honestly, and I don\u2019t say this much about beauty products let alone hand sanitizer, I\u2019d spend the money for it. 500 sprays && Mickey???!!

A balm that you can easily apply to your face without having to get your hands dirty AND biodegradable packaging. A sure yes please, or so you\u2019d think. Upon opening, I found the packaging to be great. The push up concept was great as well. Innovative and a great selling point. It had no real smell to it when I opened it but about an hour after applying it to my face, you could start to smell what smelt like an old lotion that\u2019s sat around since my mother\u2019s childhood. It was almost dusty of a smell. It also felt a bit greasy/oily. My face does feel smoother though after whipping it off though. Really wish I could love this product.\nLove the concept but not the product\nAOA Studio Collection Makeup Sponge Set Makeup Blender Latex Free and High-definition Set of 5 Makeup Blender For Powder Cream and Liquid, Super Soft Wonder Blender Beauty Cosmetic Beveled\nAOA STUDIO\n{'Brand': 'AOA STUDIO', 'Color': 'Ivory', 'Material': 'Rubber', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Makeup', 'Package Dimensions': '6.85 x 5.39 x 1.97 inches; 1.45 Ounces', 'UPC': '850022931338'}\nDurable and flexible enough for your makeup needs. Applied make up smoothly and blots great. Enough absorption to hold foundation but not make it soggy. Individually wrapped. Works great\nFlexible\nMakeup Headband - 3PCS Spa Headband For Washing Face Skincare Towel Headbands Shower Hair Band\nTinpin\n{'Color': 'Pink,Silver', 'Material': 'Foam', 'Number of Items': '3', 'Brand': 'Tinpin', 'Size': '3 piece Set', 'Package Dimensions': '8.35 x 7.17 x 2.13 inches; 3.99 Ounces'}\nI got this 3 pack for my daughters and I in hopes it\u2019d fit all of us and IT DOES! My daughters are 4 and 8 so I was reaching for it to be able to fit so I\u2019m very impressed it does. Perfect to hold our hair back when doing face masks or facials. Looks great and really comfortable.\nStretchy and comfy!\nCfalaicos Women Short Curly Bob Wavy Wig for Cosplay Party Halloween Heat Resistant Wigs Full Head Wig with Free Wig Cap (Rainbow)\nCfalaicos\n{'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '14 x 10 x 10 inches', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Special Feature': 'Heat Resistant', 'Brand': 'Cfalaicos', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '14 x 10 x 10 inches; 7.05 Ounces'}\nI have a hard time committing to different hair color changes so wigs help fulfill my color obsessions without the commitment. This wig is soo much fun! It has an adjustable strap on the bottom of the wig easily making it able to fit myself as well as my daughters. The colors are exactly as pictured and quality is great for the $17 pricing. This wig also comes with a wig cap. I have extremely long hair and this wig does a great job holding and hiding it. Love it.
