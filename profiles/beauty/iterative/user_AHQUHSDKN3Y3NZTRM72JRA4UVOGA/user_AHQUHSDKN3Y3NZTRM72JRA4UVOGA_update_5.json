A balm that you can easily apply to your face without having to get your hands dirty AND biodegradable packaging. A sure yes please, or so you\u2019d think. Upon opening, I found the packaging to be great. The push up concept was great as well. Innovative and a great selling point. It had no real smell to it when I opened it but about an hour after applying it to my face, you could start to smell what smelt like an old lotion that\u2019s sat around since my mother\u2019s childhood. It was almost dusty of a smell. It also felt a bit greasy/oily. My face does feel smoother though after whipping it off though.
