You have to lightly place it on your feet for the roller to go over the area you want. Putting too much pressure will cause it to stop in place. There are three different  grinder heads from soft to rough, but I didn't feel as though one was more effective than the other. I do like how easy it was to switch form one grinder head to the other and the concept and idea of the grinder heads. It had to be charged for about an hour when I initially opened the box.\nReview Title: It'll suffice\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Foot Peel Mask For Cracked Heels, Dead Skin & Calluses - Make Your Feet Baby Soft & Get a Smooth Skin, Removes & Repairs Rough Heels\nMonikahair\n{'UPC': '739515020639'}\nI used the foot peel mask exactly two days ago. As you can see my feet are already peeling. My thumbs and pointer fingers began peeling yesterday because I used them to open up the socks to put my feet in. A pair of booties come attached so you have to carefully cut them apart and then cut them open before you can separate it to put on. You have to make sure there's a cotton like barrier on each side of the booties before you put your foot in. Hence my thumb and pointer fingers peeling. I must say that this peel mask is way more effective than the one I used twice from Walmart. This one works a lot faster than the ones I've used before. I also like the fact that you get two pairs of them and they even include a callus shaver tool. I love the smell of lavender when you open up the mask even before you put them on. There's a tab on the side of the booties to peel and fold over so that the they are securely on your feet. Pretty nice idea considering the last feet mask, I used you had to put socks on over them to make sure 1. I didn't fall while moving around and 2. they don't slip off. The tabs make sure they stay in place and I was able to walk in them with my house shoes on. I wore them for an hour and washed the solution off my feet which were very soft afterwards. I did notice that my feet were a little dry feeling after a while but still soft. This is going to be added to my pandemic self care routine....and probably post pandemic.\nVery effective\nWonder4 Electric Callus Remover - Rechargeable Electric Foot File Callus Shaver Hard Skin Remover Pedicure Tools with 3 in 1 Roller Heads, for Cracked Heels Calluses and Dead Skin\nWonder4\n{'Brand': 'Wonder4', 'Is Electric': 'Yes', 'Item Form': 'Roller', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Unit Count': '11.4 Ounce'}\nI used this for the heels of my feet and wasn't thoroughly impressed.
