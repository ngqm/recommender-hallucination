I love that the colors are on the top of the bottles for you to know which one you're using. I forgot to use the magnet to get the cat eye effect but will try it later before curing the polish. I like the various shades of blues and purples in the set. Despite how thick it is, it only took one time to cure and dry which is a huge plus since you have to wait a while for a thick regular polish to dry.\nReview Title: Thick polish but not too thick\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Foot Peel Mask For Cracked Heels, Dead Skin & Calluses - Make Your Feet Baby Soft & Get a Smooth Skin, Removes & Repairs Rough Heels\nMonikahair\n{'UPC': '739515020639'}\nI used the foot peel mask exactly two days ago. As you can see my feet are already peeling. My thumbs and pointer fingers began peeling yesterday because I used them to open up the socks to put my feet in. A pair of booties come attached so you have to carefully cut them apart and then cut them open before you can separate it to put on. You have to make sure there's a cotton like barrier on each side of the booties before you put your foot in. Hence my thumb and pointer fingers peeling. I must say that this peel mask is way more effective than the one I used twice from Walmart. This one works a lot faster than the ones I've used before. I also like the fact that you get two pairs of them and they even include a callus shaver tool. I love the smell of lavender when you open up the mask even before you put them on. There's a tab on the side of the booties to peel and fold over so that the they are securely on your feet. Pretty nice idea considering the last feet mask, I used you had to put socks on over them to make sure 1. I didn't fall while moving around and 2. they don't slip off. The tabs make sure they stay in place and I was able to walk in them with my house shoes on. I wore them for an hour and washed the solution off my feet which were very soft afterwards. I did notice that my feet were a little dry feeling after a while but still soft. This is going to be added to my pandemic self care routine....and probably post pandemic.\nVery effective\nWonder4 Electric Callus Remover - Rechargeable Electric Foot File Callus Shaver Hard Skin Remover Pedicure Tools with 3 in 1 Roller Heads, for Cracked Heels Calluses and Dead Skin\nWonder4\n{'Brand': 'Wonder4', 'Is Electric': 'Yes', 'Item Form': 'Roller', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Unit Count': '11.4 Ounce'}\nI used this for the heels of my feet and wasn't thoroughly impressed. You have to lightly place it on your feet for the roller to go over the area you want. Putting too much pressure will cause it to stop in place. There are three different  grinder heads from soft to rough, but I didn't feel as though one was more effective than the other. I do like how easy it was to switch form one grinder head to the other and the concept and idea of the grinder heads. It had to be charged for about an hour when I initially opened the box.\nIt'll suffice\nBiutee Poly Nail Gel Kit 15ml 0.53oz Pink Nail Extension Gel Builder Gel Long Lasting Nail Salon Nail Art Design DIY at Home Beginner Friendly\u2026\nBiutee\n{'Package Dimensions': '3.5 x 2 x 1.5 inches; 0.81 Ounces'}\nI like this poly gel a little better than the one I've used previously. I will say I'm disappointed because according to the description/title this is supposed to be a kit. To me a kit comes with more than just one item. Well all I received was the poly gel. Aside from that, I love the color, although I could have used a little more on a few of my nails. The tube is rather small, but I still have enough left for at last two more manicures....I think. I ended up using gel polish over the poly gel but next time I think I will just wear it by itself. It took well to the polish and looks fabulous. It also has a nice shine/polish to it and it's very easy to file/shape.\nSuch a nice color\nGlass spray bottle-16 ounce empty bottle ounce refillable container 2 packs, suitable for essential oils, cleaning products, aromatherapy, water mist plants with mist and air flow settings\nDS DOODLE SABBATH\n{'Brand': 'DS DOODLE SABBATH', 'Capacity': '16 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '2.76 x 2.76 x 8.27 inches', 'Special Feature': 'Adjustable Nozzle', 'Product Dimensions': '2.76 x 2.76 x 8.27 inches; 1.4 Pounds', 'UPC': '619011520959'}\nI'm used to putting my hair oils in plastic bottles and notice that a lot of times they leak out, how I'm not exactly sure. I was a little concerned that if I put my hair oil in one of these glass spray bottles it may not spray like it should and I'd have to figure something else out or continue to have leaking plastic bottles. Little did I know that these would work and work well. I love the idea of the tiny funnel which helped make sure none of the oil spilled and went directly into the bottle. I like the little chalkboard like labels which I used on both bottles. I used to other bottle for my leave in moisturizing conditioner and it works like a charm. I have to be a little more careful with the bottles as they are glass and I'm not used to using glass spray bottles. The spray nozzle has the option to stop it from spraying and two ways it can spray, shower or stream. The bottles are very lightweight even after you add content inside of it. You can use either the spray nozzle or the cap to keep things sealed, options for your desired use. Love these.\nLove these glass spray bottles\nNail Files 16 Pcs, Double Sided Emery Board Manicure Tools for Filing Natural Gel and Acrylic Nails for Home and Salon Use\nKeiby Citom\n{'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'Keiby Citom', 'Grit Number': '100', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '7.8 x 5.08 x 0.59 inches; 5.29 Ounces', 'UPC': '742025065137', 'Manufacturer': 'YHIT'}\nI was able to use this emery  board on both my natural nails, poly gel, and acrylic nails when I wanted to shape or file them down. Very comfortable to hold and use. I was able to use one side for my natural nails (180) and the other side for the acrylic and poly gel nails (100). There are a lot in the pack so I'll be using them for a while without having to worry about running out of them. I like how the 100 side works really well to file/shape the acrylic/poly gel nails and the 180 side is gentle enough for my natural nails. Definitely a must have for your manicures.\nNice sturdy emery board\nSpray Bottle with Adjustable Nozzle, Suream 10.6oz/300ml Green Mist Sprayer with Stream for Curly Hair, Refillable Empty Plastic Bottle for Hairdressing, Planting, Ironing and Cleaning\nSUREAM\n{'Package Dimensions': '9.88 x 4.49 x 3.07 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'UPC': '735632989217'}\nUsed this spray bottle with water in it to iron clothes. Initially I thought it only had a stream and off option despite what the descriptions say, but if you turn the nozzle slightly from the off position, you'll be able to get a mist from the water bottle when you spray. I used this for ironing and if I were to use the bottle for cleaning, I'd use the stream option. Be careful not to turn the nozzle too much or else when you spray it, it will stream, but water will also sprinkle out from the bottle's nozzle and run down your finger(s). I like the size and shape of it as I can store it in the laundry room and not have to worry about it taking up too much space. The color of the bottle is nice also.\nNice spray bottle\nTransparent Flexible Silicon Wig Grip Headband, 2Pcs Wig Bands for Making Wigs, Soft Drop-Shaped Wig Hair Bands Scarf, Elastic Grip Band For Wigs Running Sport Headband (Light Brown+Transparent)\nYMSGIRL\n{'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material': 'Silicone', 'Fabric Type': 'Elastic,Silicon', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Brand': 'YMSGIRL', 'Package Dimensions': '4.84 x 3.46 x 1.1 inches; 1.76 Ounces'}\nI used this on an older wig and a newer one. It held both wigs in place fairly well. It wasn't too tight around my head and held everything together but I wouldn't want to wear it for extremely long periods of time. I didn't have to worry about my wig flying away because it was too windy outside. Moving my head around while it was on took a little adjusting to but after about 30 minutes I was fine and forgot I even had it on. What I really like about this is that I don't have to worry anymore about the back of my own hair getting clipped or stuck on the installed wig clips and elastic latch. I have this issues even with regular wig caps. The band prevents that from happening which is a plus for me because the latch can sit over the band.\nNice hold\nlootaan 500 Pieces False Nails French Acrylic Fake Nails Tips Half Cover Artificial Fake Nails With Box and False Nail Clipper for Women Girl\nlootaan\n{'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'lootaan', 'Number of Pieces': '500', 'Package Dimensions': '9 x 6 x 2 inches; 8.01 Ounces', 'UPC': '710157699223'}\nThese tips were so easy to apply, file, and shape. I love using them. I needed them to cover my nails so I can use the min dipping powder. They worked exceptionally well. I was able to file them down to look like my normal nails would and the powder was able to apply and bond to them well. I also tried gel nail polish over a few of them and the gel also bonded to the nails well. They felt really light and very flexible once I clipped and filed them. Pretty sure I can use these for a lot more versus the full cover nails. BTW that's my pointer finger not my middle finger in the single finger picture.\nLove it\nWhisper 90mL, a skin caressing floral Eau De Parfum for Women with calm base notes of Musk, delicate Fruity middle tones by perfume artisan Swiss Arabian\nSwiss Arabian\n{'Brand': 'Swiss Arabian', 'Item Volume': '90 Milliliters', 'Scent': 'Floral', 'Fragrance Concentration': 'Eau_de_parfum', 'Item Weight': '0.8 Pounds', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '3.94 x 3.15 x 3.15 inches; 12.8 Ounces', 'UPC': '769471301275'}\nI'm not too big on perfumes but decided to try this one to see if it would be something I liked. It is! The scent is like a fruity musk scent but very light and lasts for some time. I tried it first on the inside of my elbow to make sure I didn't have any negative reactions to it and I got hooked from the first smell. I've gotten a few compliments about the smell being nice and others wanting to know what perfume I'm wearing. Be careful not to spray too much so it's not overwhelming and honestly you don't need to spray that much for it to last. I also like the bottle and the tassels around it. Very well designed bottle and in my favorite color so that was a plus. It was also packaged very well too. I can give my regular perfumes a break and use this one now since I've had no adverse reactions from it, it smells really nice, and get a lot of compliments about it.\nVery nice smell\nPine Gel Nail Polish Set 6 Colors Purple Blue Cat Eye Glitter Gel Polish 7.5 ml Soak Off UV LED Cure Home Salon Manicure\npine\n{'Brand': 'Pine', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '9.524 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '6', 'Liquid Volume': '0.25 Fluid Ounces', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '4.84 x 2.87 x 3.58 inches', 'Product Dimensions': '4.84 x 2.87 x 3.58 inches; 9.77 Ounces', 'UPC': '738628890955'}\nThese polishes are thick and only truly require one coat to cure and be done. I love that the colors are on the top of the bottles for you to know which one you're using. I forgot to use the magnet to get the cat eye effect but will try it later before curing the polish. I like the various shades of blues and purples in the set. Despite how thick it is, it only took one time to cure and dry which is a huge plus since you have to wait a while for a thick regular polish to dry.\nThick polish but not too thick",
