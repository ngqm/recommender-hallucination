  "reference_summary": "NeWisdom 72 PCS Toddler Girls Hair Accessory Set with Gift Packing Organization Box, Gifts for Grandkids, Cute Hair Bows Hair Clips Hair Bands for Girls Toddlers, Multi-Style Elastic Hair Ties Hair Accessories for Baby Girls Age 3 4 5 6\nNeWisdom\n{'Brand': 'NeWisdom', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Color': 'GirlsKit', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Babies', 'Embellishment': 'Bow', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '10.83 x 7.28 x 1.77 inches; 14.57 Ounces', 'Manufacturer recommended age': '5 months and up', 'Item model number': 'NW-GirlsKit-36Grid', 'Department': 'Baby-girls', 'UPC': '778942698455', 'Manufacturer': 'NeWisdom'}\nMy 2 year old, got so excited when she saw these, she loves to open the box and pick out her hair ties. I must say that I think the organizational box is a major plus, each little slot comes with 2 hair ties or clips, and each one seems to be great quality. They're stretchy and I haven't had any break which is awesome. I do think the price is a little steep, especially since some hair ties are really cute but others in my opinion are kinda corny and wouldnt be my first choice. I've included pictures to show, however if you like all of the little plastic characters,  then you should buy these! Great concept and your kid should surely love them! Good quality.\nGreat stretch hair ties!! Awesome organizational box.\nGrowom Garden Hose Nozzle 4 Adjustable Spray Patterns Garden Sprayer Heavy Duty Metal Hose Nozzle with 3 Washers for Gardening, Car Washing, Pet Bathing and General Cleaning\nGrowom\n{'Brand': 'Growom', 'Finish Type': 'Polished', 'Material': 'Heavy,Metal', 'Handle Type': 'Lever', 'Package Dimensions': '8.3 x 4.6 x 1.7 inches; 1.15 Pounds'}\nReally nice heavy duty garden hose. My husband was even impressed by it. It's very solid, and heavy, definitely doesn't feel like it will be breaking anytime soon.  It's easy to fit to your hose and to use. You can adjust the water spray, and it has the lock feature so that you can keep the water running without holding the handle down. Overall I think this sprayer has it all!\nVery heavy duty!\nMagnetic Eyelashes and Magnetic Eyeliner Kit, Magnetic Eyelashes with Eyeliner, 5 Pairs Reusable Magnetic Eyelashes with Tweezer, False Lashes\nEyenjoy\n{'Brand': 'Eyenjoy', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '5.71 x 5.39 x 0.71 inches', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Mounting Type': 'Magnet', 'Product Dimensions': '5.71 x 5.39 x 0.71 inches; 2.12 Ounces', 'UPC': '736067423758'}\nThis a fairly decent set of magnetic eyelashes. I will say I have tried a few different brands. The plus side about these is that they have several small magnets, making it easy to manipulate to your eye shape and have them fit correctly. Some brands only have 3 large magnets and the placing is hard to get a good fit. The second positive about these is that it comes with two bottles of the eyeliner which is awesome since you can keep reusing the eyelashes. I will say that these eyelashes are pretty long. I wouldn't say any of them are \"natural\" looking because of the length. I've toyed with cutting a pair to see if I like them better but am afraid I'll throw off the look...over all though I would say this is a good set. And I love magnetic eyelashes far more than dealing with eyelash glue!\nBetter than dealing with eyelash glue!\nMiss U Hair Long Wavy Dyeing Color Wig Burgundy Ombre Blonde Cosplay Costume Wig\nM MISS U HAIR\n{'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy', 'Style': 'Wavy', 'Brand': 'M MISS U HAIR', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '10.2 x 8 x 1.7 inches; 11.36 Ounces'}\nThis wig might be okay for a halloween costume but really isn't great quality.
