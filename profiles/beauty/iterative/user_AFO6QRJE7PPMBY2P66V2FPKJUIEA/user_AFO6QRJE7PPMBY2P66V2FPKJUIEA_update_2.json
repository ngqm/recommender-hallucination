My husband was even impressed by it. It's very solid, and heavy, definitely doesn't feel like it will be breaking anytime soon.  It's easy to fit to your hose and to use. You can adjust the water spray, and it has the lock feature so that you can keep the water running without holding the handle down. Overall I think this sprayer has it all!\nReview Title: Very heavy duty!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I must say that I think the organizational box is a major plus, each little slot comes with 2 hair ties or clips, and each one seems to be great quality. They're stretchy and I haven't had any break which is awesome. I do think the price is a little steep, especially since some hair ties are really cute but others in my opinion are kinda corny and wouldnt be my first choice. I've included pictures to show, however if you like all of the little plastic characters,  then you should buy these! Great concept and your kid should surely love them! Good quality.\nGreat stretch hair ties!! Awesome organizational box.\nGrowom Garden Hose Nozzle 4 Adjustable Spray Patterns Garden Sprayer Heavy Duty Metal Hose Nozzle with 3 Washers for Gardening, Car Washing, Pet Bathing and General Cleaning\nGrowom\n{'Brand': 'Growom', 'Finish Type': 'Polished', 'Material': 'Heavy,Metal', 'Handle Type': 'Lever', 'Package Dimensions': '8.3 x 4.6 x 1.7 inches; 1.15 Pounds'}\nReally nice heavy duty garden hose.
