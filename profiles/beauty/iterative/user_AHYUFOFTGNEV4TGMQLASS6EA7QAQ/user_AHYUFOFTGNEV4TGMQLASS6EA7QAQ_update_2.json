I don't have terribly thick eyebrows so I wanted some of this to try out.  I've been applying it at bedtime and before I put my makeup on. It is a nice light viscous oil that doesn't weigh down my brow hairs.  Perhaps knowing that I've put something on my eyebrows makes me not fuss with them as much.  Time will tell, but so far, I like it.  I can use my Anastasia BH brow kit over this and it doesn't change the application at all (I dust a bit of setting powder on before)<br />I like it and will update if there is anything significant to tell!<br />If you feel that my review was helpful, please let me know by selecting \u201cYes\u201d from the options below. Even though I received this product at lower cost, I am not obligated in any way to review positively, my opinion has not been influenced by outside sources in any manner. I am not affiliated with this company and I never promise to provide a positive review when offered.

It doesn't feel 'tacky' on my skin, but I'm so dry that it just soaked it right up!<br />The glass dropper is long enough to reach the bottom of the glass jar.  Looks and feels very 'vintage, like something off of an Apothecary's shelf.  If you're not a fan of the dropper, you can just use the bottle top that it comes with.<br />I didn't notice any discernable scent to this.  Not floral, not perfumey, just clean.  As soon as I rubbed it in, there was NO smell left on my hands.  It just disappeared.  This is one for the beauty stand.  Very good quality and I'm happy to have been able to test this at a reduced price from the company.\nSo light and soaked right into my skin\nUptown Cosmeceuticals Eyelash Growth Serum Contains Stem Cell & Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17, Dermatologist Lab Tested Lash & Eyebrow Growth Formula, 4 Months Supply 3.5ml\n{}\nStill waiting for the results.
