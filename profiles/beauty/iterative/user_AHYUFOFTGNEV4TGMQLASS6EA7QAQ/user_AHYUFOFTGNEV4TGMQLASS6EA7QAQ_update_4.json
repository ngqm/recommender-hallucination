It has a unique push down applicator that you can simply swipe off the amount you dispense to put it on your forehead, under your chin, around your neck or around your eyes.  As it dries and sinks into your skin, it makes it feel a bit tighter.<br />There is also a moisturizing feel to it as well.  I realize that this sounds contradictory: moisturizing, plus tightening but it does work.<br />I find that the results last, for me, about 3-4 hours.  This is not an issue, but I feel worth noting.  This isn't an all day formula.<br />This formula has Hyaluronic Acid and vitamin E oil in it.  Although the list of ingredients is lengthy, what I base my decision on is: does this work?<br />This does.  The puffiness under my eyes, the crepe-y neck, the small lines on my forehead have all benefited from this gel.<br />A little does go a long way.  This is also perfect to use as an overnight serum on your skin.<br />Very happy with this.  Love the pump, love the product, love the results.\nReview Title: Excellent formula for neck, forehead, and eyes!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Vitamin C Serum 2 fl. oz with L'Ascorbic Acid - Facial Skin Care & Anti Aging Serum That Helps Skin Brightening, Repair Sun Damage, Fade Age Spots, Dark Circles, Wrinkles & Fine Lines\n{'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Item Weight': '0.31 Pounds', 'Unit Count': '2 Fl Oz', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.83 x 3.46 x 2.2 inches; 4.96 Ounces', 'UPC': '602519445008'}\nVery light feeling, clear serum that sinks into my skin with no stickiness at all.  It doesn't feel 'tacky' on my skin, but I'm so dry that it just soaked it right up!<br />The glass dropper is long enough to reach the bottom of the glass jar.  Looks and feels very 'vintage, like something off of an Apothecary's shelf.  If you're not a fan of the dropper, you can just use the bottle top that it comes with.<br />I didn't notice any discernable scent to this.  Not floral, not perfumey, just clean.  As soon as I rubbed it in, there was NO smell left on my hands.  It just disappeared.  This is one for the beauty stand.  Very good quality and I'm happy to have been able to test this at a reduced price from the company.\nSo light and soaked right into my skin\nUptown Cosmeceuticals Eyelash Growth Serum Contains Stem Cell & Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17, Dermatologist Lab Tested Lash & Eyebrow Growth Formula, 4 Months Supply 3.5ml\n{}\nStill waiting for the results.  I don't have terribly thick eyebrows so I wanted some of this to try out.  I've been applying it at bedtime and before I put my makeup on. It is a nice light viscous oil that doesn't weigh down my brow hairs.  Perhaps knowing that I've put something on my eyebrows makes me not fuss with them as much.  Time will tell, but so far, I like it.  I can use my Anastasia BH brow kit over this and it doesn't change the application at all (I dust a bit of setting powder on before)<br />I like it and will update if there is anything significant to tell!<br />If you feel that my review was helpful, please let me know by selecting \u201cYes\u201d from the options below.

MUST BUY NOW!!'<br />I wasn't too sure what to expect with this. I thought it was gimmicky, but I am happy to be proven wrong.<br />This is so much easier to use than a flat iron.<br />I like that it has a digital LCD that shows you what temperature the brush is heating up to.  It gives the heat range that your hair styling should be at depending on thickness, etc. I set mine to 230, the hottest setting and it worked great for my thick, curly hair.<br />It heats up very quickly and the hand grip is comfortable. The cord rotates from the end and the grip on the back of the wand feels nice in the hand.<br />The rubbery nubs on the ends of the bristles offer some flexibility, but they are not as flexible as your hairbrush. They are also shorter, too.<br />The way that you do this is to start with clean, well brushed hair.  As the bristles are short, they will not detangle for you.  Have your hair prepped and ready.  If you use a smoothing serum, it would be perfect to add it before you start with this.<br />You simply brush it over your hair like you would a hairbrush. You can brush from underneath or on top to make sure that all the hair gets close to the heated plate of the brush.<br />You can spend more time on areas that you want straightened more but I found that my doing my hair in pieces (held up with an alligator clip) worked best for me.<br />In order to get to the roots at the scalp, it was very easy.  The brush is easy to angle towards the scalp and it gets about 1/2&#34; away from the scalp easily and starts straightening from there.<br />If you hair is damp, you will see some steam, but you'd expect that with a curling iron or flatiron, too.<br />This actually worked so well, my kids wanted to try it out and they loved it!<br />The only concern that I had was that if you hair is the type to come out when you brush it, it will come out when you use this, too.  The issue was removing the hair from the straightener.  It is HOT. I had to work quickly to sweep the excess hair from the brush to toss.  I will keep a wide tooth comb by this the next time I use it so I can run it over the bristles and remove the hair.<br />All in all: I give this a strong thumbs up!<br />I can't speak about the others on the market, but this one really does what it says it will do.  It is way better than a flat iron.  It covers more ground and feels more comfortable in the hand.  Its a natural movement to brush your hair and this is no different.<br />Excellent new beauty tool!  Very happy that this does what it claims to do!
