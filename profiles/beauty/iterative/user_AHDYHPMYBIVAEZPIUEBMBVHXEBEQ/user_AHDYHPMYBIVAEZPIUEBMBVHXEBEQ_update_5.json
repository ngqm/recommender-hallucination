Longer next time. This time, I got the 14,16,18. The color is gorgeous and a true 30 color. I did lightly bleach it to bring that ombre 30 higher/closer to the weft (I wanted the lighter color closer to my eye area and not just on the bottom half of the hair. I attached photos to show how the curl pattern was affected by the bleach (deep curl pattern still in effect, just went from a jerry-4a to a 3b/3c (see the first and second pics). In that 2nd pic, the first section of hair is out of the pack, not washed or dyed; the second section of hair is the bleached portion, and the third piece is not bleached, only just cowashed. You can see beautiful curls in all three section, so feel free to wash or bleach (be careful, though), the curls seem to be here to stay. Lastly, the length is very true (slightly longer, actually).\nReview Title: Yes, yes, yes!!!!! I hope this seller stays in business 4ever!
