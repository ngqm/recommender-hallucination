Both take bleaching very well without losing the curl integrity (very important to me).  I mean, I bleached and toned and bleached again to get to the 27 color and the hair didn't fry.  The curly wavy still looks great after three months and I expect the kinky curly probably will, too.  Love this company and will continue to buy from them as long as the prices are this great.\nReview Title: BUY THIS FREAKING HAIR!!!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

They do not fail to fan out and quickly make themselves known.  Being so light keeps them from weighing down my own fragile lashes, which is a good thing.
