(included)', 'UPC': '666354185604'}\nReview Text: It seems you should go in one direction or it will pull the hair a bit.  In the other direction (you'll have to discover which way for your self), it is completely painless.  Even in the 'wrong' direction, it's not bad and I'm not super pain tolerant. Needs no batteries, so that's great, too.\nReview Title: So far, so good\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
