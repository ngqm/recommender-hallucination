They are good value for as many as you get, and they are very smooth and soft and don't soak up the make up into the sponge as much as some other I have tried so that the make up will actually stay on your face . They seem to be holding up quite well too and even after having them for a month they are not breaking and pilling up like others I have had. Good product!\nReview Title: Smooth finish!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Overall, I really like it, but I do think that the high setting could be a little stronger, it is a bit lower pressure than the tank ones. I had no problem filling the tank and it still does a good job on flossing my teeth. I also love that everything can fit in the nice case provided which makes it great for travel and keeps everything together.\nMostly good\nMakeup Blender Sponge Set - 4 Pack Latex Free Q-Soft Makeup Beauty Foundation Blending Sponge Flawless Smooth Brush for Liquid Foundation BB Creams Powders Concealer (4 Pack)\nFRESHME\n{'Brand': 'FRESHME', 'Color': 'Ivory', 'Material': 'Rubber', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.6 x 3.6 x 1.4 inches; 1.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '681413196902', 'Manufacturer': 'FRESHME'}\nThese work really well to blend make up so you don't have any lines on your face.
