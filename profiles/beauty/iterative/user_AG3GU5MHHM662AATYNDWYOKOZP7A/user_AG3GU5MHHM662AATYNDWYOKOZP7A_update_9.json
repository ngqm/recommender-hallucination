  "reference_summary": "Real Techniques Bold Metals: Diamond Sponge, Create Shadow or Highlighting, Multi Surfaced for Variety of Application, Synthetic Materials, Latex Free\nReal Techniques\n['Real Techniques Bold Metals: Diamond Sponge, Create Shadow or Highlighting, Multi Surfaced for Variety of Application, Synthetic Materials, Latex Free']\n{'Brand': 'Real Techniques', 'Color': 'Diamond', 'Material': 'Rubber', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '2.35 x 2 x 5.12 inches', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'For Highlighting', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2.35 x 2 x 5.12 inches; 0.48 Ounces', 'Item model number': '1552', 'UPC': '079625915525', 'Manufacturer': 'Paris Presents Incorporated'}\nVery versatile sponge for makeup application! Each shape has a different use, and they all work really well. Normally I just use a wedge sponge but this is much softer and works so much better! Especially great for blending! Would buy!\nNormally I just use a wedge sponge but this is much softer and works so much better! Especially great for blending\nWater Flosser Cordless Oral Irrigator Portable Rechargeable Dental Flossers with 5 Modes & 6 Tips Water Flossing with 300ml Water Tank for Home and Travel, Braces & Bridges Care (Blue)\nDuomishu\n{'Brand': 'Duomishu', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Special Feature': 'Por, Multiple Operation Modes, Multiple Tips', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Tank Volume': '300 Milliliters', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '9.9 x 5 x 3.1 inches; 1.2 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'hf-6', 'Batteries': '1 Lithium Ion batteries required. (included)', 'UPC': '786738939194', 'Manufacturer': 'Duomishu'}\nBefore this I used the electric tank water flossers, and while they work great, I have very limited counter space and hated how much room they took up, so I switched to this. Overall, I really like it, but I do think that the high setting could be a little stronger, it is a bit lower pressure than the tank ones. I had no problem filling the tank and it still does a good job on flossing my teeth. I also love that everything can fit in the nice case provided which makes it great for travel and keeps everything together.\nMostly good\nMakeup Blender Sponge Set - 4 Pack Latex Free Q-Soft Makeup Beauty Foundation Blending Sponge Flawless Smooth Brush for Liquid Foundation BB Creams Powders Concealer (4 Pack)\nFRESHME\n{'Brand': 'FRESHME', 'Color': 'Ivory', 'Material': 'Rubber', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.6 x 3.6 x 1.4 inches; 1.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '681413196902', 'Manufacturer': 'FRESHME'}\nThese work really well to blend make up so you don't have any lines on your face. They are good value for as many as you get, and they are very smooth and soft and don't soak up the make up into the sponge as much as some other I have tried so that the make up will actually stay on your face . They seem to be holding up quite well too and even after having them for a month they are not breaking and pilling up like others I have had. Good product!\nSmooth finish!\nLINGSFIRE Electric Foot File Callus Remover for Feet Speed Adjustable Professional Foot Polisher with 60Pcs Replacement Sandpaper Discs for Men Women Dry Dead Hard Cracked Skin or Calluses (Grey)\nLINGSFIRE\n{'Brand': 'LINGSFIRE', 'Material': 'Aluminum', 'Item Weight': '0.37 Pounds', 'Is Electric': 'Yes', 'Item Form': 'Filer', 'Package Dimensions': '8.94 x 5.24 x 2.4 inches; 5.92 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'QZ-XF6DPP-201012-1551'}\nI have used several other brands of battery-operated foot files and all have left me wishing they were better, this one is the best! At first, I wasn't thrilled that it had to be plugged in while being used, but it worked so well that I no longer mind. It took off a TON of dry skin from my heel and didn't hesitate to do so. I used it at full speed and it never was dangerous or hurt. It did the best job of getting rid of the driest skin, and it did so quickly! Throw the others in the trash and get this instead!\nBest I have used!\n100pcs Premium Quality Hair Clips, 20 Glossy Colors Snap Hair Clips, 2 Inch Hair Barrettes with Perfect Grip, Durable Colorful Hair Clips with Smooth Edges for Kids, Girls, Women\nFagaci\n{'Brand': 'Fagaci', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Color': 'Assorted', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material': 'Alloy Steel', 'Package Dimensions': '4.7 x 3.1 x 1 inches; 4.8 Ounces'}\nI have super fine hair so these are the only thing that works to clip my hair back, but they do wear out after a while so I am always interested in stocking up, and at this price it's a great way to have variety and quantity. They are a good assortment and well coated so they don't snag your hair, the clip snaps tight too to really keep a hold on things. They are very glossy, and if you like bright colors there are some brights in there, but also pastels and earth tones. I kept the neutral ones and small of the more muted colors and am giving the rest to my 13-year-old niece who loves bright colors.\nGood quality!\nColor Me Cosmetics Gel Manicure Kit with LED Lamp - DIY Gel Nail Starter Set with Prep, Base and Top Coat, 2 Gel Polish Colors & Nail Tools - Beginner Nail Kit with Everything You Need Made in USA*\nColor Me Cosmetics\n{'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'Color Me Cosmetics', 'Included Components': 'Top Coat, Nail File', 'Finish Type': 'Glossy', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Package Dimensions': '8.6 x 7.6 x 2.7 inches; 1.4 Pounds'}\nI got this for my sister who often goes to the salon to get her nails done. She was excited to get the kit, and impressed that it even included the light. The set was very simple to use and the finished results looked very high quality and have been lasting her for over a week so far. The one issue she had was the smell, but she says it doesn't last long. Overall, it's a nice quality product that even a beginner can use to get beautiful nails!\nBeginner friendly!\nAloe Vera Gel 100% Natural Moisturisers - Pure Organic Fresh Soothing Aloe-Vera Moisturizing Gel Skin Hair, Aloe Leaf Wash-free Clean After Sun Face Body (8.8 oz)\nCIMIY\n{'Brand': 'CIMIY', 'Scent': 'Aloe Vera', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Unit Count': '8.8 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Product Dimensions': '5.91 x 1.57 x 1.57 inches; 11.22 Ounces'}\nNothing beats aloe vera to treat burns for me, and this is a little easier to use than to cut off a leaf from a plant and apply it, though I have done that before too. This is a nice thick consistency but is still easy to spread and apply. It is mostly pure aloe vera gel and works very well to soothe and cover. This is a good value sized bottle and I expect it to last for quite awhile.\nGood stuff!\nPretty Frank Natural Deodorant - No Aluminum Deodorant for Women, Men, Teens, & Kids \u2013 Paraben Sulfate Free Solid Deodorant Featuring Shea Butter, Coconut Oil, Vitamin E & Baking Soda (Lavender)\nPRETTY FRANK\n{'Brand': 'PRETTY FRANK', 'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Scent': 'Lavender, Coconut', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '5.87 x 5.12 x 1.14 inches; 4.23 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'DSF-BS-LAV'}\nI've been a natural deodorant user for years and have tried many brands on the market, my favorite so far has been Native, which is also one of the most popular, so I thought I would do a comparison with that brand.<br /><br />Both are stick deodorants, but the PF deodorant has a larger case, and just a little more product, barely enough worth mentioning though. The deodorant on the PF brand slides on thicker and isn't as hard as the Native deodorant so it would be easier to apply too much with the PF than with Native. Not huge but something to consider.<br /><br />They both seem to do an equally good job at keeping odor away and I noticed no increase in odor while wearing the PF vs. the Native.<br /><br />Price-wise they are about the same so you really don't save money either way.<br /><br />Fragrance-wise I didn't really have a preference for one brand vs. the other, they both have a nice range of fragrance and there is enough variety to appeal to most people.<br /><br />Because of application, I will be sticking with Native, but if you are looking for something that glides on a bit thicker than this would be the best choice.\nA great option!\nSUPRENT Razors for Men with Matrix Cutter Head, 38.5\u00b0 Golden Angle Shaving Kit for Men, Travelling Razor Kit-1 Mens Razor Handle, 2 Blade Refills,1 Dock,1 Shave Foam\nSUPRENT\n{'Brand': 'SUPRENT', 'Number of Blades': '6', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Handle Material': 'Metal', 'Product Dimensions': '3.94 x 3.94 x 1.97 inches; 1.28 Pounds'}\nNot a dude but I have plenty of curves so I can testify to how well these work on curves and because of the shape of these they are easy to use on all curves.
