It is more natural looking and feeling. It is not heavy or too full. This wig has a nice length and color. It is shiny, but not baby doll hair shiny. If worn correctly (with a little help from YouTube) you can achieve a very real and natural look wearing this wig. I was very impressed with this wig. It fits nicely and can be adjusted to fit your head. It is pretty secure without any extra items needed.\nReview Title: Good quality wig\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

It is a big long and heavy for my liking. I definitely wouldn\u2019t be comfortable wearing this wig everyday. It is fun for trying a different look or dressing up for Halloween or a party. It is a very full wig, and doesn\u2019t shed much. It holds the waves through several wears. The color is natural and beautiful. It does fit well, and it doesn\u2019t come off easily.\nGreat wig for a natural look, but a bit heavy\nStraight 13x4 Lace Front Wigs Burgundy Lace Front Wigs Long Bob Synthetic Ombre Wine Red Wig Pre-plucked with Baby Hair Free Part Heat Resistant Synthetic Lace Wigs for Women 20 Inch\nNOBLE\n{'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Special Feature': 'Heat Resistant', 'Brand': 'NOBLE', 'Package Dimensions': '13.74 x 7.87 x 2.2 inches; 12.63 Ounces'}\nThis is one of my favorite wigs.
