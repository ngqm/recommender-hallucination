It is a big long and heavy for my liking. I definitely wouldn\u2019t be comfortable wearing this wig everyday. It is fun for trying a different look or dressing up for Halloween or a party. It is a very full wig, and doesn\u2019t shed much. It holds the waves through several wears. The color is natural and beautiful. It does fit well, and it doesn\u2019t come off easily.\nReview Title: Great wig for a natural look, but a bit heavy\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
