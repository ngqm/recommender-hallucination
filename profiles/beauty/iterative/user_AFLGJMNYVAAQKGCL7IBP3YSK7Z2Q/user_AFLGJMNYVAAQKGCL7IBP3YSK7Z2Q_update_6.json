The quality is much better than the ones in the party stores. The hair isn\u2019t too rough or too smooth. It doesn\u2019t have that shiny wig look. It\u2019s beautifully colored and styled. It\u2019s really easy to install as is. It wasn\u2019t too heavy. Most long wigs tend to be really heavy, and uncomfortable to wear for hours on end. This wig wasn\u2019t uncomfortable at all. It tangles a little, but if you\u2019re rarely wearing it, that won\u2019t be a problem. Overall, I would recommend this wig.\nReview Title: Cute, fun, party wig\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "HANNE None Lace Long Natural Wave Ombre Brown to Blonde Synthetic Wigs for Black Women High Density Heat Resistant Middle Part Wavy Synthetic Hair Party/Cosplay Party/Halloween Wigs (4/30/27 Wavy)\nHANNE\n{'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy', 'Style': 'Wavy', 'Special Feature': 'Heat Resistant', 'Brand': 'HANNE', 'Package Dimensions': '10.19 x 8.66 x 3.26 inches; 11.53 Ounces'}\nReally cute wig. It is a big long and heavy for my liking. I definitely wouldn\u2019t be comfortable wearing this wig everyday. It is fun for trying a different look or dressing up for Halloween or a party. It is a very full wig, and doesn\u2019t shed much. It holds the waves through several wears. The color is natural and beautiful. It does fit well, and it doesn\u2019t come off easily.\nGreat wig for a natural look, but a bit heavy\nStraight 13x4 Lace Front Wigs Burgundy Lace Front Wigs Long Bob Synthetic Ombre Wine Red Wig Pre-plucked with Baby Hair Free Part Heat Resistant Synthetic Lace Wigs for Women 20 Inch\nNOBLE\n{'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Special Feature': 'Heat Resistant', 'Brand': 'NOBLE', 'Package Dimensions': '13.74 x 7.87 x 2.2 inches; 12.63 Ounces'}\nThis is one of my favorite wigs. It is more natural looking and feeling. It is not heavy or too full. This wig has a nice length and color. It is shiny, but not baby doll hair shiny. If worn correctly (with a little help from YouTube) you can achieve a very real and natural look wearing this wig. I was very impressed with this wig. It fits nicely and can be adjusted to fit your head. It is pretty secure without any extra items needed.\nGood quality wig\nAISI QUEENS Short Curly Wig Black Wavy Bob Wigs for Women Synthetic Middle Part Shoudler Length Heat Resistant Wig for Daily Party Use 14 Inch\nAISI QUEENS\n{'Hair Type': 'Wig,Curly Wig', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Special Feature': 'Heat Resistant', 'Brand': 'AISI QUEENS', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '13.5 x 9.02 x 1.77 inches; 8.47 Ounces'}\nThis wig is great. It isn\u2019t heavy and is easy to put on. It is synthetic, so if you\u2019re looking for something more realistic, you\u2019ll have to make some adjustments to it. I wore it for fun, and not as something for going out. Wigs are new to me, so I kind of just wear them as is for now. I like that this wig was a nice length, and natural color and style right out the pack. Overall, this is a pretty good wig. It doesn\u2019t shed, and would be good for like Halloween, parties, or just to have fun and try something new.\nBeautiful wig. Nice and lightweight.\nLong Straight Highlights Wigs for Women Synthetic Blonde Highlights Hair Wigs Natural Looking Middle Part Ombre Brown Heat Resistant Fiber Daily Cosplay Party\nBEAUTY FLAG\n{'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Special Feature': 'Heat Resistant', 'Brand': 'BEAUTY FLAG', 'Package Dimensions': '12.32 x 8.15 x 2.64 inches; 10.58 Ounces'}\nI really didn\u2019t like this wig. It has a thick piece in the front that makes it look obvious you\u2019re wearing a wig. Plus there was just too much hair in the face area. It would take some work to make this wig wearable for me.\nThe hair is way to full in the face\nLong Black Wavy Wig with Bangs for Women Synthetic Wigs Natural Looking Realistic Wigs Hair for Daily Party Cosplay Use\nHNYBEE\n{'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '24 x 6.3 x 1.57 inches', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy', 'Style': 'Wavy', 'Brand': 'HNYBEE', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '24 x 6.3 x 1.57 inches; 14.32 Ounces', 'UPC': '723509998806'}\nI like the look and feel of this wig. It is a little more full than I prefer, but it\u2019s not a problem. The style and color are just as pictured. I like that this wig is soft too. The only issue I have is with the tangling. It tangles way too easily and badly. If you get this wig, it will need to be on a stand to avoid the tangles.\nOverall, this is a nice synthetic wig\nNOBLE Wigs for White Women Purple Lace Wigs for Black Women 27 Inch Long Curly Wavy Colored Wigs Middle Part Heat Resistant Synthetic Ombre Purple Wavy Wigs for Daily Party Cosplay Use\nNOBLE\n{'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Special Feature': 'Heat Resistant', 'Brand': 'NOBLE', 'Package Dimensions': '13.78 x 7.76 x 2.44 inches; 14.07 Ounces'}\nI like this wig, because it is great to wear as a costume wig.
