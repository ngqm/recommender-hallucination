  "reference_summary": "HANNE None Lace Long Natural Wave Ombre Brown to Blonde Synthetic Wigs for Black Women High Density Heat Resistant Middle Part Wavy Synthetic Hair Party/Cosplay Party/Halloween Wigs (4/30/27 Wavy)\nHANNE\n{'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy', 'Style': 'Wavy', 'Special Feature': 'Heat Resistant', 'Brand': 'HANNE', 'Package Dimensions': '10.19 x 8.66 x 3.26 inches; 11.53 Ounces'}\nReally cute wig. It is a big long and heavy for my liking. I definitely wouldn\u2019t be comfortable wearing this wig everyday. It is fun for trying a different look or dressing up for Halloween or a party. It is a very full wig, and doesn\u2019t shed much. It holds the waves through several wears. The color is natural and beautiful. It does fit well, and it doesn\u2019t come off easily.\nGreat wig for a natural look, but a bit heavy\nStraight 13x4 Lace Front Wigs Burgundy Lace Front Wigs Long Bob Synthetic Ombre Wine Red Wig Pre-plucked with Baby Hair Free Part Heat Resistant Synthetic Lace Wigs for Women 20 Inch\nNOBLE\n{'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Special Feature': 'Heat Resistant', 'Brand': 'NOBLE', 'Package Dimensions': '13.74 x 7.87 x 2.2 inches; 12.63 Ounces'}\nThis is one of my favorite wigs. It is more natural looking and feeling. It is not heavy or too full. This wig has a nice length and color. It is shiny, but not baby doll hair shiny. If worn correctly (with a little help from YouTube) you can achieve a very real and natural look wearing this wig. I was very impressed with this wig. It fits nicely and can be adjusted to fit your head. It is pretty secure without any extra items needed.\nGood quality wig\nAISI QUEENS Short Curly Wig Black Wavy Bob Wigs for Women Synthetic Middle Part Shoudler Length Heat Resistant Wig for Daily Party Use 14 Inch\nAISI QUEENS\n{'Hair Type': 'Wig,Curly Wig', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Special Feature': 'Heat Resistant', 'Brand': 'AISI QUEENS', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '13.5 x 9.02 x 1.77 inches; 8.47 Ounces'}\nThis wig is great. It isn\u2019t heavy and is easy to put on. It is synthetic, so if you\u2019re looking for something more realistic, you\u2019ll have to make some adjustments to it. I wore it for fun, and not as something for going out. Wigs are new to me, so I kind of just wear them as is for now. I like that this wig was a nice length, and natural color and style right out the pack. Overall, this is a pretty good wig. It doesn\u2019t shed, and would be good for like Halloween, parties, or just to have fun and try something new.\nBeautiful wig.
