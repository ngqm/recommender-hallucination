The bangs are long enough to trim to my preference. The inside clips provide extra security, which was great. This is not what I would call a daily wig. This is one I'm going to keep strictly for pictures or video recording. It is very wiggy and tangles in seconds. Gorgeous wig, but don't rely on it for everyday and extended outdoor use.\nReview Title: Good for pictures and videos\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "LOVE CINEMA Curl & Volume-up Mascara 111\nLOVE CINEMA\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.47 x 0.87 x 0.67 inches; 1.02 Ounces', 'UPC': '795827835224'}\nThe mascara does a great job. No clumping or flaking. I was able to go in with multiple coats without clumping as as I wore it throughout the day, I didn't notice any flakes on my face. I honestly didn't notice any extra lengthening or volumizing with this product though. It goes on easily though. It is one of the few mascaras that I experienced absolutely no clumping with, so I'll be a return customer just for that alone as clumping is a huge pet peeve of mine. I recommend, just don't expect miracles. It is a great mascara regardless.\nGood, just nothing special\nMRTREUP Hair Brush Spray Set With Detangling Wide Tooth Comb And Detanger Brush For Curly Hair With Hair Mist Spray Bottle 10oz Curl Hair Tools For Women Men Black Natural Hair 3a To 4c Hair Types\nMRTREUP\n{'Brand': 'MRTREUP', 'Shape': 'Oblong', 'Handle Material': 'Plastic', 'Product Benefits': 'Detangle', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Product Dimensions': '10 x 2 x 5 inches; 9.59 Ounces'}\nI originally ordered this with he hopes of using this for my own thick hair, but didn't get much mileage from the brushes. The comb was good for detangling before and during my hair wash routine, but the brushes were too pliable for me to get a decent use out of them, I was just getting frustrated. Even after applying product, I was unimpressed. However, I have been using them as wig brushes and they work perfectly for finer, thinner hair types. Hands down, the mister is the best product out of the bunch. Have been using it continuously for a while now and it's worked flawlessly.\nGood for wigs. The mister is the best part.\n5 Pieces Nail Brushes for Nail Art Nail Design Brushes Dotting Tools for Nails Nail Detail Brush Double-Ended Brush and Dotting Tool Kit\nMcduyant\n{'Brand': 'Mcduyant', 'Handle Material': 'Plastic', 'Head Material': 'Nylon', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '9.33 x 3.03 x 0.39 inches; 1.41 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'JYM-10'}\nThis set is so cute and an added plus is the dual end sites with a brush and dotter tool. The dotting tools are different sizes, llowing you more options for designs. I especially love the two thin line brushes that allow me to do more fine, detailed designs. Highly recommend to get the basics and start a collection.\nGreat starer brushes\nProfessional Electric Nail Drill, Rechargeable 35000 RPM E-File Nail Drill Kit for Gel, Acrylic Nails, Manicure Pedicure Polishing Tools with 16 Pcs Bits, Great for Home or Salon (Black)\nPLIISLUP\n{'Brand': 'PLIISLUP', 'Color': 'Black', 'Material': 'Aluminum, Metal', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '6.8 x 2.7 x 0.9 inches', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Product Dimensions': '6.8 x 2.7 x 0.9 inches; 1.32 Pounds', 'Batteries': '1 Lithium Ion batteries required. (included)', 'Manufacturer': 'PLIISLUP'}\nThe drill is nice and quiet, it runs so smooth. It was such a breeze work with and I find myself reaching for it out of all the drills I have. I love the variety of the different drill bits and accessories it comes with. This is a great first drill for first timers and beginners. It's easy to work with and not daunting to use.\nSmooth and quiet\nBeauty Bakerie Lip Whip Liquid Metallic Lipstick, Long Lasting Lip Color, Smudge Proof Makeup, Berried, 3.5 mL\nBeauty Bakerie\n['Beauty Bakerie Berried metallic Lip whip is a metallic red liquid lipstick with hints of deep purple. It is long-lasting, smudge-proof and waterproof. Glides smoothly over lips, It is a weightless and non-sticky texture.']\n{'Brand': 'Beauty Bakerie', 'Color': 'Berried', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Finish Type': 'Metallic', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '0.59 x 0.59 x 3.54 inches; 0.71 Ounces', 'Item model number': '754680458186', 'UPC': '754680458186', 'Manufacturer': 'Beauty Bakerie Cosmetics Brand'}\nThe color is beautifully pigmented and actually maintains a metallic look on the lips. I only needed to do one coat. I will say the longevity isn't that great. It lasted about an hour of me just talking and started settling in the lines and cracks of my lips, so it required constant reapplication. Stunning color, but a bit of a hassle. I love the applicator though.\nLove the applicator\nHMD Ombre Blonde Wig with Bangs Long Ombre Blonde Wigs for Women Wavy Synthetic Ombre Blonde Wig Heat Resistant fiber for Halloween Cosplay Daily Party Wigs\nHMD\n{'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy, Curly', 'Special Feature': 'Heat Resistant', 'Brand': 'HMD', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult'}\nThe color is gorgeous and the hair is incredibly soft.
