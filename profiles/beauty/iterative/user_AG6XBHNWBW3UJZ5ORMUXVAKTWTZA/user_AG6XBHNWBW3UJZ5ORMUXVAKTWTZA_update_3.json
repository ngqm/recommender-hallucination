The dotting tools are different sizes, llowing you more options for designs. I especially love the two thin line brushes that allow me to do more fine, detailed designs. Highly recommend to get the basics and start a collection.\nReview Title: Great starer brushes\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "LOVE CINEMA Curl & Volume-up Mascara 111\nLOVE CINEMA\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.47 x 0.87 x 0.67 inches; 1.02 Ounces', 'UPC': '795827835224'}\nThe mascara does a great job. No clumping or flaking. I was able to go in with multiple coats without clumping as as I wore it throughout the day, I didn't notice any flakes on my face. I honestly didn't notice any extra lengthening or volumizing with this product though. It goes on easily though. It is one of the few mascaras that I experienced absolutely no clumping with, so I'll be a return customer just for that alone as clumping is a huge pet peeve of mine. I recommend, just don't expect miracles. It is a great mascara regardless.\nGood, just nothing special\nMRTREUP Hair Brush Spray Set With Detangling Wide Tooth Comb And Detanger Brush For Curly Hair With Hair Mist Spray Bottle 10oz Curl Hair Tools For Women Men Black Natural Hair 3a To 4c Hair Types\nMRTREUP\n{'Brand': 'MRTREUP', 'Shape': 'Oblong', 'Handle Material': 'Plastic', 'Product Benefits': 'Detangle', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Product Dimensions': '10 x 2 x 5 inches; 9.59 Ounces'}\nI originally ordered this with he hopes of using this for my own thick hair, but didn't get much mileage from the brushes. The comb was good for detangling before and during my hair wash routine, but the brushes were too pliable for me to get a decent use out of them, I was just getting frustrated. Even after applying product, I was unimpressed. However, I have been using them as wig brushes and they work perfectly for finer, thinner hair types. Hands down, the mister is the best product out of the bunch. Have been using it continuously for a while now and it's worked flawlessly.\nGood for wigs. The mister is the best part.\n5 Pieces Nail Brushes for Nail Art Nail Design Brushes Dotting Tools for Nails Nail Detail Brush Double-Ended Brush and Dotting Tool Kit\nMcduyant\n{'Brand': 'Mcduyant', 'Handle Material': 'Plastic', 'Head Material': 'Nylon', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '9.33 x 3.03 x 0.39 inches; 1.41 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'JYM-10'}\nThis set is so cute and an added plus is the dual end sites with a brush and dotter tool.
