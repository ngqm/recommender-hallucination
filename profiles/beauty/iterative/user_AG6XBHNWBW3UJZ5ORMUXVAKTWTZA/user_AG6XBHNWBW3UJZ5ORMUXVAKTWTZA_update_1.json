No clumping or flaking. I was able to go in with multiple coats without clumping as as I wore it throughout the day, I didn't notice any flakes on my face. I honestly didn't notice any extra lengthening or volumizing with this product though. It goes on easily though. It is one of the few mascaras that I experienced absolutely no clumping with, so I'll be a return customer just for that alone as clumping is a huge pet peeve of mine. I recommend, just don't expect miracles. It is a great mascara regardless.\nReview Title: Good, just nothing special\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
