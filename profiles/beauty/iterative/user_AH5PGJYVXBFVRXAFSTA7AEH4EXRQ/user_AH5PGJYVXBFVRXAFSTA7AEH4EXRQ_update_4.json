When I order next I'll be ordering the shorter hair.  The weight of the hair for 20 pieces, is 50grams, so for each longer strand you have a finer tape in weft. With the shorter lengths you get a little more fullness in other words but typically the good brands still make sure they are clear about the weight of the hair you get in grams. My hair is so fine that one bundle of 20 nearly is enough, but I buy 2 sets and end up using 4 rows of about 6 extensions each then complete the look with a topper because my crown is so thin the extensions and scalp shows. I'll be toning these extensions but this is how they look as they came, with no color correction. B 8-18-60. Which is usually the color I order, but this is better. This color matches my hair better than the brand I have been using.<br /><br />I do a single weft application using a single sided tape to finish the back side of the weft and seal the tape. You must seal the backside of the tape or the weft will fall out, or make a mess of your hair. Many people need 4 or more sets to do a full head of hair. Some people with thicker and stronger hair will use two full wefts back to back and will not need the single sided tape. There are you tube videos about DIY application of tape in extensions. There are many steps and I'm skipping most of it. It's not that hard and you'll enjoy the convenience and savings by doing this yourself. Your biggest challenge is finding good hair and good tapes. This time used Glam single sided tapes and that worked great. expensive but good and you get 36 in the package. I use walker double sided tapes, they come in packages of 120 and have worked for me but they are stiff. This brand has tapes, and I'll be checking out their tapes soon.  I will have to update to let you know how they last and how easy or difficult they are to remove. Typically my tape in hair lasts about 6 weeks and then due to growth there is a need to take them out and put them back in again, moving them up closer to the scalp. 6 to 8 weeks is typically when you go to the salon to get cut and root touch ups too. This isn't really about hold or the extensions coming out, although some may come out. This is about limiting damage to the hair and just keeping the connection point closer to the scalp. They feel good, the hair quality seems great. There is far less red in this hair than typical of the dark blonds or ash blond roots.  This color combination is good. The description says silky straight but I prefer some body wave, and as you can see when you wet this hair there is a little natural wave that comes out. That's perfect. I've offered plenty of photos. The kit that the hair came with is nice too. Some double sided tapes to refresh your weft after you clean them in 6 weeks or so.  To remove the wefts I typically just stick my finger nail between the two layers of tape and put a drop or two with a dropper of alcohol 91 percent will work but 99 is better. This usually works to safely loosen the glue bond and remove the hair. I tried the oil based removers and it just complicates things. The best removers are mostly alcohol. I'll update this review in 6 to 8 weeks. For now, I'd recommend these extension for the hair and weft quality and accuracy of color and weight.  Good value. 5 starts. I hope they keep this up.\nReview Title: Excellent tape in hair extensions\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Glam Seamless Single Sided Tape for Hair Extension, Replacement Tape for Tape in Hair Extensions - 48 Tape Tabs\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4 x 2.5 x 0.3 inches; 0.64 Ounces'}\nThey work well, a much needed thing for fine hair and tape in extensions. The key is to use the tape in extension that has tape already, and rather than sandwiching too tape in extensions together (too heavy for fine hair) you use the single sided tape for the other side. I watched many videos on how to do this and I did it myself and they feel fine. There aren't very many pieces in this package for the price, however. It's a bit expensive for only 48 pieces. I nearly used all of them for one application.<br />Update:  After a full month of having the extensions in. Over-all a good experience but will not order these tapes again.<br />I am changing my rating in follow up.  Impossible to remove without damaging hair. The glue warmed and leaked out the sides over time and caught my hair in the leaked glue. This shortened the length of time I could wear the extensions. I tried to use this one sided tape and it is very shiny, you can see the glimmer of the tape. Not shine free.  I would not use this on fine hair.\nShiny finish, not invisible.Glare under lights is visible with fine hair.\nLDR by Baysyx - Restorative Glow Hydro Boost Moisturizer | Nourishing Hydration Cream with Collagen Stimulation | Fortified with Hyaluronic Acid | Made in The USA from Natural Ingredients (1.7 Oz)\nLDR\n{'Brand': 'LDR', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '6.3 x 1.2 x 1.1 inches; 1.7 Ounces', 'UPC': '725835779579', 'Manufacturer': 'LDR'}\nThe fragrance is nice and light, subtle like a soft lemon dessert. The bottle seems oversized for the amount of product inside, and as I popped the top up the bottom slipped up and the cap fell off the inner bottle. Photo is provided so you can see what I mean, it's not a deal breaker but for the vanity it will bother people. It's a glamorous container and product, so I'm sure this flaw isn't intended. I offer a photo of one pump of product in my palm. It spreads over the skin nicely and absorbs well. One pump is nearly enough for the entire face, I also have used the lotion on my elbows, backs of my hands, neck and decolletage.  So far the lotion is reacting well with my skin and I like it. The container is attractive and it does fit the hand well and feels comfortable to hold.  The product is gentle and feels good on the skin. I'll check back with results and feedback after one bottle.\nSmells great, light lemony fragrance, silky texture.\nALL\u00c9GRESSE 24 KARAT SKINCARE Gold Refining Facial Serum - Anti Aging & Anti Wrinkle Serum for Plumper, Firmer and Smoother Skin \u2013 Formulated With Progeline, Superox-C, 1 oz\nALL\u00c9GRESSE 24 KARAT SKINCARE\n{'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Product Benefits': '24 Karat Gold.

Usually the under eye area darkness, under eye wrinkles, puffiness, and crows feet are treated and diminished within minutes of first application and improves the look of make up in those areas as well. Perhaps over time the texture of the skin improves with continued use but can backslide if product use is discontinued.<br /><br /> I have not seen much improvement, immediate or over the few days with use twice daily while using this product, unfortunately. Also, I'm not sure when we are supposed to use this product. Perhaps over night? The reason why I mention this is that the product doesn't absorb into the skin cleanly, but rather is tacky to the touch and feels heavy. I didn't notice any fragrance, but I make candles and am probably nose blind at the moment. The product feels like a watery jelly, because it is mostly water and aloe gel.  It does have gold flecks in it and they seem to break up and disappear when on the skin, massaged. I haven't seen any help for fine lines or skin texture. This is a photo taken right now. Un-retouched The left side of the photo is the 24k serum side, after three days and after recent application. The right side is immediate results of another product I use applied within a half hour of the photo. It works so fast, even I couldn't believe the photo. The lines on the other side are pretty bad actually, which means I've back slid over the last few days and have more trouble. I've been using the 24K serum on half of my face, the right side of my face only. As to the right side of the photo and left side of my face, I'm not pulling on it or doing anything to make the skin look better, less wrinkled or tighter, I just put the serum on and wrote for a bit and then took the photo to complete this review. The right side serum is from a farmer's market made by a local person, Julia's. This roll on was only 15 dollars and I've been using it for under eye area on days when I wear makeup,  for a few months.  I felt I should offer a photo, although not a great photo and it's not flattering at all. I'll continue to try it, but at my age I need all the help I can get and don't want to backslide.\nNot too convinced about claims after use for a few days.\nLovrio 20\" 20 Pcs 50g Tape in Human Hair Balayage Ash Brown/Light Chestnut Brown Fading to Dirty Blonde and Platinum Blonde B8-18-60 Silky Straight Hair\nLOVRIO\n{'Brand': 'LOVRIO', 'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Extension Length': '20 Inches', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '10.28 x 4.13 x 1.93 inches; 6.38 Ounces', 'UPC': '633085357044'}\nThese are 20\" extensions, and I usually order 14\" or 16\". 20\" is on the long side and I will be trimming the length for my taste and toning the hair as well.
