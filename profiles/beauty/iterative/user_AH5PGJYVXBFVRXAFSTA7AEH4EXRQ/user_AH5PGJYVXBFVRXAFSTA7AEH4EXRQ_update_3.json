Usually the under eye area darkness, under eye wrinkles, puffiness, and crows feet are treated and diminished within minutes of first application and improves the look of make up in those areas as well. Perhaps over time the texture of the skin improves with continued use but can backslide if product use is discontinued.<br /><br /> I have not seen much improvement, immediate or over the few days with use twice daily while using this product, unfortunately. Also, I'm not sure when we are supposed to use this product. Perhaps over night? The reason why I mention this is that the product doesn't absorb into the skin cleanly, but rather is tacky to the touch and feels heavy. I didn't notice any fragrance, but I make candles and am probably nose blind at the moment. The product feels like a watery jelly, because it is mostly water and aloe gel.  It does have gold flecks in it and they seem to break up and disappear when on the skin, massaged. I haven't seen any help for fine lines or skin texture. This is a photo taken right now. Un-retouched The left side of the photo is the 24k serum side, after three days and after recent application. The right side is immediate results of another product I use applied within a half hour of the photo. It works so fast, even I couldn't believe the photo. The lines on the other side are pretty bad actually, which means I've back slid over the last few days and have more trouble. I've been using the 24K serum on half of my face, the right side of my face only. As to the right side of the photo and left side of my face, I'm not pulling on it or doing anything to make the skin look better, less wrinkled or tighter, I just put the serum on and wrote for a bit and then took the photo to complete this review. The right side serum is from a farmer's market made by a local person, Julia's. This roll on was only 15 dollars and I've been using it for under eye area on days when I wear makeup,  for a few months.  I felt I should offer a photo, although not a great photo and it's not flattering at all. I'll continue to try it, but at my age I need all the help I can get and don't want to backslide.\nReview Title: Not too convinced about claims after use for a few days.\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Glam Seamless Single Sided Tape for Hair Extension, Replacement Tape for Tape in Hair Extensions - 48 Tape Tabs\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4 x 2.5 x 0.3 inches; 0.64 Ounces'}\nThey work well, a much needed thing for fine hair and tape in extensions. The key is to use the tape in extension that has tape already, and rather than sandwiching too tape in extensions together (too heavy for fine hair) you use the single sided tape for the other side. I watched many videos on how to do this and I did it myself and they feel fine. There aren't very many pieces in this package for the price, however. It's a bit expensive for only 48 pieces. I nearly used all of them for one application.<br />Update:  After a full month of having the extensions in. Over-all a good experience but will not order these tapes again.<br />I am changing my rating in follow up.  Impossible to remove without damaging hair. The glue warmed and leaked out the sides over time and caught my hair in the leaked glue. This shortened the length of time I could wear the extensions. I tried to use this one sided tape and it is very shiny, you can see the glimmer of the tape. Not shine free.  I would not use this on fine hair.\nShiny finish, not invisible.Glare under lights is visible with fine hair.\nLDR by Baysyx - Restorative Glow Hydro Boost Moisturizer | Nourishing Hydration Cream with Collagen Stimulation | Fortified with Hyaluronic Acid | Made in The USA from Natural Ingredients (1.7 Oz)\nLDR\n{'Brand': 'LDR', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '6.3 x 1.2 x 1.1 inches; 1.7 Ounces', 'UPC': '725835779579', 'Manufacturer': 'LDR'}\nThe fragrance is nice and light, subtle like a soft lemon dessert. The bottle seems oversized for the amount of product inside, and as I popped the top up the bottom slipped up and the cap fell off the inner bottle. Photo is provided so you can see what I mean, it's not a deal breaker but for the vanity it will bother people. It's a glamorous container and product, so I'm sure this flaw isn't intended. I offer a photo of one pump of product in my palm. It spreads over the skin nicely and absorbs well. One pump is nearly enough for the entire face, I also have used the lotion on my elbows, backs of my hands, neck and decolletage.  So far the lotion is reacting well with my skin and I like it. The container is attractive and it does fit the hand well and feels comfortable to hold.  The product is gentle and feels good on the skin. I'll check back with results and feedback after one bottle.\nSmells great, light lemony fragrance, silky texture.\nALL\u00c9GRESSE 24 KARAT SKINCARE Gold Refining Facial Serum - Anti Aging & Anti Wrinkle Serum for Plumper, Firmer and Smoother Skin \u2013 Formulated With Progeline, Superox-C, 1 oz\nALL\u00c9GRESSE 24 KARAT SKINCARE\n{'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Product Benefits': '24 Karat Gold.
