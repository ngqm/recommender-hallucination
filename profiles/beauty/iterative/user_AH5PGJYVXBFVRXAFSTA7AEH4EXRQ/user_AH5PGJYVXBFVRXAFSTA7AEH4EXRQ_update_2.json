The bottle seems oversized for the amount of product inside, and as I popped the top up the bottom slipped up and the cap fell off the inner bottle. Photo is provided so you can see what I mean, it's not a deal breaker but for the vanity it will bother people. It's a glamorous container and product, so I'm sure this flaw isn't intended. I offer a photo of one pump of product in my palm. It spreads over the skin nicely and absorbs well. One pump is nearly enough for the entire face, I also have used the lotion on my elbows, backs of my hands, neck and decolletage.  So far the lotion is reacting well with my skin and I like it. The container is attractive and it does fit the hand well and feels comfortable to hold.  The product is gentle and feels good on the skin. I'll check back with results and feedback after one bottle.\nReview Title: Smells great, light lemony fragrance, silky texture.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Glam Seamless Single Sided Tape for Hair Extension, Replacement Tape for Tape in Hair Extensions - 48 Tape Tabs\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4 x 2.5 x 0.3 inches; 0.64 Ounces'}\nThey work well, a much needed thing for fine hair and tape in extensions. The key is to use the tape in extension that has tape already, and rather than sandwiching too tape in extensions together (too heavy for fine hair) you use the single sided tape for the other side. I watched many videos on how to do this and I did it myself and they feel fine. There aren't very many pieces in this package for the price, however. It's a bit expensive for only 48 pieces. I nearly used all of them for one application.<br />Update:  After a full month of having the extensions in. Over-all a good experience but will not order these tapes again.<br />I am changing my rating in follow up.  Impossible to remove without damaging hair. The glue warmed and leaked out the sides over time and caught my hair in the leaked glue. This shortened the length of time I could wear the extensions. I tried to use this one sided tape and it is very shiny, you can see the glimmer of the tape. Not shine free.  I would not use this on fine hair.\nShiny finish, not invisible.Glare under lights is visible with fine hair.\nLDR by Baysyx - Restorative Glow Hydro Boost Moisturizer | Nourishing Hydration Cream with Collagen Stimulation | Fortified with Hyaluronic Acid | Made in The USA from Natural Ingredients (1.7 Oz)\nLDR\n{'Brand': 'LDR', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '6.3 x 1.2 x 1.1 inches; 1.7 Ounces', 'UPC': '725835779579', 'Manufacturer': 'LDR'}\nThe fragrance is nice and light, subtle like a soft lemon dessert.
