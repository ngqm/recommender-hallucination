It is definitely not your average foundation.  It blends in almost immediately with your own skin color because of this, it never looks caked on or leaves makeup lines around the jawline.  It has an SPF coverage of 15 which is a nice added bonus.  The foundation seems to leave a nice cross between matte and dewy while minimizing the pores.  It is much more moisturizing then the average foundation also.  My skin used to be on the dryer side and now I have normal skin thanks to this product.\nReview Title: Colour Changing Foundation\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Flawless Finish Foundation, Colour Changing Foundation, All-Day Flawless Foundation Makeup, Covering Imperfections Liquid Complete Foundation, Suitable for ALL Skin Types\nCIDBEST\n{'Package Dimensions': '4.49 x 1.65 x 1.3 inches; 4.13 Ounces'}\nThis makeup is crazy.  It comes out of the bottle looking like a white colored moisturizer.  When applied to the face, it immediately begins to blend with the color of the skin right before your eyes.  It has somewhat of a weird smell if you put your nose up to the bottle.  I didn't notice it once I applied or throughout the day.  This makeup does not come off onto your clothes like regular foundation.  It comes off the same way it went on.  When applying it, it goes on more like moisturizer then makeup.  Its got SPF in it so it takes an extra swipe or two to get it to completely blend in but when it does its so lightweight, you don't even notice its there. It just leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth.  Oh and you don't get that later in the day shiney look with this makeup.  It really is pretty cool stuff!\nDoesn't leave marks on clothes!\nFlawless Liquid Foundation Cream, Liquid Foundation, Colour Changing Foundation, BB Cream, Long Lasting, Invisible Pores, Base Nude Face Moisturizing Liquid Cover Concealer,Universal for ALL Skin Type\nCherioll\n{'Brand': 'Cherioll', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Unit Count': '1.35 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '4.76 x 1.57 x 1.5 inches; 3.63 Ounces'}\nThis foundation is like no other foundation.
