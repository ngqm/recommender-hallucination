The heads can be switched out with the twist of the top then you just pop the other one on with another twist.  So it is easy enough to use plus it is wireless!  We didn't need to recharge it for almost 30 days exactly!  So it definitely holds a good charge and it doesn't take long to fully charge.  I like all of the different attachment options but I would have liked it if it came with a stand or a bag to keep track of everything when it is not being used.\nReview Title: Wireless Nose & Ear Trimmer...\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Flawless Finish Foundation, Colour Changing Foundation, All-Day Flawless Foundation Makeup, Covering Imperfections Liquid Complete Foundation, Suitable for ALL Skin Types\nCIDBEST\n{'Package Dimensions': '4.49 x 1.65 x 1.3 inches; 4.13 Ounces'}\nThis makeup is crazy.  It comes out of the bottle looking like a white colored moisturizer.  When applied to the face, it immediately begins to blend with the color of the skin right before your eyes.  It has somewhat of a weird smell if you put your nose up to the bottle.  I didn't notice it once I applied or throughout the day.  This makeup does not come off onto your clothes like regular foundation.  It comes off the same way it went on.  When applying it, it goes on more like moisturizer then makeup.  Its got SPF in it so it takes an extra swipe or two to get it to completely blend in but when it does its so lightweight, you don't even notice its there. It just leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth.  Oh and you don't get that later in the day shiney look with this makeup.  It really is pretty cool stuff!\nDoesn't leave marks on clothes!\nFlawless Liquid Foundation Cream, Liquid Foundation, Colour Changing Foundation, BB Cream, Long Lasting, Invisible Pores, Base Nude Face Moisturizing Liquid Cover Concealer,Universal for ALL Skin Type\nCherioll\n{'Brand': 'Cherioll', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Unit Count': '1.35 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '4.76 x 1.57 x 1.5 inches; 3.63 Ounces'}\nThis foundation is like no other foundation.  It is definitely not your average foundation.  It blends in almost immediately with your own skin color because of this, it never looks caked on or leaves makeup lines around the jawline.  It has an SPF coverage of 15 which is a nice added bonus.  The foundation seems to leave a nice cross between matte and dewy while minimizing the pores.  It is much more moisturizing then the average foundation also.  My skin used to be on the dryer side and now I have normal skin thanks to this product.\nColour Changing Foundation\nRapid Reduction Eye Cream, Under Eye Cream, Under-Eye Bags Treatment, Instant Results within 120 Seconds, Rapidly Reducing Bagginess, Puffiness, Dark Circles and Wrinkles - 2Pcs\nCIDBEST\n{'Brand': 'CIDBEST', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Use for': 'Eyes', 'Skin Type': 'Oily, Sensitive, Dry, Normal', 'Package Dimensions': '3.6 x 1.1 x 0.8 inches; 0.81 Ounces', 'UPC': '778299241700'}\nThis under eye cream is amazing.  The first time I used it, I could immediately see the difference.  It says you must apply it and wait expressionless for the 2 minutes after but I didn't even have to wait two minutes to see that there was a noticeable difference.<br />Its easy to use, you just clip the plastic tip off and apply.  There isn't a noticeable scent and the texture is soft and goes on smoothly but seems to soak in more abruptly then other eye creams.  When I say abruptly, I mean it kind of almost begins to feel chalky or glue-ish when it begins to soak in.  It leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth for the entire day.<br />I did notice that there isn't much for directions as to how often to apply it.\nImmediately see the difference...\nConcealer Cream,Makeup concealer,Skin Lightening Whitening Cream,Waterproof Smooth Flawless Finish Creamy Concealer ,Suitable for s eye circles, striated lines, scars, acne, spots\nSCOBUTY\n{'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Color': 'Ivory', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Finish Type': 'Natural', 'Package Information': 'Tube', 'Package Dimensions': '7.72 x 5.43 x 0.47 inches; 2.05 Ounces', 'UPC': '778716277046'}\nThis 3 pack of cream concealer is well, very concealing!  Its thick and maybe that is why it is a challenge to get out of the twist tube every time.  I felt as though I was twisting forever before anything came out and then when it finally did, it wouldn't stop!  It was like an explosion of concealer and it unfortunately seems to do this with every use.  With this concealer, you don't need much of it or it will begin to looked 'caked on\".  I would recommend getting a small container ready to put the extra in before beginning to use it.<br />Because of the 3 pack, you can blend them to match almost any skin tone which is a great feature.  The clear containers also is a great feature too!\nMakeup concealer\nW-Airfit Primer Face Makeup Base Pink Isolation Cream Invisible Pore,Cover Acne Marks,Smooth Skin,Oil Control Moisturizing Essence Concealer Foundation (1 pack)\nLofu\n{'Brand': 'Lofu', 'Product Benefits': 'Oil Control', 'Coverage': 'Lightweight,Medium', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Skin Type': 'Dry Skin,Oily', 'Package Dimensions': '5.16 x 1.38 x 0.94 inches; 1.66 Ounces', 'UPC': '791352429549'}\nI was surprised by how lightweight this primer is.  The texture reminds me of a light moisturizer which is different.  I also like that I can build it up for more coverage so on days when I don't need as much, I don't use as much and vise versa!  it is a nice change of pace.  It doesnt have a smell that I noticed at all or much of a color to it so it won't stain anything if you have an accident.  It did seem to 'hold' my makeup on well throughout the day into the early evening.  Although I am used to primers that have more of a pore minimizing effect to them, this is still a good value for the money.\nLightweight Primer\nMoisturising Cream, Body and Face Moisturizer for Dry Skin, Acne Cream, 2PC\nCherioll\n{'Brand': 'Cherioll', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '1.1 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Use for': 'Whole Body, Face', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '5 x 1.65 x 1 inches; 1.41 Ounces', 'UPC': '041388002378 746827880882', 'Manufacturer': 'Cherioll'}\nThe wintertime is so drying & my dad hands tend to get such bad dry skin that it cracks, exposing painful lesions all over.<br />We both started using it the first day it arrived.  Much to both of our surprises, it immediately began showing noticeable results on the first application.  When I say immediate, I mean right after we applied it our skin was much softer.  It wasn't that noticeable on the areas that were already healthy and soft.  The areas with cracked or excessively dry skin were immediately transformed into soft and moisturized skin.  It feels kind of tingly and minty going on also.<br />As far as the smell goes, its not noticeable unless you are trying to smell it which I probably wouldn't because what I can smell of it, I didn't really hate it but I definitely wasn't into it either.  It's a strange rusted orange color but does not leave stains on anything because it soaks into fabric/clothes just as regular lotion does.  The texture is a nice, thick one but considering, it soaks into the skin fairly fast.  Actually quicker then most other thick creams used for this purpose.\nImmediate Results...\nBody Wax Strips, Hair Removal Waxing Strips for Face Legs Underarms Brazilian Bikini Women with 40 Count Cold Wax Strips and 5 Post Wipes\nCARETHYS\n{'Item Form': 'Strip', 'Brand': 'CARETHYS', 'Number of Items': '50', 'Unit Count': '80 Count', 'Use for': 'Legs, Face', 'Package Dimensions': '7.6 x 5.9 x 0.8 inches; 4.8 Ounces'}\nI purchased these body wax strips and began using them only a few days after letting my hair grow out.  I didn't think it would be long enough because I could barely see it with a lighted mirror but it was.  It took a lot less time then I assumed it would and it didn't hurt much at all.  The results were better then I had imagined.  My skin was left soft and smooth.  It took me 30 minutes my first time using them on my face and decollate area.  They are very easy to cut into smaller pieces with a regular kitchen scissors but make sure to clean it off with soap and water afterwards.<br />Things to remember when using...really get the wax warm before applying (I used a space heater set on low instead of warming the wax in my hands for 30 seconds prior to using).  It will help the wax grip to the hair better so you will get better results.  When pulling the paper off of skin, always pull up and not out against the way the hair is growing.  Use one hand to hold the skin taught before pulling up on the paper.  This will also help you get more effective results.\nFast & Effective...\ngoPure ACTIVES Retinol Serum for Face - Anti Aging Serum, Face Serum, Eye Serum with Clinically Proven Bakuchiol Oil - Pore Minimizer Facial Serum and Dark Spot Remover for Face - 1oz\ngoPure\n{'Package Dimensions': '4.1 x 1.5 x 1.4 inches; 1 Ounces', 'UPC': '709618228485'}\nI have been pleasantly surprised by this product.  I have been an esthetician for 2 decades now and I love to find products that stand out to me like this one did.  It is kind of a different color than I would have expected but it doesn't leave marks on clothes, etc.  It soaks into the skin quickly and does a fantastic job of exfoliation.\nImpressive\nNose and Ear Hair Trimmer USB Rechargeable, 4 in 1 Upgraded Electronic Men Painless Eyebrow & Facial Hair Trimmer, Lightweight Eyebrow and Facial Hair Gentleman Trimmer With Waterproof Head\nPIONEO\n{'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Trimming', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Item Weight': '170 Grams', 'Brand': 'PIONEO', 'Special Feature': 'Waterproof, Cordless, Rechargeable', 'Product Dimensions': '1.3 x 5.31 x 4.06 inches; 6 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'SM-409S', 'Batteries': '1 AA batteries required.
