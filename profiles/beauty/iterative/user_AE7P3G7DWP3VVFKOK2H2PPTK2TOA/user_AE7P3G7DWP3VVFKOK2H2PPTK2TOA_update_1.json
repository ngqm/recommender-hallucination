It comes out of the bottle looking like a white colored moisturizer.  When applied to the face, it immediately begins to blend with the color of the skin right before your eyes.  It has somewhat of a weird smell if you put your nose up to the bottle.  I didn't notice it once I applied or throughout the day.  This makeup does not come off onto your clothes like regular foundation.  It comes off the same way it went on.  When applying it, it goes on more like moisturizer then makeup.  Its got SPF in it so it takes an extra swipe or two to get it to completely blend in but when it does its so lightweight, you don't even notice its there. It just leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth.  Oh and you don't get that later in the day shiney look with this makeup.  It really is pretty cool stuff!\nReview Title: Doesn't leave marks on clothes!\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
