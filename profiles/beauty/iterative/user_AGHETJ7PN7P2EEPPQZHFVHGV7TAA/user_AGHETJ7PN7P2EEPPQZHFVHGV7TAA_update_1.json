I have never given myself a gel polish manicure in my LIFE before yesterday. I had been wanting to for the longest time, but I wasn't 100% prepared to make the commitment to purchasing the light and the top coats and the bottom coats and the paint, etc, etc..<br /><br />Well if you are on the fence, jump it!<br /><br />First of all, the lamp works. You set your timer and once you do that, all you have to do is put your hand it and it starts automatically. Awesome! Like a real salon.  I was able to do my hands in 45 minutes. It would have been even faster but I did a test run on my thumb before doing them all at once to make sure I didn't mess anything up.<br /><br />Overall, I am SO happy to have this nail curing lamp!\nReview Title: Salon Perfect Nails!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
