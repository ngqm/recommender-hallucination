  "reference_summary": "UV Light for Nails,LKE Curing Lamp for Gel Nail Polish 54W UV Led Light Gel Nail Starter Kit Nail Dryer Accessories\nLKE\n{'Brand': 'LKE', 'Light Source Type': 'LED', 'Number of Light Sources': '2', 'Wattage': '54 watts', 'Control Method': 'App', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '9.45 x 8.7 x 5.08 inches; 2 Pounds', 'Batteries': '1 Lithium Ion batteries required.'}\nI just wan't ya'll to know.. I have never given myself a gel polish manicure in my LIFE before yesterday. I had been wanting to for the longest time, but I wasn't 100% prepared to make the commitment to purchasing the light and the top coats and the bottom coats and the paint, etc, etc..<br /><br />Well if you are on the fence, jump it!<br /><br />First of all, the lamp works. You set your timer and once you do that, all you have to do is put your hand it and it starts automatically. Awesome! Like a real salon.  I was able to do my hands in 45 minutes. It would have been even faster but I did a test run on my thumb before doing them all at once to make sure I didn't mess anything up.<br /><br />Overall, I am SO happy to have this nail curing lamp!\nSalon Perfect Nails!\nNeWisdom 72 PCS Toddler Girls Hair Accessory Set with Gift Packing Organization Box, Gifts for Grandkids, Cute Hair Bows Hair Clips Hair Bands for Girls Toddlers, Multi-Style Elastic Hair Ties Hair Accessories for Baby Girls Age 3 4 5 6\nNeWisdom\n{'Brand': 'NeWisdom', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Color': 'GirlsKit', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Babies', 'Embellishment': 'Bow', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '10.83 x 7.28 x 1.77 inches; 14.57 Ounces', 'Manufacturer recommended age': '5 months and up', 'Item model number': 'NW-GirlsKit-36Grid', 'Department': 'Baby-girls', 'UPC': '778942698455', 'Manufacturer': 'NeWisdom'}\nI think the pony tail holders may work for my little girls but the clips - definitely not. The clips are literally all the same just with different accessories glued on. I'm sure my girls will be able to use them on their dolls. Such a shame. The organizer box though is nice! I'm sure I'll be able to use it for something else.\nJunky\nJade Roller Microneedle Derma Roller 3 in 1 for Face Massager Tools Set, Beautlinks Real Natural Rose Quartz for Anti Aging Relaxing Eye Puffiness Wrinkles for Face Eyes Neck Body\nBeautlinks\n{'Package Dimensions': '6.85 x 6.3 x 1.73 inches; 10.41 Ounces', 'UPC': '741376342409', 'Manufacturer': 'Beautlinks'}\nI love having this Rose Quartz Roller Face Massager for applying all types of face masks and treatments to the face.<br /><br />When I put a facemask on I like to roll this over it. The rose quartz feels cool and it just feels so refreshing on the face and neck. It's also easy to clean which is nice.  I also apply some lotions / creams with it. I like to apply my hyaluronic acid with this. It seems like it works better than using my fingers alone.<br /><br />What has really impressed me though is the Microneedle Derma Roller. I only use it a few times a week but I really feel like it has helped with my dry flaky skin around my t-zone which has always been a problem for me. My face has never looked better!!\nElevate for Facials!\nFULL SPECTRUM BODY OIL, Organic Blend of Marula, Lavender, Cedarwood, Ylang Ylang, MCT Coconut with Vitamin E, for Dry Skin, Scalp, Face, Hands, & Nails for Women MADE FRESH\nEARTH CHEMISTRY SINCE 4.6 BILLION YEARS\n{'Package Dimensions': '6.73 x 3.5 x 3.39 inches; 10.51 Ounces', 'UPC': '080101444439'}\nIf you are an ashy kind of gal then you need some body in your life!<br /><br />I'm always up for trying something new so I was excited to try this ULTRA LIGHT FULL SPECTRUM BODY OIL.<br /><br />I think it works best if you put it on while your skin is still damp right out of the bath or a shower. I also try to exfoliate a little bit especially on my legs and other problem areas like elbows and knees.<br /><br />It's lightly scented which I like because if it's too overpowering it can really flare up my allergies.<br /><br />I wouldn't use something like this on my face because I do tend to be on the oily side. But for the body it really works great!\nExcellent for Dry Skin\nVeta \u2013 Lash and Eyebrow Serum \u2013 2-in-1 Lash & Brow Pen \u2013 Produces Longer, Healthier, Denser Lashes and Thicker Brows \u2013 Eyelash Serum \u2013 Boosts Skin Collagen \u2013 Drug-Free Formula - 1 fl oz.\nVeta\n{'Color': 'Silver, Black', 'Brand': 'Veta', 'Item Form': 'lotion', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Package Information': 'Tube', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.2 x 1.61 x 1.57 inches; 1.13 Ounces', 'UPC': '861121002645'}\nI'm not even going to lie to ya'll... I wear my mascara thick with multiple layers. This makes it SO hard for me to get off. It's not unusual for me to accidentally pull out my eyelashes trying to get my mascara off. This has left my eyelashes looking very sad. I decided to give this a go and I think I see results. My problem is I am defeating the purpose by wearing too much mascara! I think I just need to invest in some fake lashes.\nI see some results\n13.5 fl. Oz.

This is no exception. I have a pre-teen daughter who is on the cusp of puberty and has been suffering from a little acne. She has extremely sensitive skin so this face wash was the perfect option for her. It has kept her face clear from blemishes without drying out her skin.\nFresh & Clean\nSplendora Sugar Lip Scrub - Peach - (20g / 0.7oz.)\nSplendora\n{'Brand': 'Splendora', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Product Benefits': 'Exfoliating', 'Material Feature': 'Certified Organic', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '1.73 x 1.73 x 1.34 inches; 0.7 Ounces', 'UPC': '736640550444'}\nThis is a must-have especially during the winter when the wind hits your lips and they become dry and chapped.
