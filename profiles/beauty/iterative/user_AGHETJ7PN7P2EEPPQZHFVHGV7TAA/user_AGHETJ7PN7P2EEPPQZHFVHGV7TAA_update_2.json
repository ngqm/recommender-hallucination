The clips are literally all the same just with different accessories glued on. I'm sure my girls will be able to use them on their dolls. Such a shame. The organizer box though is nice! I'm sure I'll be able to use it for something else.\nReview Title: Junky\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I have never given myself a gel polish manicure in my LIFE before yesterday. I had been wanting to for the longest time, but I wasn't 100% prepared to make the commitment to purchasing the light and the top coats and the bottom coats and the paint, etc, etc..<br /><br />Well if you are on the fence, jump it!<br /><br />First of all, the lamp works. You set your timer and once you do that, all you have to do is put your hand it and it starts automatically. Awesome! Like a real salon.  I was able to do my hands in 45 minutes. It would have been even faster but I did a test run on my thumb before doing them all at once to make sure I didn't mess anything up.<br /><br />Overall, I am SO happy to have this nail curing lamp!\nSalon Perfect Nails!\nNeWisdom 72 PCS Toddler Girls Hair Accessory Set with Gift Packing Organization Box, Gifts for Grandkids, Cute Hair Bows Hair Clips Hair Bands for Girls Toddlers, Multi-Style Elastic Hair Ties Hair Accessories for Baby Girls Age 3 4 5 6\nNeWisdom\n{'Brand': 'NeWisdom', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Color': 'GirlsKit', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Babies', 'Embellishment': 'Bow', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '10.83 x 7.28 x 1.77 inches; 14.57 Ounces', 'Manufacturer recommended age': '5 months and up', 'Item model number': 'NW-GirlsKit-36Grid', 'Department': 'Baby-girls', 'UPC': '778942698455', 'Manufacturer': 'NeWisdom'}\nI think the pony tail holders may work for my little girls but the clips - definitely not.
