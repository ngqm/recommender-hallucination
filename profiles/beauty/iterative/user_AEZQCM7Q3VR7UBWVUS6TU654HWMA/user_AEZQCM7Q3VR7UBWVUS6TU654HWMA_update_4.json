I sometimes suffer from pain in my wrists due to typing often and found that this brush didn\u2019t bother my wrists at all.  I have never used an Argan infused brush and I did feel a difference between this brush and one without Argan:  I did see that my hair felt smoother and less frizzy.  The price point is on the higher end, but I felt the quality was definitely worth it.\nReview Title: Great round brush for blow drying hair\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
