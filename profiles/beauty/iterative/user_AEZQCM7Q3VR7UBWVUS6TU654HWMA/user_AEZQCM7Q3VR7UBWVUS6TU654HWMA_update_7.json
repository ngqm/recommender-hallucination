  "reference_summary": "[Upgrade] FUGACAL Hair Straightener Brush, 30s Fast Heating, 3 Temp Settings, Anti-Scald Design and 30mins Auto-Off, Bring You Ultra Straight Hair with Natural Shiny Look in Minutes\nFugacal\n{'Brand': 'Fugacal', 'Material': 'Ceramic', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Hair Type': 'Thick', 'Product Dimensions': '12.2 x 1.8 x 1.7 inches; 1.79 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'FG-HS01', 'Manufacturer': 'Fugacal'}\nI am a habitual flat iron user and recently purchased a wet to dry heating tool/comb, but decided to take a chance on this straightening brush steamer: I must say:  I am quite impressed with this apparatus.  It took me a quick second to get in a groove of running it through my hair, but after a few times, it was pretty easy.  The tension/pull is really good and I liked how it left my hair.  My hair feels so smooth and I am pretty satisfied with how my hair turned out (after my first try)...\nReally happy with this item\nKpdoit Wireless Pen Mini Machine Pen and Kit Digital LED Display 2200mAh Professional Supply for Artists\nKpdoit\n{'Brand': 'Kpdoit', 'Style': 'German', 'Water Resistance Level': 'Waterproof', 'Number of Pieces': '1', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '3.9 x 2.3 x 7.4 inches; 12.77 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'Kpdoit110', 'Manufacturer': 'Kpdoit'}\nThis product is great for beginners and for an affordable price!\nGreat for beginners!\n1oz.

I recommend this product at such an affordable price!\nHolds the mustache well!\nL'ANGE HAIR Argan-Infused Round Brush | Lightweight & Ergonomic Design | 53MM Tourmaline Ceramic Barrel\nL'ANGE HAIR\n{'Brand': \"L'ANGE HAIR\", 'Shape': 'Round', 'Handle Material': 'Ceramic', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Material': 'Ceramic', 'Package Dimensions': '12.32 x 4.76 x 3.58 inches; 5.29 Ounces', 'Item model number': '2456', 'UPC': '810108191339'}\nI found this round brush to be of high quality and easy to use.  I sometimes suffer from pain in my wrists due to typing often and found that this brush didn\u2019t bother my wrists at all.  I have never used an Argan infused brush and I did feel a difference between this brush and one without Argan:  I did see that my hair felt smoother and less frizzy.  The price point is on the higher end, but I felt the quality was definitely worth it.\nGreat round brush for blow drying hair\nDry Weightless Hair Volume and Texture Spray | Dry Texture Spray for Hair | Texturizing Spray | Sulfate and Cruelty Free 244ml (7oz)\nOsensia\n{'Hair Type': 'All, Dry, Fine', 'Liquid Volume': '7 Fluid Ounces', 'Brand': 'Osensia', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Unit Count': '7.0 Fl Oz', 'Package Dimensions': '8.03 x 1.93 x 1.89 inches; 8.78 Ounces', 'UPC': '850001832274'}\nI have been trying products that gives your hair the \u201ctextured\u201d look.  I have used regularly during the Summer months and I found  that it did add volume to my hair.  It also doubles as a dry shampoo., as it absorbs oils from your hair.  Lastly, I felt that the aerosol sprayed out the product with a good amount of strength, which is a plus for me.\nGreat Volume and Texturing Spray\nHygieia + Encapsulated 2% Retinol Cream \u2013 Liposomal Anti-Wrinkle Cream for Face, Neck & Body \u2013 Fast & Deep Cellular Absorption \u2013 Day or Night Cream for Firming, Lifting & Repairing Aging Skin, 4oz\nHygieia +\n{'Brand': 'Hygieia +', 'Scent': 'Unscented', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Active Ingredients': 'Retinol', 'Unit Count': '4.0 Ounce', 'Package Dimensions': '3.03 x 2.87 x 2.32 inches; 4 Ounces', 'UPC': '607469295352', 'Manufacturer': 'Hygieia +'}\nAs I age, I\u2019ve been using more products with retinol.  I do have tretinoin cream prescribed to me  (but it does irritate my face some): So, when I saw this on my Vine feed (free products for honest reviews), I ordered right away.  I\u2019ve been using this cream a few nights a week for the last few months.  I don\u2019t use products with retinol during the day, due to sun exposure (although, this product states it can be used day and night).  I did notice my sunspots to be diminishing after using.  It is moisturizing, too.  The price is steeper than what I normally would pay, but the results are worth it.  Great find and I would definitely order once I\u2019m out.\nNice retinol cream\nEveryday Beauty Renewal Night Cream Nourishing Facial Moisturizer with Brown Algae Extract, Squalene, Hyaluronic Acid and Glycerin to Moisturize and Protect Skin, Reduce Signs of Aging, 1 oz.
