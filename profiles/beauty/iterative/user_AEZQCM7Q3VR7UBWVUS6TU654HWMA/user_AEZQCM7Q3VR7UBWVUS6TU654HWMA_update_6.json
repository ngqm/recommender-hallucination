I do have tretinoin cream prescribed to me  (but it does irritate my face some): So, when I saw this on my Vine feed (free products for honest reviews), I ordered right away.  I\u2019ve been using this cream a few nights a week for the last few months.  I don\u2019t use products with retinol during the day, due to sun exposure (although, this product states it can be used day and night).  I did notice my sunspots to be diminishing after using.  It is moisturizing, too.  The price is steeper than what I normally would pay, but the results are worth it.  Great find and I would definitely order once I\u2019m out.\nReview Title: Nice retinol cream\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

It took me a quick second to get in a groove of running it through my hair, but after a few times, it was pretty easy.  The tension/pull is really good and I liked how it left my hair.  My hair feels so smooth and I am pretty satisfied with how my hair turned out (after my first try)...\nReally happy with this item\nKpdoit Wireless Pen Mini Machine Pen and Kit Digital LED Display 2200mAh Professional Supply for Artists\nKpdoit\n{'Brand': 'Kpdoit', 'Style': 'German', 'Water Resistance Level': 'Waterproof', 'Number of Pieces': '1', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '3.9 x 2.3 x 7.4 inches; 12.77 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'Kpdoit110', 'Manufacturer': 'Kpdoit'}\nThis product is great for beginners and for an affordable price!\nGreat for beginners!\n1oz.

I sometimes suffer from pain in my wrists due to typing often and found that this brush didn\u2019t bother my wrists at all.  I have never used an Argan infused brush and I did feel a difference between this brush and one without Argan:  I did see that my hair felt smoother and less frizzy.

I have used regularly during the Summer months and I found  that it did add volume to my hair.  It also doubles as a dry shampoo., as it absorbs oils from your hair.
