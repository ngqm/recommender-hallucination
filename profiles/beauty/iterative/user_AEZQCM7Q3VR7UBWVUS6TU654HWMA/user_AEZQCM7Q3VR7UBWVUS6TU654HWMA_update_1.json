It took me a quick second to get in a groove of running it through my hair, but after a few times, it was pretty easy.  The tension/pull is really good and I liked how it left my hair.  My hair feels so smooth and I am pretty satisfied with how my hair turned out (after my first try)...\nReview Title: Really happy with this item\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
