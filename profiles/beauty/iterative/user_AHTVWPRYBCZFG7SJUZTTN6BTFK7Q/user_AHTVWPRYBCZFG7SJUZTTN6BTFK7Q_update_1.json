It's a value for money thing. This huge bottle is inexpensive. The pump to squeeze it out works fine. The scent is fine. And it isn't that thin watery substance with cheap brands where most of it just flows right down the drain. I use it to wash my hair.<br />I havent combed my hair since i was 13 and mostly just don't care about it or what I put in it. It's there and it helps keep my head warm. Whatever is in this hasn't caused my hair to fall out. So im calling that a win.<br />Good enough\nReview Title: Good enough\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
