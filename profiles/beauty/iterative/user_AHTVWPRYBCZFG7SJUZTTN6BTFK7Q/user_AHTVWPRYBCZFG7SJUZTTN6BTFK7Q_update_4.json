It\u2019s a long soft rod type thing. The material is the usual you\u2019d get for a curler wrapped in silk. It\u2019s all bendy and what you do is sort of braid your hair onto/with this. After that, you use the included scrunchies to hold it in place at the bottom.<br /><br />This sounds all well and good but, maybe it was just me, it was difficult to get my hair twisted correctly onto the rod. My hair is long, reaching about mid back and perfectly straight. If you get it on there right, it comes out looking very nice. It just takes a whole lot of practice. Also, as a side note, if your hair is a little damp, it works better.<br /><br />This comes with the main curler, two large scrunchies, two smaller scrunchies, two hair clips, and a nice bag to keep everything in. The scrunchies are silk.<br /><br />This works nicely and it\u2019s worth trying out if you want heatless curls. For me it was difficult to get the knack of but if you are good with hair, which I am just not, you might find it quite easy from the start.\nReview Title: It's worth trying\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Dial Men 3in1 Body, Hair and Face Wash, Ultimate Clean, 32 fl oz\nDial\n{'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'Dial', 'Material Type Free': 'Free From Parabens,Silicones', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '9.41 x 3.94 x 2.68 inches; 2 Pounds', 'UPC': '017000118680'}\nThis doesn't feel like anything fancy. It's a value for money thing. This huge bottle is inexpensive. The pump to squeeze it out works fine. The scent is fine. And it isn't that thin watery substance with cheap brands where most of it just flows right down the drain. I use it to wash my hair.<br />I havent combed my hair since i was 13 and mostly just don't care about it or what I put in it. It's there and it helps keep my head warm. Whatever is in this hasn't caused my hair to fall out. So im calling that a win.<br />Good enough\nGood enough\nFace Scrub by Disco for Men, Exfoliating and Cleansing, Removes Dead Skin and Build Up, All Natural and Paraben Free, Eucalyptus Scent, 2 Ounces\nDisco\n{'Brand': 'Disco', 'Product Benefits': 'Exfoliating', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Scent': 'Eucalyptus', 'Package Dimensions': '6.1 x 1.81 x 1.81 inches; 2 Ounces', 'UPC': '860001694727'}\nI love being able to get in about my face with a good exfoliating wash and scrub away all the stuff. I don't know about you but I tend to wander a lot in this tiny former coal mining town where the people live and breathe in dust, and I wear it all over my face, I believe.<br />So scrubbing away all of that once a day feels brilliant. This isn't a harsh face wash. It's a gentle exfoliant but you can feel the grain in it while you wash your face. It's working well too. My skin isn't dried out and feels generally better than where I was using normal soap. And I like how you don't really need to use much of this to get it all over your face.<br />The scent was a bit of a let down because it's sort of nice but a bit weak. You might think this daft but I love a good scent that smells like a delicious candy while washing my face, or perhaps a nice lemony scent.<br />This is ok but it's working very well to clean my skin so no complaints really.\nPretty good\nLavender Foot Peel Mask 2 Pcs for Softing Smoothing Feet,Peeling Away Calluses and Dead Skin CellsExfoliating Foot Mask,Repair Rough Heels,Get Silky Feet\nBOOSCA\n{'Brand': 'BOOSCA', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Product Benefits': 'Smoothing,Nourish', 'Scent': 'Lavender', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Package Dimensions': '7.52 x 5.24 x 0.47 inches; 2.89 Ounces', 'UPC': '783103348421'}\nThis Melao lavender exfoliant foot peel works very well. The box contains one set of booties for one time use. It\u2019s real simple to use these. You have to start off by cleaning your feet well. It doesn\u2019t hurt to give them a bit of a soak for a time as well beforehand. Just to get them good ready. Next, you place the booties on your feet. It\u2019s recommended that you put socks over the booties to hold them firmly in place since you have to wear them for an hour. I did just that and think that\u2019s a mighty fine recommendation to follow. When that hour is up, you take all that off your feet and give your feet a good washing with soap and water. Now comes the waiting game. At first, I thought they did absolutely nothing.For days, I thought they did nothing. Then, around the 4th/5th day my feet just started to peel. They were shedding skin. It was so weird! They continued to do that for a few days and when it was all over my feet did look and feel really nce for quite some time. Just remember to keep moisturizing to keep them looking and feeling nice for a long time after.<br /><br />The thing about this product is that you can\u2019t expect instant results. It takes a few days and you have to still use the same moisturizers and stuff you were using on your feet, or at least I did. I have really dry feet in spots and I despise it so to have something actually work for a little while was great. You would have to use these every so often though, I think, to keep them as nice.<br />At this time, when I type this, there isn\u2019t a price listed for these so I can\u2019t tell you if it\u2019s worth it or not but they work well and could be.\nIt's good\nJODK Heatless Curling Rod Headband, No Heat Hair Curlers Ribbon with Hair Clips and Scrunchie, Soft Plush & 100% Silk Rollers for Long Hairs Sleep In, DIY Hair Styling Tools Kit for Women Girl's-Pink\nJODK\n{'Item Form': 'Clip', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Number of Items': '5', 'Material': 'Silk, Cotton', 'Size': '8 Piece Set', 'Package Dimensions': '9.25 x 4.84 x 2.83 inches; 7.37 Ounces'}\nThis is an interesting way to get some very nice curls in your hair.
