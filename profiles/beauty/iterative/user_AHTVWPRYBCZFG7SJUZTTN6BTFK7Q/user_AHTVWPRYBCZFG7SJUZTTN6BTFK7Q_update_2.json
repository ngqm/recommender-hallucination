I don't know about you but I tend to wander a lot in this tiny former coal mining town where the people live and breathe in dust, and I wear it all over my face, I believe.<br />So scrubbing away all of that once a day feels brilliant. This isn't a harsh face wash. It's a gentle exfoliant but you can feel the grain in it while you wash your face. It's working well too. My skin isn't dried out and feels generally better than where I was using normal soap. And I like how you don't really need to use much of this to get it all over your face.<br />The scent was a bit of a let down because it's sort of nice but a bit weak. You might think this daft but I love a good scent that smells like a delicious candy while washing my face, or perhaps a nice lemony scent.<br />This is ok but it's working very well to clean my skin so no complaints really.\nReview Title: Pretty good\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

It's a value for money thing. This huge bottle is inexpensive. The pump to squeeze it out works fine. The scent is fine. And it isn't that thin watery substance with cheap brands where most of it just flows right down the drain. I use it to wash my hair.<br />I havent combed my hair since i was 13 and mostly just don't care about it or what I put in it. It's there and it helps keep my head warm. Whatever is in this hasn't caused my hair to fall out. So im calling that a win.<br />Good enough\nGood enough\nFace Scrub by Disco for Men, Exfoliating and Cleansing, Removes Dead Skin and Build Up, All Natural and Paraben Free, Eucalyptus Scent, 2 Ounces\nDisco\n{'Brand': 'Disco', 'Product Benefits': 'Exfoliating', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Scent': 'Eucalyptus', 'Package Dimensions': '6.1 x 1.81 x 1.81 inches; 2 Ounces', 'UPC': '860001694727'}\nI love being able to get in about my face with a good exfoliating wash and scrub away all the stuff.
