After coming across this conditioner, it sounded perfect for my hair, so I decided to give it a try. The bottle itself is streamline and attractive, containing all of the pertinent information such as ingredients, directions, cautions, company information, and Made in the USA. I like that it is also paraben-free, sulfate-free, cruelty-free, organic, and vegan. The easy flip-top lid is very helpful in dispensing the conditioner and I am always happy when a product comes with a tamper-proof seal in place, as this did.<br /><br />This conditioner is beautifully creamy, thick, and rich and smells wonderfully fresh and citrusy, uplifting and delicious, and is perfect for men and women. I have been washing my hair as usual, applying this conditioner and then using a wide-tooth comb to remove any tangles, after which I leave the conditioner on while I shave my legs and wash my body. This gives the conditioner a little extra time to do lovely things for my hair. I then gently pat my hair dry with my towel, apply a light Argan serum, and then let it air dry the rest of the way. I love how soft and smooth this conditioner makes my hair feel.\nReview Title: ~ Softening and Smoothing with a Delicious Light True Citrus Scent. ~\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
