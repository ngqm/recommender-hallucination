It is a generous eight ounces, comes in a clear plastic bottle so you can tell when the product is getting low, and it comes with a handy flip-top lid that can be manipulated with one hand for ease of use. The scent of this is very light, if there is any at all. The label is tidy and contains the pertinent information, such as ingredients, Made in the USA, product information, and directions. The \u201cBest by\u201d date is clearly marked on the bottom of the bottle and is about a year out, giving me plenty of time to use the Micellar Cleansing Water.<br /><br />Life is busy and there is always a lot to do, which is the perfect reason that I love this Micellar Cleansing Water. It\u2019s great to use any time you want to wash your face, but my favorite use for it is when I come in from gardening or I have been busy working away at cleaning the house or whatever job I have been doing that may get me feeling a little grungy. I just put a dab of this on a cotton round and wash my face well with it, helping to make sure all that dirt isn\u2019t left on my face too long and it works perfectly and is wonderfully refreshing. I love how easy this is to use, how quick it is to use, how well it works, and that it contains absolutely no harmful ingredients. I have not tried Micellar Cleansing Water before this. I\u2019m very happy with this and am thankful I stumbled across it. I love it!\nReview Title: ~ Refreshing Grunge Fighter! ~\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

After coming across this conditioner, it sounded perfect for my hair, so I decided to give it a try. The bottle itself is streamline and attractive, containing all of the pertinent information such as ingredients, directions, cautions, company information, and Made in the USA. I like that it is also paraben-free, sulfate-free, cruelty-free, organic, and vegan. The easy flip-top lid is very helpful in dispensing the conditioner and I am always happy when a product comes with a tamper-proof seal in place, as this did.<br /><br />This conditioner is beautifully creamy, thick, and rich and smells wonderfully fresh and citrusy, uplifting and delicious, and is perfect for men and women. I have been washing my hair as usual, applying this conditioner and then using a wide-tooth comb to remove any tangles, after which I leave the conditioner on while I shave my legs and wash my body. This gives the conditioner a little extra time to do lovely things for my hair. I then gently pat my hair dry with my towel, apply a light Argan serum, and then let it air dry the rest of the way. I love how soft and smooth this conditioner makes my hair feel.\n~ Softening and Smoothing with a Delicious Light True Citrus Scent. ~\nMicellar Cleansing Water - Gentle Alcohol Free, No Rinse Facial Cleanser and Makeup Remover - For All Skin Types including Sensitive - Great for Travel, Post-Workout and Before Bedtime\nBella Jade\n['Lazy girls of the world, party people, workaholics, brand new mommies and anyone who has anything better to do than taking FOREVER to take your makeup off \u2013 REJOICE because Micellar Water is here!', 'What\u2019s micellar water, you ask?
