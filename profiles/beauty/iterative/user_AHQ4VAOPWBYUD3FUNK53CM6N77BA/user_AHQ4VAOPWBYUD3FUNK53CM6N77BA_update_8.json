This Aesthetica Climax Blush goes on smooth and stays on well for a long-lasting natural glow. This is a shimmery peachy pink, just a bit more peachy than the picture looked to me. I think my sister will inherit this. However, she will LOVE it. The compact is thin and small, which I love. I also like that this is talc-free, paraben-free, and cruelty-free. Bottom line, a little too peachy for me, but a very nice product. I recommend it to anyone who likes a little warmer or peachier tone. Very nice.\nReview Title: ~ Talc-Free, Paraben-Free, AND Cruelty-Free ~\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Luxury Conditioner With Aloe Vera - Hair Deep Conditioning for Dry Damaged Hair - Natural & Organic Moisturizing Hair Repair Treatment for Hair Loss Split Ends Dry & Itchy Scalp - Color Safe (8 oz)\nOrganic Prestige\n{'Brand': 'Organic Prestige', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Hair Type': 'Dry', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '8.0 Ounce', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2 x 2 x 7.25 inches; 8 Ounces', 'UPC': '603404817160'}\nI have medium length naturally wavy, processed hair that tends to be frizzy if I don\u2019t use good hair products, especially conditioner. After coming across this conditioner, it sounded perfect for my hair, so I decided to give it a try. The bottle itself is streamline and attractive, containing all of the pertinent information such as ingredients, directions, cautions, company information, and Made in the USA. I like that it is also paraben-free, sulfate-free, cruelty-free, organic, and vegan. The easy flip-top lid is very helpful in dispensing the conditioner and I am always happy when a product comes with a tamper-proof seal in place, as this did.<br /><br />This conditioner is beautifully creamy, thick, and rich and smells wonderfully fresh and citrusy, uplifting and delicious, and is perfect for men and women. I have been washing my hair as usual, applying this conditioner and then using a wide-tooth comb to remove any tangles, after which I leave the conditioner on while I shave my legs and wash my body. This gives the conditioner a little extra time to do lovely things for my hair. I then gently pat my hair dry with my towel, apply a light Argan serum, and then let it air dry the rest of the way. I love how soft and smooth this conditioner makes my hair feel.\n~ Softening and Smoothing with a Delicious Light True Citrus Scent. ~\nMicellar Cleansing Water - Gentle Alcohol Free, No Rinse Facial Cleanser and Makeup Remover - For All Skin Types including Sensitive - Great for Travel, Post-Workout and Before Bedtime\nBella Jade\n['Lazy girls of the world, party people, workaholics, brand new mommies and anyone who has anything better to do than taking FOREVER to take your makeup off \u2013 REJOICE because Micellar Water is here!', 'What\u2019s micellar water, you ask? It\u2019s a magical potion \u2013 a dream product for lazy girls or busy moms. Ever felt that you\u2019re too tired to remove all your makeup and wash your face by the end of the day? Well, micellar water will be your best friend.', \"Originally introduced in France over 100 years ago, where it was designed to help Parisians deal with the region's infamously harsh water supply, micellar cleansers have been their best kept secret ever since - that is, until make-up artists and models started raving about the benefits of this no-rinse formula, bringing it to our shores in recent years. It\u2019s different from the usual facial wipes and cleansers you\u2019re using. Facial wipes may help, but they don\u2019t totally remove the dirt from your skin. And many cleansers can be too harsh and strip your skin. With micellar water, you only have to pour some on a cotton pad and wipe it on your skin \u2013 then voila \u2014 you\u2019ve got a squeaky-clean face! Its magical formula makes removing makeup a breeze. It clings on the dirt and draws out impurities, leaving your skin glowing and hydrated. And if you\u2019re a fan of double-cleansing, you can also use micellar water in the morning after washing your face.\"]\n{'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive, Dry', 'Brand': 'Bella Jade', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2 x 2 x 7 inches; 8.8 Ounces', 'UPC': '636655962860', 'Manufacturer': 'Bella Jade'}\nThis Pure Bliss Micellar Cleansing Water arrived in a plastic bag to assure that, if it did leak, it did not leak on other products, but it did not leak. It is a generous eight ounces, comes in a clear plastic bottle so you can tell when the product is getting low, and it comes with a handy flip-top lid that can be manipulated with one hand for ease of use. The scent of this is very light, if there is any at all. The label is tidy and contains the pertinent information, such as ingredients, Made in the USA, product information, and directions. The \u201cBest by\u201d date is clearly marked on the bottom of the bottle and is about a year out, giving me plenty of time to use the Micellar Cleansing Water.<br /><br />Life is busy and there is always a lot to do, which is the perfect reason that I love this Micellar Cleansing Water. It\u2019s great to use any time you want to wash your face, but my favorite use for it is when I come in from gardening or I have been busy working away at cleaning the house or whatever job I have been doing that may get me feeling a little grungy. I just put a dab of this on a cotton round and wash my face well with it, helping to make sure all that dirt isn\u2019t left on my face too long and it works perfectly and is wonderfully refreshing. I love how easy this is to use, how quick it is to use, how well it works, and that it contains absolutely no harmful ingredients. I have not tried Micellar Cleansing Water before this. I\u2019m very happy with this and am thankful I stumbled across it. I love it!\n~ Refreshing Grunge Fighter! ~\nBEST FACE MASK WITH PINK ROSE CLAY - SPRING SALE - Organic Ingredients - Includes Ebook - Smooths Skin and Reduces Pores, Improves Aging Spots, Redness, Blemishes - Reduces Fine Lines\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '3 x 3 x 3 inches; 8 Ounces', 'Item model number': '2', 'UPC': '780873595123'}\nThis Maywood Creek Essentials Rose Clay Mud Mask comes in a nice lightweight plastic jar with a shiny silver lid. The product label contains all the pertinent information, such as directions, ingredients (a lovely blend of natural skin-nurturing ingredients), company information, expiration date, which is about a year out, giving me plenty of time to finish this Rose Clay Mud Mask. Interestingly, the label says to \u201cshake well before every use,\u201d but my mask is a soft solid. This mask has a different texture than I have seen before in a mask, perhaps due to the glycerin. I would say the scent is somewhat of a mix of light roses and (more so) citrus/grapefruit, best I can tell, which would be from the grapefruit and yuzi essential oils.<br /><br />I have used this mask several times and it is very gentle on my skin. It leaves my skin feeling wonderfully soft and my pores are definitely less noticeable. It does not take much of this mask to cover, so this jar should last a good long time. The mask is not overly drying to my skin, although I do use a moisturizer after, which is usual with masks. I first wash my face, then hold a warm washcloth to it, to open my pores, after which I spread a layer of this mask all over my face and neck. I have been using this about every third day or, sometimes, every other day, with good results. This mask is interesting and different, as well as effective in purifying and cleansing my face and neck.\n~ Full of LOTS of Natural, Skin-Nurturing Ingredients. Softening and Pore-Reducing. ~\nCleansing Bentonite Clay Powder - 1 Lb - Deep Skin Pore and Body Cleanser, All Natural, Detoxifying, Use for DIY facial masks, shampoo, creams, lotions, deodorant etc. by Aspen Naturals\nASPEN NATURALS\n{'Brand': 'ASPEN NATURALS', 'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Scent': 'Coconut', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Package Dimensions': '5.2 x 3.9 x 3.9 inches; 1.15 Pounds', 'UPC': '703610140080'}\nOn receipt of this Aspen Naturals Bentonite Clay Amazing Skin and Body Detoxifier, there was a tamper-proof seal in place over the opening of the jar for peace of mind in knowing it arrived to me pure and untampered with. The Bentonite Clay is a fine powder is easy to use with easy-to-follow directions right on the back of the label, although there are many other uses as well. I appreciate that this came well-protected for a safe delivery, which is a big part of a product, to be able to order it and know it will arrive safe and sound.<br /><br />I have used this several times as a face mask mixed with Rose Hydrosol and a drop of Frankincense Essential Oil, which worked perfectly for me. I just rubbed it gently on my face in gentle circular motions and then allowed it to try for about 15 to 20 minutes (until completely dry), and rinsed it off with a warm, wet washcloth. I do want to try it with the Apple Cider Vinegar also, since there are so many benefits to that as well. My skin is dry combination, but Bentonite Clay can be helpful for all skin types. My skin feels soft and smooth after using this as a mask and I will continue to use it one to two times per week.<br /><br />I have also used this Bentonite Clay stuffed into empty capsules I purchased at Amazon to help with a tummy ache and it was a huge help with that as well. I like to keep a baggy of these capsules on hand and take four to six of them (00 size) for possible bad food ingestion. This Aspen Naturals Bentonite Clay is premium, high quality 100% Sodium Bentonite Clay powder with no fillers, binders, additives or preservatives and is wonderfully detoxifying inside and out. This makes an excellent exfoliating, skin-softening, and detoxifying facial mask AND can help when taken internally with tummy trouble, such as a flu or food poisoning. I would definitely purchase this again and can recommend it wholeheartedly. Good stuff!\n~ Very Nice Bentonite Clay ~ Great for Internal or External Detoxification. ~\nSky Organics Fractionated Coconut Oil for Body & Face, 100% Pure to Condition, Soften & Smooth, 16 fl. Oz\nSky Organics\n{'Brand': 'Sky Organics', 'Scent': 'Coconut', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Unit Count': '16.00 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '8.62 x 2.56 x 2.4 inches; 1 Pounds', 'UPC': '856045007289', 'Manufacturer': 'Sky Organics'}\nOn receipt of this 100% Pure and Natural Fractionated Coconut Oil (Cocos Nucifera) from Sky Organics, it arrived in a plastic bag to protect any other items in my box from possible leakage. It came with a push-top dispenser in place, under which there was a rubber stopper to keep the oil from leaking on its journey to me. Also in the bag was a pump dispenser, should I prefer that. It\u2019s nice to have the choice of dispensing and the pump dispenser is my choice. It makes it so easy to fill up a little roller bottle or squeeze bottle for my concoctions AND easy to dispense when I use it as an after-shower moisturizer. The label contains all of the pertinent information, such as company contact information, product information, directions and possible uses, ingredients (100% pure medium chain triglyceride oil aka fractionated coconut oil (cocos nucifera), cold-pressed by expelier method), seals earned. I like that this is 100% pure and natural and is odorless and colorless, making it a perfect carrier oil for aromatherapy blends. This Fractionated Coconut Oil is chemical- and additive-free, non-greasy, and eco-friendly.<br /><br />I use this Coconut Oil most of all in my roller ball bottle blends that I make for others and for myself more than any other use, but I also use it as an after-bath moisturizer, either by itself or mixed with my choice of essential oils. I pat it all over while my skin is still slightly damp, allowing it to sink in and keep the moisture in. I like that it is completely scent-free, so any essential oils I may add to my blends doesn\u2019t need to try to overpower the carrier oil. This is a lovely big bottle and I love the pump dispenser for use one-handed and for ease in filling bottles to just the right height. This oil also has, on its own before even adding essential oils, antifungal, antiviral and antibacterial properties. It makes a lovely massage oil and can blend with other oils for a more rounded benefit. I use this almost every day, which makes this generous 16-ounce size perfect for me. Sky Organics is one of my favorite brands and I will definitely be purchasing this again, although this bottle should last me quite some time.\n~ Generous 16-Ounce Bottle from a Brand I Trust! ~\nEyelash Growth Serum Eyebrows Enhancer - Natural Eye Lash Brow Boost Enhancing Advanced Serum Full Eyebrow Lush Conditioner Booster Regrowth Treatment to Grow Fuller Thicker Longer Eyelashes\nMSLAN\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.09 x 0.87 x 0.71 inches; 0.64 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'Eyelash Growth Serum', 'UPC': '857646006060'}\nI don't wear mascara very often, so I was hoping this Lush Lash Eyelash Growth Serum would be helpful in eyelash growth. I absolutely LOVE when a product is well-protected with tamper-proof seals and this Lush Lash box came COMPLETELY covered by a plastic tamper-proof seal. To me, this is a huge plus. I am thankful for the extra care taken so that I can feel better about safety.<br /><br />Since I have been using this, my eyelashes are soft and well-conditioned and do not break off as much. I am not sure whether they are growing or not, but they are definitely in better condition (so it makes sense they are growing longer) and I will continue using this and can recommend it, especially if you do have a problem with lashes breaking off or falling out. I will update if there are any huge changes. In the meantime, I'm liking this Lush Lash very much.\n~ Softening and Conditioning for My Eyelashes - Helps Prevent Breakage ~\nArgan Oil Hair Treatment Gift Set - 3 Value Pack: Morrocan Argan Oil Shampoo 8oz Conditioner 8 oz & Hair Heat Protectant Spray 4oz Sulfate Free Natural Damaged Hair Growth Repair Packaging May Vary\nPremium Nature\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.83 x 7.05 x 2.28 inches; 1 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'Argan Oil Hair Care Set', 'UPC': '857646006497'}\nMy hair is thick, wavy, and color-treated. This Premium Nature Argan Oil Shampoo, Conditioner, and Thermal Shield Set works well for my hair type. The Argan Oil provides the extra conditioning I need without weighing my hair down. Although the bottles are smaller than the ones they sell separately, I like that these come in a set, since they all work great together. I see that most reviewers love the scent of these. That is the only thing I don't particularly like. Although the scent is unisex, it smells a little too masculine for my preference, but that is just my own preference. I love the handy flip lids on the shampoo and conditioner and the sprayer is great for the thermal shield. A huge plus to me is when a product comes with tamper-proofing, which this set comes completely wrapped in plastic, so I know it has not been tampered with.<br /><br />The shampoo is rich and opaque and, just from the creaminess, I knew this would work well on my hair. The clear shampoos are usually not conditioning enough (in general), but the creamy ones, like this, are great. The conditioner is the same, very thick and rich, perfect for my wavy, dry, color-treated hair. It may weigh finer hair down a bit much, unless used more sparsely. The thermal shield helps keep my waves from becoming frizzy. It is lightly conditioning and softening. It sprays evenly and just the right amount. I like these being sold in the set for trial purposes and then the ability to purchase them separate as well, once you run out or the smaller set sizes.<br /><br />This is a nice set of wonderfully moisturizing, softening, and frizz-taming products that add shine, bounce, and softness.\n~ Moisturizing, Softening, Frizz-Taming ~\nAesthetica Blush Powder Compact - Climax, 0.16 oz\nAesthetica\n{'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Coverage': 'Buildable', 'Brand': 'Aesthetica', 'Color': 'Climax', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2.7 x 2.1 x 0.5 inches; 0.64 Ounces', 'UPC': '617629829815', 'Manufacturer': 'Aesthetica'}\nI was a little nervous to order blush online, but this arrived in perfect condition.

I think my sister will inherit this. However, she will LOVE it. The compact is thin and small, which I love. I also like that this is talc-free, paraben-free, and cruelty-free. Bottom line, a little too peachy for me, but a very nice product. I recommend it to anyone who likes a little warmer or peachier tone. Very nice.\n~ Talc-Free, Paraben-Free, AND Cruelty-Free ~",
