I feel like the brush is more intense and the silicone head is more gentle on the skin.  I can really notice a difference after I use the brush.  My skin is much smoother.  I assume it's because it's exfoliating and removing the dead skin.  There are 2 speed settings and I've found the lower setting doesn't do much so I use it on the higher setting.  I like that it can be used in the shower since I wash my face in the shower.  I just wish it was rechargeable.  I haven't had to replace the batteries yet, but nowadays it seems that most electronics are rechargeable so I guess I'm used to that.\nReview Title: Makes a noticeable difference!\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Bath Pillow for Bathtub, Spa Pillows for Neck Head Shoulders Back Support, Thick Bath Tub Cushion with 6 Suction Cups Men Women Breathable Comfort 4D Air Mesh Quick Dry Headrest Bath Accessories\nAzun\n{'Brand': 'Azun', 'Material': 'Mesh', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '13 x 11 x 1 inches', 'Product Care Instructions': 'Hand Wash Only', 'Product Dimensions': '13 x 11 x 1 inches; 11.36 Ounces'}\nOur tub is situated so that a wall is about 3 inches from the end of the tub, meaning that if you take a bath, your head essentially has to be either vertical or in the tub.  Sticking a bath pillow to the wall only means that your vertical head has a bit of padding.  This bath pillow has changed that!  Because it's so long and softer than an inflatable pillow, it actually sort of creates that angle so my head does not have to vertical!  After my first bath, I was trying to think of a way to hang it up to dry when I realized it actually has a hook just for that!  I really, really love this bath pillow!\nVery Comfy!\nLeiCare Tweezers Precision 2-Pack - Stainless Steel Slant Tweezers for Ingrown Hair \u2013 Professional Tweezer Set with Slanted Tips for Eyebrows and Splinter Removal - Eyebrow Plucker Kit\nLeiCare\n{'Product Dimensions': '3.74 x 0.39 x 0.18 inches; 3.17 Ounces'}\nI use tweezers almost every day, mostly for eyebrow shaping and splinter removal (I have 2 young kids so this is a regular occurrence).  I've tried quite a few different tweezers, but my favorite is an old Revlon one that I've had for more than 15 years.  To me, it's not just about the angle or the point - it's the gripping power.  This LeiCare set works well and have become my go-to splinter removers.  They grip well and for the price (currently $6.99 for both tweezers and the case), I think these are a good deal.  My only complaint is with the case.  It's basically cardboard so while it's held up so far, I don't think it will last long.  If you lose the little \"straps\" that hold the tweezers closed, the case won't close.\nNice tweezer set - and I'm picky!\n5-Pack Hair Scalp scrubber Massager Shampoo Brush for Straight Curly Long Short Thick Thin Wet Dry Hair, Men Women Kids Scalp Care Hair Cleaning Shower, Scalp Care Brush,100% comfortable\nTeqifu\n{'Material': 'Silicone', 'Brand': 'Teqifu', 'Color': 'Pink, Blue', 'Package Dimensions': '8.78 x 7.68 x 2.87 inches; 8.78 Ounces', 'UPC': '608571756465', 'Manufacturer': 'Teqifu'}\nChanging weather always affects my scalp in a bad way.  I also lose hair easily so I was worried a scalp massager might cause more hair to break or fall out.  Not so!  The \"teeth\" on this scalp massager are long enough to get down to the scalp but are soft and gentle.  Even my 3-year-old daughter can sort of use it herself in the shower.  And she doesn't complain at all when I use it to actually shampoo her hair.  This massager also increases the lather a lot!  It really makes a regular everyday shampoo feel luxurious.\nJust what my scalp needed!\nHetian Sonic Facial Cleansing Brush\uff0cExfoliating and Waterproof Electric Face Wash Brush Deep Skin Care Tools Silicone Cleanser Scrubber Suitable for Any Skin Condition for Women (Pink)\nHetian\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '6.3 x 1.5 x 1.77 inches; 5.89 Ounces', 'Batteries': '1 AA batteries required.', 'UPC': '791568745273', 'Manufacturer': 'Hetian'}\nI've been using this sonic facial cleaning brush for a few weeks and tried out both the brush and the silicone heads.
