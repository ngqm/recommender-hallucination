I've tried quite a few different tweezers, but my favorite is an old Revlon one that I've had for more than 15 years.  To me, it's not just about the angle or the point - it's the gripping power.  This LeiCare set works well and have become my go-to splinter removers.  They grip well and for the price (currently $6.99 for both tweezers and the case), I think these are a good deal.  My only complaint is with the case.  It's basically cardboard so while it's held up so far, I don't think it will last long.  If you lose the little \"straps\" that hold the tweezers closed, the case won't close.\nReview Title: Nice tweezer set - and I'm picky!\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Sticking a bath pillow to the wall only means that your vertical head has a bit of padding.  This bath pillow has changed that!  Because it's so long and softer than an inflatable pillow, it actually sort of creates that angle so my head does not have to vertical!  After my first bath, I was trying to think of a way to hang it up to dry when I realized it actually has a hook just for that!  I really, really love this bath pillow!\nVery Comfy!\nLeiCare Tweezers Precision 2-Pack - Stainless Steel Slant Tweezers for Ingrown Hair \u2013 Professional Tweezer Set with Slanted Tips for Eyebrows and Splinter Removal - Eyebrow Plucker Kit\nLeiCare\n{'Product Dimensions': '3.74 x 0.39 x 0.18 inches; 3.17 Ounces'}\nI use tweezers almost every day, mostly for eyebrow shaping and splinter removal (I have 2 young kids so this is a regular occurrence).
