Sticking a bath pillow to the wall only means that your vertical head has a bit of padding.  This bath pillow has changed that!  Because it's so long and softer than an inflatable pillow, it actually sort of creates that angle so my head does not have to vertical!  After my first bath, I was trying to think of a way to hang it up to dry when I realized it actually has a hook just for that!  I really, really love this bath pillow!\nReview Title: Very Comfy!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
