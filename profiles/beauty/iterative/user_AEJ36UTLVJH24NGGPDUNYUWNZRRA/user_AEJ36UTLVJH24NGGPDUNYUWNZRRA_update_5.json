I wasnt expecting that but super happy as I knew I'd be using more than needed and wasting if I were just pouring straight from the bottle/s. Which leads me to my second point- I still think I used more than needed, particularly the conditioner. My hair is thin & rather short now so I don't need much as is, but because it's so dry & brittle the conditioner seemed to have a bit of difficulty actually saturating and smoothing out so I kept pumping more out and adding it. Well I ended up just clipping it back to sit for a bit like usual & let me tell you...when I took it out it was so silky smooth I was surprised it didnt fall out of the clip on it's own. The smell is a rather strong floral scent, I've noticed all my Korean hair products have a strong floral scent to them tho & personally I dont mind it. Havent used long enough for much result yet but will update.\nReview Title: Too early to know results for sure but so far love it.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
