Almost a bit loose with the decorations on the head, can't move back and forth too sharp to avoid sliding down. The color is popping even in darker places. The glitter part looks classic and not over the top.\nReview Title: Silky fabric, fun design\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "MOSTORY 3 in 1 Eyebrow Pencil - Super Model Perfect Brow Stylist Waterproof Brown Eye Brow Makeup Long Lasting Professional Soft Powder Pen Brush (MEDIUM BROWN)\nMOSTORY\n{'Brand': 'MOSTORY', 'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Finish Type': 'Natural', 'Special Feature': 'Waterproof, Long Lasting', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '7 x 1 x 0.5 inches; 1.59 Ounces'}\nThis is a warm color eyebrow pencil, it glides out smoothly and very easy to apply. It feels more red than the picture of product, for someone with darker eyebrows like me might need to blend in with another dark color to make it natural. I like the weight of this pencil, it feels nice to grab in palm when using. The fine tip works well to fill in the blank and the powder adds natural final touch.\nSmooth eyebrow pencil with rich color\nSAMYANG ABOUTME Red Recipe Super Cleansing Balm 3.04 oz. (90ml) - Soft Melting Milk Texture Makeup Cleansing Balm, Mineral Contained Nourishing & Soothing Cleansing, Rose Scented\nSamyang\n{'Package Dimensions': '3.66 x 3.39 x 2.36 inches; 5.57 Ounces'}\nComes with a small spatula to scoop the product out and apply on the skin. Cleanses make-up well, just simply rub it on the spot and wash it off with water. The rosy fragrance is very pleasant and relaxing. Tested out with black eye-shadow and dark lipbalm and it took them right off with just a small amount applied to the skin.\nRose-like scent and cleanse like a magic\nFolora 4pcs Premium 1 Inch Wide Solid Color Floral Plaid Headband Set for Women Girls, Blue-2\nFolora\n{'Material': 'Plastic', 'Brand': 'Folora', 'Unit Count': '4.00 Count', 'Product Dimensions': '4.72 x 0.98 x 5.51 inches; 2.26 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'FLR-HB-4pcs Blue-2'}\nI like how these 4 all have different patterns yet the color unified them well. I have the blue set and it's quite pretty. The wider style of headband supposed to be more comfortable, but it seems still tight enough to hurt your head a bit after hours of weather. It does have inner layer to make it smoother and easier on your head when you wear it. I assume after a couple of times using/wearing, it should be easier and gets more comfortable.\nSturdy headband, colorful design for the sets\nHair Silk Scrunchies Satin Elastic Hair Bands Velvet Scrunchy Chiffon Hair Ties Ropes Scrunchie for Women Girls Hair Accessories (Laser 1-6PCS)\nDEVPSISR\n{'Material': 'Silk', 'Brand': 'DEVPSISR', 'Number of Pieces': '6', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult,Kid', 'Unit Count': '6.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '7.36 x 4.96 x 1.77 inches; 4.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '791535532882'}\nThese are definitely fun hair scrunchies, they are rather tight so it works fun even for lower volume hair. It stays on the wrist well until you need to use it, does the job!\nRetro color mixed with sci-fi style\nChristmas Headbands,Glitter Reindeer Antlers Headband Hair Accessories for Girls,Sequins Mouse Ears Green Bow Hairband for Women Christmas Party Cosplay Favor Headwear\nYanJie\n{'Material': 'Cotton Blend', 'Brand': 'YanJie', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'UPC': '751300682129'}\nThe headband fits on nicely, not too tight.
