But when I went to put it together it didn\u2019t go... no matter how hard I tried! That was upsetting. I had to get my dremel out to sand it down so it fit better and it\u2019s still not all the way on. With that said, the brush is super nice and scratchy on the back. And the foot brush/pumice stone is really nice too! I hope your brush combo has less flaws.\nReview Title: Didn\u2019t fit\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
