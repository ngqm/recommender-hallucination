But when I went to put it together it didn\u2019t go... no matter how hard I tried! That was upsetting. I had to get my dremel out to sand it down so it fit better and it\u2019s still not all the way on. With that said, the brush is super nice and scratchy on the back. And the foot brush/pumice stone is really nice too! I hope your brush combo has less flaws.\nDidn\u2019t fit\nTraining Head Hairdressing Head Rainbow Synthetic Fiber Hair 24inch Mannequin Cosmetology Manikin Dolls Head for Hairdresser Styling Practicing with Free Clamp + DIY Hair Styling Braid Set\nSENSAIRUITE\n{'Brand': 'SENSAIRUITE', 'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Extension Length': '24 Inches', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '11.26 x 6.93 x 6.5 inches; 1.83 Pounds'}\n[[VIDEOID:3e9a0a4c1e05b8d79256b9b63cdd466f]] One of the main reasons I got this head was to use hot tools on it to practice before I used them on me. IT DOES NOT CURL!!!! It says that it does, but it doesn\u2019t. I have tried 3-4 different hot tools and it won\u2019t hold a curl at all. The hair is soft, it\u2019s very thick. So if you wanted it just to do some braiding, it would work well for that. Not happy.\nDOES NOT CURL!!!!\nLXIANGN Soft Rubber Nail Polish Bottle Holder Stand Anti Spill Bottle Holder Display Manicure Tools for Women (Pink and Orange)\nLXIANGN\n{'Product Dimensions': '3.46 x 2.17 x 1.57 inches; 0.96 Ounces'}\nThese are nice to have.
