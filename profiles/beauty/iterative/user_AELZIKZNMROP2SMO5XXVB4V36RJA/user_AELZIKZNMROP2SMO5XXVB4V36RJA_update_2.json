The bands were soft fabric, tight enough to hold hair back but not so tight it felt constricting. Several patterns and colors to match about any solid color top.  Slipped into place easily and stayed there.  I am pleased with this item's quality and variety.\nReview Title: Soft fabric. Well constructed.

  "reference_summary": "Wonder4 Electric Callus Remover - Rechargeable Electric Foot File Callus Shaver Hard Skin Remover Pedicure Tools with 3 in 1 Roller Heads, for Cracked Heels Calluses and Dead Skin\nWonder4\n{'Brand': 'Wonder4', 'Is Electric': 'Yes', 'Item Form': 'Roller', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Unit Count': '11.4 Ounce'}\nI do like that the 3 different grit rollers can be flipped right on the head.  It is quiet. I charged it several hours before using it, but it began lagging quickly.  I plugged it in and kept using it and didn't notice much difference while plugged in.  The description recommend only use 2 or 3 seconds at a time but I didn't find any reason why it would say that.  It wasn't very powerful, but I did see a considerable amount of very fine skin.  It didn't collect in the little tray that I could tell.  It claims to work wet or dry.  I will leave the wet testing to someone with less candles on their cake than I.  My feet felt better after using.<br />I believe there are better ones than this at a competitive price point.  It did work so I have to give it at least 3 \u2606\u2606\u2606.  It was quiet so that's a plus.  The charge cord is very short.\nIt's quiet.
