  "reference_summary": "Wonder4 Electric Callus Remover - Rechargeable Electric Foot File Callus Shaver Hard Skin Remover Pedicure Tools with 3 in 1 Roller Heads, for Cracked Heels Calluses and Dead Skin\nWonder4\n{'Brand': 'Wonder4', 'Is Electric': 'Yes', 'Item Form': 'Roller', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Unit Count': '11.4 Ounce'}\nI do like that the 3 different grit rollers can be flipped right on the head.  It is quiet. I charged it several hours before using it, but it began lagging quickly.  I plugged it in and kept using it and didn't notice much difference while plugged in.  The description recommend only use 2 or 3 seconds at a time but I didn't find any reason why it would say that.  It wasn't very powerful, but I did see a considerable amount of very fine skin.  It didn't collect in the little tray that I could tell.  It claims to work wet or dry.  I will leave the wet testing to someone with less candles on their cake than I.  My feet felt better after using.<br />I believe there are better ones than this at a competitive price point.  It did work so I have to give it at least 3 \u2606\u2606\u2606.  It was quiet so that's a plus.  The charge cord is very short.\nIt's quiet.  Not super powerful\nZOCONE 10 Packs Boho Headbands for Women Girls, Turban Headwraps for Sports Yoga Running Workout, Elastic Fashion Hair Band (A)\nZOCONE\n{'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material': 'Polyester', 'Fabric Type': 'Polyester,Silk', 'Number of Items': '10', 'Brand': 'ZOCONE', 'Package Dimensions': '9.53 x 4.41 x 2.83 inches; 6.7 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'j158'}\nNothing but good to say about this item.  The bands were soft fabric, tight enough to hold hair back but not so tight it felt constricting. Several patterns and colors to match about any solid color top.  Slipped into place easily and stayed there.  I am pleased with this item's quality and variety.\nSoft fabric. Well constructed. Stays in place.\nRed Carpet Manicure Starter Kits\n{'Color': 'RCM Essentials Starter Kit', 'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'RC Red Carpet Manicure', 'Finish Type': 'Glossy', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'UPC': '817248203854', 'Manufacturer': 'RC Red Carpet Manicure/ Zupishi'}\nThe light is small and shallow. Thumb has to cure separately.  This \"complete\" kit is not exactly complete. It has a micro USB cord but no box. Very basic nstructions. No times noted for curing. No color included.  Assuming I cured for the correct time, I had a couple nails that smudged off when I wiped with alcohol.  Most didn't. Top coat is exceptionally shiny.  I have other Red Carpet items that I'm quite pleased with. This kit fell a bit short on expectations. As a starter kit, it's one you'll have to add a few things to (file, USB box, nail color, etc.) so be aware of that.  The Purify cleaner has a light scent, but is a small bottle. I like the top coat.  Kit is decent but not great.\nNot exactly a starter kit\nBiutee Starry Sky Nail Gel Firework Nail Gel With black Nail Polish Gel 8ml UV LED\nBiutee\n{'Brand': 'Biutee', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'Gel', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '3.5274 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Liquid Volume': '0.27 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '4.92 x 3.31 x 1.77 inches; 4.59 Ounces'}\nYou will need base and top coat and a scooper/brush tool. They are not included. It took 3 coats of the black polish (included) to get full, dark coverage.  The pots are messy to open and quite small, but colors are pretty and sparkly.  Lots of glitter effect with multiple coats.  You will need a brush as well.  The finish feels bumpy (you can feel the glitter).  Maybe multiple top coat would help but I didn't want more layers since I already had base, 3 layers of color, 2 layers of glitter and a top coat.\nPots are kinda messy. No base, top coat or brush.  Glitter is pretty.\nPHOERA 30ml Foundation Liquid Full Coverage 24HR Matte Oil Control Concealer (Nude & Buff Beige) with 6ml Makeup Face Primer & Kabuki Foundation Brush Flat Top\nSIGHTLING\n{'Product Dimensions': '1.18 x 0.79 x 1.18 inches; 4.97 Ounces', 'UPC': '779296966696'}\nThey are a bit too light for my skin tone but they work.  The toner is so silky I wasn't even sure any was going on my skin.  I am almost 52 and have the expected lines in my face for that age.  The toner is a must for mature skin. I tried it without it and the foundation settled in my lines. With the toner it stayed suspended well.  The foundations are a bit thick and it felt like I was painting my face on, but with a bit of work it blended nicely. The kabuki brush is soft and full. No bristles came off.  I believe if the shade matches your skin well, it would be an excellent product. I did have to apply a bronzer over because it was a bit lighter than my skin.  Full coverage, matte finish.\nGreat toner, great brush.  Full coverage, matte finish\nPine Gel Nail Polish Set Chameleon Shimmering Color and Black 7.5 ml LED UV Cured Soak Off Nail Gel for Nail Art Manicure\npine\n{'Brand': 'Pine', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Liquid Volume': '0.25 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '4.96 x 3.7 x 2.91 inches; 9.14 Ounces', 'UPC': '738628890993'}\nI really can't complain at all about this set.  Colors are very pretty.  Easy to apply and cure.  I love the fact it comes with black polish.  The black is sheer but that is kind of a plus with this set because it allows buildable color.  You may not want a dark black behind the glitter.  A couple of the colors are similar and unless they are side by side it's harder to tell them apart but overall I love it. I really love the fact that I can have beautiful glitter nails without the scratchy feel.  I would order Pine products again.  They don't smell bad either.\nSparkly colors and buildable black\nAltaba Messy Bun Hair Piece Tousled Updo Messy Bun Hair Piece with Elastic Rubber Band Tousled Updo Extensions for Women\nAltaba\n{'Package Dimensions': '9.72 x 6.54 x 0.94 inches; 2.19 Ounces', 'UPC': '738631999942'}\nMy friend and I have tried many of these fun hair accessories. They are easy to wear and super fun.  This particular one looked good but the highlights were super blonde in the brown.  Just be aware when ordering.  The blonde was really too much to blend in my hair so sadly this one won't get much wear, but in general, the look is casual to professional with very little effort.  Pull your hair back into a ponytail or bun then slide this baby over it and suddenly the whole \"do\" changes.  Whispy texture and style.  Great for the awkward grow-out stage.\nEasy and fun style to wear.  Highlights on this were quite sharp.\nMAELYS VIRTUE Neck Firming Cream\n{'Brand': 'MAELYS', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '1.76 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Use for': 'Face', 'Package Dimensions': '3.46 x 3.39 x 2.8 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'B07PBWVV5K', 'Manufacturer': 'B4Y LABORATORIES LTD'}\nSmells and feels great.  Feels very luxurious. A little goes a long way.  However, I haven't noticed any decrease in wrinkles with continued use.  For the cost/results, I would definitely not purchase.\nFeels luxurious but little to no results",
