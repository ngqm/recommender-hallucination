Thumb has to cure separately.  This \"complete\" kit is not exactly complete. It has a micro USB cord but no box. Very basic nstructions. No times noted for curing. No color included.  Assuming I cured for the correct time, I had a couple nails that smudged off when I wiped with alcohol.  Most didn't. Top coat is exceptionally shiny.  I have other Red Carpet items that I'm quite pleased with. This kit fell a bit short on expectations. As a starter kit, it's one you'll have to add a few things to (file, USB box, nail color, etc.) so be aware of that.  The Purify cleaner has a light scent, but is a small bottle. I like the top coat.  Kit is decent but not great.\nReview Title: Not exactly a starter kit\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Wonder4 Electric Callus Remover - Rechargeable Electric Foot File Callus Shaver Hard Skin Remover Pedicure Tools with 3 in 1 Roller Heads, for Cracked Heels Calluses and Dead Skin\nWonder4\n{'Brand': 'Wonder4', 'Is Electric': 'Yes', 'Item Form': 'Roller', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Unit Count': '11.4 Ounce'}\nI do like that the 3 different grit rollers can be flipped right on the head.  It is quiet. I charged it several hours before using it, but it began lagging quickly.  I plugged it in and kept using it and didn't notice much difference while plugged in.  The description recommend only use 2 or 3 seconds at a time but I didn't find any reason why it would say that.  It wasn't very powerful, but I did see a considerable amount of very fine skin.  It didn't collect in the little tray that I could tell.  It claims to work wet or dry.  I will leave the wet testing to someone with less candles on their cake than I.  My feet felt better after using.<br />I believe there are better ones than this at a competitive price point.  It did work so I have to give it at least 3 \u2606\u2606\u2606.  It was quiet so that's a plus.  The charge cord is very short.\nIt's quiet.  Not super powerful\nZOCONE 10 Packs Boho Headbands for Women Girls, Turban Headwraps for Sports Yoga Running Workout, Elastic Fashion Hair Band (A)\nZOCONE\n{'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material': 'Polyester', 'Fabric Type': 'Polyester,Silk', 'Number of Items': '10', 'Brand': 'ZOCONE', 'Package Dimensions': '9.53 x 4.41 x 2.83 inches; 6.7 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'j158'}\nNothing but good to say about this item.  The bands were soft fabric, tight enough to hold hair back but not so tight it felt constricting. Several patterns and colors to match about any solid color top.  Slipped into place easily and stayed there.  I am pleased with this item's quality and variety.\nSoft fabric. Well constructed. Stays in place.\nRed Carpet Manicure Starter Kits\n{'Color': 'RCM Essentials Starter Kit', 'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'RC Red Carpet Manicure', 'Finish Type': 'Glossy', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'UPC': '817248203854', 'Manufacturer': 'RC Red Carpet Manicure/ Zupishi'}\nThe light is small and shallow.
