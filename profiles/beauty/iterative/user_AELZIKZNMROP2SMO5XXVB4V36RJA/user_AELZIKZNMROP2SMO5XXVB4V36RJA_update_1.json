It is quiet. I charged it several hours before using it, but it began lagging quickly.  I plugged it in and kept using it and didn't notice much difference while plugged in.  The description recommend only use 2 or 3 seconds at a time but I didn't find any reason why it would say that.  It wasn't very powerful, but I did see a considerable amount of very fine skin.  It didn't collect in the little tray that I could tell.  It claims to work wet or dry.  I will leave the wet testing to someone with less candles on their cake than I.  My feet felt better after using.<br />I believe there are better ones than this at a competitive price point.  It did work so I have to give it at least 3 \u2606\u2606\u2606.  It was quiet so that's a plus.  The charge cord is very short.\nReview Title: It's quiet.  Not super powerful\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
