The pictures on the containers do feel like they'll come off easily which is disappointing since they're so cute, but the containers themselves are nice & a good size. The lip balms have a jelly like texture & all have the same fruity scent. The red one leaves the most color on my lips, but they all leave my lips sparkly & shiny. They look great worn alone or under a lip gloss or tint.\nReview Title: Sparkly & Cute\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

The discoloration and redness on my cheeks and forehead are much less visible in the morning if I use it at night.<br />This serum works just as well as the high-end ones and is at a much more reasonable price.<br />I'm definitely recommending this brand to all my friends.\nGreat Inexpensive Serum\nBeauty Glazed Gorgeous Me Eyeshadow Palette Matte Professional 63 Colors Eyeshadow Cosmetic Matte Eyeshadow Cream +Makeup Brushes Set and Powder Blender Sponge\nBeauty Glazed\n{'Color': 'B37-63 Shades', 'Brand': 'Beauty Glazed', 'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Finish Type': 'Matte', 'Special Feature': 'Travel size, Matte', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '5.79 x 3.9 x 0.59 inches; 13.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '711796032686', 'Manufacturer': 'Beauty Glazed'}\nThis palette doesn't have all the qualities of a high end eyeshadow palette, but it is one of the best low cost palettes I've gotten before.<br />I love the range and variety of colors in this palette. All of the shimmers are highly pigmented and the matted come out great on the eye. The more vibrant shimmers do have a lot of fallout so I'd suggest using a shadow shield or doing your foundation and concealer after so you can cover it up. Also I would highly recommend using your finger or a sponge tip brush to apply the shimmers and pack on the color.\nGreat Budget Friendly Palette\nAzure OLD PEEL OFF COLLECTION (Fantasy Collection)\nAzure Cosmetics\n{'Brand': 'Azure Cosmetics', 'Scent': 'Lavender', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Unit Count': '2.7 Ounce', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.5 x 1.5 x 5.5 inches; 10.41 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'SG_B07JFDJTGC_US', 'UPC': '689513274407'}\nThese masks are really cute and glittery. They're perfect for a fun girl's night and really pull everything out of your pores, but I'm not the biggest fan of the scents. The strawberry cupcake one is okay, but the other two smell like child's medicine. It doesn't linger once the mask is applied and starts drying so it doesn't bother me too much. Just keep it in mind if you're very sensitive to smells.\nCute and Glittery\nDouble Color Lipstick Waterproof Long-Lasting Lip Gloss Moisturzing Nourishing Lipsticks Balm Lip Cosmetics By Shouhengda (4 Colors Set\uff085678\uff09\nShouhengda\n{'Package Dimensions': '6.93 x 6.3 x 2.91 inches; 4.62 Ounces'}\nI wouldn't call these tints since they aren't the most long lasting, but they are still pretty nevertheless. I would recommend applying a lip balm before applying the ombre tint because it'll make it so much easier. All of the colors are very pretty & unique from one another. I didn't get any repeats.\nEasy ombre lip\nMagic Your Life Lip Gloss Smooth Tint 6 Sets\nOcean Blue Co\n{'Brand': 'Ocean Blue Co', 'Item Form': 'Liquid, Cream', 'Finish Type': 'Glossy', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Package Information': 'Tube', 'UPC': '738685260548'}\nI love collecting lip products in adorable packaging & I also love lip tints so these cute little cones are a match made in heaven for me. The packaging feels sturdy & secure so I'm pretty sure these won't leak in my purse. The tints themselves are long lasting & very pigmented. I still have some stains from where I swatched them \ud83d\ude05 They were all packed in a small bubble mailer with super pretty gold confetti which was a nice touch.  They also included two stickers (a starfish & a sea turtle) which is super nice of them. If I see anything else from this seller that I like then I'll definitely buy it.\nSuper cute & pigmented tints\nDAGEDA Color Changing Liquid Lipstick Set, 3Pcs Aloe Vera Color-Change Moisturizing Lip Oil, Temperature Color Changing Hydrated Travel Size Lip Gloss&Long Lasting Plumper Repair Lips Skin Care Kit\nDAGEDA\n{'Brand': 'DAGEDA', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Finish Type': 'Glossy', 'Product Benefits': 'Moisturizing', 'Package Dimensions': '5.24 x 3.66 x 1.18 inches; 1.41 Ounces', 'UPC': '767065401561'}\nI love the bright bubble gum pink that most color changing lip products turn in to & I love cute makeup packaging so I knew I love these. One of them did  leak a bit in transit, but luckily nothing else I bought was stained. All 3 are the same shade of pink so don't get these expecting 3 different colors. They are very moisturizing & the color is long lasting. They have a light floral scent, but it isn't noticeable once you put it on. I don't mind fragrances in lip products so it doesn't bother me.\nSuper cute & pigmented\nDAGEDA Lip Balm,6Boxs Colorful Fruity Moisturizing Jelly Lip Lotion Set,Travel Size Hydrating Nourishing Repair Lip Balms For Cracked Dry Lips&Plumper Soften Lips Mask Skin Care Gift Kit For Kid Women\nDAGEDA\n{'Brand': 'DAGEDA', 'Item Form': 'Lotion,Balm', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Product Benefits': 'Moisturizing', 'Material Feature': 'Cruelty Free', 'Package Dimensions': '5.79 x 4.65 x 1.06 inches; 4.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '767065401431'}\nI'll be honest, I mainly bought these because of how adorable these are. I love macarons & these look just like them. The containers are secure & feel sturdy, but are also lightweight. The lip balms are really nice & have a jelly like texture. They aren't as moisturizing are Laneige or Vaseline lip balms, but I like that they aren't super thick because they work well under lipstick without messing it up like other lip balms do sometimes. They all smell amazing. The pink one (strawberry I think) is definitely my favorite. Once I'm done with the lip balms I'm definitely keeping the containers to use for other things.\nSo cute \ud83d\ude0d\nDAGEDA Lip Balm,6Boxs Colorful Shiny Fruity Moisturizing Jelly Lip Lotion with Brush,Travel Size Hydrating Repair Shimmer Lip Balms for Cracked Dry Lips&Diamond Plumper Lips Mask Skin Care Gift Kit\nDAGEDA\n{'Brand': 'DAGEDA', 'Item Form': 'Lotion,Balm', 'Finish Type': 'Glossy, Shimmery', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Product Benefits': 'Moisturizing', 'Package Dimensions': '4.88 x 3.7 x 1.02 inches; 4.23 Ounces', 'UPC': '767065401448'}\nThese little lip balms are super cute & add the right amount of sparkles to my lips.
