All of the shimmers are highly pigmented and the matted come out great on the eye. The more vibrant shimmers do have a lot of fallout so I'd suggest using a shadow shield or doing your foundation and concealer after so you can cover it up. Also I would highly recommend using your finger or a sponge tip brush to apply the shimmers and pack on the color.\nReview Title: Great Budget Friendly Palette\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
