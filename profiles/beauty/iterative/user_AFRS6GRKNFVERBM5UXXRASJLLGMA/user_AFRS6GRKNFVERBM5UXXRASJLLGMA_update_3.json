They're perfect for a fun girl's night and really pull everything out of your pores, but I'm not the biggest fan of the scents. The strawberry cupcake one is okay, but the other two smell like child's medicine. It doesn't linger once the mask is applied and starts drying so it doesn't bother me too much. Just keep it in mind if you're very sensitive to smells.\nReview Title: Cute and Glittery\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

The discoloration and redness on my cheeks and forehead are much less visible in the morning if I use it at night.<br />This serum works just as well as the high-end ones and is at a much more reasonable price.<br />I'm definitely recommending this brand to all my friends.\nGreat Inexpensive Serum\nBeauty Glazed Gorgeous Me Eyeshadow Palette Matte Professional 63 Colors Eyeshadow Cosmetic Matte Eyeshadow Cream +Makeup Brushes Set and Powder Blender Sponge\nBeauty Glazed\n{'Color': 'B37-63 Shades', 'Brand': 'Beauty Glazed', 'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Finish Type': 'Matte', 'Special Feature': 'Travel size, Matte', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '5.79 x 3.9 x 0.59 inches; 13.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '711796032686', 'Manufacturer': 'Beauty Glazed'}\nThis palette doesn't have all the qualities of a high end eyeshadow palette, but it is one of the best low cost palettes I've gotten before.<br />I love the range and variety of colors in this palette. All of the shimmers are highly pigmented and the matted come out great on the eye. The more vibrant shimmers do have a lot of fallout so I'd suggest using a shadow shield or doing your foundation and concealer after so you can cover it up. Also I would highly recommend using your finger or a sponge tip brush to apply the shimmers and pack on the color.\nGreat Budget Friendly Palette\nAzure OLD PEEL OFF COLLECTION (Fantasy Collection)\nAzure Cosmetics\n{'Brand': 'Azure Cosmetics', 'Scent': 'Lavender', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Unit Count': '2.7 Ounce', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.5 x 1.5 x 5.5 inches; 10.41 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'SG_B07JFDJTGC_US', 'UPC': '689513274407'}\nThese masks are really cute and glittery.
