It also came with an awesome sticker and a sample for another Higher Education Product, super impressive and fun. I love the unique packaging that looks like a book!<br /><br />The clay mask itself is good quality, and dried without excessive tightening or drying. It washed off easily and definitely gave a clearer complexion. The instructions do advise to only use on t-zone if you have drier skin seasonally.<br /><br />Overall, great product and I will use it weekly!\nFun and Functional Clay Mask\nMini Rubber Bands Soft Elastic Bands for Kids Hair Non-slip Rubber Hair Bands Soft Hair Elastics Ties Bands Braids Hair for Girls - STRONG - REUSEABLE (Colorful1000+Black1000)\nOLEWELL\n{'Material': 'Rubber', 'Item Form': 'Elastic', 'Brand': 'OLEWELL', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Number of Pieces': '2', 'Package Dimensions': '7 x 5 x 1 inches; 0.81 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'SML'}\nCute little hair ties for the toddlers and kids in your life with thin, slippery hair! I always use this style and found this brand to be comparable to the major brand I was previously using. The stretch is good and the packet is massive, and comes with a resealable zipper pocket for each style (black and multicolour).\nSolid Hair ties for your Toddlers!\nGrinding Away Skin Polishing Scrub, 3 fl. oz., Polishing Scrub Works to Improve Skin's Texture and Tone by Buffing Away Dead Skin Cells by Higher Education Skincare\nHigher Education\n{'Brand': 'Higher Education', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Product Benefits': 'Smoother', 'Material Feature': 'Gluten Free, Cruelty Free', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.59 x 3.58 x 1.61 inches; 3 Ounces', 'UPC': '811381031008'}\nThis is a beautiful skin product, formulated with classical ingredients for an effective scrub, including Glycolic Acid and Vitamin E, both of which are essential for a good skin product.<br /><br />The product is clear, scent-free, and works effectively to exfoliate the face without being too harsh or harmful.<br />I like the fun packaging, the free sticker, and the included sample for other products by Higher Education: This definitely makes me want to purchase more products, because the company goes the extra mile with their packaging and extras.<br /><br />I have quite sensitive skin and this is the second Higher Education Product I've used, and both have been positive experiences. I recommend them without hesitation.\nA high quality skin product that really works!\nCOSMOCOS FromNature Perfect Cover BB Cream - Light Beighe/Natural Beige SPF 50+ / PA+++ Sun Protection, Natural Skin Tone, High Coverage Korean Cosmetic K Beauty - 50g (1.76 fl oz) (Light Beige)\nCOSMOCOS\n{'Brand': 'COSMOCOS', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '1.72 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Use for': 'Skin', 'Product Dimensions': '6 x 1.5 x 1 inches; 2.82 Ounces', 'UPC': '364597179540'}\nThe FromNature Perfect Cover BB Cream is a great every day cream, I purchased it for my teen worrying it may be a little dark but it was great. BB stands for beauty blender/ing and is basically a tinted moisturizer. It works as described and isn't too thick for everyday use. Its a great price point and works great!\nGood, Everyday BB Cream\nMagnetic Eyelashes With Eyeliner Kit,10 Pairs Eyelashes Magnetic 2021 Upgraded 3D Fluffy Natural Waterproof Reusable Fox Eyes Kit False Eyelashes And Eyeliner.\nAlyxxndra\n{'Color': 'Black', 'Brand': 'Alyxxndra', 'Material': 'Faux Mink', 'Material Feature': 'Disposable', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Package Dimensions': '9.21 x 6.1 x 0.71 inches; 2.89 Ounces', 'UPC': '788402874992', 'Manufacturer': 'Alyxxndra'}\nMagnetic Lashes are probably part of the robot uprising, but I, for one, welcome our new overlords. And at least I look good while doing it.<br /><br />These lashes are so great and a massive upgrade from your traditional glue on false eyelashes. I never realised how much weight the glue adds to the weight of a false lash and once I tried these magnetic lashes I was so impressed with how lightweight they are and how easily they remove.\nGreat New Lashes\nCordless Water flosser for Cleaning Teeth: 3 Modes 7 nozzles, IPX7 Waterproof, 5 Hours of Charging for 50 Days, Portable Oral Rinse for Home, Travel, Braces, Bridges, Care\nIMTUN\n{'Brand': 'IMTUN', 'Special Feature': 'Cordless,Portable,Waterproof', 'Product Benefits': 'Cleansing', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Use for': 'Teeth', 'Product Dimensions': '2.55 x 3.07 x 9.56 inches; 1.41 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'S1-W Tooth cleaning machine', 'UPC': '788436494609', 'Manufacturer': 'shenzhenshijiankeshiyeyouxiangongsi'}\nI have wanted a water pick / water flosser for such a long time, they are a moderately expensive item for a woman on a budget and I am excited to see some off brand alternatives starting to become available. I'm not the best at dental care and I hate flossing, but I have, for a long while, wanted to find an alternative.<br /><br />Like everyone should, I asked about water flossers at my last dental appointment and my dentist basically told me that while it's not as effective as traditional flossing, he still thinks its a good option particularly for lazy people like myself and those with mobility challenges who can't use floss.<br /><br />The product itself is easy to use and assemble. It charges via usb which is great and convenient. I've been using it for about 2 weeks now, and I haven't had to charge it again. I probably use it for less than 2 minutes a day. My teeth do feel cleaner and I like the feeling of how the water targets in between the teeth.<br /><br />I definitely recommend it!\nGreat Product\nMicroblading Eyebrow Pen, Eyebrow Tattoo Liquid Pen (3 Pcs) , 2 in 1 Eyeliner Pencil, Waterproof brow Pen, Natural Looking, 24h Long Lasting (3 PCS - Black & Dark Brown & Light Brown)\nEINHOOM\n{'Brand': 'EINHOOM', 'Item Form': 'Liquid,Pencil', 'Finish Type': 'Natural', 'Special Feature': 'Waterproof, Long Lasting, Natural Looking', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '6.34 x 1.26 x 0.47 inches; 1.13 Ounces', 'UPC': '726312490659'}\nThis little eyebrow pen will give you so much control when shaping your eyebrows.
