I'm not the best at dental care and I hate flossing, but I have, for a long while, wanted to find an alternative.<br /><br />Like everyone should, I asked about water flossers at my last dental appointment and my dentist basically told me that while it's not as effective as traditional flossing, he still thinks its a good option particularly for lazy people like myself and those with mobility challenges who can't use floss.<br /><br />The product itself is easy to use and assemble. It charges via usb which is great and convenient. I've been using it for about 2 weeks now, and I haven't had to charge it again. I probably use it for less than 2 minutes a day. My teeth do feel cleaner and I like the feeling of how the water targets in between the teeth.<br /><br />I definitely recommend it!\nReview Title: Great Product\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
