It is Korean law to print exp date or manufacture date on skin care products and makeup products.(Makeup products have 3 years instead of 2.5 years.)<br />Product I receive is April 2021 exp date, that is only 10 month away and that means this was manufactured on Dec 2018, that sound pretty old as it is June 2020 right now....<br />Yes it is not expired but I have been using many korean skin care brands and almost always I get the products that have at least 2 years or longer exp date.<br />This is not something you use every day like toner and I only have 10 month to use and there's no way that I can use whole bottle by April.<br />I think it's good product but hopefully you'd get longer exp date product than mine so you wouldn't waste your money!\nReview Title: Wish I received longer exp date....\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

(I think our ceiling fan help as well.)<br />This is really great addition for bedroom, living room or entryway!<br />Lighting is therapeutic at night too!<br />Totally recommend!!\nLove it\nBANILA CO Hi Bye Soothing Spot Treatment, 7 Natural Ingredients, Dermatologist-tested, Acne, Daily protection,30ml\nBANILA CO\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.09 x 1.34 x 1.3 inches; 3.63 Ounces'}\nIt did actually make my pimple a bit smaller next day but what I didn't like was exp date.<br />All Korean skin care have 2.5 years expiration date from manufacture date.
