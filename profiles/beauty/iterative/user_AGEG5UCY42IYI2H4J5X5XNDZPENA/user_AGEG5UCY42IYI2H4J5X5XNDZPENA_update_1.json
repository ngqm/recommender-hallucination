To sample it for now, I actually applied it to my hands and elbows, which suffer from some dryness year-round. The results have been great! Any roughness has dissipated easily with daily application. I may save the rest for my face for the winter, but I'm really happy with what it's done so far. The moisturizer is faintly blue, opaque, and creamy. It smells more like a lotion, but it's still a pleasant aroma. Overall, this one is definitely recommended because I have quickly seen how well it works on dry skin.\nReview Title: Nice smelling, creamy facial moisturizer\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
