Resistance\nReview Date: 2021/02/21\nStore: HOP SKIP\nAverage Rating: 3.5\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '1.89 x 1.73 x 1.61 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '860004890928'}\nReview Text: So, I saw something like this on TV and thought, 'Why not?' What guy wouldn't want to try something out that could lead to a manlier, chiseled looking jawline with just a few minutes of effort a day. I thought the people in the ad looked ridiculous, and however ridiculous they looked, I feel even more ridiculous using this thing. One big benefit is that if I ever get into an argument with my wife, I can break through even her angriest moments by popping this thing into my mouth for a little exercise in front of her. She can't help but laugh! Seriously, this thing has helped me reduce conflict in my marriage, which is probably worth an extra star, but...<br /><br />It's not very comfortable to use. I don't have issues with TMJ, but repeatedly opening and closing my mouth around these purported 40lbs of resistance leads to some pretty unpleasant soreness after about a minute or two. It hasn't gotten better with repeated use. In any case, I keep trying because it doesn't seem to be doing any damage. In the end, I haven't really noticed much in the way of increased chiseling after a month of use, but I guess I'll keep trying. The product is well made for its purpose, but remember, you'll look pretty ridiculous using it.\nReview Title: You'll look more ridiculous than with shake weight or whatever other novelty workout item...\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

To sample it for now, I actually applied it to my hands and elbows, which suffer from some dryness year-round. The results have been great! Any roughness has dissipated easily with daily application. I may save the rest for my face for the winter, but I'm really happy with what it's done so far. The moisturizer is faintly blue, opaque, and creamy. It smells more like a lotion, but it's still a pleasant aroma. Overall, this one is definitely recommended because I have quickly seen how well it works on dry skin.\nNice smelling, creamy facial moisturizer\nJaw Exerciser | Face Exerciser Ball | | Double Chin Reducer | Sculpt jaw chew lanyard included | Look Younger, slim tone, | jawline exerciser|50Lb.
