Her initial impression was that it might be something that she wouldn't want to continue using because it's extremely oily. She was worried it would leave an oily residue on her skin after using it. However, despite going on very oily, it leaves no nasty residue and washes away quickly and easily, taking makeup off with it. She says her skin feels pleasant and cleansed after using this, and it's far less harsh than many chemical makeup removers.\nReview Title: Highly effective\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Black Wolf - Men\u2019s Ultra Hydrating Moisturizer - 1.7 Fl Oz \u2013 Soothe Dry, Patchy & Flaky Areas on your Skin - Fast Absorbing Formula Won't Feel Heavy or Greasy - Sulfate Free for Dry Skin\nBlack Wolf\n{'Brand': 'Black Wolf', 'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Unit Count': '1.7 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Package Dimensions': '5.39 x 3.15 x 1.46 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'BLKWLF_MOIST_DRY', 'UPC': '850021340087'}\nMy face goes from oilier in the summer to dryer in the winter, so I haven't had a chance to fully experience the benefits of this in the season that I will need it most. To sample it for now, I actually applied it to my hands and elbows, which suffer from some dryness year-round. The results have been great! Any roughness has dissipated easily with daily application. I may save the rest for my face for the winter, but I'm really happy with what it's done so far. The moisturizer is faintly blue, opaque, and creamy. It smells more like a lotion, but it's still a pleasant aroma. Overall, this one is definitely recommended because I have quickly seen how well it works on dry skin.\nNice smelling, creamy facial moisturizer\nJaw Exerciser | Face Exerciser Ball | | Double Chin Reducer | Sculpt jaw chew lanyard included | Look Younger, slim tone, | jawline exerciser|50Lb. Resistance\nHOP SKIP\n{'Package Dimensions': '1.89 x 1.73 x 1.61 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '860004890928'}\nSo, I saw something like this on TV and thought, 'Why not?' What guy wouldn't want to try something out that could lead to a manlier, chiseled looking jawline with just a few minutes of effort a day. I thought the people in the ad looked ridiculous, and however ridiculous they looked, I feel even more ridiculous using this thing. One big benefit is that if I ever get into an argument with my wife, I can break through even her angriest moments by popping this thing into my mouth for a little exercise in front of her. She can't help but laugh! Seriously, this thing has helped me reduce conflict in my marriage, which is probably worth an extra star, but...<br /><br />It's not very comfortable to use. I don't have issues with TMJ, but repeatedly opening and closing my mouth around these purported 40lbs of resistance leads to some pretty unpleasant soreness after about a minute or two. It hasn't gotten better with repeated use. In any case, I keep trying because it doesn't seem to be doing any damage. In the end, I haven't really noticed much in the way of increased chiseling after a month of use, but I guess I'll keep trying. The product is well made for its purpose, but remember, you'll look pretty ridiculous using it.\nYou'll look more ridiculous than with shake weight or whatever other novelty workout item...\nBlack Wolf - Men\u2019s Gentle Hydrating Face Wash - 5 Fl Oz - Hydrating Sugar Technology Blend Helps Replenish Moisture - Natural Oils Argan, Coconut, & Safflower Hydrate Your Skin, Great for Dry Skin\nBlack Wolf\n{'Item Form': 'Foam', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Brand': 'Black Wolf', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '7.09 x 6.97 x 2.01 inches; 6.07 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'BLKWLF_FACEWASH_DRY', 'UPC': '850021340070'}\nI love how this face wash leaves my skin. It's very gentle but leaves my skin feeling very soft and pleasant. I've used other products from the same brand, and they've all bee good, so it's becoming one of my trusted brands.<br /><br />The best thing I can say for the face wash is this: I'm currently traveling away from home and I forgot the face wash. My skin feels noticeably worse and drier after just a week of washing with regular soap. I'm looking forward to getting home and using this again.\nWorks great, leaves skin silky smooth\nGAINWELL\nGAINWELL\n{'Brand': 'GAINWELL', 'Shape': 'Round', 'Handle Material': 'Wood', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '7.24 x 2.56 x 1.73 inches; 2.17 Ounces'}\nThis brush has been great for me and my toddler son due to its reasonable size and quality build. The wooden handle is ergonomic, and the longer bristles coupled with boars bristles make fast work of unruly hair. Both my toddler and I have wavy, relatively thick hair, and we're able to get it under control with this brush. It's priced right (under $10 when I got it), and the quality really seems higher than expected for that price range. Just be aware, when they say small, they mean small. My wife's standard sized hair brush is considerably larger. If you need something bigger, this may not be the best option, but if you have fairly short hair and are okay with a smaller brush, this one is great.<br /><br />***I write reviews as a hobby because I love trying out electronics, clothing, household products, kitchen devices, and more.

She's mostly used it for hair so far, and based on that and the fact that her hair is not super long, she says this bottle will last for some time. She likes its effects as well. It leaves her hair and eyebrows feeling silky and adds some small level of shine and healthy appearance. Overall, for under $10 at present, this one is super easy to recommend!<br /><br />***I write reviews as a hobby because I love trying out electronics, clothing, household products, kitchen devices, and more.

I've been using a straight razor for some time, but these cartridge type razors are definitely easier to use and less likely to produce accidental cuts. I was excited to try this, and in general, it's been pretty good, but not amazing. The razor itself is quite heavy and looks very cool. The cartridge fits easily and is easy to change if necessary. There's also the heavy base piece to stand the razor up. The shaving cream is not that great. It comes out of the can with impressive body, but once you start applying it to your face, it deflates and just doesn't provide awesome coverage. The razor is smooth on the skin, but because of its asymmetrical design, it's less comfortable in the left hand. I'm right handed, but I still switch between hands when I'm shaving different sides of my face. It would have been better if they made it symmetrical. Overall, not really worth $50 despite the cool looks.\nPretty good razor, so-so shaving cream.
