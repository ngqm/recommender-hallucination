It's PURE GARBAGE. NOT human hair, NOT 9A grade. My hair burned when I tried to flat iron it at 250 degrees!. Tangled like crazy and shedded like a cat. I contacted the seller to tell them this hair was no good and they offered me a 30% refund IF I give them a GOOD (LYING) REVIEW. What a joke. Any other amazon seller would apologize for the inconvenience and offer you a replacement or refund to keep you happy. $189.99 dollars I will never see again. What a disappointment, trowed the whole bundles in the garbage and was forced to buy a wig.<br /><br />DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT waste your money on this. Look for another amazon vendor and READ all 1 star reviews, those are the ones that really tell you how it is.\nHAIR IS GARBAGE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY\n4D Silk Fiber Lash Mascara Black, Natural Waterproof Mascara Extra Long Lash,Thick Thickening and Lengthening, No Clumping, No Smudging, Lasting Voluminous Eyelashes Dramatic Extension Mascara\nSIKEMAY\n{'Color': 'Black', 'Special Feature': 'Smudge Proof, Non Clumping', 'Brand': 'SIKEMAY', 'Specialty': 'Waterproof, Hypoallergenic', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '8.9 x 4 x 1.1 inches; 2.57 Ounces', 'UPC': '764690676852', 'Manufacturer': 'SIKEMAY'}\nThis Mascara is so esthetically pleasing :) so beautiful packaging and big.
