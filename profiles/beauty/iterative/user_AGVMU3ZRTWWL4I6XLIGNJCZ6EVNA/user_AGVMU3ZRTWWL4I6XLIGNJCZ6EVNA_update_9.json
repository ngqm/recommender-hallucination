It's PURE GARBAGE. NOT human hair, NOT 9A grade. My hair burned when I tried to flat iron it at 250 degrees!. Tangled like crazy and shedded like a cat. I contacted the seller to tell them this hair was no good and they offered me a 30% refund IF I give them a GOOD (LYING) REVIEW. What a joke. Any other amazon seller would apologize for the inconvenience and offer you a replacement or refund to keep you happy. $189.99 dollars I will never see again. What a disappointment, trowed the whole bundles in the garbage and was forced to buy a wig.<br /><br />DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT waste your money on this.
