If it\u2019s too light it darkens it . If it\u2019s too dark it lightens it . I would like it if it wasn\u2019t so dry or maybe if they would add some dimethacone to it to make it more moist . My skin is dry and I always have to set the makeup with a spray to moisten it back after the foundation and powder is on ..  love it and it\u2019s inexpensive\nReview Title: My favorite color .
