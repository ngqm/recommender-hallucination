This one didn't cause my lips to get itchy or dry and goes on very smooth. There is hardly any scent to it and no flavor except for a slight sunscreen taste. Overall I like it because it provided great sun protection.\nReview Title: Smooth\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "ABOUT ME MediAnswer Collagen Firming Up Mask 4ea (1box) 25g - 77% Pure Collagen Extract Anti-Aging Total Care Facial Mask Sheet, Powerful Hydrating and Anti-Wrinkle Night Skin Care\nSamyang\n{'Brand': 'Samyang', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Anti-aging', 'Scent': 'Fresh', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.1 x 6.3 x 0.9 inches; 0.88 Ounces'}\nPros: I had noticeably firmer skin after one use. It was cold and relaxing.<br /><br />Cons: The instructions on how to use are in Chinese. It's is a little difficult to position as the mask itself feels very much like slimy loose skin. My face turned red - but I do have very sensitive skin.<br /><br />Overall I was happy with the tighter looking skin. You will definitely look like something out of a horror movie when you wear this face mask so don't wear it around small children (see picture).\nWorks\nMens Sea Facial Detox Facial Mask Sheet for Oily Skin- New Skincare - Blackhead, Pore Cleansing, Peel-off (Age under 35)\nSeptCity\n{'Brand': 'SeptCity', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Product Benefits': 'Detoxifying', 'Skin Type': 'Oily', 'Unit Count': '6.00 Count', 'Product Dimensions': '7.09 x 5.51 x 0.79 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '733424600616'}\nI was skeptical when I first opened the pouch for this mask and found a dry sheet that seemingly was just a paper towel with cut outs but when I followed the directions and soaked it in water for a minute it became thick and almost skin like. I suggest when you place it in water to soak it unfolded and flat if possible because I had just added water to the pouch and let it soak folded in that and it was difficult to unfold. The eye holes and mouth holes were a bit too small for me so I will likely cut the holes bigger before soaking next time. Overall it did hydrate my skin some but not to the point where I wouldn't need to use moisturizer as I still had some dry patches. I did not experience any redness from this and for the rest of the day my skin has felt tighter. I prefer the sheer masks that come pre mositened mostly because it saves me a step but it does do what it says it will do.\nHydrates ok\nMainBasics Headband with Buttons for Face Masks (Gray)\nMainBasics\n{'Number of Items': '1', 'Brand': 'MainBasics', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '9.5 x 3.5 x 0.3 inches; 0.81 Ounces', 'UPC': '790887351233'}\nIt is a soft material headband and it is comfortable to wear. You do need to make sure the headband is flat against your head or your mask elastic will keep popping off the buttons though. It does give your ears a break if you have to wear a mask all day. I wish the buttons were more firmly sewn in place though.\nWorks\nSUIBOBO skincare 100% quartz jade roller and Essential Oil bottle eye roller-real jade crystal gem stone marble cuarzo ice cold anti aging anti puff facial face roller eye roller massager\nSUIBOBO\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.13 x 3.66 x 1.46 inches; 7.16 Ounces', 'UPC': '619470980790', 'Manufacturer': 'HENNSERY CRAFT LIMITED'}\nEasy to use and comes packaged nicely - very giftable. This roller provides a nice massage for my face and has a cool feeling to it. I like to use it with my face moisturizer. The essential oil roller is a nice bonus.\nRelaxing\nLAPCOS 24K Gold Foil Hydrogel Eye Mask (1 Pack) Under Eye Patches for Dark Circles, Puffiness, Fine Lines & Wrinkles - Anti-Aging Korean Eye Patches to Firm & Smooth Under Eye Skin\nLAPCOS\n[\"This\\xa0luxurious hydrogel patch tackles the major signs of dark circles, puffiness, fine lines, and wrinkles for a glowing, revitalized appearance.

I have used gold under eye masks before and this one wasn't as good. I like to put them in the refrigerator for a nice cooling effect when I wake up in morning and usually the cool feeling lasts 10 mins but with these after a minute it wasn't cool anymore. My eyes didnt look any brighter underneath after wearing for 20 mins. They do feel more moisturized so I gave 3 stars because of that.\nThey are ok\n[Abib] Creme coating mask Tone-up solution 17g (5pcs)\nAbib\n{'Brand': 'Abib', 'Scent': 'Unscented', 'Number of Items': '5', 'Package Dimensions': '8.7 x 6.2 x 0.8 inches; 8.01 Ounces'}\nThis mask looks pretty terrifying when on but it does a fantastic job of soothing the skin. My skin is very pale and gets sections of redness easily and when I woke up this morning I had no red sections and my skin was really hydrated. It did leave my skin a bit oily looking but I used an oil paper to pull that out and my skin looked great after that.\nVery soothing\nReusable Cotton Swab Portable Silicone Swab Washable Cotton Swabs for Ear Cleaning Beauty Treatment Makeup Cotton Swab\nJAOYU\n{'Product Dimensions': '3.2 x 3.2 x 0.39 inches', 'UPC': '739232135913'}\nI love these silicone \"cotton swabs\"!! I personally have a problem with the feeling of cotton balls and cotton swabs but they are useful. I didn't even realize something like this existed so I was super excited to try it out. I used it for touching up makeup and they are really easy to use and clean. It comes with different textured heads too so it's very versatile.\nLove these\nAvajar Perfect V Lifting Premium Eye Mask 5 Sets(10 Pairs) - Under Eye Collagen Patch | Hydrogel Anti Aging Mask for Puffy Eyes & Bags, Dark Circles and Wrinkles | Elasticity Improvement Pad\na DAILY SELF-CARE COSMETICS avajar\n{'Brand': 'a DAILY SELF-CARE COSMETICS avajar', 'Item Form': 'Mask', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating', 'Scent': 'Hydrogel', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Product Dimensions': '4.33 x 2.17 x 5.91 inches; 4.66 Ounces'}\nI was surprised when the instructions said to leave these on for 1 to 2 hours as I am used to other under eye patches only being on for 20 mins. I had the patches on for 1 hour and 25 mins. It had a slightly cool feeling the whole time it was on. I have sensitive skin and had no adverse reaction to it. I was impressed that my eye puffiness was visibly reduced.\nReduced puffiness\nPanama Jack Sunscreen Lip Balm - SPF 45, Tropical & Mango 6 Pack Plus, Broad Spectrum UVA-UVB Sunscreen Protection, Prevents & Soothes Dry, Chapped Lips\nPanama Jack\n{'Scent': 'Mango', 'Product Benefits': 'Soothing', 'Item Weight': '4.25 Grams', 'Number of Items': '6', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '5.08 x 4.72 x 1.34 inches; 0.15 Ounces'}\nI have sensitive lips so I tend to only use nivea lip gloss but I wanted something with better sun protection. This one didn't cause my lips to get itchy or dry and goes on very smooth. There is hardly any scent to it and no flavor except for a slight sunscreen taste.
