It was cold and relaxing.<br /><br />Cons: The instructions on how to use are in Chinese. It's is a little difficult to position as the mask itself feels very much like slimy loose skin. My face turned red - but I do have very sensitive skin.<br /><br />Overall I was happy with the tighter looking skin. You will definitely look like something out of a horror movie when you wear this face mask so don't wear it around small children (see picture).\nReview Title: Works\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
