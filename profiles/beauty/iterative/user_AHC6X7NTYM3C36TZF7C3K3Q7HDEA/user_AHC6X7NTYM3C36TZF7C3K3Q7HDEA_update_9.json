It absorbs o to the skin pretty quick and doesn\u2019t leave  it greasy.  The smell goes away and it seems to moisturize.\nOkay\nLeetaltree 6Pcs Makeup Sponge Set\nLeetaltree\n{'Brand': 'Leetaltree', 'Color': 'Ivory', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '1.6 x 1.6 x 2.36 inches', 'Skin Type': 'Normal,All Skin Types', 'Product Dimensions': '1.6 x 1.6 x 2.36 inches; 2.08 Ounces'}\nSoft but firm, squishy, foundation sponges.

The mirror is easy to assemble. Just snap the base on.  Mirror is this and heavy.  The light is adjustable.  My biggest issue is with quality control.  The corner is the mirror is chipped.\nDamaged\nCanple Self-cleaning Slicker Brush for Medium Long Hair Types Dog and Cat, Removes Loose Hair Undercoat Effectively Reduce Mats & Tanglings Grooming Brush\nCanple\n{'Brand': 'Canple', 'Special Feature': 'Self Cleaning', 'Product Benefits': 'Smoothing', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '10.16 x 6.3 x 2.2 inches; 8.82 Ounces'}\nExcellent product.

Colors look great.  One very big con was the top coat.  It just didn\u2019t seem to want to dry and took way longer than other dip sets that I have. Needless to say I touched it and ruined the clean look.  I will be using a gel top coat with this going forward.\nPretty colors\nGel Nail Polish Set - TOEDO Fall Winter Nail Gel 6 Colors Tan Brown Colors Soak Off LED Nail Lamp Gel Polish Kit for Home DIY Manicure Nail Designs\nTOEDO\n{'Brand': 'TOEDO', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'gel', 'Finish Type': 'Matte,Glossy', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '1.56 FL Oz', 'Liquid Volume': '0.27 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '11.1 x 3.31 x 3.23 inches; 9.14 Ounces'}\nPretty colors but the polish was very thick.  It\u2019s difficult to apply.  Probably personal preference but I\u2019d like it a little thinner so that it distributes/applies easier.\nConsistency too thick\nKRISNICE Gel Nail Polish Kit- 6 Colors Blue Olive Turquoise Lavender Purple Gel Polish Set Glitter Nail Polish Soak Off LED Gel Nail Kit Nail Art Manicure Salon DIY at Home Gifts for Women (KCS6-010)\nKRISNICE\n{'Brand': 'KRISNICE', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Color': 'Blue,Olive,Turquoise,Purple', 'Type': 'gel', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Special Feature': 'Long Lasting', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '6.00 Count', 'Liquid Volume': '7.3 Milliliters', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '5.51 x 3.94 x 0.59 inches', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '5.51 x 3.94 x 0.59 inches; 1.41 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'KCS6-010', 'UPC': '613635849250'}\nThese gel polish colors are perfect for spring.
