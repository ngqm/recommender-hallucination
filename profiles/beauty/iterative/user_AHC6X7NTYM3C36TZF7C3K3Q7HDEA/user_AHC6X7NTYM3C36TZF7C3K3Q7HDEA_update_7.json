Colors look great.  One very big con was the top coat.  It just didn\u2019t seem to want to dry and took way longer than other dip sets that I have. Needless to say I touched it and ruined the clean look.  I will be using a gel top coat with this going forward.\nReview Title: Pretty colors\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
