I like how vibrant the colors are and how smoothly the liner goes on. Paired with a lipstick, they look really nice and work well. I just wish that the color was accurate. Other than that, great product!\nReview Title: Pretty colors, not accurate\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I really just wanted this pack for the mirror. Well, I got it and now I realize I need to make a dental appointment! In all seriousness, the mirror works okay but after I pulled the protective plastic cover off it started to scratch badly. Don't know why.\nOkay\nPlant Therapy Natural Acetone Free Nail Polish Remover 6 fl oz One Touch Dispensing Bottle with Flip Top Cap Tropical Flower Scent\nPlant Therapy\n{'Brand': 'Plant Therapy', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Item Weight': '6.24 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Unit Count': '6 Fl Oz', 'Package Dimensions': '5.1 x 2.2 x 2.2 inches; 6.24 Ounces', 'UPC': '680912056168'}\nSmells great and works!

It helps moisturize my skin and calm it afterwards. It's not greasy and moisturizes really well. It has a light scent that isn't too strong. I've been using this moisturizer for a while now and it hasn't caused any breakouts or dry spots.
