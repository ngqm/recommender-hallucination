It definitely makes your feet peel and after it's all done they are baby smooth. I followed the instructions and my feet peeled for approximately a week. After they were done peeling I gave myself a home pedicure because it didn't take off EVERY callus but it did well enough that they were soooo smooth afterwards. My feet are summer time ready!\nReview Title: Really works, super soft feet\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Loved that it has a speed control where it can be slow to very fast for acrylic nails. It worked great on my natural nails. Will definitely keep using it!\nWorks fantastic!

I really just wanted this pack for the mirror. Well, I got it and now I realize I need to make a dental appointment! In all seriousness, the mirror works okay but after I pulled the protective plastic cover off it started to scratch badly. Don't know why.\nOkay\nPlant Therapy Natural Acetone Free Nail Polish Remover 6 fl oz One Touch Dispensing Bottle with Flip Top Cap Tropical Flower Scent\nPlant Therapy\n{'Brand': 'Plant Therapy', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Item Weight': '6.24 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Unit Count': '6 Fl Oz', 'Package Dimensions': '5.1 x 2.2 x 2.2 inches; 6.24 Ounces', 'UPC': '680912056168'}\nSmells great and works!

As I was trying to remove the tape around the plastic covering the handle snapped in half.\nBroke immediately\nBlue Sage De-Puffing Caffeine Eye Serum | Natural Anti-Aging Eye Treatment with Probiotics, Green Tea + Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Face to Tighten and Hydrate under Eye Skin, and Brighten Dark Circles\nBlue Sage\n{'Package Dimensions': '6.06 x 1.65 x 1.42 inches; 4.69 Ounces', 'UPC': '860004070450', 'Manufacturer': 'Blue Sage Skin Co'}\nI couldn't use this product at all. Any time I tried to apply to my under eye it would burn really badly. I would have to immediately wipe it off. I always used a clean face when I applied this and it still burned.\nBurned and I couldn't use\nBlack Wolf - Men\u2019s Ultra Hydrating Moisturizer - 1.7 Fl Oz \u2013 Soothe Dry, Patchy & Flaky Areas on your Skin - Fast Absorbing Formula Won't Feel Heavy or Greasy - Sulfate Free for Dry Skin\nBlack Wolf\n{'Brand': 'Black Wolf', 'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Unit Count': '1.7 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Package Dimensions': '5.39 x 3.15 x 1.46 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'BLKWLF_MOIST_DRY', 'UPC': '850021340087'}\nI like to use this moisturizer after I use the Black Wolf charcoal mask. It helps moisturize my skin and calm it afterwards. It's not greasy and moisturizes really well. It has a light scent that isn't too strong. I've been using this moisturizer for a while now and it hasn't caused any breakouts or dry spots. Really good product!\nSmells nice, moisturizes, works well after black mask use\nLip Liner Set 12 Colors Natural Lip Liner Makeup Pencil Long Lasting Matte Velvet Lip Liner\nMarine Forest\n{'Brand': 'Marine Forest', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Item Form': 'Pencil', 'Finish Type': 'Matte,Velvet', 'Product Benefits': 'Smoothening', 'Package Dimensions': '6.42 x 2.28 x 0.94 inches; 2.24 Ounces', 'UPC': '729843697955'}\nI tried each one of these lip liners and they are not true to the colors on the pencils. I like how vibrant the colors are and how smoothly the liner goes on. Paired with a lipstick, they look really nice and work well. I just wish that the color was accurate. Other than that, great product!\nPretty colors, not accurate\n2Pcs Mascara Black Volume and Length 4D Natural and Long Lasting Lash Blast Mascara, 0.27 Fl Oz\nMarine Forest\n{'Brand': 'Marine Forest', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Item Volume': '0.27 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Information': 'Tube', 'Water Resistance Level': 'Waterproof', 'Package Dimensions': '4.84 x 2.01 x 0.98 inches; 3.17 Ounces', 'UPC': '729843907382'}\nI am very impressed with this mascara!

They are fairly long but I like that. I can cut and file them to size. These nails come with many different sizes guaranteeing the right fit for everyone. My daughter used these nails with some nail decals and applied a clear gel top coat to get them to look shiny. They are great quality and I love them!\nEasy to use, pretty, variety of color\nLavender Foot Peel Mask 2 Pcs for Softing Smoothing Feet,Peeling Away Calluses and Dead Skin CellsExfoliating Foot Mask,Repair Rough Heels,Get Silky Feet\nBOOSCA\n{'Brand': 'BOOSCA', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Product Benefits': 'Smoothing,Nourish', 'Scent': 'Lavender', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Package Dimensions': '7.52 x 5.24 x 0.47 inches; 2.89 Ounces', 'UPC': '783103348421'}\nI didn't think this would work but it does!
