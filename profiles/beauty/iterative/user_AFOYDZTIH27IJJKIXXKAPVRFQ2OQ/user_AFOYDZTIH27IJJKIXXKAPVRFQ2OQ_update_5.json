If you have wavy, frizzy, unmanageable hair (as I do), this could really help!  I had been using argan oil and other oil blends to tame my wild hair, and when I read the ingredients in my roommate's beard oil and saw how similar they were, I wanted to give it a try.  I first bought the Tea Tree blend by Beardsmen Spirit, since I'm a big fan of the benefits of tea tree oil, and I liked it so much that I wanted to try out this Rousing Citrus blend.<br /><br />As far as ingredients go, the Rousing Citrus blend has Jojoba seed oil, sweet almond oil, grape seed oil, glycerin, grapefruit peel oil, lemon fruit oil, blood orange essential oil, clove flower oil, and vanilla plantifolia fruit essential oil.  I compared this to the ingredients in the Tea Tree blend, which are Jojoba seed oil, sweet almond oil, grape seed oil, glycerin, peppermint essential oil, tea tree leaf essential oil, and vanilla plantifolia fruit essential oil.  Not too big of a difference except for the obvious different essential oils.  This oil has about the same thick consistency, and a little bit goes a long way!  It takes about 5-6 drops of the oil to tame the frizz in my hair that's about 4 inches down past my shoulders.<br /><br />One con for me though: this oil does not really have a citrus smell.  I smell clove over everything else, and while this isn't a bad thing, I was really hoping for those lemon and blood orange essential oils to be prominent.  So a more appropriate name for this would be &#34;Rousing Clove&#34;.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion. I will not rate items highly if they don't deserve the rating, and I write these lengthy reviews to help out fellow shoppers, since I always read reviews on products before buying. :)  Feel free to ask any questions you have about any details I may have left out!\nReview Title: Works wonders for taming frizz.

If you have hard to manage, dry, brittle hair, this can works WONDERS.  I have very fine, wavy, frizzy hair AND I live in Florida, so the odds are always against my hair.  After realizing that the ingredients in beard oils are the same as the ingredients in many hair products (like tea tree oil, jojoba oil, grape seed oil, etc), and hearing from other women about the benefits of using it in your hair, I wanted to give this a try.  The tea tree oil and peppermint oil are absolutely wonderful for dry, itchy scalps, and just a little bit of this stuff goes a long way.  I put a dime-sized amount of the beard oil in my palms and distributed it evenly throughout my hair, from roots to tips, and massaged it into my scalp as well.  This oil is thicker than most oil treatments that are advertised for hair, so again, a little dab goes far!  I like that, though, because it really feels like it's coating and absorbing into my thirsty hair.  As my hair dried, the waves were well-defined and NOT FRIZZY, hallelujah!<br /><br />Another secret for guys and gals:  this type of beard oil containing tea tree oil can also be used in more uh, private areas.  Why not keep hair in your nether regions just as soft as conditioned as hair in the upper regions?  The tea tree oil is very soothing on razor burn as well.  Basically, this beard oil is very versatile in its uses, and I'm loving it.  Thumbs up, would recommend!<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion.

With Hyaluronic Acid, Coenzyme (CoQ10), Licorice, Vitamin C, Glycolic. For sagging skin and wrinkles\n{'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '2.0 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Item Volume': '2 Fluid Ounces', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '3 x 3 x 2.5 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '703510551986'}\nI'm 30 years old and have been trying to do a lot of preventative skin care (especially since I live in Florida and get quite a bit of sun on my skin on a regular basis).  One reason I was drawn to this particular neck firming cream was the royal jelly ingredient.  I'm new to learning about the benefits of royal jelly, so for those who haven't hear of it before, royal jelly is a substance secreted by honeybee workers and fed by them to larvae that are being raised as possible queen bees.  When used externally, royal jelly increases the skin's moisture and collagen production, which slows the process of getting wrinkles.  There are tons of other beneficial oils in this cream, all of which can be found on the ingredients list on the product page.<br /><br />This neck firming cream is very thick, but absorbs quickly into the skin, and does not leave an oily residue.  After washing my face and neck area, I put a dime-sized amount of the cream in my palms and then applied it to my neck, distributing it evenly with circular motions.  This cream has a very light and pleasant, almost gingery scent.  The reason I am rating this 4 stars instead of 5 si the fact that I did get a few blemishes on my neck after using the cream.  I am not sure if this was a result of an ingredient, or my skin just getting used to a new product.  I have been suing this for 5 days now.  My neck did feel very nourished and moisturized after using this, so I will continue to apply this cream unless more blemishes appear.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion.

Hyaluronic Acid with Aquaxyl. 1 fl. oz.\n{'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Unit Count': '1.0 Fl Oz', 'Package Dimensions': '4 x 2 x 2 inches; 0.8 Ounces'}\nI'm very big on preventative skin care, especially for my face and neck, especially since I live in Florida.  The sun is not forgiving here, so skin care is a top priority to me.  I chose to purchase vitamin C serum from Skederm after reading about their carefully chosen ingredients.  Even the container was carefully thought out to preserve the shelf life of the ingredients.  In addition to many beneficial oils in the serum, the ingredients include hyaluronic acid, which helps retain moisture, which protects the skin from free radical damage, sun damage, and aiding in the reduction of inflammation.<br /><br />I have been using this serum in my daily skin care regimen, applying if after cleansing my face and neck areas.  One pump from the bottle is enough for me to evenly distribute a layer of the serum over all of my face and neck.  The serum itself is actually more of a lotion.  It is white and smooth like a facial moisturizer, and it spreads over skin like one.  The serum absorbs quickly into the skin, and leaves it feeling very hydrated and soft.  I noticed a very slight greasy feeling on the skin under my eyes and under my chin a couple of times after applying, but it hasn't negatively affected my skin in any way.  It may just take longer to absorb in those areas, or maybe I should apply less.<br /><br />Since I started using this serum only 3 days ago, I have noticed less sagging in the skin below my eyes, which has always been a problem area for me.  The skin on my neck also feels more elasticized and very moisturized throughout the day.  Thumbs up for this Vitamin C serum!<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion.

I was drawn to Derma-Nu after reading numerous good reviews, as well as wanting to try a serum with green tea in the ingredients.  Most of the other serums I have purchased do not have green tea as a listed ingredient, and I'm really a big fan of all of the benefits of it, so I was sold!<br /><br />The bottle of serum comes with a pamphlet showing other products by Derma-Nu that are suggested as being used in conjunction with this firming serum, as well as a pamphlet showing their line of products for complete body skin care.  Anyway, let's get back to this serum!  I'm a fan of hyaluronic acid and it's ability to hold 1000 times its weight in water.  In this serum, the mixture has been infused with vitamin C, vitamin E, and green tea for their anti-aging properties.  The serum itself is very fluid, and it takes about a nickel sized amount to cover my whole face and neck area.  It spreads evenly and smoothly, and takes a moment to absorb, so it's easy to make sure you've covered all of the important areas (some other serums I've purchased tend to absorb so quickly that I can't get it distributed evenly).  I would recommend using a moisturizer after letting the serum soak in for a few minutes.  My skin feels fantastic after using this, and I've noticed the skin under my eyes feeling firmer just after using this a few times.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion.
