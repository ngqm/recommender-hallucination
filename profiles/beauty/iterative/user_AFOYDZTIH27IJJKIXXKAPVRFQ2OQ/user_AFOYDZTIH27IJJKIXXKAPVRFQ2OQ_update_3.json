Hyaluronic Acid with Aquaxyl. 1 fl. oz.\nReview Date: 2016/05/31\nAverage Rating: 3.2\nProduct Details: {'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Unit Count': '1.0 Fl Oz', 'Package Dimensions': '4 x 2 x 2 inches; 0.8 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I'm very big on preventative skin care, especially for my face and neck, especially since I live in Florida.  The sun is not forgiving here, so skin care is a top priority to me.  I chose to purchase vitamin C serum from Skederm after reading about their carefully chosen ingredients.  Even the container was carefully thought out to preserve the shelf life of the ingredients.  In addition to many beneficial oils in the serum, the ingredients include hyaluronic acid, which helps retain moisture, which protects the skin from free radical damage, sun damage, and aiding in the reduction of inflammation.<br /><br />I have been using this serum in my daily skin care regimen, applying if after cleansing my face and neck areas.  One pump from the bottle is enough for me to evenly distribute a layer of the serum over all of my face and neck.  The serum itself is actually more of a lotion.  It is white and smooth like a facial moisturizer, and it spreads over skin like one.  The serum absorbs quickly into the skin, and leaves it feeling very hydrated and soft.  I noticed a very slight greasy feeling on the skin under my eyes and under my chin a couple of times after applying, but it hasn't negatively affected my skin in any way.  It may just take longer to absorb in those areas, or maybe I should apply less.<br /><br />Since I started using this serum only 3 days ago, I have noticed less sagging in the skin below my eyes, which has always been a problem area for me.  The skin on my neck also feels more elasticized and very moisturized throughout the day.  Thumbs up for this Vitamin C serum!<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion.

  "reference_summary": "Beard Oil - Tea Tree Scent - Huge Man-Sized 4 oz Bottle - 100% Natural - Softens Your Beard and Stops Itching - Scent Women Love - Best Beard Oil And Conditioner For Men\nBEARDSMEN SPIRIT\n{'Scent': 'Tea Tree', 'Liquid Volume': '4 Fluid Ounces', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Brand': 'BEARDSMEN SPIRIT', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Package Dimensions': '4.7 x 2 x 2 inches; 8 Ounces', 'UPC': '646437251228'}\nLadies: beard oil is your friend!  If you have hard to manage, dry, brittle hair, this can works WONDERS.  I have very fine, wavy, frizzy hair AND I live in Florida, so the odds are always against my hair.  After realizing that the ingredients in beard oils are the same as the ingredients in many hair products (like tea tree oil, jojoba oil, grape seed oil, etc), and hearing from other women about the benefits of using it in your hair, I wanted to give this a try.  The tea tree oil and peppermint oil are absolutely wonderful for dry, itchy scalps, and just a little bit of this stuff goes a long way.  I put a dime-sized amount of the beard oil in my palms and distributed it evenly throughout my hair, from roots to tips, and massaged it into my scalp as well.  This oil is thicker than most oil treatments that are advertised for hair, so again, a little dab goes far!  I like that, though, because it really feels like it's coating and absorbing into my thirsty hair.  As my hair dried, the waves were well-defined and NOT FRIZZY, hallelujah!<br /><br />Another secret for guys and gals:  this type of beard oil containing tea tree oil can also be used in more uh, private areas.  Why not keep hair in your nether regions just as soft as conditioned as hair in the upper regions?  The tea tree oil is very soothing on razor burn as well.  Basically, this beard oil is very versatile in its uses, and I'm loving it.  Thumbs up, would recommend!<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion.

With Hyaluronic Acid, Coenzyme (CoQ10), Licorice, Vitamin C, Glycolic. For sagging skin and wrinkles\n{'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '2.0 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Item Volume': '2 Fluid Ounces', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '3 x 3 x 2.5 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '703510551986'}\nI'm 30 years old and have been trying to do a lot of preventative skin care (especially since I live in Florida and get quite a bit of sun on my skin on a regular basis).  One reason I was drawn to this particular neck firming cream was the royal jelly ingredient.  I'm new to learning about the benefits of royal jelly, so for those who haven't hear of it before, royal jelly is a substance secreted by honeybee workers and fed by them to larvae that are being raised as possible queen bees.  When used externally, royal jelly increases the skin's moisture and collagen production, which slows the process of getting wrinkles.  There are tons of other beneficial oils in this cream, all of which can be found on the ingredients list on the product page.<br /><br />This neck firming cream is very thick, but absorbs quickly into the skin, and does not leave an oily residue.  After washing my face and neck area, I put a dime-sized amount of the cream in my palms and then applied it to my neck, distributing it evenly with circular motions.  This cream has a very light and pleasant, almost gingery scent.  The reason I am rating this 4 stars instead of 5 si the fact that I did get a few blemishes on my neck after using the cream.  I am not sure if this was a result of an ingredient, or my skin just getting used to a new product.  I have been suing this for 5 days now.  My neck did feel very nourished and moisturized after using this, so I will continue to apply this cream unless more blemishes appear.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion.
