The citrus scent, while good, is more of a clove scent than a citrus in my opinion (as the product DOES contain clove), but it is not at all overpowering in any way, so it will not clash with your colognes or other fragrances that you wear. Just a small drop is enough to keep your facial hair looking hydrated, as there is truly nothing worse looking than a dry beard! This blend of beard oil contains many top quality oils such as: grape seed oil, orange oil, jojoba oil, and more! The 4 oz. bottle will last you a very long time. In fact, I have barely made a dent in mine! If you\u2019re growing out your facial hair and want it to look its best, this beard oil is a great place to start!<br /><br />I was provided this beard oil for free in order to evaluate and provide my honest feedback through a review.\nReview Title: Good quality oil; Smells more like clove than citrus though\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Calily Genuine Handcrafted Sandalwood Comb for Men \u2013 Pocket Size Mustache and Beard Comb with Premium Synthetic Leather Case / Ultra-Smooth Combing; No Static or Snagging\nCalily\n{'Brand': 'Calily', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.6 x 3.1 x 0.6 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '821079365117'}\nIf you\u2019re looking for a compact, yet very stylish comb that can be used on your beard, mustache, and even hair, look no further than this handcrafted sandalwood comb by Calily. The comb itself is just over 3 inches, meaning it fits perfectly in any pocket, bag, glove compartment of a car, etc. If you are always on the run like I am, having a useful and reliable comb is key in making sure you look your best! I usually slick back my hair, and on especially hot days, it can come undone, leading to a rather homely look. Now the only thing I have to do is take the comb out of my pocket and I\u2019m good to go! Although my beard isn\u2019t anywhere near as long as I\u2019d like it, It also works well there.<br /><br />The comb itself features a nice sandalwood scent that is both refreshing and calming. The wood on the comb feels very sturdy, and the teeth on the comb feel as if they will not break easily, like plastic combs do. The comb also comes with a very nice carrying case.<br /><br />Overall, if you need a reliable, stylish, and VERY compact comb, I would absolutely recommend this comb by Calily.<br /><br />I was sent this product for free in order to evaluate and leave my honest feedback.\nThe perfect comb for anybody who is always on the go!\nWebat Bath Bombs Gift Set, Spa Bomb Fizzies & Ultra Lush Essential Oil - Dry Skin Moisturize, Fit for Bubble & Spa Bath, Handmade Birthday Gift Ideal for Lady, Women, Girlfriend, Men\nWebat\n[\"Product Specification: 1.
