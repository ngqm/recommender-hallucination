The comb itself is just over 3 inches, meaning it fits perfectly in any pocket, bag, glove compartment of a car, etc. If you are always on the run like I am, having a useful and reliable comb is key in making sure you look your best! I usually slick back my hair, and on especially hot days, it can come undone, leading to a rather homely look. Now the only thing I have to do is take the comb out of my pocket and I\u2019m good to go! Although my beard isn\u2019t anywhere near as long as I\u2019d like it, It also works well there.<br /><br />The comb itself features a nice sandalwood scent that is both refreshing and calming. The wood on the comb feels very sturdy, and the teeth on the comb feel as if they will not break easily, like plastic combs do. The comb also comes with a very nice carrying case.<br /><br />Overall, if you need a reliable, stylish, and VERY compact comb, I would absolutely recommend this comb by Calily.<br /><br />I was sent this product for free in order to evaluate and leave my honest feedback.\nReview Title: The perfect comb for anybody who is always on the go!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
