  "reference_summary": "Calily Genuine Handcrafted Sandalwood Comb for Men \u2013 Pocket Size Mustache and Beard Comb with Premium Synthetic Leather Case / Ultra-Smooth Combing; No Static or Snagging\nCalily\n{'Brand': 'Calily', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.6 x 3.1 x 0.6 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '821079365117'}\nIf you\u2019re looking for a compact, yet very stylish comb that can be used on your beard, mustache, and even hair, look no further than this handcrafted sandalwood comb by Calily. The comb itself is just over 3 inches, meaning it fits perfectly in any pocket, bag, glove compartment of a car, etc. If you are always on the run like I am, having a useful and reliable comb is key in making sure you look your best! I usually slick back my hair, and on especially hot days, it can come undone, leading to a rather homely look. Now the only thing I have to do is take the comb out of my pocket and I\u2019m good to go! Although my beard isn\u2019t anywhere near as long as I\u2019d like it, It also works well there.<br /><br />The comb itself features a nice sandalwood scent that is both refreshing and calming. The wood on the comb feels very sturdy, and the teeth on the comb feel as if they will not break easily, like plastic combs do. The comb also comes with a very nice carrying case.<br /><br />Overall, if you need a reliable, stylish, and VERY compact comb, I would absolutely recommend this comb by Calily.<br /><br />I was sent this product for free in order to evaluate and leave my honest feedback.\nThe perfect comb for anybody who is always on the go!\nWebat Bath Bombs Gift Set, Spa Bomb Fizzies & Ultra Lush Essential Oil - Dry Skin Moisturize, Fit for Bubble & Spa Bath, Handmade Birthday Gift Ideal for Lady, Women, Girlfriend, Men\nWebat\n[\"Product Specification: 1.

Now add these bath bombs by Calily to the mix, and you have an even more enjoyable experience!<br /><br />This set comes with 6 bath bombs; Garden of Heaven, Yoga Strength, Revive, Vanilla Indulgence, Stress relief, and Energy Grapefruit.<br /><br />The bath bombs all come individually wrapped, in a very nice gift box. This means that they would be an excellent present for any lady in your life. Once you add them to the water, the immediately begin to fizz and turn your water a color (does not stain your skin). They all smell beautiful. My personal favorite is the Vanilla Indulgence scent!<br /><br />If you\u2019re looking for a gift for a special lady (I suppose guys can use them as well!) in your life, or looking for a way to take your relaxation to the next level, I would totally recommend trying out these bath bombs by Calily!<br /><br />I received these bath bombs for free in order to test and leave my honest feedback.\nThe ultimate bath time experience!\nBeard Oil - Rousing Citrus Scent - Huge Man-Sized 4 oz Bottle - 100% Natural - Softens Your Beard and Stops Itching - Scent Women Love - Best Beard Oil And Conditioner For Men\nBEARDSMEN SPIRIT\n{'Scent': 'Citrus', 'Liquid Volume': '4 Fluid Ounces', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Brand': 'BEARDSMEN SPIRIT', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Package Dimensions': '4.1 x 2 x 1.8 inches; 8 Ounces'}\nThis is a very high quality beard oil that is sure to keep your facial hair looking its best! The citrus scent, while good, is more of a clove scent than a citrus in my opinion (as the product DOES contain clove), but it is not at all overpowering in any way, so it will not clash with your colognes or other fragrances that you wear. Just a small drop is enough to keep your facial hair looking hydrated, as there is truly nothing worse looking than a dry beard! This blend of beard oil contains many top quality oils such as: grape seed oil, orange oil, jojoba oil, and more! The 4 oz. bottle will last you a very long time. In fact, I have barely made a dent in mine! If you\u2019re growing out your facial hair and want it to look its best, this beard oil is a great place to start!<br /><br />I was provided this beard oil for free in order to evaluate and provide my honest feedback through a review.\nGood quality oil; Smells more like clove than citrus though\nPoly Gel Nail Kit, opove Nail Builder Gel Extension Nail thickening Solution French Nail Art Equitment - 6 Colors 15ML\nopove\n{'Product Dimensions': '13.78 x 5.91 x 1.97 inches; 1.82 Pounds'}\nThis kit had everything We were looking for.
