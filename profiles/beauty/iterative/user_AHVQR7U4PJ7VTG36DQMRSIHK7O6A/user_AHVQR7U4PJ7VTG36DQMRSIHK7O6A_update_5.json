I've been wearing them daily in the morning and I've noticed such an improvement in my eyes and the puffiness around them. I usually leave them on for 45 minutes each morning and when I take them off my eyes feel moisturized and rejuvenated.<br /><br />They come packed nicely in the container and comes with a little spoon that you can use to get a pair of masks out since they are saturated in a liquid.<br /><br />As a bonus tip, try keeping these in your refrigerator.

The comb itself is just over 3 inches, meaning it fits perfectly in any pocket, bag, glove compartment of a car, etc. If you are always on the run like I am, having a useful and reliable comb is key in making sure you look your best! I usually slick back my hair, and on especially hot days, it can come undone, leading to a rather homely look. Now the only thing I have to do is take the comb out of my pocket and I\u2019m good to go! Although my beard isn\u2019t anywhere near as long as I\u2019d like it, It also works well there.<br /><br />The comb itself features a nice sandalwood scent that is both refreshing and calming. The wood on the comb feels very sturdy, and the teeth on the comb feel as if they will not break easily, like plastic combs do. The comb also comes with a very nice carrying case.<br /><br />Overall, if you need a reliable, stylish, and VERY compact comb, I would absolutely recommend this comb by Calily.<br /><br />I was sent this product for free in order to evaluate and leave my honest feedback.\nThe perfect comb for anybody who is always on the go!\nWebat Bath Bombs Gift Set, Spa Bomb Fizzies & Ultra Lush Essential Oil - Dry Skin Moisturize, Fit for Bubble & Spa Bath, Handmade Birthday Gift Ideal for Lady, Women, Girlfriend, Men\nWebat\n[\"Product Specification: 1.

The citrus scent, while good, is more of a clove scent than a citrus in my opinion (as the product DOES contain clove), but it is not at all overpowering in any way, so it will not clash with your colognes or other fragrances that you wear. Just a small drop is enough to keep your facial hair looking hydrated, as there is truly nothing worse looking than a dry beard! This blend of beard oil contains many top quality oils such as: grape seed oil, orange oil, jojoba oil, and more! The 4 oz. bottle will last you a very long time. In fact, I have barely made a dent in mine! If you\u2019re growing out your facial hair and want it to look its best, this beard oil is a great place to start!<br /><br />I was provided this beard oil for free in order to evaluate and provide my honest feedback through a review.\nGood quality oil; Smells more like clove than citrus though\nPoly Gel Nail Kit, opove Nail Builder Gel Extension Nail thickening Solution French Nail Art Equitment - 6 Colors 15ML\nopove\n{'Product Dimensions': '13.78 x 5.91 x 1.97 inches; 1.82 Pounds'}\nThis kit had everything We were looking for.
