The packaging is rather fancy but the scents are so delicious . They remind me of cocktails they serve in the Hawaiian islands..The bars are a full size 10.5 oz and you can share these with a male spouse. Most male's tend to avoid scented soaps especially if they linger? To bad I didn't buy this one for myself but my cousin should enjoy this soap. Maybe she will return the favor and buy me the same brand? Lol\nReview Title: Taking a cruise...in the Hawaiian islands\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Handmade in Sussex, England, these bars are triple-milled to produce a completely uniform, long-lasting soap. Imbued with carefully chosen Michel Design Works fragrances, every bath will be a luxurious one. Michel Design Works was created by Bruce & Deborah Michel in the early 1980s. The first product was an elaborate \u201cmemory book\u201d called Our Country Diary. Still a favorite today, it is filled with vintage artwork, quirky quotes, notable dates and plenty of room to record all the events of the year. Our Country Diary will become a beautiful record of your family life. When they first created their signature elephant logo, it signified a remembrance of all things special. Although Michel Design Works has greatly expanded into bath & body, home fragrance and decor, when Bruce & Deborah remember and celebrate all of their wonderful customers and the company\u2019s history, it is even more fitting today!
