Handmade in Sussex, England, these bars are triple-milled to produce a completely uniform, long-lasting soap. Imbued with carefully chosen Michel Design Works fragrances, every bath will be a luxurious one. Michel Design Works was created by Bruce & Deborah Michel in the early 1980s. The first product was an elaborate \u201cmemory book\u201d called Our Country Diary. Still a favorite today, it is filled with vintage artwork, quirky quotes, notable dates and plenty of room to record all the events of the year. Our Country Diary will become a beautiful record of your family life. When they first created their signature elephant logo, it signified a remembrance of all things special. Although Michel Design Works has greatly expanded into bath & body, home fragrance and decor, when Bruce & Deborah remember and celebrate all of their wonderful customers and the company\u2019s history, it is even more fitting today! Whether you are a new or a long-time friend, we welcome you to enjoy the art, lather up with our English soaps, set an elegant table with napkins, candles, plates, and serveware, and end your day with wonderfully fragrant n bubble bath.']\n{'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'Michel Design Works', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '6 x 3 x 2 inches; 6.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'SOAL227', 'UPC': '608666691299', 'Manufacturer': 'Michel Design Works'}\nI purchased the Hummingbird scent and I currently own three scents from Michel.. The Peony is really a good scent and the scent is just wonderful. The bars are really big and the lather is just infectious so I recommend that you buy a bar for bathing.

First of all these soap sets were on my Wish-list for sometime. They arrived today and just like they are pictured...The big bar is truly huge..! Reminds me of a container of butter that you find in the super market. The scents are very nice and they arrived un broken or switched out due to a shortage in shipping.
