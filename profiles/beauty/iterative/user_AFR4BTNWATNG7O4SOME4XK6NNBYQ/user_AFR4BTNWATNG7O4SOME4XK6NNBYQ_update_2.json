I like this product but I must warn African females (black) this product does leave a residue..so if you use this lotion daily..always brush your hair out. From the scalp to the ends...it reminds me of the &#34;jerri curl&#34; products from the 1980's. Over all my hair did not dry out and it stayed moisturized for atleast 2-3 before re-applying. If you use a pressing comb or hot curling iron dont mix this product with heat..if you desire a Donna Summers look this is perfect..\nReview Title: Better than a perm any day..\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
