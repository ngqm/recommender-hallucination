  "reference_summary": "Savon de Marseille, Jasmine fragrance, 5.3 Oz Bar soap, Marius Fabre\nMarius Fabre\n{'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Brand': 'Marius Fabre', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '5.3 Ounce', 'Item Package Quantity': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '3 x 1 x 2 inches; 4.8 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'HB150JA'}\nThe bar is rather small..but the jasmine is overly pungent! In a good way..I'm wondering could it be chemically enhanced? Most jasmine's are rather light in nature. Regardless this bar is for a special occasion like my birthday 2015\nblooms in jasmine\nOptimum Salon Haircare Damage Antidote Oil Moisturizer 8.5 oz\nSoft-Sheen Carson\n{'Material Type Free': 'Aluminum Free', 'Liquid Volume': '8.5 Fluid Ounces', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Brand': 'Soft-Sheen Carson', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.5 x 2.5 x 1.2 inches; 3.99 Ounces', 'UPC': '755332133307 796433040804 075285008492 784190441354'}\nI bought this product last year in 2014 at a local CVS pharmacy store. I like this product but I must warn African females (black) this product does leave a residue..so if you use this lotion daily..always brush your hair out. From the scalp to the ends...it reminds me of the &#34;jerri curl&#34; products from the 1980's. Over all my hair did not dry out and it stayed moisturized for atleast 2-3 before re-applying. If you use a pressing comb or hot curling iron dont mix this product with heat..if you desire a Donna Summers look this is perfect..\nBetter than a perm any day..\nVenezia Soapworks Moisturizing Soap Rose - 7oz\nVenezia\n{'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Brand': 'Venezia', 'Scent': 'Rose', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.7 x 2.8 x 1.7 inches; 0.81 Ounces', 'UPC': '796433748755 895697010100 787461525142'}\nThis bar I purchased because I wanted to collect a rose scented bar from this company. When I'm in a mood for &#34;florals&#34; I scan amazon for certain scents of soaps. The reviews were reasonable regarding this brand. Only time will tell will I repeat my purchase.\nA little piece of italy...I think?\nAsquith & Somerset ROSE GARDEN 10.5 Oz Perfumed Bath Soap, Gift Wrapped, imported from England\nAsquith & Somerset\n{'Brand': 'Asquith & Somerset', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Item Package Quantity': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '4.8 x 3.7 x 1.4 inches; 8.8 Ounces', 'UPC': '784179663692'}\nI have used Asquith & Somerset bath products since 2010.
