I like this product but I must warn African females (black) this product does leave a residue..so if you use this lotion daily..always brush your hair out. From the scalp to the ends...it reminds me of the &#34;jerri curl&#34; products from the 1980's. Over all my hair did not dry out and it stayed moisturized for atleast 2-3 before re-applying. If you use a pressing comb or hot curling iron dont mix this product with heat..if you desire a Donna Summers look this is perfect..\nBetter than a perm any day..\nVenezia Soapworks Moisturizing Soap Rose - 7oz\nVenezia\n{'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Brand': 'Venezia', 'Scent': 'Rose', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.7 x 2.8 x 1.7 inches; 0.81 Ounces', 'UPC': '796433748755 895697010100 787461525142'}\nThis bar I purchased because I wanted to collect a rose scented bar from this company.

Handmade in Sussex, England, these bars are triple-milled to produce a completely uniform, long-lasting soap. Imbued with carefully chosen Michel Design Works fragrances, every bath will be a luxurious one. Michel Design Works was created by Bruce & Deborah Michel in the early 1980s. The first product was an elaborate \u201cmemory book\u201d called Our Country Diary. Still a favorite today, it is filled with vintage artwork, quirky quotes, notable dates and plenty of room to record all the events of the year. Our Country Diary will become a beautiful record of your family life. When they first created their signature elephant logo, it signified a remembrance of all things special. Although Michel Design Works has greatly expanded into bath & body, home fragrance and decor, when Bruce & Deborah remember and celebrate all of their wonderful customers and the company\u2019s history, it is even more fitting today! Whether you are a new or a long-time friend, we welcome you to enjoy the art, lather up with our English soaps, set an elegant table with napkins, candles, plates, and serveware, and end your day with wonderfully fragrant n bubble bath.']\n{'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'Michel Design Works', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '6 x 3 x 2 inches; 6.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'SOAL227', 'UPC': '608666691299', 'Manufacturer': 'Michel Design Works'}\nI purchased the Hummingbird scent and I currently own three scents from Michel..

First of all these soap sets were on my Wish-list for sometime. They arrived today and just like they are pictured...The big bar is truly huge..!
