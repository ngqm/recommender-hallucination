I have only used once because I only remove my nails once a month or longer if I can, but it was much.  Better than soaking or using foil or gloves. Both hands took me about 3 hours so I purchased a 2nd one so I could do each hand at the same time and I think I got the hang of getting the Acrylic off better towards the end so I hope to cut the time down to less than a hour next time.<br /><br />It also came quickly\nReview Title: Better than soaking\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
