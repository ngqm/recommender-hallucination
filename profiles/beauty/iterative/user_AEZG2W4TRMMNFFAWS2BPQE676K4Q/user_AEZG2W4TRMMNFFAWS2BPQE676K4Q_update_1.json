The pack includes 6 tropical flavors and 1 Mango. I feel silly thinking about how I\u2019m pretty sure I have never used lip balm with sunscreen in it before.<br /><br />These smell great, are very moisturizing, and glide on nicely. There is no bad taste at all, though I couldn\u2019t particularly taste a flavor. I think it is a great formula- no complaints.<br /><br />The chap sticks are standard size with the usual twist up and cap. They are a little pricey, but you are getting what seems to be a high quality product. I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so, I would love to know-thanks!\nReview Title: Wonderful Smell- Super Moisturizing\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
