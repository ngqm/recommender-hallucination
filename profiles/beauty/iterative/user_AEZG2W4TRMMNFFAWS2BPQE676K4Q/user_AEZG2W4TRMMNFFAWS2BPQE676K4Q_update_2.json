Overall, they are very cute and seem pretty well made.<br /><br />You get a small peacock hair clip, a large peacock hair clip, a thin headband, and then another large peacock piece that you insert the headband into.<br /><br />My opinion is that the smallest hair clip is the most seriously wearable. It is actually very cute especially with the long thinner wispy feathers coming off it. The larger ones are fun, but a bit much in my opinion. Another thing I don\u2019t like about the larger ones is that they are very thick and stiff with the added black backing. I would have preferred the black backing to not be as large and for the entire piece to look more flexible and airy. That is just my opinion though. My daughter likes these just the same.<br /><br />They aren\u2019t absolutely perfect. There are a few areas mostly near the little gems where you can see some excess glue- not extremely noticeable.<br /><br />Anyway, if you like the way these look and are okay with the large ones being stiff, then I would recommend these. They aren\u2019t the best quality out there, but they are good.<br /><br />I\u2019ll be sure to update this review if any issues arise with regular use. I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so, I would love to know- thanks!\nReview Title: Cute, Fun Pieces, Pretty Good Quality\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Panama Jack Sunscreen Lip Balm - SPF 45, Tropical & Mango 6 Pack Plus, Broad Spectrum UVA-UVB Sunscreen Protection, Prevents & Soothes Dry, Chapped Lips\nPanama Jack\n{'Scent': 'Mango', 'Product Benefits': 'Soothing', 'Item Weight': '4.25 Grams', 'Number of Items': '6', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '5.08 x 4.72 x 1.34 inches; 0.15 Ounces'}\nThis Panama Jack Sunscreen Lip Balm - SPF 45 is a good product. The pack includes 6 tropical flavors and 1 Mango. I feel silly thinking about how I\u2019m pretty sure I have never used lip balm with sunscreen in it before.<br /><br />These smell great, are very moisturizing, and glide on nicely. There is no bad taste at all, though I couldn\u2019t particularly taste a flavor. I think it is a great formula- no complaints.<br /><br />The chap sticks are standard size with the usual twist up and cap. They are a little pricey, but you are getting what seems to be a high quality product. I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so, I would love to know-thanks!\nWonderful Smell- Super Moisturizing\nWIOR Peacock Headband for Women, Fashion Peacock Hair Clip, 3 Pcs Peacock Feathers Hair Clip Peacock Flapper Headband with Pearls & Diamonds Hair Accessory for Girls Ladies Wedding Party Festival Prom\nWIOR\n{'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material': 'Pearl', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Party,Wedding', 'Brand': 'WIOR', 'Size': 'Free Size', 'Package Dimensions': '7 x 5 x 0.3 inches; 0.63 Ounces'}\nI ordered these WIOR peacock hair pieces for my 5 year old who loves hair accessories.
