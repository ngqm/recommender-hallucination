You get a pack of 6 small shield shaped soaps in a resealable plastic bag. The soaps are about 2.75 inches in length.<br /><br />The scent is strong when you open the bag and especially in the shower. Some of the oils and ingredients included are cloves, cinnamon, oregano, peppermint, parsley, eucalyptus, and rosemary. If you don\u2019t like the smell of cloves, then do not order this because that is the most predominant smell in my opinion. I like it though- it has a nice spicy kick.<br /><br />The soap definitely feels different than I expected. It doesn\u2019t feel really smooth like many soaps. When dry, they were slightly powdery when I ran my finger across. They are slightly gritty feeling which I noticed more once the soap became wet in the shower. This could be nice if you like a slight scrubby feeling. I typically rub it onto my mesh bath sponge or silicone sponge so I don\u2019t really care about the grittiness either way. I found that it lathers and suds up very well with both my mesh and silicone sponges.<br /><br />I just started using, so I\u2019m not sure how many showers I\u2019ll be able to get out of each bar. Honestly, I thought they might disintegrate and get used up fast simply based on how powdery they felt when dry. I don\u2019t think it will last as long as some other soaps, but I was still surprised that I could somewhat see the outline of where the shallow cross was imprinted on the soap even after my first shower-and I did intentionally scrub my sponges all over that side pretty vigorously. I took a picture of what the soap looked like after one shower compared to unused bars.<br /><br />Anyway, my skin feels very clean, perhaps even a little moisturized after using and I haven\u2019t experienced any irritation to my sensitive skin (I have eczema).<br /><br />I like that this soap is natural and free from harmful chemicals. I also love that it is made in the USA-Ohio specifically, which is where I am from.<br /><br />I\u2019ll be sure to update my review if any issues arise like if I find that the bars do in fact get used far too quickly. I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so, I would love to know- thanks!!!\nReview Title: Interesting Gritty Texture And Strong Clove Scent\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Panama Jack Sunscreen Lip Balm - SPF 45, Tropical & Mango 6 Pack Plus, Broad Spectrum UVA-UVB Sunscreen Protection, Prevents & Soothes Dry, Chapped Lips\nPanama Jack\n{'Scent': 'Mango', 'Product Benefits': 'Soothing', 'Item Weight': '4.25 Grams', 'Number of Items': '6', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '5.08 x 4.72 x 1.34 inches; 0.15 Ounces'}\nThis Panama Jack Sunscreen Lip Balm - SPF 45 is a good product. The pack includes 6 tropical flavors and 1 Mango. I feel silly thinking about how I\u2019m pretty sure I have never used lip balm with sunscreen in it before.<br /><br />These smell great, are very moisturizing, and glide on nicely. There is no bad taste at all, though I couldn\u2019t particularly taste a flavor. I think it is a great formula- no complaints.<br /><br />The chap sticks are standard size with the usual twist up and cap. They are a little pricey, but you are getting what seems to be a high quality product. I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so, I would love to know-thanks!\nWonderful Smell- Super Moisturizing\nWIOR Peacock Headband for Women, Fashion Peacock Hair Clip, 3 Pcs Peacock Feathers Hair Clip Peacock Flapper Headband with Pearls & Diamonds Hair Accessory for Girls Ladies Wedding Party Festival Prom\nWIOR\n{'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material': 'Pearl', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Party,Wedding', 'Brand': 'WIOR', 'Size': 'Free Size', 'Package Dimensions': '7 x 5 x 0.3 inches; 0.63 Ounces'}\nI ordered these WIOR peacock hair pieces for my 5 year old who loves hair accessories. Overall, they are very cute and seem pretty well made.<br /><br />You get a small peacock hair clip, a large peacock hair clip, a thin headband, and then another large peacock piece that you insert the headband into.<br /><br />My opinion is that the smallest hair clip is the most seriously wearable. It is actually very cute especially with the long thinner wispy feathers coming off it. The larger ones are fun, but a bit much in my opinion. Another thing I don\u2019t like about the larger ones is that they are very thick and stiff with the added black backing. I would have preferred the black backing to not be as large and for the entire piece to look more flexible and airy. That is just my opinion though. My daughter likes these just the same.<br /><br />They aren\u2019t absolutely perfect. There are a few areas mostly near the little gems where you can see some excess glue- not extremely noticeable.<br /><br />Anyway, if you like the way these look and are okay with the large ones being stiff, then I would recommend these. They aren\u2019t the best quality out there, but they are good.<br /><br />I\u2019ll be sure to update this review if any issues arise with regular use. I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so, I would love to know- thanks!\nCute, Fun Pieces, Pretty Good Quality\nBodyguard Moisturizing Immunity Soap 6pk | 7 Essential Oils Clinically Evaluated to Boost Immunity and Protect | Moisturizes with Sweet Almond Oil | Healthy PH for Skin Microbiome\nSpa-Da\n{'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Brand': 'Spa-Da', 'Scent': 'Cinnamon', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '8 x 3.3 x 2 inches; 7.2 Ounces', 'UPC': '860003618998'}\nThis Spa-Da Immunity Support Soap is one of the more interesting soaps I have tried.
