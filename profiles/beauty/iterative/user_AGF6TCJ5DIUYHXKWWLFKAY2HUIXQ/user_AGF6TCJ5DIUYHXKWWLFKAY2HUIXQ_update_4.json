It fits my adult head and my 2 year old\u2019s head well. It is extremely comfortable to wear and doesn\u2019t  dig into the sides of your head. The headband is covered in satin so it\u2019s soft. It can fall down pretty easily because there are no combs to hold it in place but I\u2019ll take that inconvenience for the comfort!  It is decently made, not real high quality, but for the price it\u2019s fair. Much cheaper than buying ones inside parks!  I definitely recommend this!\nReview Title: Very cute and comfortable\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Fits great!<br /><br />UPDATE - my daughter wore these to Disney World and we received SO many compliments on them.  I actually prefer these for her age over the overpriced options at the park.\nPerfect for Disney trip!\nN3 No Name Necessary Pore-Minimizing Mattifying Oil and Shine Control Anti-aging Makeup Face Primer Spray (200ml)\nNo Name Necessary\n{'Brand': 'No Name Necessary', 'Skin Type': 'Combination', 'Package Information': 'Bottle', 'Finish Type': 'Matte', 'Specialty': 'Mattifying', 'Product Dimensions': '1.7 x 1.7 x 7.5 inches; 8.78 Ounces'}\nI am typically low maintenance with make up but wanted to try this product as I live in the sweltering heat of south Florida year round. First thing I noticed is this is a very nice sized bottle, almost as big as a standard can of hairspray.  I have been using this product for a week now and have definitely noticed a difference. My pores are less noticeable and my makeup lasts much longer than without the product. My face looks and feels smooth all day.  It\u2019s so easy to use too!  All you have to do is shake it up and spray your face several times before applying makeup.  I haven\u2019t noticed a scent to it and barely notice the product at all when I spray it on.  Now I just wish I had a travel size to take with me on upcoming trips!  I definitely recommend giving this a try!\nGreat product, face stays looking fresh all day\n3D Mask Bracket - Internal Support Holder Frame Nose Breathing Smoothly- Lipstick Protection Cool Mask Bracket - DIY Face Mask Accessories - 5Pcs (L-Adult)\nVedory\n['\u2764-Outfits Set Include: 1 pack of 5 3D mask bracket (not including mask or cloth, etc.). \u2764-Size: about 10*9*4.2cm / 3.9*3.51*1.64 inches, enough space for various masks. \u2764-Unique design: designed to fit the face of the nose bridge, breathing more smoothly, breathable and not stuffy. \u2764-Ideal Saver for Makeup - It makes the mask not to stick lipstick, protecting your perfect makeup from being messed up.If you wear glasses, 3D Inner Bracket can also prevent the lens from fogging because of more breathing space. \u2764 3D Inner Bracket also suitable for various ma-sks.Using double sided tape or thread to fasten the silicone frame onto the mask can make it work better.']\n{'Package Dimensions': '6.3 x 4.72 x 2.36 inches; 1.41 Ounces', 'UPC': '800914455053', 'Manufacturer': 'Vedory'}\nI work in a school that currently requires everyone to wear masks when on property. These mask brackets have really helped me feel more comfortable to wear a mask all day. I also find it much easier to speak and be heard with this bracket.<br /><br />These are the second set of brackets I have tried and I feel like these fit my face much better than other ones.  It took some getting used to as it doesn\u2019t clip into my non pleated masks and sometimes moves around, but I am definitely liking using these better than nothing.  I have shared extras with coworkers and they have all found them to be helpful.  I would recommend.\nHelps when wearing mask all day\nChristmas Headbands for Women,Glitter headbands Sequence Red and Green,Holiday Costume Headwear Handmade Mouse Ears Hairband Hair Decorations for Girl Party Cosplay Favor Accessories\nYanJie\n{'Age Range (Description)': 'Child', 'Occasion': 'Christmas, Party, Birthday, Thanksgiving', 'Material': 'Cotton Blend', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Brand': 'YanJie', 'Package Dimensions': '10.12 x 7.6 x 1.22 inches; 1.13 Ounces', 'UPC': '751300682099'}\nThis headband is so cute!
