  "reference_summary": "Higher Education Skincare: Goal Digger - Silky Moisturizing Cucumber Creme; formulated for dry and sensitive skin; cucumber extract; natural extract: melon, kale, cabbage, ginger, turmeric - 1.7 fl oz\nHigher Education\n{'Brand': 'Higher Education', 'Scent': 'Cucumber', 'Item Form': 'Creme', 'Unit Count': '1.7 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2.88 x 2.88 x 2.13 inches; 7.2 Ounces', 'UPC': '811381032050'}\nNice green color with a refreshing cucumber scent. This feels light, not greasy and yet is very effective at moisturizing skin. It's quickly absorbed by my skin. I like that it doesn't have any AHA or retinol so that I can use this day or night in combination with different serums.\nlight but very effective\nGrinding Away Skin Polishing Scrub, 3 fl. oz., Polishing Scrub Works to Improve Skin's Texture and Tone by Buffing Away Dead Skin Cells by Higher Education Skincare\nHigher Education\n{'Brand': 'Higher Education', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Product Benefits': 'Smoother', 'Material Feature': 'Gluten Free, Cruelty Free', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.59 x 3.58 x 1.61 inches; 3 Ounces', 'UPC': '811381031008'}\nI like that the particles are much finer than those in other facial scrubs. Other facial scrubs I've tried have coarser particles, so coarse it feels like I'm rubbing sand on my face.<br /><br />What I don't like is that the product I received will expire in less than 3 months - Oct 2020. This doesn't seem to be just a one-time occurrence. I also purchased the  \"Higher Education MBA Night Renewing Serum with 0.5% retinol\". That one expires even sooner - on Sep 2020.<br /><br />I don't know what Amazon's policy is on expiration dates for skin care products. But, if I were purchasing this from a physical store, I wouldn't get something that expires in less than 3 months. I expect a product to be good for at least a year. Granted, expired doesn't automatically mean that a product is unusable. However, customers don't like getting old stock especially when a customer still has to pay full price for it. I didn't it but, if I were, I'd be annoyed enough to return the item.<br /><br />I also don't know if Higher Education regularly sends soon-to-expire items to Amazon or if they're just doing this to Vine purchases. Either way, that's really not good practice. For a facial scrub that costs $25, I don't expect the seller to pass off expiring products on me.<br />UPDATE - After going through reviews of the two Higher Education products, it appears that they regularly send soon-to-expire products to customers. Bad seller - Higher Education. Really really bad.<br /><br />One star for sending me an old product. Amazon, stop selling old products! Customers who paid full price for this - you should return the product.\nexpires in less than 3 months\nMBA Renewing Retinol Serum, 1.7 fl. oz, 0.5% Retinol Hydrates & Brightens Skin's Appearance by Diminishing the Look of Breakouts, Hyperpigmentation, and Signs of Aging by Higher Education Skincare\nHigher Education\n{'Skin Type': 'All', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'Higher Education', 'Item Form': 'Serum', 'Unit Count': '1.7 Fl Oz', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.5 x 3.4 x 1.5 inches; 3.99 Ounces', 'UPC': '811381034009'}\nReceived July 23, 2020.<br /><br />I use this 2x a week in the evenings after applying hyaluronic serum. I've experienced no allergic reaction. I chose this because the retinol concentration (0.5%) isn't too high.<br /><br />This is the second Higher Education skin care product I've purchased that has a very short expiration period - expires in less than 2 months (Sep 2020). The first was the \"Grinding Away skin polishing scrub\" that expires in less than 3 months (Oct 2020).<br /><br />I'm really annoyed that Higher Education is stocking Amazon with old products. If I were paying full price for this, I would expect to receive \"fresh\" products - with at least a year before expiration. If I were purchasing this from a physical store, I'd give this back to the counter lady and just look for something else.<br /><br />One star for sending me an old product. Amazon, stop selling old products!

It's 29\" long. One inch isn't much. Whether 29 or 30\", it's still too short for a tall guy with long arms. It also doesn't scrub that well. I have a 130-cm (51 inches) nylon exfoliating scrub from Daiso. That one really makes great contact with my back and can also be folded up tight to scrub the rest of my body (arms, neck, etc.). Folding up this Lnlofen scrubber ends up making it to thick and awkward to scrub my neck, arms, etc.\nToo short, doesn't effectively scrub back, awkward to scrub other parts of body\nzelaxy Mask Strap Extenders, Soft Silicone Mask Holders for Relieve Ear Pain Caused by Mask (Eagle)\nzelaxy\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.3 x 2.5 x 0.4 inches; 1.59 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'zelaxy'}\nzelaxy Mask Strap Extenders<br /><br />I find these extenders are necessary when wearing medical masks because the ear loops are often too long for me. I had to use the slots closest to the middle to ensure masks fit snugly and don't fall down. I could just tie another loop to make the loops shorter but I prefer using these extenders because they hold the loops better. My ears are small. Loops tend to just get pulled out from behind my ears.\nGood hold on mask ear loops\nBaby Safety Cotton Swabs for Infant Baby Kid Ear Nose Clean White Cotton Double Tipped Natural Paper Sticks Spiral Head Multipurpose Cotton Buds Cleaning Sticks (M552)\nmeilamei\n{'Product Dimensions': '3.31 x 3.31 x 3.27 inches; 0.63 Ounces'}\nMeilamei cotton buds 300 ct<br /><br />Good.
