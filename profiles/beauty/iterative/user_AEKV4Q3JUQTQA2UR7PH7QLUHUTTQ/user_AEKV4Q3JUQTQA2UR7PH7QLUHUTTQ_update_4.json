I also liked that it is supposed to be 2000 watts.  I really didn't feel like this blow dryer worked as well as my cheap Revlon blow dryer that's 1800 watts.  This blow dryer doesn't seem to get as hot either.  It looks nice and it is light and smaller, so that is good.  But overall, I didn't really care for this one.  The buttons are clunky and hard to switch...might get looser over time, but  right now it's just not easy to switch to different settings.  There are just more cons than pros with this hair dryer.\nReview Title: It's just okay...\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "DERMAL 10 Combo Pack Premium Collagen Essence Full Face Facial Mask Sheet - The Ultimate Supreme Collection for Every Skin Condition Day to Day Skin Concerns - Silky Cellulose Mask Sheet\nDERMAL\n{'Brand': 'DERMAL', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Scent': 'Rose', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Unit Count': '10 Count', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.26 x 5 x 1.34 inches; 11.2 Ounces', 'UPC': '703856882157'}\nI like these masks for daily use, as they are somewhat moisturizing and no real fragrance that I can detect.  I like the variety of the pack and they are easy on my skin.  I did take off one star as they are not as moisturizing as a jelly type mask..these are more water-like...but they are nice in that they are collagen masks.  For the price they are nice.\nNice Daily Mask\nLAPCOS Good Morning Fresh Quick Masks (30 Count) Daily Sheet Masks for Beauty & Skin Care - Hydrating and Moisturizing Korean Face Mask with Witch Hazel, Aloe Vera & Cucumber\nLAPCOS\n{'Brand': 'LAPCOS', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Moisturizing', 'Scent': 'Cucumber', 'Skin Type': 'Normal', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5 x 4 x 3 inches; 1 Pounds', 'UPC': '818929024478'}\nI really like this product...from the packaging to the actual mask.  It's really good..the mask moisturizes really well and after just 10 minutes, it feels similar to a serum on my face after I take it off.  Stays moisturized.  And the packaging is awesome....love the little container they are stored in, and I like the tweezers that are included to take the mask out without contaminating with fingers and trying to pull out a single mask.  It's very well done all the way around.\nQuick Moisture!\n[miclan] Honey Nutrient Enriched Mask 10pcs - Mediheal Family Brand Facial Sheet Mask Full of Hydraiting Nutrients Skin with Honey and Propolis\nmiclan\n{'Brand': 'Miclan', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Product Benefits': 'Moisturizing', 'Scent': 'Honey', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Package Dimensions': '8.15 x 4.21 x 1.5 inches; 11.99 Ounces'}\nThis is one of the good kind of masks...you know, the ones that feel sort of jelly like and thick.  It's not watery, but very moisturizing.  I don't recall it having a fragrance to it...frankly most of them don't have much fragrance.  This one is very nice.  It has the paper peel off backing which is extra too.  I would re-order these masks!\nVery moisturizing...\nIonic Hair Dryers for Women 1800W Blow Dryer with Diffuser Hot and Cool Settings Speed Adjustable Negative Ion Hair Dryer with 2 Concentrators,1 Hair Scalp Massager Brush for Curly Hair(LTD Edition)\nLassie\n{'Brand': 'Lassie', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Number of Speeds': '2', 'Product Dimensions': '11.4 x 9.4 x 3.7 inches; 2.43 Pounds', 'Manufacturer': 'Lassie'}\nI had high hopes for this blow dryer...as I like the style of it and the colors.
