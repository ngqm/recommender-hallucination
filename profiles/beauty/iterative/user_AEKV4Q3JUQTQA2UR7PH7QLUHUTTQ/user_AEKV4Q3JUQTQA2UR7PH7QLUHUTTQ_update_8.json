I think it is great.  Holds well and looks nice with the velour type fabric.  The only thing is this size might not work well for someone with really thick hair?  Not sure, but my hair is pretty fine and this only wrapped around it 3 times.  So for someone with thick hair it might not work?  This scrunchie really holds well...I wear it all day and overnight and it doesn't budge and feels very comfortable,  not too tight.\nReview Title: Nice combo!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "DERMAL 10 Combo Pack Premium Collagen Essence Full Face Facial Mask Sheet - The Ultimate Supreme Collection for Every Skin Condition Day to Day Skin Concerns - Silky Cellulose Mask Sheet\nDERMAL\n{'Brand': 'DERMAL', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Scent': 'Rose', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Unit Count': '10 Count', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.26 x 5 x 1.34 inches; 11.2 Ounces', 'UPC': '703856882157'}\nI like these masks for daily use, as they are somewhat moisturizing and no real fragrance that I can detect.  I like the variety of the pack and they are easy on my skin.  I did take off one star as they are not as moisturizing as a jelly type mask..these are more water-like...but they are nice in that they are collagen masks.  For the price they are nice.\nNice Daily Mask\nLAPCOS Good Morning Fresh Quick Masks (30 Count) Daily Sheet Masks for Beauty & Skin Care - Hydrating and Moisturizing Korean Face Mask with Witch Hazel, Aloe Vera & Cucumber\nLAPCOS\n{'Brand': 'LAPCOS', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Moisturizing', 'Scent': 'Cucumber', 'Skin Type': 'Normal', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5 x 4 x 3 inches; 1 Pounds', 'UPC': '818929024478'}\nI really like this product...from the packaging to the actual mask.  It's really good..the mask moisturizes really well and after just 10 minutes, it feels similar to a serum on my face after I take it off.  Stays moisturized.  And the packaging is awesome....love the little container they are stored in, and I like the tweezers that are included to take the mask out without contaminating with fingers and trying to pull out a single mask.  It's very well done all the way around.\nQuick Moisture!\n[miclan] Honey Nutrient Enriched Mask 10pcs - Mediheal Family Brand Facial Sheet Mask Full of Hydraiting Nutrients Skin with Honey and Propolis\nmiclan\n{'Brand': 'Miclan', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Product Benefits': 'Moisturizing', 'Scent': 'Honey', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Package Dimensions': '8.15 x 4.21 x 1.5 inches; 11.99 Ounces'}\nThis is one of the good kind of masks...you know, the ones that feel sort of jelly like and thick.  It's not watery, but very moisturizing.  I don't recall it having a fragrance to it...frankly most of them don't have much fragrance.  This one is very nice.  It has the paper peel off backing which is extra too.  I would re-order these masks!\nVery moisturizing...\nIonic Hair Dryers for Women 1800W Blow Dryer with Diffuser Hot and Cool Settings Speed Adjustable Negative Ion Hair Dryer with 2 Concentrators,1 Hair Scalp Massager Brush for Curly Hair(LTD Edition)\nLassie\n{'Brand': 'Lassie', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Number of Speeds': '2', 'Product Dimensions': '11.4 x 9.4 x 3.7 inches; 2.43 Pounds', 'Manufacturer': 'Lassie'}\nI had high hopes for this blow dryer...as I like the style of it and the colors.  I also liked that it is supposed to be 2000 watts.  I really didn't feel like this blow dryer worked as well as my cheap Revlon blow dryer that's 1800 watts.  This blow dryer doesn't seem to get as hot either.  It looks nice and it is light and smaller, so that is good.  But overall, I didn't really care for this one.  The buttons are clunky and hard to switch...might get looser over time, but  right now it's just not easy to switch to different settings.  There are just more cons than pros with this hair dryer.\nIt's just okay...\n[Abib] Creme coating mask Tone-up solution 17g (5pcs)\nAbib\n{'Brand': 'Abib', 'Scent': 'Unscented', 'Number of Items': '5', 'Package Dimensions': '8.7 x 6.2 x 0.8 inches; 8.01 Ounces'}\nI was not crazy about the design of the actual mask.  It comes with a top portion and a bottom portion...which didn't stay in place on my face very well...and was just too much packaging for a face mask.  This is also different in that it is an actual cream, rather than the clear gel type or watery type mask.  I did like the cream ok, but I use these masks when I am bathing, and the 2 part design just does not stay in place properly and drove me crazy.\nThis is a 2 part mask\nShakira Perfumes - Dance for Women - Long Lasting - Femenine, Charming and Modern Perfume - Fruity Floral Notes - Ideal for Day Wear - 1.7 Fl Oz\nShakira\n{'Brand': 'Shakira', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Item Volume': '50 Milliliters', 'Scent': 'Dance', 'Special Feature': 'Long Lasting', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Language': 'English', 'Product Dimensions': '2.64 x 2.05 x 5.63 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'Item model number': '8411061823033'}\n***Edited to add that this kept reminding me of something else I'd worn and now I'm thinking it is very similar to BBW Into the Night.***.  I was very pleasantly surprised by this scent....I like dark orientals and even though this is listed as floral gourmand, it fits the bill as a dark oriental for me.  I definitely get the base notes of vanilla, cocoa, tonka and benzoin....it is very reminiscent of a scent I used to wear a long time ago, but can't quite place it?  Maybe Euphoria?  Not sure, but this is a really nice rich dark scent that is heavier on the gourmand side than floral.  This is for sure a date night scent.\nA Rich Gourmand\nBath Bombs, SAZEN Bath Bomb with Natural & Organic Essential Oils, Shea Coconut Butter for Skin Moisturize, Bubble Spa Bath, Birthday Mothers Day Christmas Handmade Gift Set for Women Kids Her Him\nSAZEN\n{'Brand': 'SAZEN', 'Scent': 'Coconut', 'Material Feature': 'Organic Ingredients', 'Unit Count': '24.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '24', 'Package Dimensions': '12.17 x 6.26 x 2.24 inches; 2.65 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'SAZEN 01', 'UPC': '745103723622', 'Manufacturer': 'SAZEN'}\nThese are a good set of bath bombs....that do add oils and scent to my bath.  I like the selection of scents in this set and the fizz is pretty good.  I did take off one star due to size as these are on the small to medium in size and I have a very large tub, so I need to use 2 of these to get enough moisturizing product in my tub.\nNice set of bath bombs\ninvisibobble Sprunchie Spiral Hair Ring - True Black - Scrunchie Stylish Bracelet, Strong Elastic Grip Coil Accessories for Women - Gentle for Girls Teens and Thick Hair\ninvisibobble\n{'Item Form': 'Scrunchie', 'Brand': 'invisibobble', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Item Weight': '2 Grams', 'Number of Pieces': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '2.83 x 2.8 x 0.87 inches; 0.07 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'IB-SP-HP10001'}\nI didn't even know that Invisibobble made this combo hair scrunchie with the coil inside.
