I didn\u2019t use the whole stencil because most of them would create a pretty large brown but I use them to create the shape and make them both uniform. You pick a stencil then do one side then flip the stencil to do the other stencil.<br /><br />Works pretty well but you will probably need to do some of your creativity to make them look more natural.<br /><br />Over all these are pretty helpful especially when you have the need to draw on brows daily, it speeds of the process and makes sure your aren\u2019t leaving the house with 2 totally different brows.\ud83e\udd28\nHelp create uniform left and right side brows\nDry Weightless Hair Volume and Texture Spray | Dry Texture Spray for Hair | Texturizing Spray | Sulfate and Cruelty Free 244ml (7oz)\nOsensia\n{'Hair Type': 'All, Dry, Fine', 'Liquid Volume': '7 Fluid Ounces', 'Brand': 'Osensia', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Unit Count': '7.0 Fl Oz', 'Package Dimensions': '8.03 x 1.93 x 1.89 inches; 8.78 Ounces', 'UPC': '850001832274'}\nPerfect spray for a non wash day or even a wash day.<br /><br />Spells really nice.<br /><br />Gives my fine hair texture and fullness.<br /><br />So good for people with oily hair.<br /><br />I do not have oily, hair but I do have limp<br />Hair and I really like this spray it makes my clean hair seem like a second day hair.<br /><br />Great product\nLive love this texture soray\nmold remover gel (3 Pack)\nYondarli\n{'Brand': 'Yondarli', 'Number of Items': '3', 'Unit Count': '1.0 Fl Oz', 'Package Dimensions': '5.94 x 2.76 x 1.77 inches; 7.13 Ounces'}\nI had high hopes for this but I did use it for my washer because I already bought a new one.<br /><br />I used this for both the grout in my bathroom and the moldy silicone around my bathroom tub faucet, I did not have great results on either, I tried several applications and same results.<br /><br />I can\u2019t say this would not work on your washer seal since I was not able to try it out on there.\nI used this t for grout and mold on silicone seal.\nUltimate Essentials Kit\n{'Brand': 'Olaplex', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Hair Type': 'Damaged', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Benefits': 'Repairs, Strengthens & Protects hair.
