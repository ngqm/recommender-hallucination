I didn\u2019t use the whole stencil because most of them would create a pretty large brown but I use them to create the shape and make them both uniform. You pick a stencil then do one side then flip the stencil to do the other stencil.<br /><br />Works pretty well but you will probably need to do some of your creativity to make them look more natural.<br /><br />Over all these are pretty helpful especially when you have the need to draw on brows daily, it speeds of the process and makes sure your aren\u2019t leaving the house with 2 totally different brows.\ud83e\udd28\nReview Title: Help create uniform left and right side brows\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
