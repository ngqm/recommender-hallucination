I didn\u2019t use the whole stencil because most of them would create a pretty large brown but I use them to create the shape and make them both uniform. You pick a stencil then do one side then flip the stencil to do the other stencil.<br /><br />Works pretty well but you will probably need to do some of your creativity to make them look more natural.<br /><br />Over all these are pretty helpful especially when you have the need to draw on brows daily, it speeds of the process and makes sure your aren\u2019t leaving the house with 2 totally different brows.\ud83e\udd28\nHelp create uniform left and right side brows\nDry Weightless Hair Volume and Texture Spray | Dry Texture Spray for Hair | Texturizing Spray | Sulfate and Cruelty Free 244ml (7oz)\nOsensia\n{'Hair Type': 'All, Dry, Fine', 'Liquid Volume': '7 Fluid Ounces', 'Brand': 'Osensia', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Unit Count': '7.0 Fl Oz', 'Package Dimensions': '8.03 x 1.93 x 1.89 inches; 8.78 Ounces', 'UPC': '850001832274'}\nPerfect spray for a non wash day or even a wash day.<br /><br />Spells really nice.<br /><br />Gives my fine hair texture and fullness.<br /><br />So good for people with oily hair.<br /><br />I do not have oily, hair but I do have limp<br />Hair and I really like this spray it makes my clean hair seem like a second day hair.<br /><br />Great product\nLive love this texture soray",
