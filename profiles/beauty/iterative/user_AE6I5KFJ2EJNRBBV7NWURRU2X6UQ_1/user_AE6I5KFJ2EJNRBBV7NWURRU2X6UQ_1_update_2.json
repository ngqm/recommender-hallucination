She says the eyelashes were easy to attach on her own eyelashes by following simple steps.<br />After applying them the lashes on, she says she likes how the false eyelashes blend well with her own natural eyelashes; giving them a more full look. She likes that they were made of good quality synthetic fibers, and they appear to be durable. She says she likes that they are lightweight, soft, and smooth. My wife likes that she can reuse them and she has reused them 6 times in the last 2+ weeks, and so far, so good.<br />For the quality, quantity and price, they are great value for money. I would recommend them.\nReview Title: Great quality and value for money\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
