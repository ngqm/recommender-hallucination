My wife says that she says she does like them a lot because they are different from the crochet hair extensions that she usually gets and she likes how lightweight, abundant and flowy they feel on her head. She likes how they have a very natural and fluffy look and how easy they are to fic with no harm or damage to her skin. My wife does like the hair pattern and she says that they are nice and smooth. She says that they didn't even look frizzy or damaged when the hair was taken out of the packets. She says her favorite thing about these hair's is how easy they are to wash and how breathable it feels which makes it nice for when it\u2019s hot in our neck of the woods Summer weather.
