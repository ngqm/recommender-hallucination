I used the red polish on my toenails and so far they have lasted over 2 weeks without issues. However (at least with the red polish), the color goes on a bit transparent so you would definitely need 2 coats of color. Overall, it\u2019s highly recommended!<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to read my review and photos of this product.\u00a0\u00a0I hope it has been helpful in providing you with more information.\nReview Title: Affordable Selection of Gel Colors\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
