It's perfect for adding a little life back into my hair or revitalizing a hairstyle from the day before. I like that it doesn't just drench my hair in fluids.

There was no directions on how to use the product which is the reason for the 1 star it might have been more but I could not get over the fact that it did not come with instructions.  No instructions on the jar, no instructions in the mailing envelope at all.  How are you supposed to know who to apply, when to apply or how to take it off.  I did try and it didn't work but that could because I put it on wrong because again there was NO instructions included with this product.\nDid not work on my puff eyes\n4 Pairs False Eyelashes Reusable Face Eyelashes Fit for All Eyes Free Eyelash Tweezers, Natural Thick Hand-Made 3D Faux Mink Eyelashes for a Beautiful Makeup Look (Natural)\nesonstyle\n{'Brand': 'Esonstyle', 'Material': 'Faux Mink', 'Material Feature': 'Cruelty Free', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Mounting Type': 'Eyelash Glue', 'Package Dimensions': '6.2 x 3.7 x 0.5 inches; 0.63 Ounces'}\nThese were perfect for a night out.
