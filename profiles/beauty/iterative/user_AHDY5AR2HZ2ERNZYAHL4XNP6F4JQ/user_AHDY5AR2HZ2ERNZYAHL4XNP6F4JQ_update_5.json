It's perfect for adding a little life back into my hair or revitalizing a hairstyle from the day before. I like that it doesn't just drench my hair in fluids. It lightly coats it allowing me better control of how much water, or other liquid, I want on my hair.\nA great find\nEye Mask for Puffy Eyes,Under Eye Patches,Dark Circles Under Eye Treatment,Eye Masks& Puffy Eyes Treatment, Eye Mask for Dark Circles\uff0860 PCS)\nMourvibe\n{'Package Dimensions': '3 x 3 x 1.5 inches; 6.07 Ounces', 'UPC': '778365190505'}\nI'm not sure if how I applied it is what made it not work or if the product just doesn't work at all.  There was no directions on how to use the product which is the reason for the 1 star it might have been more but I could not get over the fact that it did not come with instructions.  No instructions on the jar, no instructions in the mailing envelope at all.  How are you supposed to know who to apply, when to apply or how to take it off.  I did try and it didn't work but that could because I put it on wrong because again there was NO instructions included with this product.\nDid not work on my puff eyes\n4 Pairs False Eyelashes Reusable Face Eyelashes Fit for All Eyes Free Eyelash Tweezers, Natural Thick Hand-Made 3D Faux Mink Eyelashes for a Beautiful Makeup Look (Natural)\nesonstyle\n{'Brand': 'Esonstyle', 'Material': 'Faux Mink', 'Material Feature': 'Cruelty Free', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Mounting Type': 'Eyelash Glue', 'Package Dimensions': '6.2 x 3.7 x 0.5 inches; 0.63 Ounces'}\nThese were perfect for a night out. Looked very natural and easy to put on. I like that so many come in there they all look similar. Very natural. They feel soft. Really made my eyes pop.

I didn't like the feel. When you touch them they feel like plastic. Can get better quality at the hair store. They look super fair. Very uncomfortable. Would not purchase.\nDo not recommend\nKellyRoom 5D Faux Mink Lashes Handmade Luxurious Dramatic Thick Fake Eyelashes,14 Pairs (2 Styles)\nKellyRoom\n{'Brand': 'KellyRoom', 'Material': 'Faux Mink', 'Material Feature': 'Cruelty Free', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Mounting Type': 'Eyelash Glue', 'Package Dimensions': '6.6 x 6.6 x 1.2 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'UPC': '824382149559'}\ndoesn't feel overly fake but def not real.
