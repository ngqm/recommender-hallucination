I love the color and length. The cap has 3 combs two in the front and one in the back. The wig does have come with a very tiny piece of lace that you will have to cut. The lace while dark in color when looking at it is very transparent. You do not get any parting space but the part you get (middle part) is a decent length.<br /><br />The wig is very manageable doesn\u2019t do too much shedding (it hasn\u2019t shed at all). The wig is synthetic so I wouldn\u2019t recommend adding direct heat to it. If you want to style it use steam. Once the lace is cut the wig is ready to wear.\nReview Title: She is cute\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Yawamica 15 Pairs 6D Mink Eyelashes Faux 20MM Lashes Fluffy Cat Eye Wispy False Eyelashes Thick Dramatic Fake Eyelashes Handmade Reusable Natural Look Eyelashes Pack Long Eye Lashes\nYawamica\n{'Brand': 'Yawamica', 'Material': 'Faux Mink', 'Material Feature': 'Cruelty Free', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Mounting Type': 'Eyelash Glue', 'Package Dimensions': '8.9 x 8.3 x 0.5 inches; 2.4 Ounces'}\nI ordered two different lashes from this company so this review might be duplicated.<br /><br />Both sets of lashes are so sexy and very easy to apply. They take glue very well and very easy to clean (I just pick the glue off them). These are definitely reusable which is honestly my favorite part about them.<br /><br />The lashes offer slightly different sizes within their packs so please look before you pick. My only complaint is that it\u2019s hard for me to tell which lash goes to with which lash because of the placement of the lashes. So this leads to me having to put a lash back after realizing it\u2019s not the right lash.<br /><br />Beside that the lashes are fantastic and I would recommend them.\nSo cute but confusing\nAISI QUEENS Curly Bob Wig Short Ombre Brown Wig for Black Women Kinky Hair Middle Part Heat Resistant Synthetic Hair Wig for Women 14inch\nAISI QUEENS\n{'Hair Type': 'Coily', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Brand': 'AISI QUEENS', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '12.71 x 8.9 x 2.72 inches; 9.14 Ounces'}\nThis such a beautiful soft wig.
