They take glue very well and very easy to clean (I just pick the glue off them). These are definitely reusable which is honestly my favorite part about them.<br /><br />The lashes offer slightly different sizes within their packs so please look before you pick. My only complaint is that it\u2019s hard for me to tell which lash goes to with which lash because of the placement of the lashes. So this leads to me having to put a lash back after realizing it\u2019s not the right lash.<br /><br />Beside that the lashes are fantastic and I would recommend them.\nReview Title: So cute but confusing\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
