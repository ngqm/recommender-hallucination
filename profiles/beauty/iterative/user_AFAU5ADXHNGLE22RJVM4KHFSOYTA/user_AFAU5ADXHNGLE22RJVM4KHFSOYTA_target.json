The ends get tangled easily but that\u2019s to be expected from bone straight hair. The hair is soft doesn\u2019t seem to shed, the cap is constructed well. The wig is ready to wear out of the packaging for some people for others you\u2019ll have to cut the bangs to to fit you. You can definitely tell the end tangles easily when touching it because they have that dense texture to them that\u2019ll always get your fingers or comb caught no matter how many times you brush or comb the ends.<br /><br />My advice would be to cut them if you know what you are doing if not pack a brush or comb with you.\nReview Title: Shiny\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Yawamica 15 Pairs 6D Mink Eyelashes Faux 20MM Lashes Fluffy Cat Eye Wispy False Eyelashes Thick Dramatic Fake Eyelashes Handmade Reusable Natural Look Eyelashes Pack Long Eye Lashes\nYawamica\n{'Brand': 'Yawamica', 'Material': 'Faux Mink', 'Material Feature': 'Cruelty Free', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Mounting Type': 'Eyelash Glue', 'Package Dimensions': '8.9 x 8.3 x 0.5 inches; 2.4 Ounces'}\nI ordered two different lashes from this company so this review might be duplicated.<br /><br />Both sets of lashes are so sexy and very easy to apply. They take glue very well and very easy to clean (I just pick the glue off them). These are definitely reusable which is honestly my favorite part about them.<br /><br />The lashes offer slightly different sizes within their packs so please look before you pick. My only complaint is that it\u2019s hard for me to tell which lash goes to with which lash because of the placement of the lashes. So this leads to me having to put a lash back after realizing it\u2019s not the right lash.<br /><br />Beside that the lashes are fantastic and I would recommend them.\nSo cute but confusing\nAISI QUEENS Curly Bob Wig Short Ombre Brown Wig for Black Women Kinky Hair Middle Part Heat Resistant Synthetic Hair Wig for Women 14inch\nAISI QUEENS\n{'Hair Type': 'Coily', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Brand': 'AISI QUEENS', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '12.71 x 8.9 x 2.72 inches; 9.14 Ounces'}\nThis such a beautiful soft wig. I love the color and length. The cap has 3 combs two in the front and one in the back. The wig does have come with a very tiny piece of lace that you will have to cut. The lace while dark in color when looking at it is very transparent. You do not get any parting space but the part you get (middle part) is a decent length.<br /><br />The wig is very manageable doesn\u2019t do too much shedding (it hasn\u2019t shed at all). The wig is synthetic so I wouldn\u2019t recommend adding direct heat to it. If you want to style it use steam. Once the lace is cut the wig is ready to wear.\nShe is cute\nMICPANG Electric Eyebrow Trimmer Precision Electric Eyebrow Razor for Women Battery-Operated Facial Hair Remover with Comb (Pink)\nMICPANG\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.28 x 2.64 x 0.94 inches; 1.13 Ounces'}\nThe product hardly works and it drains the battery you put in it so quickly. I haven\u2019t even used it for 15 minutes and the fresh battery I put in it is completely DRAINED!<br /><br />I\u2019m not a fan of this product so all I can say is buy it at your own risk.\nNO\nCOLORGRAM Artist Formula Auto Brow Pencil 0.25g- True Beauty K-Drama Makeup, Built-in-Spoolie, Clump-Free Formula, Softly Glides, Natural Look (02 Natural Brown)\nCOLORGRAM\n[\"Featuring a unique, triangular tip, Brow Definer's retractable pencil design is ideal for outlining and filling your brows in one fluid motion.

So my advice have your concealer on deck or do your eyebrows before you do any other part of your face because you\u2019ll be taken off whatever you put on with this<br />\u2022 You\u2019ll have to apply some pressure to get anything off dark enough<br />\u2022 The tip isn\u2019t as precise as what I\u2019m used to using which is why it\u2019ll cause you to mess up a bit.<br /><br />I like it but I\u2019m not in like with it. I don\u2019t really see myself reaching for this unless it\u2019s all I have on hand.\nIt\u2019s ok\nMAEPEOR Black Glossy Lipgloss Black Nourishing Plumping Lip Gloss Luscious-colors Non-Sticky Shine Glossy Lipgloss\nMAEPEOR\n{'Brand': 'MAEPEOR', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Finish Type': 'Glossy', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Softening,Smoothening,Shine,Cold,Nourishing,Moisturizing,Gentle,Makeup', 'Specialty': 'Natural', 'Product Dimensions': '1.18 x 0.39 x 0.39 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nPros<br />\u2022 Moisturizes your lips well<br />\u2022 Good coverage<br />\u2022 Matches photo colors perfectly<br />\u2022 Colors look good on lighter and darker skin tones<br />\u2022 Colors are versatile<br />\u2022 The Gloss is amazing<br /><br />Cons<br />\u2022 Lied about where it\u2019s actually made<br />\u2022 Doesn\u2019t plump (only applies if you are interested)<br />\u2022 Sticky<br />\u2022 Definitely doesn\u2019t last long<br />\u2022 Once it\u2019s gone it\u2019s gone no color will be left behind on your lips (which sucks because i love the tint of stained lips)<br /><br />Would I recommend? Honestly I would but it would likely be if my top 5 favorites are sold out situation\nIt\u2019s nice  while it lasts\nTOP GIRL 30 Inch Ocean Wave Crochet Hair Pack of 3 Ombre Blonde Deep Wave Crochet Hair Extensions Curls curly Wavy Braids Braiding Twist for Black Women\nTop Girl\n{'Brand': 'Top Girl', 'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Extension Length': '30 Inches', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Product Dimensions': '30 x 3 x 2 inches; 14.07 Ounces'}\nThe quality is absolute trash, its very stringy, it sheds, the hair feels like weird elastic. Washing does not help it still feels awful. it looks exactly it feels terrible.\nEWWW\nVigorous Straight Highlights Wigs for Women Synthetic Long Highlight Lace Wigs Natural Looking Straight Wigs Middle Part\nVigorous\n{'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Special Feature': 'Glueless', 'Brand': 'Vigorous', 'Package Dimensions': '12.48 x 9.37 x 2.87 inches; 9.59 Ounces'}\nThis wig was a gift to a person who really loves this colored wigs and they are absolutely gorgeous on her! She really loved the wig. She said it\u2019s super nice feeling, did not shed at all and was very easy for her to customize. The length did take her by surprise Because she isn\u2019t used to anything this long but she said it\u2019s a first time for everything.\nShe loved it\nBEAUTY CAT 3D False Eyelashes Classic -Full Long Dramatic and Natural Look / Comfortable Wearing Strip Lashes by Handmade, Soft & Light Weight Fluffy Faux Eyelash(5 Pairs) No. 001-SUNFLOWER\nBEAUTY CAT\n{'Brand': 'BEAUTY CAT', 'Material': 'Synthetic Hair', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '2.28 x 0.79 x 4.53 inches', 'Material Feature': 'Disposable', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Product Dimensions': '2.28 x 0.79 x 4.53 inches; 1.06 Ounces', 'UPC': '192542000881', 'Manufacturer': 'Goddess Eyelash Products Co.,Ltd'}\nSuper cheap literally were ripping while I was taken them off the white thing no matter how gentle I was. My first lash was the only one that didn\u2019t rip while I was removing it. These lashes are super cute but the they aren\u2019t durable and aren\u2019t useable  if they rip (none of mine were usable) because they don\u2019t rip the same way.\nI hate it here\nMAEPEOR Lightweight Foundation Stick Matte Concealer and Contour Makeup Stick Oil Control and Waterproof Long-lasting Stick Foundation (#02 White)\nMAEPEOR\n{'Item Form': 'Stick', 'Finish Type': 'Matte', 'Package Information': 'Stick', 'Brand': 'MAEPEOR', 'Coverage': 'Full', 'Product Dimensions': '2.36 x 0.79 x 0.79 inches; 1.13 Ounces'}\nThis product isn\u2019t blendable at all, which is crazy because I have oily skin and stick foundations are supposed to work so well this type of skin but this one did not do the job at all. The color match however is spot that alone is worth 5 stars but I\u2019m rating this as a whole so sadly only 2 stars from me.\nNO\nAISI BEAUTY Long Blonde Wig with Bangs Straight Blonde Wigs for Women 24 Inch Synthetic Heat Resistant Cosplay Wigs for Girls Costume Party Wear\nAISI BEAUTY\n{'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Special Feature': 'Heat Resistant', 'Brand': 'AISI BEAUTY', 'Package Dimensions': '10.59 x 9.29 x 3.27 inches; 12.31 Ounces'}\nReally freaking shiny it looks like a costume wig because of the shine.
