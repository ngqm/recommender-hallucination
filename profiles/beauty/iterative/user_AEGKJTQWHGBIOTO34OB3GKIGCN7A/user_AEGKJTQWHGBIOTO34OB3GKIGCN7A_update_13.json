At the time of this review there was no price listed, but I have to wonder...with good quality almond oil, even organic available in 16 ounce bottles for well under $20, what price will they put on this tiny bottle with less than 2 ounces.\nReview Title: Nice quality oil but...\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

All the salt in this product is less than I would\u2019ve expected and very fine grained so the exfoliation experience isn\u2019t what I expected. What I did like about it was it was not as oily as many of the products that I\u2019ve had in the past. It did leave my skin feeling soft and refreshed. And I do think the price is very reasonable for the quality of the ingredients that are in it. I took one star off for the misrepresentation of the exfoliation product.\nNot great for exfoliating, but a pleasant experience\n2oz / 60ml Glass Spray Bottles for DIY Refill, Essential Oils, Pillow Mists,Fine Mist Spray -3Packs Amber Color\nEagleKing\n{'Brand': 'EagleKing', 'Material': 'Glass', 'Capacity': '2 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '3', 'Special Feature': 'Mist Spray', 'Package Dimensions': '6.3 x 6.1 x 1.7 inches; 8.78 Ounces'}\nSturdy components, good quality glass bottle, sprays a perfect super fine mist.  No complaint at all about the quality, the price...a bit steep even for this quality but I don't find it obscene, hence only one star removed.\nGood quality\nArgan Magic 100% Pure Argan Oil \u2013 Moisturizing Oil that Infuses Skin with Enriched Hydration | Leaves Skin Restored & Refreshed | Non-Greasy | Rich in Vitamin E | Made in USA | Cruelty Free (2 oz)\nArgan Magic\n{'Brand': 'Argan Magic', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Active Ingredients': 'Vitamin e', 'Unit Count': '2 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.2 x 1.1 x 1.1 inches; 2 Ounces', 'UPC': '605923474046'}\nI don't think there is a part of your body that wouldn't benefit from this oil.  I use it on my hair, and mix a bit in my conditioner.  Great for the skin and especially the face.  I also use it for dried cuticles.  Perfect size.\nLove this oil!\nPure Active Body Cleansing Shower Wipes, 40 Individually Wrapped Reduced Price Personal Hygiene Body Wipes for Women and Men, XL, Extra Moist for After Gym Travel Camping Outdoors Sports\nPure Active\n{'Brand': 'Pure Active', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Unit Count': '40.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '8.39 x 6.81 x 6.57 inches; 2.55 Pounds', 'UPC': '613497909697'}\nThe Covid answer to post gym workouts!  If I were a gym owner,  I would keep these well in stock! This is a nice big cloth, used to clean up after a workout. It is not dripping wet but it is adequately moist. There is a slight clean scent to it, but nothing perfumy or anything that would fight with a perfume. It did a nice job, however other than doing may be under arms face and chest one of these towels would not be enough if you really wanted to clean yourself up.  These would also be great during camping trips. Or even long car trips when you like to refresh. For what it is, I don\u2019t think the price is unreasonable. If I were a gym owner I would give each patron two of these towels when they arrived. I thought the product was good, the towel was really soft and enjoyable to use.  The towel itself is also as strong as it is soft. I will make sure to have a couple of these in my purse at all times.\nThe Covid answer to post gym workouts!\nEmpty Brown Glass Spray Bottles2-Pack, Refillable 16 oz Containers for Essential Oils, Cleaning Products, Aromatherapy, Misting Plants, or Cooking - Reliable Sprayer with Mist and Stream Settings\nCherry\n{'Brand': 'Cherry', 'Material': 'Glass', 'Capacity': '16 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Product Care Instructions': 'Hand Wash Only', 'Package Dimensions': '9.09 x 6.46 x 3.35 inches; 4.94 Ounces', 'UPC': '791523234187'}\nNice quality but overpriced.  The bottle is quality glass, the sprayer is sturdy with multiple functions, you can spray or stream. It even has nice chalk type labels included. They are perfect if you want to make your own natural cleaning supplies, and the dark amber color will protect your essential oil\u2019s, but I feel that the price is way out of line. I\u2019m not debating the quality, the quality is there. The price\u2026 Not.\nNice quality but overpriced\n6 Pack Portable travel bottles-30ml Flip Cap Reusable Bottles Keychain Carriers for Travel Outdoor Camping Supplies, Metal Buckle Include, Set of 6\nSKYCY\n{'Package Dimensions': '8.03 x 5.2 x 2.36 inches; 7.05 Ounces', 'UPC': '653552483120'}\nI like making my own hand lotions and sanitizers and these little keychain lotion bottle and holders are just adorable for those projects. What\u2019s really nice about them is they make a nice gift for a guy and a lot of these types of holders are way too feminine to give to a guy as a gift. Any patriot would certainly love it.  The price? I found it to be fair for the novelty that it is.\nAdorable for DYI gifts\n36 Pack 2oz Clear Plastic Empty Bottles Travel Containers with Flip Cap for Hand Sanitizer, Cosmetic, Shampoo, Lotion, Liquid Body Soap, Cream, Toner, BPA-free\nJIUZHU\n{'Package Dimensions': '12.09 x 10.28 x 3.07 inches; 13.12 Ounces', 'UPC': '667322945817'}\nGreat for homemade projects!  I would\u2019ve like them to be a little bit more flexible for pushing thicker lotions out. But if you\u2019re going to be putting liquids and it won\u2019t be an issue. Well packaged. I felt it was a decent value.\nGreat for homemade projects!\nEmpty Amber Glass Spray Bottles - (4 Pack) 16 oz with Labels Refillable Container for Essential Oils, Cleaning Solutions, Cleaning Products, Hair, Plant Mister, Daily Shower, Gardening or Aromatherapy\nAYL\n{'Brand': 'AYL', 'Material': 'Glass', 'Capacity': '16 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '4', 'Product Care Instructions': 'Hand Wash Only', 'Package Dimensions': '9.88 x 7.6 x 7.17 inches; 2.98 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'EmptyAmberGlassSprayBottles 4 Pack', 'UPC': '860005177202'}\nThese well made bottles are big and perfect for cleaning solutions.  The sprayer works well and I liked the addition of the metal funnel and the labels.  That being said, $5 each for a glass spray pump bottle is pricey...they back it up with quality, but if your buying 4 of them I think the price should be lower.\nNice quality\n8 PCS 40ML Mini Spray Bottles, FANDAMEI Fine Mist Plastic Spray Bottles, Empty Refillable Clear Atomizer for Cleaning, Travel, Essential Oils, Perfume, Makeup Liquids. Travel Size, Pink & Blue\nFandamei\n{'Brand': 'Fandamei', 'Material': 'Plastic', 'Capacity': '40 Milliliters', 'Number of Items': '8', 'Special Feature': 'Mist Spray', 'Package Dimensions': '8.46 x 5.79 x 1.42 inches; 5.93 Ounces'}\nI used these for a homemade essential oil facial spray.  The mist is really fine which I liked.  It has a double cap which is nice as it stays secure in your purse.  Well constructed and just cute.  I felt for a buck a bottle it was a good value.\nGreat for DYI projects\nZMCARE 12-Pack, Eco-Friendly 28-410 (28 mm) Lotion Pump for Cosmetics, Hand Wash, Hand Sanitizer, Soap Dispenser Containers \u2014 Non-Slip Design \u2014 Fits Most 1 liter/33.8 Oz Bottles.\nZMCARE\n{'Package Dimensions': '9.06 x 4.84 x 2.28 inches; 6.49 Ounces', 'UPC': '850013484591'}\nThese pumps are good quality, solid construction meant for larger bottles to pay attention to the type of bottle it fits or you will be unhappy.  The same company sells a smaller pump, set of two for $6 which I found way overpriced so I was surprised to find these pumps so reasonable and a good value.\nGreat value!\nYARELI Organic Castor Oil for Eyelashes, Eyebrows, Hair, Skin and Body - Cold Pressed and Unrefined, 12oz\nYARELI\n{'Product Benefits': 'Moisturizing', 'Scent': 'Fragrance free', 'Liquid Volume': '12 Fluid Ounces', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Brand': 'YARELI', 'Package Dimensions': '10.2 x 2.36 x 2.2 inches; 12 Ounces'}\nGreat price for a quality product!  Are use a lot of castor oil in lotions and creams that I formulate myself. I like to use the best quality caster oil I can find and I find this product compatible with brands that I spend the same amount on for a 4 ounce bottle. So I find this to be an amazing value.\nGreat price for a quality product!\nTanshine Airless Pump Bottle 6Pcs 30ml/1.01oz Empty Lotion Bottle Vacuum Lotion Bottle Tiny Travel Lotion Bottles Easy to Carry Out Vacuum Pump Lotion Bottles\nTANSHINE\n{'Package Dimensions': '10.67 x 8.5 x 1.93 inches; 8.47 Ounces'}\nThe mist is fine and the pump works well, make sure not to fill it all the way as when you prime the pump you need a little wiggle room.  The quality is not great, and this company makes a beautiful set of six with much better materials and gold accenting for two dollars more...spend the money on the other set.  The airless pump will keep ingredients from oxidizing too quickly.  Not a bad set, but since I've used the other one...I'm spoiled, so this one is just okay.\nJust okay\nClaireceuticals Sweet Almond Oil for Hair, Face & Skin - Organic Almond Oil for Skin - Pure Almond Oil Moisturizer for Dry Skin - Facial Moisturizer for Women - Ideal Dandruff Remover - 1.69 Fl Oz\nCLAIRECEUTICALS\n{'Brand': 'CLAIRECEUTICALS', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Unit Count': '1.7 Fl Oz', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Item Volume': '100 Milliliters'}\nThis is a nice quality oil, it absorbs well and leaves the skin soft.  At the time of this review there was no price listed, but I have to wonder...with good quality almond oil, even organic available in 16 ounce bottles for well under $20, what price will they put on this tiny bottle with less than 2 ounces.\nNice quality oil but...",
