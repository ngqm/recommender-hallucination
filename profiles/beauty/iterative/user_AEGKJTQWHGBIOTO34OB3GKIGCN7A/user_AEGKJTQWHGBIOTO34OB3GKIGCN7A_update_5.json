All the salt in this product is less than I would\u2019ve expected and very fine grained so the exfoliation experience isn\u2019t what I expected. What I did like about it was it was not as oily as many of the products that I\u2019ve had in the past. It did leave my skin feeling soft and refreshed. And I do think the price is very reasonable for the quality of the ingredients that are in it. I took one star off for the misrepresentation of the exfoliation product.\nNot great for exfoliating, but a pleasant experience\n2oz / 60ml Glass Spray Bottles for DIY Refill, Essential Oils, Pillow Mists,Fine Mist Spray -3Packs Amber Color\nEagleKing\n{'Brand': 'EagleKing', 'Material': 'Glass', 'Capacity': '2 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '3', 'Special Feature': 'Mist Spray', 'Package Dimensions': '6.3 x 6.1 x 1.7 inches; 8.78 Ounces'}\nSturdy components, good quality glass bottle, sprays a perfect super fine mist.  No complaint at all about the quality, the price...a bit steep even for this quality but I don't find it obscene, hence only one star removed.\nGood quality\nArgan Magic 100% Pure Argan Oil \u2013 Moisturizing Oil that Infuses Skin with Enriched Hydration | Leaves Skin Restored & Refreshed | Non-Greasy | Rich in Vitamin E | Made in USA | Cruelty Free (2 oz)\nArgan Magic\n{'Brand': 'Argan Magic', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Active Ingredients': 'Vitamin e', 'Unit Count': '2 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.2 x 1.1 x 1.1 inches; 2 Ounces', 'UPC': '605923474046'}\nI don't think there is a part of your body that wouldn't benefit from this oil.  I use it on my hair, and mix a bit in my conditioner.  Great for the skin and especially the face.  I also use it for dried cuticles.  Perfect size.\nLove this oil!\nPure Active Body Cleansing Shower Wipes, 40 Individually Wrapped Reduced Price Personal Hygiene Body Wipes for Women and Men, XL, Extra Moist for After Gym Travel Camping Outdoors Sports\nPure Active\n{'Brand': 'Pure Active', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Unit Count': '40.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '8.39 x 6.81 x 6.57 inches; 2.55 Pounds', 'UPC': '613497909697'}\nThe Covid answer to post gym workouts!  If I were a gym owner,  I would keep these well in stock! This is a nice big cloth, used to clean up after a workout. It is not dripping wet but it is adequately moist. There is a slight clean scent to it, but nothing perfumy or anything that would fight with a perfume. It did a nice job, however other than doing may be under arms face and chest one of these towels would not be enough if you really wanted to clean yourself up.  These would also be great during camping trips. Or even long car trips when you like to refresh. For what it is, I don\u2019t think the price is unreasonable. If I were a gym owner I would give each patron two of these towels when they arrived. I thought the product was good, the towel was really soft and enjoyable to use.  The towel itself is also as strong as it is soft. I will make sure to have a couple of these in my purse at all times.\nThe Covid answer to post gym workouts!\nEmpty Brown Glass Spray Bottles2-Pack, Refillable 16 oz Containers for Essential Oils, Cleaning Products, Aromatherapy, Misting Plants, or Cooking - Reliable Sprayer with Mist and Stream Settings\nCherry\n{'Brand': 'Cherry', 'Material': 'Glass', 'Capacity': '16 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Product Care Instructions': 'Hand Wash Only', 'Package Dimensions': '9.09 x 6.46 x 3.35 inches; 4.94 Ounces', 'UPC': '791523234187'}\nNice quality but overpriced.
