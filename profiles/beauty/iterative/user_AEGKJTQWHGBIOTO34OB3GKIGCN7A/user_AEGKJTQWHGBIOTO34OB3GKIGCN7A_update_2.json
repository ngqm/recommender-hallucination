All the salt in this product is less than I would\u2019ve expected and very fine grained so the exfoliation experience isn\u2019t what I expected. What I did like about it was it was not as oily as many of the products that I\u2019ve had in the past. It did leave my skin feeling soft and refreshed. And I do think the price is very reasonable for the quality of the ingredients that are in it. I took one star off for the misrepresentation of the exfoliation product.\nNot great for exfoliating, but a pleasant experience\n2oz / 60ml Glass Spray Bottles for DIY Refill, Essential Oils, Pillow Mists,Fine Mist Spray -3Packs Amber Color\nEagleKing\n{'Brand': 'EagleKing', 'Material': 'Glass', 'Capacity': '2 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '3', 'Special Feature': 'Mist Spray', 'Package Dimensions': '6.3 x 6.1 x 1.7 inches; 8.78 Ounces'}\nSturdy components, good quality glass bottle, sprays a perfect super fine mist.
