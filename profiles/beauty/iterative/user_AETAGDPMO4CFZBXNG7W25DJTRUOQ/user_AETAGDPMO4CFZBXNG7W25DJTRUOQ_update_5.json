It hits all your skincare needs.  These are the cloth style masks which I always find have more serum, better sticking power and a better fit than the hydrogel masks.<br /><br />The eye patches I especially liked.  They're packed full of serum, stay on well and cover the whole under eye and side area.  The brightening face mask did seem to make my skin more even and brighter but it does say not for sensitive skin.  I do sometimes have some sensitivity issues but didn't experience that with any of the masks.<br /><br />There's enough serum in all the masks that you can use the excess the next day as a serum or swipe over your d\u00e9colletage. I like to keep my masks in the fridge.  They feel great when they're chilled.  This is definitely a product I'll be buying again.\nReview Title: great selection.\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "[Weekly Point Cosmetic Rose edition mask sheet] - Facial skin care mask sheet 3solutions(Wriklecare, Brighten up, Moisture) in one (1Pack of 10pcs)\nWeekly Point Cosmetic\n{'Brand': 'Weekly Point Cosmetic', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Product Benefits': 'Moisture,Skin', 'Scent': 'Rose', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.38 x 4.84 x 7.01 inches; 12.63 Ounces'}\nI\u2019ve been using sheet masks for years. Long before they became something you could buy at your local pharmacy so I\u2019m used to reading the adorable translations on the back (see photo)<br /><br />That aside the mask is a little on the small side and I think I have an average sized face. It does stretch though and the benefit is that it doesn\u2019t get in your hair. Lots of serum with this one, or mask juice as I like to call it<br />so at the end of the mask time you have enough to apply extra to your face a neck.<br /><br />I left it for the full 20 minutes and my skin did feel soft and moisturised.  I used it after a transatlantic flight and my skin really needed the hydration. Obviously you won\u2019t see any miracles after one use but do make it part of your weekly or twice weekly routine for maximum effect.<br /><br />Don\u2019t be tempted to leave it on longer or sleep with it. All masks will just dry out and negate the benefits.<br /><br />This is a nice addition to my sheet mask collection.\nLovely and hydrating.\nGlass Nail File - JORLAI 2PC Nano Nail Shiner Nail Files Polisher Glass Nail Buffers Professional Crystal Manicure Tools Kit for Natural Nails\nJORLAI\n{'Package Dimensions': '4.2 x 2.5 x 0.4 inches; 1.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '712322500167'}\nThese are very cute and sparkly and come in their own case. I like that they\u2019re nice and small and the thickness is great for shaping the sides of your nails. I found the buffing part slow going and it took quite a while to build up a shine but I\u2019m happy with the end result. My nails took a real beating from gel so I\u2019m giving them a break from all polish and this really helps build a lovely shine.\nGives a good natural shine\nTravel Friendly Face Cleanser, Quick Cleansing Dry Tissue 20 Packs - Dry Facial Wipes Makeup Remover Travel Size, Exfoliating Wipes For Face\na DAILY SELF-CARE COSMETICS avajar\n{'Brand': 'a DAILY SELF-CARE COSMETICS avajar', 'Skin Type': 'All Skin,Dry', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Unit Count': '20.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '20', 'Product Dimensions': '5.51 x 2.76 x 3.94 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nThis is a solid five stars.  I'm a flight attendant and it's such a pain to have to take a variety of products when you travel and some countries have liquid restrictions.<br /><br />I used this as soon as I got to my hotel with low expectations that were quickly blown away.  You use wet it with warm water and it takes off all makeup including mascara.  You rinse with water afterwards but it's not overly soapy so you don't have to worry about getting soap in your eyes.  I've used this at home and then used a cotton wool pad with my usual makeup remover expecting some residue makeup but nothing was left.  I'm so impressed with these and as one pad will take off all your makeup it's really good value.\nSensational\nBodipure Baking Soda Natural Vegetable Sport Bar Soap 3 Pack - Refreshing & Cooling Mint - Deodorizing Cleanser for Face and Body - 4 oz. ea\nBodipure\n{'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Skin Type': 'All, Sensitive', 'Brand': 'Bodipure', 'Scent': 'Clean, natural mint', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Product Dimensions': '7 x 2.25 x 1 inches; 14.89 Ounces', 'UPC': '838347004388', 'Manufacturer': 'Bodipure, Inc.'}\nThe best soap I\u2019ve used bar none. Seriously.<br /><br />I came in from the garden where I\u2019d been stacking a cord of firewood and planting bulbs. My hands were filthy and cracked. This soap made the dirt dissolve immediately. I know that\u2019s what soap does but with this it just vanishes without even having to scrub, even from under my nails. It has a light mint scent and isn\u2019t drying at all. I didn\u2019t know I could get that excited about washing my hands. I tried it in the shower and my skin felt clean and smooth without feeling dry. Even my husband who doesn\u2019t like anything remotely \u201cgirly\u201d was a fan.<br /><br />The hand mask that came with it was lovely and moisturising.\nThe best soap I\u2019ve used.\nKaruna 7 Days of Glow - Face & Eye Mask Variety Pack (7 Sheets), Hydrate, Brighten and Glow\nKaruna\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.05 x 5.04 x 1.57 inches; 8.75 Ounces', 'UPC': '857950007333'}\nThis is a really great sheet mask pack.
