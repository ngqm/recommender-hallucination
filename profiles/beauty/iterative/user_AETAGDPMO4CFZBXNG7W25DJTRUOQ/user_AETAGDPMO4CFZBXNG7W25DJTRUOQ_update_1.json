Long before they became something you could buy at your local pharmacy so I\u2019m used to reading the adorable translations on the back (see photo)<br /><br />That aside the mask is a little on the small side and I think I have an average sized face. It does stretch though and the benefit is that it doesn\u2019t get in your hair. Lots of serum with this one, or mask juice as I like to call it<br />so at the end of the mask time you have enough to apply extra to your face a neck.<br /><br />I left it for the full 20 minutes and my skin did feel soft and moisturised.  I used it after a transatlantic flight and my skin really needed the hydration. Obviously you won\u2019t see any miracles after one use but do make it part of your weekly or twice weekly routine for maximum effect.<br /><br />Don\u2019t be tempted to leave it on longer or sleep with it. All masks will just dry out and negate the benefits.<br /><br />This is a nice addition to my sheet mask collection.\nReview Title: Lovely and hydrating.\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
