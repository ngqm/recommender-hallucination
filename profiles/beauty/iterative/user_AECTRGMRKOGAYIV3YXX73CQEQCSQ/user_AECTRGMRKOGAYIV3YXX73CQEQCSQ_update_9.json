I love the packaging and the color was really rich and a beautiful tone on my skin. Oftentimes reds can be too warm or too cool and this is just the right amount of warmth for me. It's very comfortable to wear and was nice and long wearing without being drying. and then I was really pleased with how beautifully it faded after a very long time. I'm excited to try different shades in this formula.\nReview Title: Super comfortable, long wearing, and fades beautifully\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

In good light, the pink color flashes copper. The wear time is good too. The picture is after three days of wear and it still looks excellent.\nPink shifts to copper!\nBeautyBio GloPRO Regeneration Tools\n{'Product Dimensions': '9.88 x 2.38 x 7.88 inches; 1.3 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'ZumYu', 'Batteries': '2 AAA batteries required.

I decided to try two super inexpensive versions , both costing around $20 and see if this significantly more expensive option from GloPRO was really worth it. In short, yes. Both of the cheaper options were incredibly painful and flimsy feeling. One of them even felt kind of like getting a face tattoo. It was awful. The GloPRO option actually feels nice on the skin because of the vibration feature and the red light therapy is a huge benefit for those monthly breakouts. I do feel like my skin care is absorbing more effectively since I've been using this, but it's still an extremely expensive tool. If you really want a microneedling device, in my opinion this is worth the investment, however, I don't think it's a necessary item.\nSuper pricey, but much better than the budget-friendly alternatives\nMakeup Blender Sponge Set - 4 Pack Latex Free Q-Soft Makeup Beauty Foundation Blending Sponge Flawless Smooth Brush for Liquid Foundation BB Creams Powders Concealer (4 Pack)\nFRESHME\n{'Brand': 'FRESHME', 'Color': 'Ivory', 'Material': 'Rubber', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.6 x 3.6 x 1.4 inches; 1.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '681413196902', 'Manufacturer': 'FRESHME'}\nI'm not a complete beauty sponge snob and I've tried lots of different brands, both high-end and budget friendly, and I found sponges I liked at both price points. These sponges are definitely on the farmer side, so for that reason they aren't my favorite. They do expand when wet and I really do like the shape of the larger ones in this set--they are very similar to the Real Techniques sponges--but they're just not as soft and bouncy as some of the others that I prefer. If you're looking for a good drugstore-priced sponge I recommend the Loreal ones.\nKind of firm but good shapes\n2019 Newest Nose Hair Trimmer for Men Women MASWATER Professional Electric Nose Ear Hair Trimmer Clipper Painless Wet/Dry Trimming Premium Quality Stainless Steel Dual-Edge Blades Won't Break!\nmaswater\n{'Brand': 'Maswater', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Nose,Facial Hair,Beards,Grooming,Trimmer,Professional', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Included Components': 'Clipper, Battery', 'Color': 'Silver', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1 x 1 x 5 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Batteries': '1 AA batteries required.', 'UPC': '699949549697', 'Manufacturer': 'MASWATER'}\nI didn't have great success with his nose hair trimmer. First off it does pull despite claiming not to. It's not incredibly painful but every now and then it would snag and Pull and I did enjoy that. Also it didn't seem to do the best job getting all the hairs. I had one here that I was trying to get and I had to go over it several times and it just wouldn't seem to trim it. It's not super expensive so it's not a complete fail for me but I'm not going to be using this a lot unless I really need to. It also heats up relatively quickly.\nIt does pull and it doesn't get every hair.\nTOUCH IN SOL No Pore Blem Priming Eraser - Face Makeup Easy Grip Stick Primer with Smudging Cushion Tip, Concealing Pores and Fine Lines, Sebum Control and Skin Smooth & Velvety Finish\nTouch in Sol\n{'Brand': 'Touch in Sol', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Package Information': 'Tube', 'Item Volume': '1 Milliliters', 'Specialty': 'Moisturizing, Cruelty Free, Vegan', 'Item model number': 'P813614'}\nI tried a few other products and they no poreblem line and overall I'm pretty impressed. It swipes on and does a decent job of minimizing pores. It's not as effective as my cover FX pore filling primer or my tarte pore filling primer but I do like the convenience of having this in a pen.\nPretty decent\nIonic Hair Dryers for Women 1800W Blow Dryer with Diffuser Hot and Cool Settings Speed Adjustable Negative Ion Hair Dryer with 2 Concentrators,1 Hair Scalp Massager Brush for Curly Hair(LTD Edition)\nLassie\n{'Brand': 'Lassie', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Number of Speeds': '2', 'Product Dimensions': '11.4 x 9.4 x 3.7 inches; 2.43 Pounds', 'Manufacturer': 'Lassie'}\nThey're quite a few of these hair dryers popping up that are designed to look like the ridiculously expensive Dyson. While I've never tried the Dyson, I was excited by the design and so I picked this one up. On the plus side it does have an extremely long cord so if you can't stand right directly next to you anymore you'll be fine but it is not a swivel cord so it's not as maneuverable as others. It's not a huge deal for me but just something to be aware of. I love the hat and cold functions which makes it really nice to set your hair at the end and seal in the style. If you've only ever used regular hair dryers you'll really appreciate this added feature. It's a pretty substantial hair dryer. If you're used to really inexpensive lightweight ones you'll notice the additional weight however it's not so heavy that your arm will get tired even if you have a ton of hair like I do. And I just have to go back to the overall style and design again because this hair dryer looks so sleek and cool. I get a kick out of using it every time I see it.\nBeautiful Dyson style design and pretty impressive hair dryer too\nMarshique Touch Fit Glitter Cream Shadow 0.2Oz (Gold Beige White Clear Skin Tone Shiny mood) - Champagne Gold Pearl, Sparkle Eyeshadow, Waterproof and Longlasting for Under fat eye\nMarshique\n{'Brand': 'Marshique', 'Item Form': 'Cream,Powder,Creamy', 'Finish Type': 'Luminous,Shiny,Sheer,Glitter,Shimmer', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Coverage': 'Light', 'Package Dimensions': '1.61 x 1.61 x 0.74 inches; 0.2 Ounces', 'Item model number': '0000'}\nI'm not generally a huge fan of cream shadows but I wanted to give this one a try and I'm so happy I did. It is so glimmery and beautiful. My favorite way to wear this is just padded over a bear eyelid with some mascara and maybe a little bit of liner. It just adds a beautiful finished touch. It also looks really lovely tapped on top of eyeshadow. For that method I prefer my finger versus a brush. It's nice because it doesn't bunch up or overly crease. And I really like the airtight packaging as well.\nSuch a beautiful cream shadow\nRAREKIND Fade Matte Lipstick by Amorepacific - 10 Colors, Cruelty-Free Nourishing Lip Stick, Velvety-smooth, Long-Lasting Moisturizing Lipstick - 3.2g Maple Road\nRAREKIND\n{'Package Dimensions': '3.3 x 0.9 x 0.9 inches; 0.95 Ounces'}\nThis is so beautiful!
