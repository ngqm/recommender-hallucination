In good light, the pink color flashes copper. The wear time is good too.

I decided to try two super inexpensive versions , both costing around $20 and see if this significantly more expensive option from GloPRO was really worth it. In short, yes. Both of the cheaper options were incredibly painful and flimsy feeling. One of them even felt kind of like getting a face tattoo. It was awful. The GloPRO option actually feels nice on the skin because of the vibration feature and the red light therapy is a huge benefit for those monthly breakouts. I do feel like my skin care is absorbing more effectively since I've been using this, but it's still an extremely expensive tool. If you really want a microneedling device, in my opinion this is worth the investment, however, I don't think it's a necessary item.\nSuper pricey, but much better than the budget-friendly alternatives\nMakeup Blender Sponge Set - 4 Pack Latex Free Q-Soft Makeup Beauty Foundation Blending Sponge Flawless Smooth Brush for Liquid Foundation BB Creams Powders Concealer (4 Pack)\nFRESHME\n{'Brand': 'FRESHME', 'Color': 'Ivory', 'Material': 'Rubber', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.6 x 3.6 x 1.4 inches; 1.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '681413196902', 'Manufacturer': 'FRESHME'}\nI'm not a complete beauty sponge snob and I've tried lots of different brands, both high-end and budget friendly, and I found sponges I liked at both price points. These sponges are definitely on the farmer side, so for that reason they aren't my favorite. They do expand when wet and I really do like the shape of the larger ones in this set--they are very similar to the Real Techniques sponges--but they're just not as soft and bouncy as some of the others that I prefer. If you're looking for a good drugstore-priced sponge I recommend the Loreal ones.\nKind of firm but good shapes\n2019 Newest Nose Hair Trimmer for Men Women MASWATER Professional Electric Nose Ear Hair Trimmer Clipper Painless Wet/Dry Trimming Premium Quality Stainless Steel Dual-Edge Blades Won't Break!\nmaswater\n{'Brand': 'Maswater', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Nose,Facial Hair,Beards,Grooming,Trimmer,Professional', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Included Components': 'Clipper, Battery', 'Color': 'Silver', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1 x 1 x 5 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Batteries': '1 AA batteries required.', 'UPC': '699949549697', 'Manufacturer': 'MASWATER'}\nI didn't have great success with his nose hair trimmer. First off it does pull despite claiming not to. It's not incredibly painful but every now and then it would snag and Pull and I did enjoy that. Also it didn't seem to do the best job getting all the hairs. I had one here that I was trying to get and I had to go over it several times and it just wouldn't seem to trim it. It's not super expensive so it's not a complete fail for me but I'm not going to be using this a lot unless I really need to. It also heats up relatively quickly.\nIt does pull and it doesn't get every hair.\nTOUCH IN SOL No Pore Blem Priming Eraser - Face Makeup Easy Grip Stick Primer with Smudging Cushion Tip, Concealing Pores and Fine Lines, Sebum Control and Skin Smooth & Velvety Finish\nTouch in Sol\n{'Brand': 'Touch in Sol', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Package Information': 'Tube', 'Item Volume': '1 Milliliters', 'Specialty': 'Moisturizing, Cruelty Free, Vegan', 'Item model number': 'P813614'}\nI tried a few other products and they no poreblem line and overall I'm pretty impressed.
