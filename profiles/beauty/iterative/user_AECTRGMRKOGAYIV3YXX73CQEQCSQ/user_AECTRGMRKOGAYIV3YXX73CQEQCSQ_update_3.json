(included)', 'UPC': '810813030237 851262002673', 'Manufacturer': 'BeautyBio', 'Country of Origin': 'China'}\nReview Text: I've been in the market for a microneedling device for a while now, but I wasn't sure if I needed something super expensive or if I could get away with a more budget-friendly option. I decided to try two super inexpensive versions , both costing around $20 and see if this significantly more expensive option from GloPRO was really worth it. In short, yes. Both of the cheaper options were incredibly painful and flimsy feeling. One of them even felt kind of like getting a face tattoo. It was awful. The GloPRO option actually feels nice on the skin because of the vibration feature and the red light therapy is a huge benefit for those monthly breakouts. I do feel like my skin care is absorbing more effectively since I've been using this, but it's still an extremely expensive tool. If you really want a microneedling device, in my opinion this is worth the investment, however, I don't think it's a necessary item.\nReview Title: Super pricey, but much better than the budget-friendly alternatives\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
