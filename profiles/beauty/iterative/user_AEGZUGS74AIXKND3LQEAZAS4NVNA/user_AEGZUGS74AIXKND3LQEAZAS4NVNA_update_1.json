Epilators gently remove hair at the root, rather than at the surface like shaving, and can remove much shorter hair than waxing so you don't have to wait until hair becomes visible to remove it. After epilation, legs stay smooth for up to four weeks and hair grows back at different rates, meaning you will typically have less hair to remove each time you epilate.\", 'What is the benefit of epilation versus using a traditional razor, cream, or foam?', \"Unlike shaving, cream, or foam - which only cut or dissolve hair at the skin surface - epilators remove hair at the root. Because it takes a while for the hair to grow back to the skin surface, your skin will stay smooth for up to four weeks. As the hair grows back from the root, the tip of the hair will not be blunt, but instead look thinner and finer. As a result, you'll no longer have the feeling of coarse stubble.\", 'What is the benefit of epilation versus waxing (Agda or Halawa)?', \"Wax does remove hair from the root just like epilators. However, when it comes to removing shortest hair, wax performs quite poorly. As wax basically sticks on the hair to remove it, hair needs to be a certain length for this process to take place. Therefore, there is a hair-growth waiting period for those who use wax. With epilators, there is no such waiting and therefore no need to cover legs up. Using wax is also a hassle. The preparation process (for self-made wax, Adga, or Halawa) is long, messy, and tiresome. What's even worse, using wax (Agda or Halawa) is a more painful process compared to epilators.\", 'Does epilation hurt?', 'Most women trying epilation for the first time find the process much less painful than they had anticipated. As hair is removed at the root, however, there might be some discomfort. In the beginning, the pulling sensation is stronger, but this subsides as your skin adjusts to the process. Over time, after successive epilations, there is also less hair to be removed. Studies show that epilating more frequently can reduce pain significantly. Silk-\u00e9pil Xpressive also features three ways to help women minimize discomfort - Olay pre-epilation wipes prepare the skin for epilation, a new massage system stimulates the skin before epilation and helps reduce the pain, and a beginner cap helps new users get used to epilation.', 'How long does my hair have to be for epilation?', 'Silk-\u00e9pil can remove hair that is 0.5-mm in length. This hair length occurs after approximately two days of not shaving.', 'Will my hair grow back after epilation?', 'Yes. However, the hairs will grow back more tapered and fine than they do from shaving. Hair that is removed with a razor is cut at skin level, so that the edge grows back blunt and coarse, causing razor stubble.', 'Does hair grow back thicker and stronger after epilation?', 'No, dermatologists have confirmed that epilation has no negative impact on the thickness of regrowing hair. In addition, because hairs are removed at the root, the hairs that do grow back have softer, narrower tips than hairs removed with a razor, so they feel softer and finer to the touch. The reason why this question arises every now and then is that hair removal is more frequent (and also more in focus) in summer. And this is also the time when hair growth itself changes. Due to the higher ambient temperatures the blood circulation is better, leading to a better supply of nutrition to hair roots so that hair growth in general is stronger.']\nAverage Rating: 3.9\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Braun', 'Water Resistance Level': 'Not Water Resistant', 'Included Components': 'Cleaning Brush', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '10.24 x 2.76 x 7.76 inches; 1.25 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'SE7921SPA', 'UPC': '069055866856 883207546034', 'Manufacturer': 'P & G'}\nReview Text: Some quick thoughts on this model specifically:<br />* Removes smaller hairs (0.5mm) than older models, so you can be more aggressive as stray hairs start to grow back<br />* The \"massagers\" on the epilation head really do help<br />* You can use it dry or completely-wet, but not damp (e.g., right after the shower won't work)... and I must say that using it under running water dramatically reduces any discomfort, although it's a bit harder to notice stray hairs<br />* You can't use it while plugged in (that would be a serious safety hazard in the shower!) but it means that whenever the battery eventually stops holding a charge, you'll have to toss the unit)<br />* I wish this included a trimming head like other models, for the cases when you have longer hairs you want to attack (they have to be 7 mm or shorter before this will really pull them out)<br />* This doesn't include an attachment for facial hair like some do (which is OK)... just make sure that your epilator is clean if you're going to use it on your face, because otherwise it will make you break out<br />* The small spotlight on the unit makes it much easier to see hairs you may have missed<br />* The exfoliating brush is a nice touch, because epilating frequently leads to ingrown hairs. It says to use it a day or two before epilating, and it's super-gentle... almost feels like it's not doing anything, but I found it's more effective and more comfortable (if more slow) than just using a loofah. The \"wait 2 days\" advice is good because otherwise your skin gets sensitive<br /><br />And some thoughts on epilation in general:<br />* This seems obvious, but I have to say it: it only hurts when a hair is being removed. This means that the first time you epilate, it's very uncomfortable. But since only a small percentage of the hair grows back before you epilate again (assuming you do it at least once every 3 months!), the subsequent touch-ups really aren't bad at all, especially on your legs. (Underarms are less comfortable, and bikini area even less so. Face is also quite sensitive, though that probably varies by person, depending on how much tweezing you normally do.)<br />* The first time you epilate, your legs will be unbelievably smooth. But hair grows back at different rates, so after a month or so of epilating (maybe one time each week), you'll have tiny hairs here and there, that are starting to grow back but are still too small to get. It's less of an issue with this epilator than others, and the hairs aren't really visible. So if you think someone's going to be touching your legs, then shave :-D but otherwise life is much easier if you just epilate once a week or so. Then if you don't bother doing anything for a month or so, you'll have a few stray hairs here and there, but nothing like someone who shaves regularly and then skips a month (or even a week... or even 3 days). Visible stubble is entirely a thing of the past.<br />* Remember that the exfoliation is important to prevent ingrown hairs (just little bumps on your legs--mine don't turn red). But if you wax, or if you age ;) you'll have to do that anyway. And this unit's exfoliator is more gentle than a loofah<br />* And how could I forget the #1 reason to epilate: no more underarm bumps. You know, the ones that you ALWAYS have, despite a million products on the market that say they'll banish them but don't? Sometimes when you epilate, your skin will be red for 30-90 seconds afterward, but then it fades. So NO MORE BUMPS. That alone is reason enough to own an epilator, IMO :)  This also helps with bikini-area bumps, but I find in those cases that the redness can take several hours to fade, so it's fantastic to use the day before swimming but would not be a good choice immediately before pool time\nReview Title: another solid epilator from Braun (plus no more underarm bumps!)\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
