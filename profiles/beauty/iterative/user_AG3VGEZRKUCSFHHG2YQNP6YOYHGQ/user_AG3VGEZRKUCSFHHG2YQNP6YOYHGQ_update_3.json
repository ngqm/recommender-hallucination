That being said, it\u2019s important that you suction off your hair in order to get the most effective results from using your hot tools. This also comes into play when you are trimming or cutting hair, as you cannot cut the entire thickness of a section with one pass. It is important that you suction off your hair into thinner bundles so that a hot tool or your hair shears are most effective in trimming or curling or straightening your hair. These suctioning clips are incredibly effective for two reasons. First, the bottom portion of the clip has a somewhat pointed, though rounded, edge to help divide the hair into sections. Second, the top portion of the lab has a padded layer that helps to grab onto and hold the suction of hair in place. With the Number of clips in this package, you have more than enough to work with in order to section of all areas of your hair for curling, straightening, or trimming. I absolutely love these clips already and am incredibly excited that they have helped to cut down the styling time it takes to straighten or curl my hair. If you are a person that regularly use is hot tools on your hair, I would absolutely recommend these to help in your styling as well!\nReview Title: Perfect sectioning for styling\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "3D Mink Eyelashes Natural Long Lashes 2 in 1 Self-adhesive Eyeliner Instead of Adhesive 5 Different Styles Pairs Kits Sets with Tweezers , NO NEED GLUE\nPURELEOR\n{'Brand': 'PURELEOR', 'Material': 'Mink Fur', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Mounting Type': 'Eyelash Glue', 'Unit Count': '5.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '9 x 6 x 1 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '750810450143'}\nThis set of lashes comes with five pairs in different styles, a set of tweezers and a liquid eyeliner that also acts as glue. The styles vary from casual day to day wear to dramatic showstoppers. The lashes are synthetic fibers with a medium band that is sturdy and with proper care can be used easily 20 or more times. They are soft and comfortable to wear with a secure hold for all day wear. With the liner functioning as a glue, you eliminate the need for an extra step and instead of putting glue on the lash band, you put it on as you would a normal liner making application incredibly easy, even for a beginner. I love these lashes!!!\nPerfect lashes for a beginner or pro!\nYinMer Lavish Lash \u2013 Eyelash Growth Enhancer & Brow Serum with Biotin & Natural Growth Peptides for Long, Thick Lashes and Eyebrows\nOUZIFISH\n{'Package Dimensions': '6.61 x 2.8 x 1.26 inches; 3.53 Ounces'}\nThis eyebrow serum came beautifully packaged beyond anything I expected. The packaging and presentation gave the immediate feel of an expensive and regal product. The actual tube and brush of the serum also are impeccable with regard to presentation. The serum itself is very basic and lacking a little in desired thickness. Using a simple thin brush like the one that is provided makes for a bit of a challenge in applying such a watery textured liquid to your brow. A spoolie type brush would have made application on your brows much easier. Having said that, the brush that is provided is perfect for application of the serum to your eyelashes which, like brows, respond to the same formulas to encourage retention of existing lashes and brows and promote growth of new ones. I have been using this product nightly for nearly two months now and definitely see a bit of noticeable growth in my lashes and some growth, though not as noticeable, in my brows. Part of that could be due to the slow rate of growth of eyebrows and part could be due to the uneven application on my eyebrows with the small liner like application brush. I will continue to use the product until it is finished but will definitely be looking for a serum with a spoolie style applicator for my next brow growth serum.\nBetter for a lash serum than brows ... but it\u2019s workable\nL'ANGE HAIR Rubber Sectioning Hair Clips | Narrow-Tipped Design | For Parting & Sectioning Hair | Easy Grip Handles | Professional Styling Results | 6-Pack (Blush)\nL'ANGE HAIR\n{'Brand': \"L'ANGE HAIR\", 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Color': 'Blush', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Embellishment': 'Bow', 'Package Dimensions': '8.46 x 5.71 x 1.14 inches; 2.89 Ounces', 'Item model number': '2323', 'UPC': '810108190585', 'Manufacturer': \"L'ANGE HAIR\"}\nStyling your hair when it comes to curling or straightening it can sometimes be difficult as the thicker your hair is, the less effective a hot tool can be.
