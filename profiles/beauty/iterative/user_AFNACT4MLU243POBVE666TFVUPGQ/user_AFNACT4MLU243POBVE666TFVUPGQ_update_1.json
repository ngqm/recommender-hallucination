I now have 4 Sigma brushes and all four are of outstanding quality. This little brush does exactly  what Sigma's website says it will do (see the video on their site) and I highly recommend it. I no longer see any reason to pay $40 and up for one makeup brush when Sigma offers such a large variety of brushes at half the price!\nReview Title: Another win for Sigma\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
