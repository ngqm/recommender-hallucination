I've only tried it once and it stayed put for 24 hrs, even though a shower! Now that's what I call really waterproof! I don't normally sleep in makeup of any kind but wanted to give it an \"all night\" durability test. Woke up the next morning....was still there! Expected at least some \"mascara\" marks on my pillowcase but there was nary a mark. But my biggest surprise came when I awoke without \"racoon eyes\"!!! I usually wear \"tubing\" mascaras as other formulas end up under my eyes within a few hours, I actually expected this mascara to do the same.<br /><br />Volume and length? It definitely added length.  I use Latisse so my lashes have stayed long as I've aged and this mascara provided additional length.  As to volume,  not so much.  However, I only used one coat so it may indeed give the volume advertised with another coat. I really did not notice any \"fibers\" and being a lens wearer perhaps that's not a bad thing.  The formula is not thick so it applies smoothly without leaving clumps. It was fairly easy to remove  with a cotton pad soaked in micro-cellular water.  All in all, if you are looking for staying power this mascara is worthy of a try.<br /><br />The packaging is unique! Hans Holbein's portrait of a young Princess Elizabeth [later Queen Elizabeth I] just caught my eye. I found the square shape vs round tube a lot easier to hold and the brush is a standard design found on many other mascara brands.\nReview Title: WORTHY OF A TRY FOR STAYING POWER ALONE PLUS- No Racoon Eyes!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Sigma 3DHD - Precision Brush - Pink\n{'Skin Type': 'All', 'Item Form': 'Wand', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Ferrule Material': 'Brass', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '2 x 1 x 8 inches', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2 x 1 x 8 inches; 0.35 Ounces', 'Item model number': '3DP02'}\nThis is another great brush from Sigma! I now have 4 Sigma brushes and all four are of outstanding quality. This little brush does exactly  what Sigma's website says it will do (see the video on their site) and I highly recommend it. I no longer see any reason to pay $40 and up for one makeup brush when Sigma offers such a large variety of brushes at half the price!\nAnother win for Sigma\nR-NEU 200 Cotton Rounds, 100% Natural Turkish Cotton Makeup Remover and Facial Cleansing Cotton Round Pads, Waffle Textured Hypoallergenic Cotton Wipes, 2.25 Inch Diameter (200 Pack)\nR-NEU\n{'Size': '2.25 Inch (Pack of 200)', 'Brand': 'R-NEU', 'Material': 'Cotton', 'Product Benefits': 'Cleansing', 'Shape': 'Round', 'Package Dimensions': '9.17 x 4.8 x 2.28 inches; 3.77 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'yhua8a-654', 'UPC': '696292837730', 'Manufacturer': 'R-NEU'}\nSwisspers is my usual brand but for some strange reason I decided to give these a try. They're \"ok\" ...they are soft and absorbent but they tend to shed fibers even when wet. As I use these around my eye area that is not a good thing! Will return to my usual rounds.\nJUST OK\n4D Silk Fiber Lash Mascara Black, Natural Waterproof Mascara Extra Long Lash,Thick Thickening and Lengthening, No Clumping, No Smudging, Lasting Voluminous Eyelashes Dramatic Extension Mascara\nSIKEMAY\n{'Color': 'Black', 'Special Feature': 'Smudge Proof, Non Clumping', 'Brand': 'SIKEMAY', 'Specialty': 'Waterproof, Hypoallergenic', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '8.9 x 4 x 1.1 inches; 2.57 Ounces', 'UPC': '764690676852', 'Manufacturer': 'SIKEMAY'}\nFirst off I wear contact lens and so far I've had no adverse reaction.
