  "reference_summary": "Biutee Nail Mirror Powder4 Boxes 8 Colors 0.5g with 4 Brushes Nail Chameleon Powder Nail Glitter Nail Chrome Powder Manicure Unicorn Chrome Pigments\nBiutee\n{'Package Dimensions': '5.63 x 5.59 x 1.97 inches; 0.02 Ounces'}\nI had never tried decorative nail powder before ; in fact never even heard of this product so was curious to give it a go and so glad that I did!! Its super easy to use and creates some really cool effects with relative ease.<br /><br />In a nutshell, you use it with gel nail colors: Apply your basecoat, color (this suggests plain black or white for the best  effects) then top coat. Do not use rubbing alcohol at this point as you would typically do, but instead apply the powder, which is just like eyeshadow with an eyeshadow type applicator then seal with one last coat of gel top coat.<br /><br />It has a chrome like effect and blends nicely , to create all kinds of effects. It is  very easy to use, much easier than gel nail polish itself and can even hide imperfections! Love it !!\nLove this powder ! So easy to use and create unique fun effects\nPursoma Beyond The Body After the Class Post Workout Soak, 9 oz\nPursoma\n{'Brand': 'Pursoma', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Stress Relief,Anti-inflammatory,Pain Relief,Cleansing,Pore', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Unit Count': '1.0 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Product Dimensions': '7.5 x 5 x 7.5 inches; 9.24 Ounces', 'UPC': '857525007096'}\nOn the fence on this product for one reason: price!! Don't get me wrong - I love a good bath and maybe I am crazy but I will pay up to $20 to my favorite retailer for their beautiful CBD bath bombs (which yes, also includes a crystal)  but as an avid bath salt user from basic to boutique; I cannot for the life of me understand what is in this product that justifies that price point. I compared to some of my premium brands too; just to see what this might have that they don't<br /><br />After a long spin class followed by 30 minutes of strength workouts I was feeling the muscle burn so I added this to my bath and soaked for 20 minutes. The smell is not my favorite but it is one I am used to from some of the other brands I use and it is consistent with the natural ingredients. It is hard to define but I would say it has an almost clinical smell.  It reminds me of a very clean hospital - not bad, just not my personal favorite scent. That said, they do use all natural ingredients so for that I am willing to pay more and I will say it was very relaxing, and helped with the muscle soreness.<br /><br />You do also get a rather large crystal in the bag -I like crystals but here is a watch out just in case you are not bothered one way or another - the crystal weighed 1oz so you are getting 8oz salts which is enough for one bath with 1/9 of the bag weight being taken up by the crystal.<br /><br />Now to be fair, the ingredient list does show all natural with no fillers that you might see in cheaper products such as coconut oil or unsourced scents and I really do feel crazy relaxed after this bath! Just wish it was maybe enough for 2/3 baths !!\nVery relaxing, all natural. Clinical but clean scent. Pricey for size!\nAtlas Semi Matte Texture Putty | Medium Shine | Medium Hold | Thickening | Texturizing | Defining | Styling and Grooming Product for Men and Women | For All Hair Types\nAtlas\n{'Hair Type': 'Coarse, Wavy, Curly', 'Scent': 'Masculine', 'Liquid Volume': '70 Milliliters', 'Item Form': 'Clay', 'Brand': 'Atlas', 'Product Dimensions': '2.95 x 2.95 x 1.18 inches; 2.57 Ounces', 'UPC': '854659007237'}\nHas a great scent so that\u2019s the first thing I noticed. Smells masculine like a fresh cologne but certainly not overpowering . Scent mutes a little once applied so it still smells nice but won\u2019t bother you either .<br /><br />Has a nice amount of hold and it\u2019s a good semi matte with just a hint of shine. It has a good amount of hold that is buildable with the right amount of product and it washes out easily with no residue.<br /><br />Impressed and would buy again\nGreat since and buildable hold !\nLittle Moon Essentials Floral Bath & Shower Sugar Exfoliant, Relax, 2 oz.\nLittle Moon Essentials\n{'Brand': 'Little Moon Essentials', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Product Benefits': 'Exfoliating', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Material Type Free': 'preservative free,paraben free', 'Package Dimensions': '2.2 x 2.2 x 1.3 inches; 2 Ounces', 'UPC': '673673882459'}\nI love this.
