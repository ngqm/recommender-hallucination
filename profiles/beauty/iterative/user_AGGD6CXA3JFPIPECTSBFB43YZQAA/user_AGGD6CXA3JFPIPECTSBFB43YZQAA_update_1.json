Its super easy to use and creates some really cool effects with relative ease.<br /><br />In a nutshell, you use it with gel nail colors: Apply your basecoat, color (this suggests plain black or white for the best  effects) then top coat. Do not use rubbing alcohol at this point as you would typically do, but instead apply the powder, which is just like eyeshadow with an eyeshadow type applicator then seal with one last coat of gel top coat.<br /><br />It has a chrome like effect and blends nicely , to create all kinds of effects. It is  very easy to use, much easier than gel nail polish itself and can even hide imperfections! Love it !!\nReview Title: Love this powder ! So easy to use and create unique fun effects\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
