I really like the length of the bristles and the curve of the scrubber, perfect for my back. It\u2019s easy to switch out the different scrub heads.\nReview Title: Great for my sensitive skin as weekly exfoliator\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "96 Pieces Glossy False Nails Oval Rhinestone Full Cover False Nails Pink Color Changing Gradient Short Artificial Nail Tips with 4 Pieces Nail Glue for Women Girls Nail DIY Decorations\nBBTO\n{'Material': 'Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS)', 'Brand': 'BBTO', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Glossy', 'Number of Pieces': '4, 96', 'Package Dimensions': '11.5 x 7.32 x 0.5 inches; 1.59 Ounces'}\nYou get what you pay for. The nails are pretty thin and that\u2019s only alright for the short length, not medium which these are. There is only enough nails in each set for me to get both hands once. The others are wasted. I put the gradient color on first as it was the least trouble for this mommy of 4. All the others would REQUIRE a clear top coat. Jus touching the gold glitter n it started coming off. This gradient color could use a top coat to help it last longer but it\u2019s fine. And before asking, I didnt bother trying the nail glue it comes with. If the nails aren\u2019t great I wouldn\u2019t trust the glue. For my regular fake nails I will stick with my short rounded French tips that are thicker and more durable than these. If I want something with color for a night or 2, I might put one of the others on. While I probably won\u2019t buy these ever again they aren\u2019t bad, jus not that good either to waste more of my money for another batch.<br />Edited review update: last pic is of my broken nail. It lasted 5 hours. Then I trimmed all my nails down n 5 more nails went the following day. There is no salvaging them either. It all split down the middle n not a small split either. It went almost through n just fell apart. And so I drop my ratings from 3 stars to 1. If I could give 0, I would.\nCheap and that\u2019s the quality too\nDROP THE BOMB Bbosong Sun Stick SPF50+ PA++++ 15g - Oil Free UVA/UVB Protection Sebum Control Skin Smooth Moisturizing Sunblock Stick Balm without Sticky, Primer before Makeup\nDROP THE BOMB\n{'Sun Protection': '50 SPF', 'Item Weight': '15 Grams', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Brand': 'DROP THE BOMB', 'Package Dimensions': '3.5 x 1.7 x 1.1 inches; 0.53 Ounces'}\nWhen they say hypoallergenic, reef friendly, made with vegan ingredients, and calming natural ingredients I think it must be okay to order. But they don\u2019t list their ingredients so I wasn\u2019t sure if I should. And now I know why they don\u2019t. I posted a picture of the ingredients if you would like to look them up yourself. The top half of the ingredients which take up most of what it is made of is made of: polyethylene(man made plastic), a chemical, acrylic or plexiglass, a few man made silicones, and chemical fragrances(some of them are really long words so I just put down the laymans terms.) I stopped looking it up at that point. I\u2019m not putting this on as I\u2019m allergic to a few of the ingredients. Hope this helps.\nThey don\u2019t list ingredients but I have a picture of it\nNatwag Makeup Remover Pads,18 Pack 3.74 Inch Reusable Microfiber Cleansing Pad with Laundry Bag Suitable for All Skin Types,3 Color Facial Cleansing Pad Set.\nNatwag\n{'Brand': 'Natwag', 'Skin Type': 'All Skin,Dry', 'Material Feature': 'Reusable', 'Unit Count': '18.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '18', 'Package Dimensions': '4.4 x 4.37 x 2.59 inches; 3.84 Ounces', 'UPC': '745103569701'}\nI use these with my micellar water for my makeup removal and it works great. It was really easy to hand wash. I love that it comes with its own laundry bag if I choose to throw it in the washer. 18 pack, for the price ($10) is a steal!\nSo soft and easy to hand wash\nAmtidy Solid Color Vintage Modern Style Elastic Women's Rhinestone Crown Tiara, Bridal Wedding Dance Party Birthday Party Women's Headband Tiara, Queen Tiara With Comb\uff08Silver\uff09\nAmtidy\n{'Material': 'Rubber', 'Fabric Type': 'Elastic', 'Brand': 'Amtidy', 'Item Form': 'Spiral', 'Unit Count': '10.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '11.65 x 5.63 x 3.23 inches; 12.03 Ounces', 'UPC': '782931993780'}\nI use these to get my hair out of the way for washing my face, gym time, and just to wear out. Variety of colors make it easy to match to my clothes. Fits my head good and stays on.\nGood variety of color\nBiutee Poly Nail Gel Kit 15ml 0.53oz Pink Nail Extension Gel Builder Gel Long Lasting Nail Salon Nail Art Design DIY at Home Beginner Friendly\u2026\nBiutee\n{'Package Dimensions': '3.5 x 2 x 1.5 inches; 0.81 Ounces'}\nThis is just the poly gel. In order to use this for long nails you need nail forms, a solution, a container for the solution, and the brush with scrapper, and the UV lamp. Also the base coat and most likely a nail drill and some nails files (not shown in picture). ***Important*** You have to use a gel nail base coat before the poly gel in order for it to stick, otherwise they will pop off. If you don\u2019t have these things, I would suggest you don\u2019t get this for the first time. There are nail kits for that. And lots of YouTube videos to show how to do it. It\u2019s how I learned to do mine. With a full set of long nails, and enough for extra nails and some fills, this one bottle could last for at least a couple months. This is a good amount of product for a reasonable price. $7 for nails for a couple months. And this nice color looks beautiful. It\u2019s hardy nails like acrylic and gel nail polish in one.\nBeautiful saloon nails\nBiutee Starry Sky Nail Gel Firework Nail Gel With black Nail Polish Gel 8ml UV LED\nBiutee\n{'Brand': 'Biutee', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'Gel', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '3.5274 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Liquid Volume': '0.27 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '4.92 x 3.31 x 1.77 inches; 4.59 Ounces'}\nThis is a complete set, not a full kit. There is a big difference. Saying that this is everything you need to make the nails if you have everything else. That means you already have the UV lamp, the base and top coat, and the solution and brush kit. From my experience, this kit is not for beginners. The glitter set aka starry sky set is messy and requires a lot of filing similar to biutees cat eye set. By hand, but filing with a nail drill is better. I was trying different looks to see if I can make some awesome looking Halloween (witchy) looking nails. This set alone is not it though. I might try experimenting with mixing this with biutees poly gels that might make it better and more manageable.\nComplete set not for beginners\nGlitter Poly Nail Gel Extensions Builder Gel UV/LED Soak Off Acrylic Fashion Gel Polish Set for Nails Beginner DIY Nail Art at Home 8 colors-15g (Pink series)\nMIZHSE\n{'Brand': 'MIZHSE', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '478.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '9', 'Package Dimensions': '9.76 x 4.88 x 1.42 inches; 12.8 Ounces'}\nFirst picture is the after, after a lot of work. Don\u2019t let it fool you. Second picture is to just show that this white is really an off white, milky white. Third picture is 2 days later where 2 popped off. The next day the ring finger one broke in half. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f This is my 7th set(of different sets and brands of polygel trying to find the best). Not my first rodeo. I know what I\u2019m doing with polygels. Am I a professional? Nope. Just a mom doing my own nails at home. I love polygels as it gives me beautiful salon nails from home and can stand the abuse a regular mom can put it through (like cleaning and washing dishes without gloves,etc).<br /> I tried 4 different colors. They gave me an insight about the quality of this set. You only see 3 colors in the first pic, I know. But that\u2019s because the clear is what I originally tried ( I really did try) to put on my middle finger instead of one of the glitters. Putting this set in the forms(I don\u2019t use the forms from this set as I don\u2019t like them), using solution to spread it in the forms was like any other polygel I\u2019ve used. It\u2019s when I turned it over and put it on my nails did something different happen. It basically started to ooze out of the forms way more than normal,it was getting messy. Putting it under the uv lamp to set it quickly. But as it was setting under the lamp the nails were falling a bit and setting that way. But it was the \u201cclear\u201d color that was the worst of the bunch. Oozed out so fast that it was un-salvageable. The way it oozed made me think of Buitee\u2019s Starry sky set. But at least those were the specialty set, their regular ones were SOLID(even if I didn\u2019t like some of the colors, that\u2019s nothing on their quality). This set will probably work on nails like polish or something, but I love using the nail forms and this just doesn\u2019t work, and didn\u2019t stay ON. I don\u2019t recommend this.\nWorst polygel I\u2019ve used yet\nHylunia Hydrate Body Wash - Energizing Blend With Mango 8.5 oz\nHylunia\n{'Product Dimensions': '2 x 2 x 5 inches; 11.22 Ounces', 'Item model number': '059ENM-250-R', 'UPC': '185449000313'}\nSmells like fermented mango....like a mango daiquiri....definitely not what I expected it to smell like lol. At the time of my order, it was priced about $20. I\u2019m glad they dropped it as I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth that much. Very much a gentle cleanser, not so much good for a lather. I\u2019m actual surprised this is a body wash. I think it has the consistency of a cream facial cleanser, and the bottle looks like one as well. And after a few uses trying it as a body wash and not really liking it, I really only use it on my face now. I don\u2019t think I would reorder this.\nIt\u2019s alright-more better as a facial cream cleanser\nFollain Everybody Bar Soap | Lavender & Bergamot, Skin Moisturizing Hand & Body Cleanser with Shea Butter, Argan Oil, Hydrate for Softer Skin, Non-Drying, Rich-Lather, Cruelty Free, 5 oz\nFollain\n{'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Brand': 'Follain', 'Scent': 'Bergamot,Lavender', 'Material Feature': 'Cru, Non GMO, Dermatologist Tested', 'Product Dimensions': '3.75 x 2.25 x 1 inches; 5.11 Ounces', 'Item model number': '692764483009', 'UPC': '692764483009'}\nThis is a big bar of soap, and that helps mitigate the high cost of a single bar of soap if you feel like splurging. It smells nice and lathers really well by itself, with a cloth, sponge or a brush. Gives a nice clean feel but it does feel like it strips my skin a bit more than I would like.\nBig bar of soap\nBalance White Mud Balancing Mask by Au Natural Skinfood | Rotorua Exfoliating Mask with 16+ Manuka Honey | Certified | Food For Your Skin | All Skin Types | Made in New Zealand | 1.7 oz\nA\u00da NATURAL SKINFOOD\n{'Brand': 'A\u00da NATURAL SKINFOOD', 'Item Form': 'Mask', 'Product Benefits': 'Exfoliates,Hydrates,Exfoliating', 'Scent': 'Honey', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Product Dimensions': '9.65 x 6.1 x 1.77 inches; 1.7 Ounces'}\nPretty costly for such a small amount. I got 3 masks out of this small container, so that about $13 per mask. There was a lack of safety seal on mine which makes me question the product. Did I see a big difference between this expensive mask and one that costs less? Nope, not even alittle difference. While I do like companies that are about being all natural, there are cheaper options that do the same. Very unlikely I would reorder this.\nSmall amount an expensive mask\nNAILGIL Poly Nail Gel (Temperature)\nNAIL GIL\n{'Brand': 'NAIL GIL', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'gel', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '9.45 x 4.72 x 1.18 inches'}\nI like this set. The base and top coat work great with the poly gels. I\u2019ve also tried it with other sets of base and top coats and it works fine with those too. The sets lasted a few weeks no problems. The only thing that I\u2019m not a fan of, is the colors. It supposed to be the color that it is on the tube. I find that the colors look a bit different from the tube to the dot that I made on the stick, and then even bigger difference on my nails. For instance, the red tube. Looks like a lighter red on the dot. Then on my hands, it turned red orange(not color changing either). I didn\u2019t finish with a top coat before I took a picture because I didn\u2019t like the color at all and I ended up painting it over with gel nail polish. Really that\u2019s the only on with such a big difference. The others are not a big difference but a bit more sheer than I expected. It is still good quality, so if you like the colors then this set is for you. A bit on the expensive side for the amount of poly gels you get, and I\u2019m not a big fan of the colors so I wouldn\u2019t reorder this.\nGood beginners set but a bit expensive\nKPOKPO 2021 NEW - Soft Shower Body Brush \uff0cBack Scrubber Soft Bristles Bath Brush\uff0c 3 in 1 Foldable Bath Brush Exfoliating Brush with Long Handle Body Brush Lotion Applicator and Massager\nKPOKPO\n{'Material': 'Sponge,Plastic,Nylon', 'Brand': 'KPOKPO', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '19.18 x 3.14 x 0.82 inches', 'Product Benefits': 'Softening,Nourishing,Clean,Exfoliating', 'Operation Mode': 'Manual', 'Product Dimensions': '19.18 x 3.14 x 0.82 inches; 13.44 Ounces', 'UPC': '712491891110', 'Manufacturer': 'ProOrganic'}\nAs I mentioned, I have sensitive skin.
