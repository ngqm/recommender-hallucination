  "reference_summary": "96 Pieces Glossy False Nails Oval Rhinestone Full Cover False Nails Pink Color Changing Gradient Short Artificial Nail Tips with 4 Pieces Nail Glue for Women Girls Nail DIY Decorations\nBBTO\n{'Material': 'Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS)', 'Brand': 'BBTO', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Glossy', 'Number of Pieces': '4, 96', 'Package Dimensions': '11.5 x 7.32 x 0.5 inches; 1.59 Ounces'}\nYou get what you pay for. The nails are pretty thin and that\u2019s only alright for the short length, not medium which these are. There is only enough nails in each set for me to get both hands once. The others are wasted. I put the gradient color on first as it was the least trouble for this mommy of 4. All the others would REQUIRE a clear top coat. Jus touching the gold glitter n it started coming off. This gradient color could use a top coat to help it last longer but it\u2019s fine. And before asking, I didnt bother trying the nail glue it comes with. If the nails aren\u2019t great I wouldn\u2019t trust the glue. For my regular fake nails I will stick with my short rounded French tips that are thicker and more durable than these. If I want something with color for a night or 2, I might put one of the others on. While I probably won\u2019t buy these ever again they aren\u2019t bad, jus not that good either to waste more of my money for another batch.<br />Edited review update: last pic is of my broken nail. It lasted 5 hours. Then I trimmed all my nails down n 5 more nails went the following day. There is no salvaging them either. It all split down the middle n not a small split either. It went almost through n just fell apart. And so I drop my ratings from 3 stars to 1. If I could give 0, I would.\nCheap and that\u2019s the quality too\nDROP THE BOMB Bbosong Sun Stick SPF50+ PA++++ 15g - Oil Free UVA/UVB Protection Sebum Control Skin Smooth Moisturizing Sunblock Stick Balm without Sticky, Primer before Makeup\nDROP THE BOMB\n{'Sun Protection': '50 SPF', 'Item Weight': '15 Grams', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Brand': 'DROP THE BOMB', 'Package Dimensions': '3.5 x 1.7 x 1.1 inches; 0.53 Ounces'}\nWhen they say hypoallergenic, reef friendly, made with vegan ingredients, and calming natural ingredients I think it must be okay to order. But they don\u2019t list their ingredients so I wasn\u2019t sure if I should. And now I know why they don\u2019t. I posted a picture of the ingredients if you would like to look them up yourself. The top half of the ingredients which take up most of what it is made of is made of: polyethylene(man made plastic), a chemical, acrylic or plexiglass, a few man made silicones, and chemical fragrances(some of them are really long words so I just put down the laymans terms.) I stopped looking it up at that point. I\u2019m not putting this on as I\u2019m allergic to a few of the ingredients. Hope this helps.\nThey don\u2019t list ingredients but I have a picture of it\nNatwag Makeup Remover Pads,18 Pack 3.74 Inch Reusable Microfiber Cleansing Pad with Laundry Bag Suitable for All Skin Types,3 Color Facial Cleansing Pad Set.\nNatwag\n{'Brand': 'Natwag', 'Skin Type': 'All Skin,Dry', 'Material Feature': 'Reusable', 'Unit Count': '18.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '18', 'Package Dimensions': '4.4 x 4.37 x 2.59 inches; 3.84 Ounces', 'UPC': '745103569701'}\nI use these with my micellar water for my makeup removal and it works great.
