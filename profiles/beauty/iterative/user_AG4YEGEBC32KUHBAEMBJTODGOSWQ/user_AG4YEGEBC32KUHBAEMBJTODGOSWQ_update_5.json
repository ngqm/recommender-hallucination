This is not true. My hair is very thin and with any type of hair tie I have to tie it at least three times. I cannot make this hair clip wrap around and stay wrapped around my thin ponytail. I can do this at the end of a braid with less hair. It is cute but it is difficult to make it stay closed.\nReview Title: Cannot stay closed around a ponytail\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
