This is not true. My hair is very thin and with any type of hair tie I have to tie it at least three times. I cannot make this hair clip wrap around and stay wrapped around my thin ponytail. I can do this at the end of a braid with less hair. It is cute but it is difficult to make it stay closed.\nDifficult to make this stay closed\ninvisibobble Pink Ball Hair Ties with Coil, TWINS Prima Ballerina - Ponytail Holder - No Damage, Wrap and Twist - Pain-Free Hair Accessories for Girls and Women - Gentle for Girls Teens and Thick Hair\ninvisibobble\n{'Color': 'Prima Ballerina', 'Item Form': 'Spiral', 'Brand': 'Invisibobble', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '1.97 x 0.87 x 1.85 inches', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Language': 'Spanish', 'Product Dimensions': '1.97 x 0.87 x 1.85 inches; 0.32 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'IB-TW', 'Manufacturer': 'invisibobble'}\nThe pictures on this product make it seem like you can use this bobby hair tie in a ponytail.

I feel like the wand itself makes it messier to apply because you are just rubbing it on your hair instead of brushing it to catch all the flyaways. The gel itself works well but you just have to apply a little more pressure with the wand to get it to go where you want to go.\nGood hold\nBABOR Power Serum Ampoule: Beta Glucan | Calms, Strengthens, Soothes | 2D Hyaluronic Acid & Microsilver | Clean & Vegan | Visible Results in 7 Days\nBabor\n{'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Product Benefits': 'Instantly calms, strengthens & soothes complexion while providing intense hydration.
