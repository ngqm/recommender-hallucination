But this body wash altered my perspective a bit. One small pump of this body wash covers your entire body. Is that not cost effective or what? The consistency of the soap it self is very dense and thick and not droopy and watery like most body washes out-there. The smell lingers for a few hours until you bathe again so its like wearing a perfume without a perfume (if you like the scent of course). The foam is also very rich if using this soap with a sponge. Sadly, everything about this product on the label (beside the name) is in Korean. But would totally recommend and acquire again in the future.\nReview Title: Very luxurious foaming wash and scent...\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "4D Silk Fiber Lash Mascara Black, Natural Waterproof Mascara Extra Long Lash,Thick Thickening and Lengthening, No Clumping, No Smudging, Lasting Voluminous Eyelashes Dramatic Extension Mascara\nSIKEMAY\n{'Color': 'Black', 'Special Feature': 'Smudge Proof, Non Clumping', 'Brand': 'SIKEMAY', 'Specialty': 'Waterproof, Hypoallergenic', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '8.9 x 4 x 1.1 inches; 2.57 Ounces', 'UPC': '764690676852', 'Manufacturer': 'SIKEMAY'}\nThe mascara is packaged in a very pretty box and tube. Very unusual and I haven't seen mascaras like this one before which makes it very visually appealing. The wand is silicone or rubbery. The mascara is very black and bold on the lashes (I have brown lashes and it pops in color). The fibers are there, there are very many of them and wand builds on those fibers very very well with every application stroke. There are two things that make me uncomfortable about this mascara. First is the smell of it. It is a very strong / pungent chemical smell that does not smell like your average mascara from a drug or department store. Second, it is made in China. Maybe I am paranoid, but learning a little of how cheap cosmetics are made oversees, the smell reminds me of all the descriptions from those documentaries. On the bright side (aside the smell), my eyes did not sting upon application, the mascara did not shed, and removing it (although it is waterproof) was very easy with regular miscellar water and a cotton pad. Because of the smell, not a product I would purchase again or give as a gift. But overall very pretty and definitely builds the length + volume with the fibers that are part of the mascara.\nPretty and lots of fibers but smells funky\nBouquet Garni Body Shower White Musk - Unique Fragrance Decanting Engineering Method gives Long Lasting Rich Fragrance - Gentle and Mild Cleansing Scented Body Wash with Natural Surfactant 17.85 Fl Oz\nBouquet Garni\n{'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Skin Type': 'All, Dry', 'Brand': 'Bouquet Garni', 'Scent': 'Garni', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '8.23 x 6.34 x 3.66 inches; 1.34 Pounds'}\nI don't typically like musk as its very strong and powdery..
