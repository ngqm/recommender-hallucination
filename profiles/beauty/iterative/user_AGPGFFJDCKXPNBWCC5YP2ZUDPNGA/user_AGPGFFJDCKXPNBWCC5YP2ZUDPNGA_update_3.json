It does an exceptional job of breaking down mascara. The best part of this product comes from continued use! Eyelashes become darker, shinier and a lot healthier. I've noticed less breakage and fall down after introducing this product into my skin care routine. I'm hoping to see some growth soon. I gave up on trying to use one of those so-called miracle eyelash serums because it burned my eyes so bad. This Mia Adora oil does not burn if you get it in your eyes, it just makes your vision blurry for a while. I was fortunate to have purchased this item with a promotional discount for the purpose of testing and review. I like the way it effectively breaks down and removes eye makeup. It's gentle on the delicate eye area and it's fragrance free. You can use this oil as a conditioning treatment alone, just a drop or two for each eye, and the bottle will last you a good while.\nThe Mia Adore castor oil blend your lashes will love\nTinksky Nail Art Stamping Printing Plate Manicure Stamping Image Plate Templates with Stamp Pack of 10 (Silver)\n{'Package Dimensions': '6.1 x 3.6 x 1.2 inches; 8 Ounces', 'UPC': '889736846560'}\nI love to use nail stamping in my manicures. It is fairly easy to learn how to do, it's incredibly fun and really can amp up the look of your nails. The downside of all that is it can get expensive!! This 11 piece set from Tinksky is a great value for all that you get, and is perfect for anyone that either wants to try it out -or- wants to build up a variety of images. Granted, there aren't any examples shown of the stamping plates that you'll get, so that's a little bit of a mystery. If you don't mind that, I do recommend this set!!<br />Attached are photos of the plates that I received... I am super happy to have the images that I received and although I don't love the stamper, it is nice to have!! Keep in mind that you may have to experiment with your technique and try different polishes with these plates. Just because you may not get an image to pickup on the first or second try does not mean that the plate is trash. Not all stamper heads and polishes will work together nicely from plate to plate. Having said all that, I have had pretty good experiences using these and I am a beginner.<br />I was given a promotional discount on my purchase in exchange for my review.<br />Would I buy it again at full price? You bet!! Would I recommend it to a friend? Absolutely!!<br />***IMAGES IN MY SET (IN ORDER OF APPEARANCE)***<br />1. Ocean Elements<br />2. Butterflies/Flowers<br />3. Garden Scenery (Full Plate Buffet Style Image)<br />4. Shoe Couture<br />5. Horse & Carriage (Full Plate Buffet Style Image) Moyou London knockoff<br />6. French Motifs<br />7. Easter Icons<br />8.
