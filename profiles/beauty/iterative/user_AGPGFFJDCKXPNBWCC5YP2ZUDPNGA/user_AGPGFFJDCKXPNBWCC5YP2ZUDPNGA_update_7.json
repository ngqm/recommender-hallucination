It has much better coverage, and a thicker consistency than any other BB's I've used (which, until now, have all been Western brands). It almost covers like a foundation, but feels extremely lightweight like a BB. It does dry down really fast, and it was a bit darker than I expected. I am light neutral in complexion and chose the shade \"light beige\". I believe I was able to make the color work for me, but I'm not sure if it'll suit all light skin tones. \ud83d\udc7b<br /><br />This BB has a beautiful satin matte finish, but did have a tendency to cling to my dry patches, so be sure to start with an exfoliated, well moisturized, and primed face. I did not use any primer with this product, (since it's marketed as a BB cream), and without the aid of a pore filling primer this product did eventually settle into my fine lines & large pores. I am really impressed with the staying power of this product though, even without primer & setting spray! After a full day of masking against covid in the South Florida heat, there was no transfer to my face mask. \ud83d\ude03 That's a huge, HUGE plus! With that being said, I highly recommend using a really good cleanser to efficiently remove this product at the end of the day.<br /><br />PROS:<br />+ Great coverage that can be built up<br />+ Very lightweight on the skin<br />+ Excellent staying power<br />+ SPF 50<br />+ Transfer resistant! \ud83d\ude4c<br />+ No photo flashback!<br />+ Fragrance free!<br />+ 1.67 oz of product (vs. the U.S. standard 1 fl. oz)<br />+ 2 sample hair care products included as a bonus! \u2764<br />+ Convenient PRIME Shipping<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Dries very fast and can be difficult to blend<br />- Clings to dry patches<br />- Settles into pores & wrinkles (without primer)<br /><br />TO BE CONSIDERED:<br />* Warm yellow undertone may not suit everyone<br /><br />Side Note: There was one other thing I wanted to mention... When I took the manufacturer safety seal off of the tube, I had a volcanic eruption of BB cream that I wasn't prepared for, which made a mess of my tube. If you're like me and don't want to waste precious product, just be aware that it might come spilling out like lava when you break the product seal. \ud83d\ude43\nReview Title: Transfer resistant formula \ud83d\ude37 with excellent coverage!

It does an exceptional job of breaking down mascara. The best part of this product comes from continued use! Eyelashes become darker, shinier and a lot healthier. I've noticed less breakage and fall down after introducing this product into my skin care routine. I'm hoping to see some growth soon. I gave up on trying to use one of those so-called miracle eyelash serums because it burned my eyes so bad. This Mia Adora oil does not burn if you get it in your eyes, it just makes your vision blurry for a while. I was fortunate to have purchased this item with a promotional discount for the purpose of testing and review. I like the way it effectively breaks down and removes eye makeup. It's gentle on the delicate eye area and it's fragrance free. You can use this oil as a conditioning treatment alone, just a drop or two for each eye, and the bottle will last you a good while.\nThe Mia Adore castor oil blend your lashes will love\nTinksky Nail Art Stamping Printing Plate Manicure Stamping Image Plate Templates with Stamp Pack of 10 (Silver)\n{'Package Dimensions': '6.1 x 3.6 x 1.2 inches; 8 Ounces', 'UPC': '889736846560'}\nI love to use nail stamping in my manicures. It is fairly easy to learn how to do, it's incredibly fun and really can amp up the look of your nails. The downside of all that is it can get expensive!! This 11 piece set from Tinksky is a great value for all that you get, and is perfect for anyone that either wants to try it out -or- wants to build up a variety of images. Granted, there aren't any examples shown of the stamping plates that you'll get, so that's a little bit of a mystery. If you don't mind that, I do recommend this set!!<br />Attached are photos of the plates that I received... I am super happy to have the images that I received and although I don't love the stamper, it is nice to have!! Keep in mind that you may have to experiment with your technique and try different polishes with these plates. Just because you may not get an image to pickup on the first or second try does not mean that the plate is trash. Not all stamper heads and polishes will work together nicely from plate to plate. Having said all that, I have had pretty good experiences using these and I am a beginner.<br />I was given a promotional discount on my purchase in exchange for my review.<br />Would I buy it again at full price? You bet!! Would I recommend it to a friend? Absolutely!!<br />***IMAGES IN MY SET (IN ORDER OF APPEARANCE)***<br />1. Ocean Elements<br />2. Butterflies/Flowers<br />3.

It does not file the nail nor does it impart any shine whatsoever. Seriously, go to your local beauty supply store and get a 4way buffer block for less than a dollar-- you'll get great results with that!!<br />I purchased this item with a promotional discount for the purpose of testing and review.\nWhat a dissapointment!!\nFluorescent Pink 4 Oz - Liquid Latex Body Paint, Ammonia Free No Odor, Easy On and Off, Cosplay Makeup, Creates Professional Monster, Zombie Arts\nLiquid Latex Fashions\n{'Color': 'Fluorescent Pink', 'Brand': 'Liquid Latex Fashions', 'Item Weight': '4 Ounces', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Package Information': 'Bottle', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '3 x 3 x 3 inches; 4 Ounces', 'Item model number': '010620aa', 'UPC': '811832016844', 'Manufacturer': 'Liquid Latex Fashions'}\nGood liquid latex is every nail artist's best friend. I decided to purchase this jar after using up my supply of prepared/bottled liquid latex varieties, and I am so glad I did. Prior to discovering Liquid Latex Fashions, I was buying liquid latex marketed as &#34;nail art tape&#34;. In terms of package price and the consistent quality of product, I find that this is the much better option. As long as I continue to stamp, water marble and do gradient nails I will continue to use THIS. Here are the highlights as to why I think Liquid Latex Fashions is superior to all the rest:<br /><br />* Package size is 4 ounces and an ample supply for simple nail art. It is smaller in real life than what it appears in the ad photos. I have been using this as my go-to for the past six months and have barely made a dent in it. I suspect that it will probably dry up before I can get through it all.<br />* Product is simple to decant - the large mouth on the jar makes it easy to use an infant medicine syringe to draw the liquid up and dispense into a clean nail polish bottle. (You can get the plastic medi syringes for free at the pharmacy counter - all you have to do is ask.)<br />* Consistency is thin/watery, which is easy to apply and dries very fast. It turns to a dark pink when it's dry. One layer works great for me, but you can add more layers if needed.<br />* It peels so good! Always a clean peel in one solid sheet - no bits and pieces of latex that break off. You can literally roll your fingertip across the edge and peel it off in one whole piece. No more fighting with latex removal after doing a gorgeous gradient!<br />* FYI: Ammonia free does not mean odorless. This product does not smell good at all. If you've used any type of liquid latex before, you know it does have a distinguishable smell. It is somewhere between fish oil and cat urine. Or a mixture of both. Yeah, it stinks to be perfectly honest. Just be forewarned.<br />* Pricing of this is so much more economical versus prepared varieties. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if some folks weren't just repackaging this and slapping their brand labels on it.<br />* The bonus to THIS particular liquid latex - it's black light reactive... so if you plan on going to an all-night rave anytime soon, you can wear this and you'll glow all night! lol ;)<br /><br />\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f<br />Highly recommended and I will most definitely repurchase when I hit tub bottom. Thanks for reading!<br /><br />Seriously though, one more thing - In order to keep the latex fresh and from drying up, you should make sure to wipe any excess latex from around the neck of the jar. Keep the lid screwed on tight when not in use, and store it in a cool dry place.\nAbsolutely the BEST for nail art and I've tried MANY!\n3Pcs Nail Gradient Sponges Brush Pens Kit, AKWOX 3 Differents UV Gel Nail Art Brush Gradient Ombre Brushes Double Head Nail Sponge Painting Pen with 4 Replacement Heads\nAKWOX\n{'Product Dimensions': '7.1 x 3.1 x 0.52 inches; 3.99 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'AK-OT051'}\nPrior to purchasing this, I did some comparison shopping and found that this set costs roughly the same price as if i were to buy the same products, direct from overseas, (but without the 3-4 week wait). The quality of each item is astounding, and was delivered with 2-day Prime shipping. I was a tad bit surprised at the size of the gradient sponges though. I've seen them used in \"Aeropuffing\" tutorials, and for some reason i thought they'd be bigger. In actuality, they are about the size of a nickel, (and obviously round in circumference). The sponges feature both round and slightly tapered tips, and the package includes 2 replacements of each. Both of the ombr\u00e8 brushes I received have adequate bristles, and the ferrules are securely attached. Every one of these items is exact to the ones you see being rebranded by big companies - without the hefty mark-up. I would definitely repurchase and I recommend this set without question! :)\nFantastic tools without the hefty mark-up!\n10Pack 2oz Plastic Empty Spray Bottle, Mostof Fine Mist Small Clear Travel Plastic Bottles Container with Funnels Labels\nMostof\n{'Brand': 'Mostof', 'Capacity': '2 Ounces', 'Special Feature': 'Mist Spray', 'Product Care Instructions': 'Hand Wash Only', 'Reusability': 'Reusable', 'Package Dimensions': '6.5 x 6.3 x 3.9 inches; 8.78 Ounces', 'UPC': '634715829481'}\nA spray bottle is a spray bottle, right? \ud83e\udd14 Lol, nope!<br /><br />So, here we are... shopping on Amazon, presented with a thousand options for something as simple as a bottle that sprays. \ud83d\ude30<br /><br />My selection criteria was this: (a) The plastic must be able to handle liquid sanitizer made with a base of 60% alcohol (the 91% ISP variety), *without suffering undesirable changes* and (b) Have a good spray nozzle capable of producing a fine, even mist *without getting clogged*.<br /><br />This set of bottles from MOSTOF checks both of those boxes. \u2714 I tested them specifically against 2 different types of liquid (not gel) sanitizer.  Initially, I chose this particular set for the larger sized funnels that are also included, and the fact that it comes with (10) travel sized bottles.<br /><br />None of my bottles leak and they spray a fine, even mist without leaving droplets.  After seeing the spray function in action, I decided to use a couple of these for facial mists and essences. I don't know (yet) whether they'll spray every last drop, but the sprayer feed wraps all the way around the bottom of the bottle, which does look promising. \ud83e\udd1e So far, every liquid I've put in them has been fine; the plastic didn't change and the sprays perform the same.<br /><br />Ultimately, I had to dock a star from my rating because the bottles came filthy inside, \ud83d\ude2c every one of them is heavily scratched up, and one of the bottles I received doesn't sit evenly. \u27a1\ufe0f(see photos 3&4: defect (warped) bottle is on the right)\u2b05\ufe0f<br /><br />PRO'S:<br />+ Contains everything you need to package liquids immediately<br />+ Includes larger sized funnels = quick flow in filling<br />+ Spray nozzles produce fine, even mist without leaving droplets<br />+ Sprayer feed goes all the way around the bottom of the bottle<br />+ No leaking from the bottle necks or spray nozzles<br />+ Spray nozzles have not clogged<br />+ Caps fit tightly<br />+ No adverse reactions to the plastic (re: high alcohol content)<br />+ Airline approved carry-on size<br />+ Excellent price for ten bottles (and two funnels!)<br />+ Convenient PRIME shipping<br />+ Bonus sheet of labels (they're small, but they work)<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Bottles came really scratched up and very dirty<br />- One of the ten bottles I received doesn't sit evenly<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />Ultimately, I think there's some quality control issues that the manufacturer could improve upon. As long as you're not an Etsy seller, or someone that's gonna be gifting these, you may not mind the scratches or the possibility of uneven bottom(s). Provided you wash them out really good, they still do the job! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc Should anything happen to change with these as time goes on, I will update this review. Thanks for reading!
