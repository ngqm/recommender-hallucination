The quality of each item is astounding, and was delivered with 2-day Prime shipping. I was a tad bit surprised at the size of the gradient sponges though. I've seen them used in \"Aeropuffing\" tutorials, and for some reason i thought they'd be bigger. In actuality, they are about the size of a nickel, (and obviously round in circumference). The sponges feature both round and slightly tapered tips, and the package includes 2 replacements of each. Both of the ombr\u00e8 brushes I received have adequate bristles, and the ferrules are securely attached. Every one of these items is exact to the ones you see being rebranded by big companies - without the hefty mark-up. I would definitely repurchase and I recommend this set without question! :)\nReview Title: Fantastic tools without the hefty mark-up!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

It does an exceptional job of breaking down mascara. The best part of this product comes from continued use! Eyelashes become darker, shinier and a lot healthier. I've noticed less breakage and fall down after introducing this product into my skin care routine. I'm hoping to see some growth soon. I gave up on trying to use one of those so-called miracle eyelash serums because it burned my eyes so bad. This Mia Adora oil does not burn if you get it in your eyes, it just makes your vision blurry for a while. I was fortunate to have purchased this item with a promotional discount for the purpose of testing and review. I like the way it effectively breaks down and removes eye makeup. It's gentle on the delicate eye area and it's fragrance free. You can use this oil as a conditioning treatment alone, just a drop or two for each eye, and the bottle will last you a good while.\nThe Mia Adore castor oil blend your lashes will love\nTinksky Nail Art Stamping Printing Plate Manicure Stamping Image Plate Templates with Stamp Pack of 10 (Silver)\n{'Package Dimensions': '6.1 x 3.6 x 1.2 inches; 8 Ounces', 'UPC': '889736846560'}\nI love to use nail stamping in my manicures. It is fairly easy to learn how to do, it's incredibly fun and really can amp up the look of your nails. The downside of all that is it can get expensive!! This 11 piece set from Tinksky is a great value for all that you get, and is perfect for anyone that either wants to try it out -or- wants to build up a variety of images. Granted, there aren't any examples shown of the stamping plates that you'll get, so that's a little bit of a mystery. If you don't mind that, I do recommend this set!!<br />Attached are photos of the plates that I received... I am super happy to have the images that I received and although I don't love the stamper, it is nice to have!! Keep in mind that you may have to experiment with your technique and try different polishes with these plates. Just because you may not get an image to pickup on the first or second try does not mean that the plate is trash. Not all stamper heads and polishes will work together nicely from plate to plate. Having said all that, I have had pretty good experiences using these and I am a beginner.<br />I was given a promotional discount on my purchase in exchange for my review.<br />Would I buy it again at full price? You bet!! Would I recommend it to a friend? Absolutely!!<br />***IMAGES IN MY SET (IN ORDER OF APPEARANCE)***<br />1. Ocean Elements<br />2. Butterflies/Flowers<br />3.

It does not file the nail nor does it impart any shine whatsoever. Seriously, go to your local beauty supply store and get a 4way buffer block for less than a dollar-- you'll get great results with that!!<br />I purchased this item with a promotional discount for the purpose of testing and review.\nWhat a dissapointment!!\nFluorescent Pink 4 Oz - Liquid Latex Body Paint, Ammonia Free No Odor, Easy On and Off, Cosplay Makeup, Creates Professional Monster, Zombie Arts\nLiquid Latex Fashions\n{'Color': 'Fluorescent Pink', 'Brand': 'Liquid Latex Fashions', 'Item Weight': '4 Ounces', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Package Information': 'Bottle', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '3 x 3 x 3 inches; 4 Ounces', 'Item model number': '010620aa', 'UPC': '811832016844', 'Manufacturer': 'Liquid Latex Fashions'}\nGood liquid latex is every nail artist's best friend. I decided to purchase this jar after using up my supply of prepared/bottled liquid latex varieties, and I am so glad I did. Prior to discovering Liquid Latex Fashions, I was buying liquid latex marketed as &#34;nail art tape&#34;. In terms of package price and the consistent quality of product, I find that this is the much better option. As long as I continue to stamp, water marble and do gradient nails I will continue to use THIS. Here are the highlights as to why I think Liquid Latex Fashions is superior to all the rest:<br /><br />* Package size is 4 ounces and an ample supply for simple nail art. It is smaller in real life than what it appears in the ad photos. I have been using this as my go-to for the past six months and have barely made a dent in it. I suspect that it will probably dry up before I can get through it all.<br />* Product is simple to decant - the large mouth on the jar makes it easy to use an infant medicine syringe to draw the liquid up and dispense into a clean nail polish bottle. (You can get the plastic medi syringes for free at the pharmacy counter - all you have to do is ask.)<br />* Consistency is thin/watery, which is easy to apply and dries very fast. It turns to a dark pink when it's dry. One layer works great for me, but you can add more layers if needed.<br />* It peels so good! Always a clean peel in one solid sheet - no bits and pieces of latex that break off. You can literally roll your fingertip across the edge and peel it off in one whole piece. No more fighting with latex removal after doing a gorgeous gradient!<br />* FYI: Ammonia free does not mean odorless. This product does not smell good at all. If you've used any type of liquid latex before, you know it does have a distinguishable smell. It is somewhere between fish oil and cat urine. Or a mixture of both. Yeah, it stinks to be perfectly honest. Just be forewarned.<br />* Pricing of this is so much more economical versus prepared varieties. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if some folks weren't just repackaging this and slapping their brand labels on it.<br />* The bonus to THIS particular liquid latex - it's black light reactive... so if you plan on going to an all-night rave anytime soon, you can wear this and you'll glow all night! lol ;)<br /><br />\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f<br />Highly recommended and I will most definitely repurchase when I hit tub bottom. Thanks for reading!<br /><br />Seriously though, one more thing - In order to keep the latex fresh and from drying up, you should make sure to wipe any excess latex from around the neck of the jar. Keep the lid screwed on tight when not in use, and store it in a cool dry place.\nAbsolutely the BEST for nail art and I've tried MANY!\n3Pcs Nail Gradient Sponges Brush Pens Kit, AKWOX 3 Differents UV Gel Nail Art Brush Gradient Ombre Brushes Double Head Nail Sponge Painting Pen with 4 Replacement Heads\nAKWOX\n{'Product Dimensions': '7.1 x 3.1 x 0.52 inches; 3.99 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'AK-OT051'}\nPrior to purchasing this, I did some comparison shopping and found that this set costs roughly the same price as if i were to buy the same products, direct from overseas, (but without the 3-4 week wait).
