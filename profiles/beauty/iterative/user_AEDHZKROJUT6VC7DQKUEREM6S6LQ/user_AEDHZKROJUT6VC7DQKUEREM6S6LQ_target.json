Boy was I sorry I ordered these.  At first, upon receipt, I thought they'd be too small and I started to return. Then, I thought I'd try one out to see if it fits.  The fit was right so I took them home.  When I got home, I got out the glue and tried one out.  Right away I noticed the paint job on the lightest color (nude) is horrible!  There are streaks in the nail that look unnatural.  I tried one on anyway and it would not stay on.  It stuck for a moment and then with the slightest nudge, it came off.  AND it left a shiny opalescent plastic patina on the glue that was stuck to my nail!  The back of the fake nail literally came off onto my own nail!  Junk.  I threw them all in the trash.  Don't waste your time - buy Kiss nails - they are the best quality I've found for the price.  They stay on for up to 2 weeks for me.\nReview Title: If I could give this 0 Stars I would\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

My undereye area is an issue with slight crepiness (sp?) and fine wrinkles.  I decided to return because of the reaction.  I have realized that sticking with brand name, proven products for the undereye area are always better for me - Murad works better for me and I'll stick with that line.

The darker tone is good for checkbones and lighter on the apples of cheeks.  Very natural color - coral and bronze but no glitter which I cannot stand.  Worth every penny!\nBuy This!
