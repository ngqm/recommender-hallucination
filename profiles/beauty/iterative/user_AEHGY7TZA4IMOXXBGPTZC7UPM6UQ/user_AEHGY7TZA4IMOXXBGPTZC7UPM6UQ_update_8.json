  "reference_summary": "Segbeauty empty bottle 290\nTruuMe\n{'Brand': 'Segbeauty', 'Color': 'Clear', 'Material Type Free': 'Dairy Free', 'Item Weight': '3.4 Ounces', 'Bottle Nipple Type': 'Vented', 'Package Dimensions': '7.99 x 3.19 x 2.24 inches; 3.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'AM-160083-03', 'UPC': '701822757553 701822760621'}\nThis is definitely a mister, not a spray bottle! It produces such a fine mist, exactly as advertised.\nSuch a fine mist!\nFascy Facial Mask Beauty Treatment 5 Packs 3 Step Mask, Korean Facial Skincare Mask, All Natural Moisturizing Facial Mask Skin Beauty Treatment with Eye Cream, Skin Rejuvenation Facial Mask\nFascy\n{'Brand': 'Fascy', 'Item Form': 'Cream, Sheet', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating', 'Scent': 'Centella Asiatica', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Package Dimensions': '7.64 x 4.88 x 0.94 inches; 7.05 Ounces'}\nThis is a great idea, but sadly not for me. After using all three steps my skin broke out into red bumps and remained red for 24 hours.<br />I don\u2019t expect this is a common reaction and didn\u2019t notice anything in the ingredients that I would react to, but there it is.\nGreat idea, not for me.\nBABOR Power Serum Ampoules - Hyaluronic Acid | Moisturizing Smoothing and Plumping | 8D Hyaluronic Acid and Tripeptide Intensely Hydrate All Skin's Layers | 7 Days to Hydrated Skin\n{'Skin Type': 'All', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydration', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'Babor', 'Item Form': 'Serum', 'Package Dimensions': '5.94 x 3.43 x 0.91 inches; 2.08 Ounces'}\n[[VIDEOID:4eaf048eb55433860172118977ad0ff1]] I\u2019ve used the entire box, exactly as directed and cannot recommend this product.<br /><br />The only things I liked about this product is that it\u2019s unscented and the packaging is kind of fun, but that is absolutely outweighed by the possibility cutting yourself.<br /><br />It does not do what it says. It doesn\u2019t provide \u201cintensive plumping\u201d or\u201dimprove skin elasticity\u201d which are just ridiculous claims, particularly when you consider this used for one week and the first two ingredients are water and glycerine. I have pure glycerine and  after mixing it with water in various percentages, I\u2019d be comfortable betting that this product is at least 70% water.<br /><br />I was able to cleanly snap all seven ampoules using the plastic topper provided. Even though my snaps were clean the edges of both pieces are sharp and you shouldn\u2019t touch them. It took me several tries to figure out how to get all the serum out of the ampoules. For three days I was tapping the opening on my palm which didn\u2019t feel great, but I just couldn\u2019t get it to pour out cleanly.<br /><br />Although it is almost as liquid as water, if you get the opening of the ampoules covered with the liquid it won\u2019t come out because of surface tension. If this happens just turn the bottle open side up and blow on the liquid until the opening is clear and you\u2019re good to go.<br /><br />If you can tilt the bottle just right you can get the serum to pour out. It\u2019s tricky, but spend the time doing it that way and you\u2019ll save yourself a lot of frustration. You see me getting it right in the video, but even then I had to blow the ampoule open once.<br /><br />There is also the cost. $50.00 for one week of use. That\u2019s about $200 a month and $1250 a year although it does specify that you should use this daily for six weeks, maximum. Why? Is that concerning to anyone else? Anyway, even if you have money to burn you would do well spending it on a procedure from a dermatologist or a flight to Dubai for vacation. This is absolutely ridiculous.\nNot moisturizing.\nMoisturizing Heel Socks with Soft Gel Lining for Dry Cracked Feet Treatment - Unisex Reusable Foot Moisturizer SPA Socks for Women & Men - Pedicure Heel Sleeves from Breathable Cotton\nPumice Valley\n{'Size': '1 Pair (Pack of 1)', 'Material': 'Gel', 'Brand': 'Pumice Valley', 'Fabric Type': 'Cotton', 'Package Dimensions': '7.87 x 4.02 x 0.91 inches; 2.08 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'PUMICE VALLEY'}\nMy favorite thing about these is that they actually stay on all night!<br /><br />I\u2019ve worn silicone heel covers under really tight socks and I always wake up with them hanging around my ankles. These are tight, but they stay on even without socks.<br /><br />My toes can breathe again!\nThey stay on all night!\n10pcs Nail Tips Clips for Quick Building Polygel Nail Forms Nail Tips Clip for Finger Nail Extension DIY Manicure Nail Art Tool\ntiggell\n{'Size': '10 Count (Pack of 1)', 'Brand': 'tiggell', 'Style': 'French', 'Coverage': 'Full Well Tips', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Package Dimensions': '7.64 x 5.24 x 1.61 inches; 2.08 Ounces'}\nThese are definitely a bargain!<br /><br />Fairly good product that I don\u2019t actually need because the plastic forms for poly gel nails stay on my nails without them. I say fairly good because I could not get them to hold the forms on my pinkies.\nDefinitely a bargain!\nMISS SPA Head to Toe Body and Facial Mask Set, Brighten Under-Eye, Deep Therapy Lip Mask, Moisturizing Foot Booties, Anti-Aging, Anti-Wrinkle, Skin Care for Women, 3-Pack\nMISS SPA\n{'Brand': 'MISS SPA', 'Product Benefits': 'Softening', 'Scent': 'Fresh', 'Skin Type': 'Dry,All Skin Types', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Product Dimensions': '3.07 x 0.24 x 4.33 inches; 2.15 Ounces', 'UPC': '838623303099'}\nI really enjoyed this set and it\u2019s affordable enough that I can use it regularly,<br /><br />I try to take a few hours one evening a week when everyone else has plans to take some time for myself. This has been really difficult during COVID quarantine so I ended up moving it all into the bathroom, lol! Bubble bath, a nice shampoo and deep conditioner, possibly a sheet mask, then I\u2019m out of the bathroom...usually because someone needs to use it, lol!<br /><br />I knew this set was going to be the perfect addition to my routine. The sheet masks never get right under my eyes or lips so the ones this kit supplies that target those areas are perfect! they supply are great! I\u2019m still getting used to wearing the lip one because I\u2019d never used one before, but there not uncomfortable and they do leave my lips feeling softer. I love that the foot ones aren\u2019t exfoliating, just pure moisture. I put them on and cover them with socks, then inevitably fall asleep wearing them. The next morning I take them off, massage in the rest of the liquid, and they feel wonderful!<br /><br />Not exactly a spa experience, but I\u2019m not one who does that regularly anyway so this feels very indulgent!\nEffective and affordable addition to a spa day/night!\nWIS Hyaluronic Acid Facial Masks for Women Anti Aging, Moisturizing for All Skin Type 24 Pcs Sheet Mask, Daily Skin Care\n+WIS+\n{'Brand': '+WIS+', 'Item Form': 'Mask', 'Product Benefits': 'Moisturizing', 'Scent': 'Hyaluronic Acid', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '6.18 x 5.04 x 4.13 inches; 1.83 Pounds'}\nI ordered this even after seeing that it is recommended for \u201cyoung skin...to prevent wrinkles\u201d and I am so glad I did! Old or young, this mask is for you!<br /><br />It\u2019s a nice, thin sheet and every package has more than enough serum in it. After placing the face mask (which fits me well) I use the extra serum on my neck, d\u00e9collet\u00e9, and hands. I usually read or watch something on my tablet while I\u2019m wearing it which means I have my glasses on. I am so pleased that they sit well on my nose and don\u2019t interfere with the action of the mask in any way. It has never irritated my sensitive skin, and has proven soothing when my skin is having a reaction to something else.<br /><br />These are also remarkably affordable (when I ordered them) for what you get which means I can use them regularly rather than save them for emergencies and special occasions!<br /><br />10/10 Would recommend!\n10/10 Would recommend!\nFoot Peel Mask Natural Exfoliating Peeling Treatment Skincare Footmask Dead Skin Remover Foot Scrub Feet Peeling Mask Repairs Dry Cracked Heels In Home Spa Exfoliation Care for Men or Women 55g Pack\nFootish by Saffron\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '7.4 x 5.04 x 0.31 inches; 1.94 Ounces', 'UPC': '718910754868'}\nThese foot masks work, but they are definitely in the expensive side.
