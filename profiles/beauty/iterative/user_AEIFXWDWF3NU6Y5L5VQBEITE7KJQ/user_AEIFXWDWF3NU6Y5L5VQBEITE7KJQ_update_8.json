Except it\u2019s a lot of packaging & fuss. Once the cream is gone, there\u2019s no way to open this up & get all the rest out from inside the container like you can do with tubes.<br /><br />Besides that, the cream itself is great!<br />No scent whatsoever, it glides on smoothly & easily, and it absorbs quickly & completely.<br />It\u2019s nice to find an under eye cream you can use in the morning before applying concealer. I also have been applying at night after I wash my face & my under eye skin area looks & feels moisturized in the morning.<br /><br />So \u2014 5 stars for the cream, 3 stars for the silly syringe brings me to 4 stars overall.<br /><br />**Thank you for reading my review & I hope that it\u2019s Helpful!** \ud83e\udd17\nReview Title: The cream is great!

The amount of hair she has takes a lot of this, but WOW - you can see the results - her hair is very shiny & soft. It doesn\u2019t have that cheap conditioner greasy softness - it\u2019s a nice, swingy softness. Moroccan argan oil is the secret!<br />At nearly $18 for 8 oz., it\u2019s a pricey treat but also worth it.<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to read this & I hope it\u2019s helpful!\nHelp for color-treated hair?

I have every intention of using them all on my almost 60 yr old self because I like their products for my very sensitive skin.)<br /><br />At a little over $8/per piece, they\u2019re priced at full retail, but you are paying for the convenience of boxed selections.<br /><br />**Thank you for reading this review & I hope that it\u2019s Helpful!**\nVery giftable with a nice selection of quality products! You pay for the boxed convenience\u2026\nEyebrow Tattoo Pen, Waterproof brow Pencil, Microblading Brow Pen, Natural Looking, Long Lasting (1# Light Brown)\nEINHOOM\n{'Brand': 'EINHOOM', 'Item Form': 'Pencil', 'Finish Type': 'Natural', 'Product Benefits': 'Smoothening', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '4.8 x 0.79 x 0.75 inches; 0.32 Ounces'}\nFull disclosure: I\u2019m a makeup klutz who has no business posting a pic of eyebrows BUT \u2014 for the 1st time, I found a product that let me actually draw some in!<br />My brows never fully grew back after chemo in 2005, so I\u2019ve just learned to love my sparse & whispy nothings.<br />This pen, though, is pretty goof proof! I think it\u2019s the way the end is shaped with 4 little tips similar to a fork\u2026 the lines that come out aren\u2019t thick & bold, but they can be if you just keep drawing over & over.<br /><br />My daughter is a brow fill-in champ, so I will definitely have her help me next time she\u2019s home but, in the meantime, I will recommend this product since if I can use it, anyone can!<br />I\u2019m timid about big dark brows, but will try a little more each day. At just under $10, it\u2019s a great value for an excellent product.<br /><br />**Thank you for reading this review & I hope that it\u2019s Helpful!**\nMakeup klutz me can actually use this! Very easy to apply & draw\u2026\nBack Acne Treatment Spray | Bacne Cure Treatment Spray | Clears Back Acne, Body Acne, Chest Acne, Butt Acne, Ingrown Hairs & Razor Bumps | Formulated with Natural Ingredients, Cruelty-free | 5.1 oz\nPROOT\n{'Item Form': 'mist', 'Brand': 'PROOT', 'Skin Type': 'Oily, Combination, Dry, Normal', 'Use for': 'Whole Body', 'Item Volume': '5.1 Fluid Ounces', 'Product Dimensions': '1.7 x 1.7 x 7 inches; 7.48 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Choice Cosmetics Co.,Ltd'}\nI ordered this for my daughter who spends a lot of time in the gym, so fitted workout clothes + sweat + misc. dirt = back breakouts!<br />This spray not only feels good going on, but it has helped her flare ups considerably after using it for a week after each shower (2x/day).<br /><br />The design allows it to spray out at all angles which is important to reach your back if there isn\u2019t anyone to help you with it.<br />There\u2019s no downside - it feels good, there\u2019s no funky residue, it has reduced the redness & inflammation, & it\u2019s easy to use.<br />Definitely recommend & will order again!<br /><br />**Thank you for reading my review & I hope that it\u2019s Helpful!**\nYou can actually reach your back with this! 1 week use & it looks much improved\u2026\nBeautyGARDE MAGIC Charcoal Facial Cleanser - detoxifying and anti-pollution face cleanser, Nonie Creme\nBeautyGARDE\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.5 x 2.13 x 7.75 inches; 4.8 Ounces', 'Item model number': '1201', 'UPC': '856365007242'}\nThe scrubber tip on this tube of cleanser sounded like a great idea, so I ordered it. I\u2019ve used charcoal face products on my very dry, sensitive skin in the past with no irritation or reaction & this one is fine, too. Cleans, rinses well, moisturizes a bit.<br /><br />BUT \u2014 the angled tip has teeny nylon bristles that are actually too short. You squeeze the tube to push some product onto the surface & gently \u201cscrub\u201d your face with it. The problem is that the bristles are so short that it just feels like a plastic disc massage! No matter how gently or firmly I applied it, the result was the same - rubbing creamy gray cleanser across my face with a circle of hard plastic.<br /><br />In theory, this idea is good but the actual design of the tip does not work for me.<br /><br />**Thank you for reading my review & I hope that it\u2019s Helpful!**\nScrubber feature is better in theory than in practice - NOPE! Cleanser is fine\u2026\nKea Health Manuka Honey Moisturizer Cream - For Cracked Hands and Feet - Eczema and Psoriasis Treatment - Anti Itch Relief for Dry Skin - With Lanolin and Olive Oil\nKea Health\n{'Brand': 'Kea Health', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '7.0 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Use for': 'Hands, Feet', 'Package Dimensions': '2.95 x 2.91 x 2.72 inches; 8.15 Ounces'}\nI have super dry skin in general & go through creams & lotions Iike crazy, always looking for the perfect one.<br />This one? WOW - is it ever super moisturizing.<br /><br />On my hands, I can rub it in for several minutes & it feels really creamy like a good massage cream. The lanolin must be what makes this happen & the olive oil must be the reason my skin is glistening afterwards. If I need to do something right away, I do wipe my palms off a bit but, at night I\u2019ve been rubbing this in & leaving it to soak in all night.<br />On my feet, I rub this on my heels & balls of my feet after a late shower, then cover them with comfy socks & let this soak in all night.<br />Next morning? New hands, new feet! They feel great.<br /><br />Manuka honey is known for its effectiveness in treating skin issues due to its antibacterial properties, so the combination of this, along with the other ingredients makes this an instant favorite in my book.<br />A little goes a long way & the price is very reasonable for the excellent quality.<br /><br />**Thank you for reading my review & I hope that it\u2019s Helpful!**\nOUTSTANDING cream that glides on & leaves you glistening\u2026 my hands & feet LOVE it!\nSqualane + Cucumber Rapid Eye Lift Cream for Dark Circles and Puffiness, Peptide-Complex Infused - 0.4 oz\nSkin Set Go\n{'Brand': 'Skin Set Go', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Use for': 'Eyes', 'Item Volume': '0.4 Fluid Ounces'}\nI\u2019d rather pay less for this eye cream & have it come in a simple tube with a narrow tip to just squeeze out a little at a time.<br />The syringe seems like much ado about nothing - I mean, it\u2019s just a way of squeezing out a little cream, too! Except it\u2019s a lot of packaging & fuss.
