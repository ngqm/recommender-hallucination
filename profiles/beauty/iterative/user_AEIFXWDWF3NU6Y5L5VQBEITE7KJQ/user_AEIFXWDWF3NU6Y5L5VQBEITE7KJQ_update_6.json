I\u2019ve used charcoal face products on my very dry, sensitive skin in the past with no irritation or reaction & this one is fine, too. Cleans, rinses well, moisturizes a bit.<br /><br />BUT \u2014 the angled tip has teeny nylon bristles that are actually too short. You squeeze the tube to push some product onto the surface & gently \u201cscrub\u201d your face with it. The problem is that the bristles are so short that it just feels like a plastic disc massage! No matter how gently or firmly I applied it, the result was the same - rubbing creamy gray cleanser across my face with a circle of hard plastic.<br /><br />In theory, this idea is good but the actual design of the tip does not work for me.<br /><br />**Thank you for reading my review & I hope that it\u2019s Helpful!**\nReview Title: Scrubber feature is better in theory than in practice - NOPE!

The amount of hair she has takes a lot of this, but WOW - you can see the results - her hair is very shiny & soft. It doesn\u2019t have that cheap conditioner greasy softness - it\u2019s a nice, swingy softness. Moroccan argan oil is the secret!<br />At nearly $18 for 8 oz., it\u2019s a pricey treat but also worth it.<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to read this & I hope it\u2019s helpful!\nHelp for color-treated hair?

I think it\u2019s the way the end is shaped with 4 little tips similar to a fork\u2026 the lines that come out aren\u2019t thick & bold, but they can be if you just keep drawing over & over.<br /><br />My daughter is a brow fill-in champ, so I will definitely have her help me next time she\u2019s home but, in the meantime, I will recommend this product since if I can use it, anyone can!<br />I\u2019m timid about big dark brows, but will try a little more each day. At just under $10, it\u2019s a great value for an excellent product.<br /><br />**Thank you for reading this review & I hope that it\u2019s Helpful!**\nMakeup klutz me can actually use this!
