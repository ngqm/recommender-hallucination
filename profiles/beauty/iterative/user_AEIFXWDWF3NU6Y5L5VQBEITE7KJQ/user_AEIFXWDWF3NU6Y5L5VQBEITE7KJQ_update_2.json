The amount of hair she has takes a lot of this, but WOW - you can see the results - her hair is very shiny & soft. It doesn\u2019t have that cheap conditioner greasy softness - it\u2019s a nice, swingy softness. Moroccan argan oil is the secret!<br />At nearly $18 for 8 oz., it\u2019s a pricey treat but also worth it.<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to read this & I hope it\u2019s helpful!\nReview Title: Help for color-treated hair?
