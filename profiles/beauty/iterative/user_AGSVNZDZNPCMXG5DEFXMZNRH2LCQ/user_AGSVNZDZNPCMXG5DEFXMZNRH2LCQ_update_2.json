The mask was super saturated out of the package, so I had to scrape some of the serum off to keep it from dripping.  I also had to fold the large mask over in a few spots where it covered my hairline on all 3 sides.  On my face the mask was cool and refreshing.  Conveniently, it didn\u2019t slip at all, even while sitting up and looking at my cell phone.  I could smell the green tea, but it wasn\u2019t overwhelming.  TIP:  I\u2019ve learned that Karuna masks leave A LOT of serum on the face that doesn\u2019t easily absorb into the skin once the mask is removed.  I left the mask on for 30 minutes, increasing absorption and letting it dry out a bit...I highly recommend this, followed by splashing cool water on your face to gently remove any excess serum.  This prevents sticky skin and left my face feeling smooth and soft almost immediately.  Within 2 hours my skin felt hydrated and looked brighter and super clean.  Very happy with this mask!\nReview Title: My favorite Karuna mask!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "6 Pack 3D Mask Bracket Internal Support Frame, Vamotto No Smell Nasal Mask Pad for Adult and Children to Creating More Space for Breathing and Protection Lipstick Ideal Makeup Saver\nVamotto\n{'Product Dimensions': '4 x 3.2 x 2 inches; 1.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '739210749279'}\nI had heard about these mask frames and was so excited to see them available on Amazon.  I was hoping they\u2019d help keep my mask drier while at the gym.  Unfortunately, they\u2019re simply too small for an adult face...I\u2019m not even sure they\u2019d work for a child.  The frame is surprisingly comfortable against the face, and it did indeed create a pocket/bubble around my nose and mouth.  However, the frames are so small, I literally can\u2019t open my mouth to talk without my lower lip slipping uncomfortably out of the frame...and I have a pretty average sized face!  If you don\u2019t talk to anyone while wearing a mask, this is a cool little find.  If you do talk, or just breathe heavily (like at the gym), this will never, ever work for you...not even close.  I did try cutting off the bottom of the frame, where it rests on the chin.  This helped, but the edges of the frame end up pushing into my face, which I\u2019m guessing would be uncomfortable after a few minutes, and would definitely leave marks.  Oh well, I tried!\nGreat idea, but...no.\nKaruna Oh, Glow On Face Mask Sheet, Skincare and Beauty Facial Masks with Moisturizing and Collagen Promotion Properties for Healthy Glow, Contain Green Tea, Vitamin C and Pineapple (3 Sheets)\nKaruna\n{'Brand': 'Karuna', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrate Skin,Hydrate', 'Scent': 'Pineapple', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Package Dimensions': '6.54 x 4.88 x 0.87 inches; 9.59 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'MSF1004 - CA', 'UPC': '857950007166'}\nI\u2019ve used various Karuna masks, but this is defiantly my favorite.
