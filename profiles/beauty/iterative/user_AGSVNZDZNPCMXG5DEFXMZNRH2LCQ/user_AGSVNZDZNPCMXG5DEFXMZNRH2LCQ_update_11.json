These glass dipping jars are about the same size as the caps on acetone polish remover.  They're small, but hold the perfect amount of acetone in one and alcohol in the other that's needed for a gel mani and tool clean-up.  Super easy to clean, they won't break down over time, and they take up no space in my travel kit.  Perfect!\nReview Title: Perfect!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "6 Pack 3D Mask Bracket Internal Support Frame, Vamotto No Smell Nasal Mask Pad for Adult and Children to Creating More Space for Breathing and Protection Lipstick Ideal Makeup Saver\nVamotto\n{'Product Dimensions': '4 x 3.2 x 2 inches; 1.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '739210749279'}\nI had heard about these mask frames and was so excited to see them available on Amazon.  I was hoping they\u2019d help keep my mask drier while at the gym.  Unfortunately, they\u2019re simply too small for an adult face...I\u2019m not even sure they\u2019d work for a child.  The frame is surprisingly comfortable against the face, and it did indeed create a pocket/bubble around my nose and mouth.  However, the frames are so small, I literally can\u2019t open my mouth to talk without my lower lip slipping uncomfortably out of the frame...and I have a pretty average sized face!  If you don\u2019t talk to anyone while wearing a mask, this is a cool little find.  If you do talk, or just breathe heavily (like at the gym), this will never, ever work for you...not even close.  I did try cutting off the bottom of the frame, where it rests on the chin.  This helped, but the edges of the frame end up pushing into my face, which I\u2019m guessing would be uncomfortable after a few minutes, and would definitely leave marks.  Oh well, I tried!\nGreat idea, but...no.\nKaruna Oh, Glow On Face Mask Sheet, Skincare and Beauty Facial Masks with Moisturizing and Collagen Promotion Properties for Healthy Glow, Contain Green Tea, Vitamin C and Pineapple (3 Sheets)\nKaruna\n{'Brand': 'Karuna', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrate Skin,Hydrate', 'Scent': 'Pineapple', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Package Dimensions': '6.54 x 4.88 x 0.87 inches; 9.59 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'MSF1004 - CA', 'UPC': '857950007166'}\nI\u2019ve used various Karuna masks, but this is defiantly my favorite.  The mask was super saturated out of the package, so I had to scrape some of the serum off to keep it from dripping.  I also had to fold the large mask over in a few spots where it covered my hairline on all 3 sides.  On my face the mask was cool and refreshing.  Conveniently, it didn\u2019t slip at all, even while sitting up and looking at my cell phone.  I could smell the green tea, but it wasn\u2019t overwhelming.  TIP:  I\u2019ve learned that Karuna masks leave A LOT of serum on the face that doesn\u2019t easily absorb into the skin once the mask is removed.  I left the mask on for 30 minutes, increasing absorption and letting it dry out a bit...I highly recommend this, followed by splashing cool water on your face to gently remove any excess serum.  This prevents sticky skin and left my face feeling smooth and soft almost immediately.  Within 2 hours my skin felt hydrated and looked brighter and super clean.  Very happy with this mask!\nMy favorite Karuna mask!\nZeitun Natural Anti Cellulite Body Scrub - Organic Coffee Body Scrub Exfoliator With Robusta & Dead Sea Salt - Cinnamon, Ginger And Moisturizing Oils, 7 oz\nZeitun\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.57 x 5.91 x 8.27 inches; 7 Ounces'}\nThis coffee scrub smells divine while dry, and leaves my skin smelling ever so subtly like coffee and cinnamon.  Oddly, I don\u2019t really notice the smell in the shower.  I love the exfoliation and use it on my entire body.  Out of the shower, I feel a mild oil barrier on my skin that I don\u2019t care for.  Once I add my normal body shaping cream (Clarins Body Fit), I\u2019m in heaven!  The 2 products together leave my skin super cool and tingly for about an hour, followed by crazy soft skin.  I don\u2019t actually have a lot of cellulite (thank you Clarins!), but what I do have is less noticeable after just 2 uses.  So, what\u2019s not to like?  This scrub is so incredibly messy, it\u2019s borderline impractical!  Most scrubs are made with sugar or salt crystals held together with some form of oil or gel, and dissolve in the shower.  Ground coffee doesn\u2019t dissolve and this scrub is dry, so it literally gets everywhere...like sand from the beach!  And worse, I have a walk in shower with white tile floors...coffee stains if it sits too long!  As much as I like the way this product smells and improves my skin texture, it\u2019s a pain in my cellulite free backside to clean up!  Mixing it with a little water and creating a paste before use helps a little, and thankfully I have a handheld shower to quickly rinse it off my tiled walls and shower door, but I\u2019m constantly concerned it\u2019s going to stain my floor grout.  Deep sigh...I soooooo wish this product weren\u2019t so messy!\nSuper soft skin, but oh so messy to use!!\nBusy Co. Biodegradable Hydrating Hand Wipes, With Collagen and Peptides to Smooth and Improve Elasticity, 15 Individually Wrapped Wipes (Refresh Line - Fresh Citrus)\nBUSYCO\n{'Brand': 'BUSYCO', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '4.5 x 7.3 x 3.5 inches; 4.16 Ounces'}\nThese wipes are earth friendly, made in the U.S., sanitize, AND moisturize....could a hand wipe be any more perfect?  The wipes are a nice thickness that remains moist even after several passes...I was literally able to clean my hands and arms after the gym.  The packets are small and easy to toss in my gym bag or purse, the wipes have no scent, and one will go a long way.  And most impressive, aside from the company\u2019s commitment to sustainability, my skin dries quickly, isn\u2019t sticky, and feels quite soft.  The air just got dry where I live, so every bit of moisture is appreciated.  Love this company, love this product!\nEarth friendly wipes, clean and soft hands!\nKaruna 7 Days of Glow - Face & Eye Mask Variety Pack (7 Sheets), Hydrate, Brighten and Glow\nKaruna\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.05 x 5.04 x 1.57 inches; 8.75 Ounces', 'UPC': '857950007333'}\nI\u2019ve tried several different Karuna masks...they\u2019re all good, but some are better than others.  This particular set is a great mix of masks designed to help with different needs, including hydrating, soothing and brightening.  The masks are individually wrapped and presented in a box that opens like a book, with suggestions for which masks to use on which days.  The packaging is nice and these would make a great gift.  The masks are very saturated (overly saturated, IMO) with serum, with plenty left over to use on my neck.  They\u2019re large enough to easily cover my entire face, and come with a paper backing that makes them easy to to unfold.  Because they\u2019re so saturated they easily slip while on my face, which makes it impossible to do anything other than sit still for the 20-30 minutes I wear them.  Also, there\u2019s so much serum left on my face after I remove the masks, it\u2019s impossible for my skin to absorb it all.  I\u2019ve discovered that lightly splashing my face with cold water helps remove the excess serum and my skin fully dries more quickly.  Ultimately, all of the face masks left my skin very soft and hydrated, and a few of them plumped my skin and created a lovely even skin tone.  There is one set of eye masks in the kit and that that were surprisingly light and effective, reducing puffiness and brightening my eyes.  These are a tiny bit pricey, but they\u2019re a nice quality and I like having a set of masks that cover a range of needs.\nNice masks, nice results!\nFRESHME Mud Mask - Facial Mask Kaolinite Clay Masks Cleansing and Moisturizing Brightening Smoothing Face Mask, 3.4 fl oz\nFRESHME\n{'Brand': 'FRESHME', 'Item Form': 'Clay', 'Product Benefits': 'Moisturizing', 'Skin Type': 'Acne Prone', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Package Dimensions': '5.87 x 1.89 x 1.85 inches; 4.9 Ounces'}\nFirst, Pelargonium Graveolens = Rose Geranium (I had to look it up!).  Fancy flower aside, this mask has absolutely no scent.  One of the main reasons I ordered this was because I expected a pleasant scent, so this was disappointing.  The mud is very thin and a little watery which was surprising.  Ultimately the mud doesn\u2019t fully dry or pull my skin, and it\u2019s pretty easy to wash off...no dried mud on my hairline!  There are little bits of something in the mud, leaves I think, that I don\u2019t care for.  They\u2019re aren\u2019t a lot of them, so it seems like this wasn\u2019t intentional and may be a quality control issue.  Up close the bits look a little rotten and rather unappealing.  After 15 minutes my pores look a little tighter, the few tiny blackheads I have are still there, and I can\u2019t really say my skin feels more hydrated.  It doesn\u2019t feel dry, it pretty much feels like it always does.  The packaging, as with all Freshme products is lovely, with the tube of mud packaged inside a matching box, so very giftable.  Personally, I prefer the Freshme sheet masks to this mud.  The clarifying benefits I expect from a mud mask just aren\u2019t as obvious as I\u2019d hoped.\nOk, but not as clarifying as expected.\nSpanature Lavender Hand & Body Lotion Travel Size Selection 4 Pack, Relaxing and Revitalizing Moisturizer for Rough and Dry Skin, Nourishing and Gentle for All Skin Types, Made In Korea - 75 ml/2.53oz\nSpanature\n{'Brand': 'Spanature', 'Scent': 'Lavender', 'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Unit Count': '4.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '4', 'Package Dimensions': '5.08 x 4.29 x 2.91 inches; 1.06 Pounds', 'UPC': '088234470592'}\nWhat a great buy!  I\u2019m constantly putting lotion on my hands, especially during the winter, and keep travel size lotions everywhere.  This lotion comes in the perfect size for my bag, my desk, the night stand, and the car.  The lotion itself has a lovely lavender scent.  It\u2019s not artificial or overwhelming like perfume, but smells botanical, like real lavender.  The lotion has a medium consistency and quickly absorbs, leaving a slight, non-greasy shine on my hands that makes them look less dry.  The scent fades quickly, but my hands feel soft and moisturized for hours...love it!  And, each lotion comes in an unbranded gift box, making them very giftable!\nNice lotion at a great price!\nMISS SPA Head to Toe Body and Facial Mask Set, Brighten Under-Eye, Deep Therapy Lip Mask, Moisturizing Foot Booties, Anti-Aging, Anti-Wrinkle, Skin Care for Women, 3-Pack\nMISS SPA\n{'Brand': 'MISS SPA', 'Product Benefits': 'Softening', 'Scent': 'Fresh', 'Skin Type': 'Dry,All Skin Types', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Product Dimensions': '3.07 x 0.24 x 4.33 inches; 2.15 Ounces', 'UPC': '838623303099'}\nI had mixed results with these 3 products.  The eye patches are gel patches and not meant to be wet with serum - the serum is released by the gel when it's in contact with skin.  The patches easily stayed in place, but resulted in no visible improvements, and left my undereye area feeling a little dehydrated.  The lip patch is also a gel patch.  It was odd to wear, but it stayed on while I moved around and almost seemed to form a suction seal around my mouth after 10 minutes.  I liked this patch - it left my lips smooth and soft for a day and a half...nice!  The foot booties are for moisturizing only...these are NOT exfoliating booties that take days to work and lead to skin peeling.  They were easy to use and comfortable to wear.  I wore them for 30 minutes and was quite pleased with how soft my feet still felt after 2 days.  My only issue was that after removing the booties I had to spend a good amount of time massaging in the lotion left on my feet...seriously, even after trying to dry them with a towel my feet felt greasy.  Be sure to allow time for the product to absorb afterwards and don't plan to run out the door like I did.  For all of this, I would give the set 4 stars.  However, there's an EXCESSIVE amount of packaging.  The patches all have plastic protectors on both sides, are enclosed in plastic clam shells, and are sealed in the final package.  I felt guiltier than usual when I saw the pile of trash I generated by using this set...these items are definitely over packaged.\nMostly good results, wasteful packaging...\nSpanature Aloe Vera Hand & Body Lotion Travel Size Selection, 4 Pack, Relaxing and Revitalizing Moisturizer for Rough and Dry Skin, Nourishing and Gentle for All Skin Types, Made In Korea - 75 ml/2.53oz\nSpanature\n{'Brand': 'Spanature', 'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Unit Count': '10.1 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '4', 'Use for': 'Hands', 'Package Dimensions': '4.21 x 3.62 x 2.8 inches; 1.05 Pounds', 'UPC': '088234470585'}\nI absolutely love the scent of this lotion...it's lovely, but subtle and not overpowering.  The lotion has a nice medium consistency and absorbs nicely and doesn't leave a greasy residue, but it does take a couple of minutes.  I use this lotion on my hands, keeping it in my bag, car and on the nightstand.  My only issue is that the moisture it creates doesn't last long...I have to reapply it frequently...like every couple of hours  But let's be fair...at roughly $4/tube, this lotion is a fantastic value!\nLovely scent, non-greasy, great value!\nWIS Hyaluronic Acid Facial Masks for Women Anti Aging, Moisturizing for All Skin Type 24 Pcs Sheet Mask, Daily Skin Care\n+WIS+\n{'Brand': '+WIS+', 'Item Form': 'Mask', 'Product Benefits': 'Moisturizing', 'Scent': 'Hyaluronic Acid', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '6.18 x 5.04 x 4.13 inches; 1.83 Pounds'}\nI like these face masks, and for the price, they cant\u2019t be beat!  Pros:  they stay in place without slipping or dripping, even while I move around; within an hour of use my skin feels more moisturized,; after several uses my skin looks more plumped; non-irritating and scent free; they cover my entire face; and of course, at about $1 each, the price is great!  Cons:  the masks are folded with a backing sheet but are still trickier than most to unfold; the eye holes are a little small; and my skin feels sticky after I remove the masks and pat in the remaining serum, so I have to splash cool water to get my skin feeling clean.  Overall, these are a great as a daily mask!\nGood hydration and plumping!\nCrystal Glass Dappen Dishes for Nail Art Acrylic Liquid Powder and Nail Polish Removing (2, Clear)\nGenco Dental\n['\ud83d\udc85\ud83c\udffc ACRYLIC LIQUID HOLDER - Perfectly holds any acrylic liquid powder for all your nail art you need! \ud83d\udc85\ud83c\udffc BUBBLE WRAPPED PACKAGING - Our Dappen Dishes come bubble wrapped to ensure each product has proper protection to arrive at your house safely. \ud83d\udc85\ud83c\udffc GET THOSE NAILS DID - Great nails come with great responsibility, that is why starting with a high-quality nail monomer dish is essential for everyday nail perfection. \ud83d\udc85\ud83c\udffc EASE OF USE - These glass dappen dishes can be used for natural nails, false nails, and acrylic nails. \ud83d\udc85\ud83c\udffc NAIL POLISH CLEAN UP - Perfect for putting alcohol in for gel polish clean up or acetone for regular polish.']\n{'Brand': 'Genco Dental', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Product Dimensions': '4.5 x 2.5 x 1 inches; 1.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '850032532211', 'Manufacturer': 'Genco Imports'}\nSuch a simple design, yet so hard to find!
