The wipes are a nice thickness that remains moist even after several passes...I was literally able to clean my hands and arms after the gym.  The packets are small and easy to toss in my gym bag or purse, the wipes have no scent, and one will go a long way.  And most impressive, aside from the company\u2019s commitment to sustainability, my skin dries quickly, isn\u2019t sticky, and feels quite soft.  The air just got dry where I live, so every bit of moisture is appreciated.  Love this company, love this product!\nReview Title: Earth friendly wipes, clean and soft hands!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "6 Pack 3D Mask Bracket Internal Support Frame, Vamotto No Smell Nasal Mask Pad for Adult and Children to Creating More Space for Breathing and Protection Lipstick Ideal Makeup Saver\nVamotto\n{'Product Dimensions': '4 x 3.2 x 2 inches; 1.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '739210749279'}\nI had heard about these mask frames and was so excited to see them available on Amazon.  I was hoping they\u2019d help keep my mask drier while at the gym.  Unfortunately, they\u2019re simply too small for an adult face...I\u2019m not even sure they\u2019d work for a child.  The frame is surprisingly comfortable against the face, and it did indeed create a pocket/bubble around my nose and mouth.  However, the frames are so small, I literally can\u2019t open my mouth to talk without my lower lip slipping uncomfortably out of the frame...and I have a pretty average sized face!  If you don\u2019t talk to anyone while wearing a mask, this is a cool little find.  If you do talk, or just breathe heavily (like at the gym), this will never, ever work for you...not even close.  I did try cutting off the bottom of the frame, where it rests on the chin.  This helped, but the edges of the frame end up pushing into my face, which I\u2019m guessing would be uncomfortable after a few minutes, and would definitely leave marks.  Oh well, I tried!\nGreat idea, but...no.\nKaruna Oh, Glow On Face Mask Sheet, Skincare and Beauty Facial Masks with Moisturizing and Collagen Promotion Properties for Healthy Glow, Contain Green Tea, Vitamin C and Pineapple (3 Sheets)\nKaruna\n{'Brand': 'Karuna', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrate Skin,Hydrate', 'Scent': 'Pineapple', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Package Dimensions': '6.54 x 4.88 x 0.87 inches; 9.59 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'MSF1004 - CA', 'UPC': '857950007166'}\nI\u2019ve used various Karuna masks, but this is defiantly my favorite.  The mask was super saturated out of the package, so I had to scrape some of the serum off to keep it from dripping.  I also had to fold the large mask over in a few spots where it covered my hairline on all 3 sides.  On my face the mask was cool and refreshing.  Conveniently, it didn\u2019t slip at all, even while sitting up and looking at my cell phone.  I could smell the green tea, but it wasn\u2019t overwhelming.  TIP:  I\u2019ve learned that Karuna masks leave A LOT of serum on the face that doesn\u2019t easily absorb into the skin once the mask is removed.  I left the mask on for 30 minutes, increasing absorption and letting it dry out a bit...I highly recommend this, followed by splashing cool water on your face to gently remove any excess serum.  This prevents sticky skin and left my face feeling smooth and soft almost immediately.  Within 2 hours my skin felt hydrated and looked brighter and super clean.  Very happy with this mask!\nMy favorite Karuna mask!\nZeitun Natural Anti Cellulite Body Scrub - Organic Coffee Body Scrub Exfoliator With Robusta & Dead Sea Salt - Cinnamon, Ginger And Moisturizing Oils, 7 oz\nZeitun\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.57 x 5.91 x 8.27 inches; 7 Ounces'}\nThis coffee scrub smells divine while dry, and leaves my skin smelling ever so subtly like coffee and cinnamon.  Oddly, I don\u2019t really notice the smell in the shower.  I love the exfoliation and use it on my entire body.  Out of the shower, I feel a mild oil barrier on my skin that I don\u2019t care for.  Once I add my normal body shaping cream (Clarins Body Fit), I\u2019m in heaven!  The 2 products together leave my skin super cool and tingly for about an hour, followed by crazy soft skin.  I don\u2019t actually have a lot of cellulite (thank you Clarins!), but what I do have is less noticeable after just 2 uses.  So, what\u2019s not to like?  This scrub is so incredibly messy, it\u2019s borderline impractical!  Most scrubs are made with sugar or salt crystals held together with some form of oil or gel, and dissolve in the shower.  Ground coffee doesn\u2019t dissolve and this scrub is dry, so it literally gets everywhere...like sand from the beach!  And worse, I have a walk in shower with white tile floors...coffee stains if it sits too long!  As much as I like the way this product smells and improves my skin texture, it\u2019s a pain in my cellulite free backside to clean up!  Mixing it with a little water and creating a paste before use helps a little, and thankfully I have a handheld shower to quickly rinse it off my tiled walls and shower door, but I\u2019m constantly concerned it\u2019s going to stain my floor grout.  Deep sigh...I soooooo wish this product weren\u2019t so messy!\nSuper soft skin, but oh so messy to use!!\nBusy Co.
