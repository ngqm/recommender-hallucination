  "reference_summary": "10Pcs 3D Face Inner Silicone Bracket for Comfortable Breathing, Washable Reusable Silicone Bracket\u00a0Under Frame Lipstick Protector Keep Fabric off Mouth to Create More Breathing Space\nBlaikepcam\n{'Package Dimensions': '10.2 x 6.18 x 3.43 inches; 2.4 Ounces'}\nThese silicon brackets were the best product I ever purchased. It has made breathing so much easy while wearing masks. I normally wear glasses so whenever I wear a mask it always fogs with my glasses esp when it's cold outside. After putting these on I am finally able to breathe and not worry about the way the fabric touches my face when I am walking outside and no fogs in my glasses. The brackets were lightweight and comfortable to wear,great buy in these difficult times.\nGreat design!!!\nOrganic Roll On Essential Oils Set, 100% Pure USDA Certified - Protector Blend (Based on 4 Thieves Legend) & Lemongrass with Black Leather Travel Case\nRed Silk Essentials\n{'Brand': 'Red Silk Essentials', 'Scent': 'Lemongrass', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Material Feature': 'Organic', 'Liquid Volume': '10 Milliliters', 'Package Dimensions': '6.3 x 4.09 x 3.86 inches; 7.69 Ounces', 'UPC': '753068385595', 'Manufacturer': 'Red Silk Essentials'}\nPros:<br />The oil was high quality.<br />The oil smells great.<br />The carrying case is well made and useful.<br /><br />Cons<br />Cannot think of any !!!\nGreat set!!!",
