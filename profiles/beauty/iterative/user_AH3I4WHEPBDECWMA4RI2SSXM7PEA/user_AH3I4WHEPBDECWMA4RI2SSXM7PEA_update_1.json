It has made breathing so much easy while wearing masks. I normally wear glasses so whenever I wear a mask it always fogs with my glasses esp when it's cold outside. After putting these on I am finally able to breathe and not worry about the way the fabric touches my face when I am walking outside and no fogs in my glasses. The brackets were lightweight and comfortable to wear,great buy in these difficult times.\nReview Title: Great design!!!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
