Every time I order a synthetic hair wig I\u2019m disappointed. I didn\u2019t have to pluck this, the hair line looks very natural. The hair is soft, it feels like it\u2019s my own. My only complaint is that it\u2019s a very yellow blonde but I knew that when I ordered it. I\u2019m wondering if I could maybe use my purple shampoo on it and tone it to a more natural blonde. I don\u2019t want to ruin it but I think I\u2019m going to give it a try. Will keep you posted on my results and show a before and after!\nReview Title: Gorgeous wig\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
