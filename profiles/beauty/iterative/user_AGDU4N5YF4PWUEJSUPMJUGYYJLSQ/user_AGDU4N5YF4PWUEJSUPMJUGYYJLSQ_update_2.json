To my surprise it works pretty well. I don\u2019t wear foundation during the summer, only bronzer/blush and highlighter. My skin gets extremely oily and shiny by the end of the day. I put my bronzer and highlighter on and then applied this powder using a powder brush. I would only use the applicator inclosed with it if I had no other choice. I went out in my yard and watered all of my flowers, it was 80 degrees out so quite warm. Came back inside and looked in the mirror and my face was still matte. Went about the rest of my day which included a 2.5 mile walk with my family. When I went to wash the makeup off my face my nose was only slightly shiny, that\u2019s it. I deducted a star because my skin gets pretty bronzed this time of year, it seemed like the powder washed my color out a little bit. It wasn\u2019t a huge difference but enough to notice.\nReview Title: Works well\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Every time I order a synthetic hair wig I\u2019m disappointed. I didn\u2019t have to pluck this, the hair line looks very natural. The hair is soft, it feels like it\u2019s my own. My only complaint is that it\u2019s a very yellow blonde but I knew that when I ordered it. I\u2019m wondering if I could maybe use my purple shampoo on it and tone it to a more natural blonde. I don\u2019t want to ruin it but I think I\u2019m going to give it a try. Will keep you posted on my results and show a before and after!\nGorgeous wig\nBy Terry Hyaluronic Pressed Hydra-Powder | Transcluscent | Infused with Hyaluronic Acid | Vegan\nBy Terry\n{'Brand': 'By Terry', 'Item Form': 'powder', 'Finish Type': 'Matte', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '3.19 x 3.15 x 0.75 inches; 2.82 Ounces', 'Item model number': '3700076457087'}\nI was skeptical about this but decided to give it a try anyways.
