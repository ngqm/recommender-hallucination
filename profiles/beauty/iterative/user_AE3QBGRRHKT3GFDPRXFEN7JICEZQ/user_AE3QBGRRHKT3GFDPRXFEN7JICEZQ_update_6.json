I really enjoy showing people how cool it looks for the polish to change color right before their eyes! Now having the option to do this with long lasting gel polish is super exciting! I swatched these colors and was able to immediately see the color difference after being under the warm lights of the led lamp so the changing is very sensitive, which is really what you want in a thermal polish. The stickers on the tops of the bottles aren't all that color accurate BUT they do give a general idea of what the colors are so you can have an idea of what you have. I did 2 coats for each color and it's a little hard to tell but some were great with 2 coats and others really could have benefited from a third. The glitter polish is really not a pretty color at all, I kind of wish it was either just a different thermal all together or they had chose different colors for it. The blue and reddish colors were the best formulas, seeming more like regular nail polish (not as thick and much smoother application).<br />The set is packaged great for gift giving. If you know anyone who really likes polish this would be great for them, keeping in mind if they don't already work with gel polishes they will need not only some type of lamp but also a base and top coat since this set does not include those.\nReview Title: Thermal gel polish-YES!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Very happy with this purchase.\nGreat mascara\n4D Silk Fiber Lash Mascara Black, Natural Waterproof Mascara Extra Long Lash,Thick Thickening and Lengthening, No Clumping, No Smudging, Lasting Voluminous Eyelashes Dramatic Extension Mascara\nSIKEMAY\n{'Color': 'Black', 'Special Feature': 'Smudge Proof, Non Clumping', 'Brand': 'SIKEMAY', 'Specialty': 'Waterproof, Hypoallergenic', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '8.9 x 4 x 1.1 inches; 2.57 Ounces', 'UPC': '764690676852', 'Manufacturer': 'SIKEMAY'}\nDoes a great job of making my lashes look lush and full plus it also makes them look longer. I usually have mascara that does one or the other but not both  so this product is great. It's waterproof but easily removable with a makeup wipe or eye makeup remover. I also really like the square shape of the bottle, it keeps it from rolling around on my counter when I set it down lol Very happy with this purchase.\nLong, thick lashes in an instant!\nBoar Bristle Hair Brush, Detangler Brush, Hairbrush for Long Short Thick Thin Curly Straight Wavy Dry Hair Adds Shine and Makes Hair Smooth, Best Paddle Hair Brush for Men Women Kids\nLHIUEM\n{'Brand': 'LHIUEM', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Hair Type': 'All, Wavy, Dry, Curly, Straight', 'Material': 'Boar', 'Product Dimensions': '10.43 x 3.94 x 1.97 inches; 8.47 Ounces', 'UPC': '791523116681'}\nI initially bought a soft bristle boar bristle brush and HATED it. I got this combination brush and I really, really like it. This gift set is great because it has a small travel brush as well as a cleaning tool and comb. I haven't used the comb but the travel brush came in really handy as I usually only with my regular comb and no brush because the brush takes up too much space. Having the smaller travel brush was nice and then the cleaning tool is awesome to clean hair out of both brushes. I would definitely recommend this set for anyone wanting a boar bristle brush.\nGreat gift pack!\nPine Gel Nail Polish Set Chameleon Shimmering Color and Black 7.5 ml LED UV Cured Soak Off Nail Gel for Nail Art Manicure\npine\n{'Brand': 'Pine', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Liquid Volume': '0.25 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '4.96 x 3.7 x 2.91 inches; 9.14 Ounces', 'UPC': '738628890993'}\nThis set does not come with a base or top coat but DOES come with the necessary black polish that you will want to use under these colors. They are incredibly sheer polishes and to use without a black base you will not be able to get full, opaque coverage. With the black base though these polishes really stand out. They are unique to anything else I have in my gel polish collection and is similar to what you would find in the indie polish world of regular polishes. I swatched them on black swatch sticks and I only needed one coat to get the look I was going for. They were just thick enough to get good coverage but not so thick they were goopy. I'm looking forward to wearing these colors!\nFun!\nCIMIY Gel Nail Polish Set 8 bottles - Manicure Colors Infinity with Top Base Coat for Forest Nail Art Natural Daily All Seasons for Nail Profession Salon and Starter at Home Soak Off UV LED 0.32oz\nCIMIY\n{'Brand': 'CIMIY', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Glossy', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Liquid Volume': '0.3 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '11.54 x 3.58 x 1.22 inches; 11.64 Ounces'}\nThese colors are perfect for the fall season. They come in a really nice gift set package and include a bas and top coat so your giftee will be all ready to go...as long as they already have a lamp ;) The colors on the bottles are very accurate as to what is inside the bottle, which is really good considering a lot of the time color accuracy is the biggest issue. I swatched one color; it was two coats of perfection. The formula is a lot like regular polish rather than gel, meaning it glides on really well and you don't have to manipulate it to get good coverage. The top coat cured in 30 seconds which I was super excited about. Some other brands I have tried recently have needed 120+ seconds to cure which just makes the process way too long for me. Overall I am really happy with this brand and this set. I wish they had more colors to try. Once they do, I'm sure I'll be making another purchase!\nBeautiful fall set\nColor Changing Gel Nail Polish Set Spring Summer Mood Nail Polish for Starter and Professional 6 Colors Pink Red Blue Yellow Purple Brown Manicure Kit for Valentine\u2019s Day Girlfriend Gift\nASKITO\n{'Brand': 'ASKITO', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'Gel', 'Special Feature': 'Long Lasting,Long-lasting', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '1.62 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '6', 'Liquid Volume': '0.27 Fluid Ounces'}\nI have quite a few regular nail polishes that are thermal and I love the magic of the changing colors.
