I personally wouldn\u2019t wear as an everyday wig, without a hat. It is soft, but you can tell this wig is synthetic by touch. The shine looks more natural, shine is not terrible. I would definitely use if I needed a wig for a costume. This wig does shed if you run your fingers through it, but it isn\u2019t terrible shedding.\nReview Title: Good wig overall\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
