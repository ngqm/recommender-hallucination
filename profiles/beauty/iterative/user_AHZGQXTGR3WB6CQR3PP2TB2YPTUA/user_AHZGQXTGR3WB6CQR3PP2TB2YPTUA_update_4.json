However, I regretted using this oil to bathe the baby. It made things slippery and when I was getting  her out of the tub to wash her bottom I was terrified because she felt slippery. I will continue using this for myself but I am worried about using it on the baby. I also hesitate using it when bathing my toddler because he loves to move around a lot and I am concerned he would slip. Also, some oil leaked out during shipping.\nReview Title: Natural ingredients and nourishing BUT parents BEWARE\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "LUBEX UV LED Nail Lamp Nail Dryer Light, 54W Professional Nail Curing Lamp Nail Light for Gel Polish with 30s/60s/99s Timer, Gel Nail Machine with Auto Sensor LCD Screen with Anti-UV Gloves Offered\nLUBEX\n{'Style': 'Traditional', 'Brand': 'LUBEX', 'Special Feature': 'Motion Sensor', 'Light Source Type': 'LED', 'Connectivity Technology': 'IR', 'Package Dimensions': '8.6 x 5.9 x 3.7 inches; 1.3 Pounds'}\nI like this lamp. It cures evenly and it\u2019s base is large enough to take hand or foot without the danger of damaging polish while putting it in. It came with the fingerless glove for hand protection and I thought that was pretty neat. It\u2019s supposed to protect the skin from tanning. I never had a glove before. It also came with the 2 nail files. It\u2019s a smart lamp, when the temperature gets high, it will turn to low-power mode to protect the hand, light kinda dims. When temperature gets down, the lamp goes back to normal work mode. When you out your hand in it automatically goes for 120sec, other presets are 39/60/90  sec. Instruction manual is pretty good.<br />Overall it\u2019s a good lamp and I recommend. Bonus for small details as nail file and the glove.\nNice unit, dries evenly\nLilySilk Large Silk Scrunchies for Womens Girls Kids, Green, Pure 100 Real Natural Raw Mulberry Raw Silk, 6A Grade, Beautiful for Hair, Soft, Tie Scrunchies Silk Big Giant\nLilySilk\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.9 x 6.4 x 1.2 inches; 1.59 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'RDUS6111H-02A'}\nThis is large scrunchie with a lot of ruffle. Color is beautiful dark green and the fabric has a great shine to it, it\u2019s silks nature and looks great The elastic inside is quite stretchy and I wrap this around my hair in tail for 3 times. It holds my hair well but I still feel it should be stronger for a large ponytail. I can see this looking great on a hair bun.\nLarge and perfect for a bun - beautiful color\n3D Mink Eyelashes Natural Long Lashes 2 in 1 Self-adhesive Eyeliner Instead of Adhesive 5 Different Styles Pairs Kits Sets with Tweezers , NO NEED GLUE\nPURELEOR\n{'Brand': 'PURELEOR', 'Material': 'Mink Fur', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Mounting Type': 'Eyelash Glue', 'Unit Count': '5.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '9 x 6 x 1 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '750810450143'}\nI am terrible at doing lashes but I really like having nice lashes, now during pandemic lash salon is out of the question. Before trying these I tried lashes with glue and that was a disaster. Then ai tried magnetic ones and that was a good experience. When these came up for the review I honestly didn\u2019t understand how different it is then a glue? Well, it\u2019s the application process that\u2019s different. With glue you have to squeeze it out and make sure not to put  too much, then you have to make sure to place the lash correctly on the first attempt or you might have glue on your eye lid. This liner serves as a glue! It\u2019s just like regular liner, has that sharpie tip and works like a pen. You draw your line over the eye lid and then place the lashes and they will stick to it perfectly. If you need to reposition the lash there is no mees and glue residue, you just pull and place it back accordingly. I only wish these would be more natural style but for the ladies that like their lashes little more dramatic this is perfect choice.\nBeginner friendly application\nEmilia Hypoallergenic Bath Oil for Babies - Paraben-Free Natural Baby Wash Enriched With Natural Oat Extract, Sunflower, Sweet Almond, Sesame, Calendula, and Chamomile 8.5 fl.oz.\nEmilia\n{'Brand': 'Emilia', 'Scent': 'Chamomile', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Unit Count': '8.5 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.81 x 2.05 x 1.85 inches; 8.78 Ounces'}\nI love the natural ingredients and the mild and pleasant scent, I also love how the skin feels after this bath oil.
