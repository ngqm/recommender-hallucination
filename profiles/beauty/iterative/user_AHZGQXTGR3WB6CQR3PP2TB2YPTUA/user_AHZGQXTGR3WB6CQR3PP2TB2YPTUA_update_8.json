  "reference_summary": "LUBEX UV LED Nail Lamp Nail Dryer Light, 54W Professional Nail Curing Lamp Nail Light for Gel Polish with 30s/60s/99s Timer, Gel Nail Machine with Auto Sensor LCD Screen with Anti-UV Gloves Offered\nLUBEX\n{'Style': 'Traditional', 'Brand': 'LUBEX', 'Special Feature': 'Motion Sensor', 'Light Source Type': 'LED', 'Connectivity Technology': 'IR', 'Package Dimensions': '8.6 x 5.9 x 3.7 inches; 1.3 Pounds'}\nI like this lamp. It cures evenly and it\u2019s base is large enough to take hand or foot without the danger of damaging polish while putting it in. It came with the fingerless glove for hand protection and I thought that was pretty neat. It\u2019s supposed to protect the skin from tanning. I never had a glove before. It also came with the 2 nail files. It\u2019s a smart lamp, when the temperature gets high, it will turn to low-power mode to protect the hand, light kinda dims. When temperature gets down, the lamp goes back to normal work mode. When you out your hand in it automatically goes for 120sec, other presets are 39/60/90  sec. Instruction manual is pretty good.<br />Overall it\u2019s a good lamp and I recommend. Bonus for small details as nail file and the glove.\nNice unit, dries evenly\nLilySilk Large Silk Scrunchies for Womens Girls Kids, Green, Pure 100 Real Natural Raw Mulberry Raw Silk, 6A Grade, Beautiful for Hair, Soft, Tie Scrunchies Silk Big Giant\nLilySilk\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.9 x 6.4 x 1.2 inches; 1.59 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'RDUS6111H-02A'}\nThis is large scrunchie with a lot of ruffle. Color is beautiful dark green and the fabric has a great shine to it, it\u2019s silks nature and looks great The elastic inside is quite stretchy and I wrap this around my hair in tail for 3 times. It holds my hair well but I still feel it should be stronger for a large ponytail. I can see this looking great on a hair bun.\nLarge and perfect for a bun - beautiful color\n3D Mink Eyelashes Natural Long Lashes 2 in 1 Self-adhesive Eyeliner Instead of Adhesive 5 Different Styles Pairs Kits Sets with Tweezers , NO NEED GLUE\nPURELEOR\n{'Brand': 'PURELEOR', 'Material': 'Mink Fur', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Mounting Type': 'Eyelash Glue', 'Unit Count': '5.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '9 x 6 x 1 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '750810450143'}\nI am terrible at doing lashes but I really like having nice lashes, now during pandemic lash salon is out of the question. Before trying these I tried lashes with glue and that was a disaster. Then ai tried magnetic ones and that was a good experience. When these came up for the review I honestly didn\u2019t understand how different it is then a glue? Well, it\u2019s the application process that\u2019s different. With glue you have to squeeze it out and make sure not to put  too much, then you have to make sure to place the lash correctly on the first attempt or you might have glue on your eye lid. This liner serves as a glue! It\u2019s just like regular liner, has that sharpie tip and works like a pen. You draw your line over the eye lid and then place the lashes and they will stick to it perfectly. If you need to reposition the lash there is no mees and glue residue, you just pull and place it back accordingly. I only wish these would be more natural style but for the ladies that like their lashes little more dramatic this is perfect choice.\nBeginner friendly application\nEmilia Hypoallergenic Bath Oil for Babies - Paraben-Free Natural Baby Wash Enriched With Natural Oat Extract, Sunflower, Sweet Almond, Sesame, Calendula, and Chamomile 8.5 fl.oz.\nEmilia\n{'Brand': 'Emilia', 'Scent': 'Chamomile', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Unit Count': '8.5 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.81 x 2.05 x 1.85 inches; 8.78 Ounces'}\nI love the natural ingredients and the mild and pleasant scent, I also love how the skin feels after this bath oil. However, I regretted using this oil to bathe the baby. It made things slippery and when I was getting  her out of the tub to wash her bottom I was terrified because she felt slippery. I will continue using this for myself but I am worried about using it on the baby. I also hesitate using it when bathing my toddler because he loves to move around a lot and I am concerned he would slip. Also, some oil leaked out during shipping.\nNatural ingredients and nourishing BUT parents BEWARE\nMD Complete Bright & Healthy Vitamin C+ Vitalizing Face Serum| with Vitamin C, Vitamin E and Herbal Extracts | Potent Antioxidant Protection, Nourishes, Brightens and Evens Skin 0.5 fl oz\nMD Complete by Dr. Brian Zelickson\n{'Skin Type': 'Acne Prone, Sensitive', 'Use for': 'Face', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'MD Complete by Dr. Brian Zelickson', 'Item Form': 'Serum', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.05 x 1.63 x 3.75 inches; 4.97 Ounces', 'UPC': '850458005573'}\nI was a little bit concerned since some reviewers mentioned this vit c is oily. I thought it would feel too heavy for my skin but thankfully that wasnot the case.<br /><br />Compared with any other Vitamin C serum I have used during the past 7 years, this is the thickest version I have seen. Usually Vit C is thin almost like water but this variety by MD is oil based. It works great for my skin giving it a bit extra hydration it needs. I use at night, I do believe it would be too heavy for daytime use as humidity is high. It makes my skin softer and feeling more hydrated then usual.\nworks well for me\nKLAVUU Pure Pearlsation pH Balancing Quick Cleansing Pad 100ea - Powerful Makeup Mild Exfoliating Cleansing Pad without Skin Irritation, Intense Moisturizing\nKLAVUU\n{'Brand': 'KLAVUU', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Unit Count': '100.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '3.74 x 3.74 x 4.33 inches; 1.21 Pounds'}\nO my goodness I love these pads! They are thick, textured and strong, they don\u2019t tear and can definitely take some abuse. Wipes are generously soaked in liquid that leaves no oily or sticky residue. It smells nice and fresh. The jug with pads is huge, it\u2019s like a peanut butter jar lol No complaints here but not exactly something you want to put in a travel bag. Pads are large and easy to remove because one side has a cutout where you can stick your finger and pull the wipe out.\nGreat presoaked pads\nPress On Nails Red Medium, 200PCS Cosics Glossy Red Fake Nails Full Cover with Storage Box, Colored Acrylic Nails Coffin Ballerina Shape & Almond Stiletto Nails with Adhesive Tabs for Salon Women DIY\nCOSICS\n{'Size': '210 Piece Set', 'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'COSICS', 'Style': 'Medium', 'Pattern': 'Solid', 'Package Dimensions': '7.36 x 7.17 x 1.57 inches; 5.29 Ounces'}\nThese plastic nail are good (not excellent) quality. They bend a little and are not as sturdy as some other brands but they look very real. They are even a little see through. You get 2 boxes of nails, same color but different shape. One box contains pointy nails and other box comes with more oval shaped ones. They come in many sizes and I was able to get appropriate size for all of my fingers. I didn\u2019t use the glue stickers they included, I used liquid nail glue from another brand. Also pointy nails were a little too pointy for me and the tips needed a little filing. Quantity is great, well there is abundance of nails so it\u2019s easy to replace when one breaks. Because they\u2019re so many I will rate this 5 stars but otherwise would probably be 4.\nExcellent value - good quality (not excellent)\nMilyBest Fluffy Lashes False Eyelashes Natural Look Cat Eye Lashes, Dramatic Faux Mink Lashes 3D Effect 18mm D Curl Volume Extension Reusable Wispy Lashes Pack 10 Pairs\nMilyBest\n{'Color': 'B-Sweet Date | 18MM', 'Brand': 'MilyBest', 'Material': 'Faux Mink, Plastic, Cotton', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '7.44 x 4.02 x 0.69 inches', 'Material Feature': 'Cruelty Free', 'Product Dimensions': '7.44 x 4.02 x 0.69 inches; 0.32 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'QC10-T02', 'Manufacturer': 'MilyBest', 'Country of Origin': 'China'}\nThese lashes are so gorgeous!
