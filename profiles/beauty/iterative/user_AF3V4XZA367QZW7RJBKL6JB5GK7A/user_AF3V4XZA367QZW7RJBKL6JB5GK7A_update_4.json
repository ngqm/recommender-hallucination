I am autistic, and I hate the feel of water in my ears, so I use cotton swabs to dry my ears after a shower. This adds up to a lot of swabs and I felt guilty about putting that many into the trash when I could make a tiny difference environmentally. I didn't really think the silicone option would work. The cotton soaks up the water. But the little knobby end actually does pull the water out of my ear canal.<br /><br />The case is fine. I feel like the rubber bit that holds it together will eventually break. It is just flimsy. But, for now, it does its job. I ordered the blue, and it is a pretty dull blue, but the swab works, so whatever.\nReview Title: It Works\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Also, even when they are soaking wet, they don't feel drippy. I am weird about having water on/in my face, and these cloths allow me to wash my face without triggering an odd anxious feeling. I really like these cloths and always keep one on hand.\nReally Soft\nTELETIES - Spiral Hair Coils - Ponytail Holder Hair Ties for Women - Phone Cord Hair Ties - Strong Grip, No Rip, Water Resistant, No Crease Hair Tie Coils - 3 pack (Large, Maliblu)\nTeleties\n{'Material': 'Fabric', 'Item Form': 'Spiral', 'Brand': 'Teleties', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Number of Pieces': '3', 'Package Dimensions': '3 x 3 x 1.2 inches; 2.08 Ounces', 'UPC': '711841892807'}\nI love telephone cord style hair ties. They gather all of my hair into a ponytail or bun easily and, best of all, they don't give me headaches like more traditional hair elastics. These are a pretty combination of aqua blue and white, and they are very sturdy.\nNo Headaches\nRAREKIND Fade Matte Lipstick by Amorepacific - 10 Colors, Cruelty-Free Nourishing Lip Stick, Velvety-smooth, Long-Lasting Moisturizing Lipstick - 3.2g Maple Road\nRAREKIND\n{'Package Dimensions': '3.3 x 0.9 x 0.9 inches; 0.95 Ounces'}\nEh. The color is bit more orange-y than I\u2019d hoped for by the photo. It\u2019s really thick. It doesn\u2019t stay put or feel great on. I might try mixing it with some gloss if I liked the color more.\nNot thrilled\nReusable Cotton Swab Portable Silicone Swab Washable Cotton Swabs for Ear Cleaning Beauty Treatment Makeup Cotton Swab\nJAOYU\n{'Product Dimensions': '3.2 x 3.2 x 0.39 inches', 'UPC': '739232135913'}\nI was skeptical.
