It lasts as long as any lipstick, so not forever, but good enough. It doesn't feel too thick on my lips. Overall this one was a win.\nReview Title: A win\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "AuroTrends Makeup Remover Towel,2 Pack Reusable Chemical-free Microfiber Makeup Remover Cloths,Magically and Gently Wipe Away Cosmetics,Sunscreen,Oil and Dirt,Set of 2 (Pink+Black)\nAuroTrends\n{'Brand': 'AuroTrends', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Material Feature': 'Reusable', 'Unit Count': '2.0 Count', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.52 x 2.72 x 1.42 inches; 6.4 Ounces'}\nThese are really soft. Also, even when they are soaking wet, they don't feel drippy. I am weird about having water on/in my face, and these cloths allow me to wash my face without triggering an odd anxious feeling. I really like these cloths and always keep one on hand.\nReally Soft\nTELETIES - Spiral Hair Coils - Ponytail Holder Hair Ties for Women - Phone Cord Hair Ties - Strong Grip, No Rip, Water Resistant, No Crease Hair Tie Coils - 3 pack (Large, Maliblu)\nTeleties\n{'Material': 'Fabric', 'Item Form': 'Spiral', 'Brand': 'Teleties', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Number of Pieces': '3', 'Package Dimensions': '3 x 3 x 1.2 inches; 2.08 Ounces', 'UPC': '711841892807'}\nI love telephone cord style hair ties. They gather all of my hair into a ponytail or bun easily and, best of all, they don't give me headaches like more traditional hair elastics. These are a pretty combination of aqua blue and white, and they are very sturdy.\nNo Headaches\nRAREKIND Fade Matte Lipstick by Amorepacific - 10 Colors, Cruelty-Free Nourishing Lip Stick, Velvety-smooth, Long-Lasting Moisturizing Lipstick - 3.2g Maple Road\nRAREKIND\n{'Package Dimensions': '3.3 x 0.9 x 0.9 inches; 0.95 Ounces'}\nEh. The color is bit more orange-y than I\u2019d hoped for by the photo. It\u2019s really thick. It doesn\u2019t stay put or feel great on. I might try mixing it with some gloss if I liked the color more.\nNot thrilled\nReusable Cotton Swab Portable Silicone Swab Washable Cotton Swabs for Ear Cleaning Beauty Treatment Makeup Cotton Swab\nJAOYU\n{'Product Dimensions': '3.2 x 3.2 x 0.39 inches', 'UPC': '739232135913'}\nI was skeptical. I am autistic, and I hate the feel of water in my ears, so I use cotton swabs to dry my ears after a shower. This adds up to a lot of swabs and I felt guilty about putting that many into the trash when I could make a tiny difference environmentally. I didn't really think the silicone option would work. The cotton soaks up the water. But the little knobby end actually does pull the water out of my ear canal.<br /><br />The case is fine. I feel like the rubber bit that holds it together will eventually break. It is just flimsy. But, for now, it does its job. I ordered the blue, and it is a pretty dull blue, but the swab works, so whatever.\nIt Works\nKISSIO Lipstick Set,4Pcs Cigarette Matte Lipstick Set,Red Matte Pigmentation Lipstick,Long Lasting Waterproof Lipstick for women\nKISSIO\n{'Brand': 'KISSIO', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Item Form': 'Stick', 'Finish Type': 'Matte', 'Product Benefits': 'Long Lasting,Cleansing,Moisturizing,Long-lasting,Makeup', 'Package Dimensions': '10.79 x 8.27 x 0.47 inches; 2.01 Ounces'}\nThese are fine. They don't stay very well though, and they make my lips a bit dry, so I still end up adding a lip balm over top, and that sort of ruins the matte finish. The color is good. I like the size of the container as well, like a lip balm.\nNice Colors\nLong Curly Wig for Women Black Long Wavy Wigs with Bangs Synthetic Replacement Wig Heat Resistant Natural Looking for Daily Party Cosplay (Black)\nGUDEMAY\n{'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Special Feature': 'Glueless', 'Brand': 'GUDEMAY', 'Package Dimensions': '10.98 x 9.96 x 2.32 inches; 10.86 Ounces', 'UPC': '779880641428'}\n[[VIDEOID:da59496c84540ec5e1ead467d50fa820]] I adore this wig.<br /><br />So, it isn't black. It is brown. Or else, they accidentally sent me the brown version. Regardless, I love how it looks on. The hair doesn't have that super-shiny fake look of plastic. It falls nicely. I will post a photo.\nPretty!\n2PCS Wine Red&Black mixed Brown 14''Short Curly Bob Wig with Air Bangs for Women Shoulder Length Wavy Wigs Synthetic Heat Resistant Fiber Hair Medium Length Glueless Wig for Daily Wear\nOSWINMART\n{'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '14 x 9.5 x 8.5 inches', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Special Feature': 'Glueless', 'Brand': 'OSWINMART', 'Product Dimensions': '14 x 9.5 x 8.5 inches; 1.08 Pounds', 'UPC': '732043538942'}\nI like the darker one a lot. The lengths for both wigs are good, and the bangs work pretty well. Although I prefer the darker one, other people have commented that they like the reddish one better. So both work well and look good on. The darker one is super close to my real style on a good hair day, just with added bangs, so I am sure I will get a lot of use out of it.\nBoth are Great!\nSHIONLE - Semi Matte Air Lipstick: Creamy semi matte lipstick | Long Lasting | Great Coverage | Creamy Texture | 06 CRUSH BERRY | 3.3g\nSHIONLE\n{'Brand': 'SHIONLE', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Finish Type': 'Matte', 'Product Benefits': 'Long Lasting,Moisturizing', 'Product Dimensions': '1 x 3 x 1 inches; 0.12 Ounces'}\nSlightly browner than expected, but it still is a color that works with my skin tone.
