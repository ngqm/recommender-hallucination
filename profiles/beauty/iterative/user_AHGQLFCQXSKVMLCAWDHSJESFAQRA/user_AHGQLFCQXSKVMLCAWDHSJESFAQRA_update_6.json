Cosmetics'}\nThis is a pretty color but I bought this blush based on the ingredients shown in the picture on the back of the package which have a low toxic rating. HOWEVER the product I received has a different ingredient list that includes BHA which according to the Skin Deep website is a Human endocrine disruptor - strong evidence. As well as petrolatum classified as expected to be toxic or harmful  This also has proplyparaben a Human immune toxicant or allergen - strong evidence.  So I'm not sure I should use it which is a waste of money.  It rates an overall moderate toxic level according to EWG.\nModerately Toxic\nJade Rose Quartz Roller for Face 2 in 1 Gua Sha Set Including Rose Quartz Roller and Jade Face Massager 100% Real Natural Jade Facial Roller Anti Aging Face Roller Massager by Rayfarmo\nRAYFARMO\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '6 x 2 x 0.5 inches; 7.04 Ounces', 'UPC': '680727935887', 'Manufacturer': 'RAYFARMO'}\nI like the cool feel of the stone on my face.  The small end of the roller gives a nice light massage.  The extra stone piece is nice for other areas like the arms and such.  The roller is smooth.  The extra stone piece can really work tension out.\nMassaging\nZWIFEJIANQ Silicone Back Scrubber,Exfoliating Lengthen Silicone Bath Body Brush for Men and Women,Deep Clean & Invigorate Your Skin (30 inch, Purple)\nZWIFEJIANQ\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.72 x 4.57 x 1.93 inches; 7.37 Ounces', 'UPC': '781076826120'}\nWorks well to scrub your back and sholders.

It has a curve so you can reach the curves of your back.  The britsles are soft.  The sponge is great.  It folds up for travel.  The handle is solid and sturdy.  Just be careful when changing the head piece, I pinched the skin on my finger.\nLove it\nLong-Handled Back Scrubber for Shower Body-Brush - HFLHLL Super Long Portable Assembly 3 in 1 Bath Exfoliating Brush with Bristles Sponge Massager Head, Suitable for Wet or Dry, Women and Men\nHFLHLL\n{'Brand': 'HFLHLL', 'Power Source': 'hand_powered', 'Product Care Instructions': 'Wash with Warm Water', 'Operation Mode': 'Manual', 'Package Dimensions': '13.74 x 4.72 x 2.99 inches; 15.91 Ounces', 'UPC': '730869806597', 'Manufacturer': 'HFLHLL GROUP'}\nThe attachments are great.  Thick sponge and soft brush.  One of the best I have tried.  The only negative is releasing the attachment once it is on and you want to use a different attachement.  It's a bit difficult.\nGreat\nVOKEYLA Blonde Short Wavy Wig with Bangs 12 Inch Shoulder Length Synthetic Cosplay Wig for Women None Lace Honey Blonde with Highlight Purple&Pink Stripe Pastel Wig(Blonde/Purple&Pink)\nVOKEYLA\n{'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '12 x 6 x 3 inches', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy', 'Style': 'Wavy', 'Brand': 'VOKEYLA', 'Product Dimensions': '12 x 6 x 3 inches; 11.22 Ounces'}\nCute wig for fun.
