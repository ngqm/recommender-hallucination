Cosmetics'}\nThis is a pretty color but I bought this blush based on the ingredients shown in the picture on the back of the package which have a low toxic rating. HOWEVER the product I received has a different ingredient list that includes BHA which according to the Skin Deep website is a Human endocrine disruptor - strong evidence. As well as petrolatum classified as expected to be toxic or harmful  This also has proplyparaben a Human immune toxicant or allergen - strong evidence.  So I'm not sure I should use it which is a waste of money.  It rates an overall moderate toxic level according to EWG.\nModerately Toxic\nJade Rose Quartz Roller for Face 2 in 1 Gua Sha Set Including Rose Quartz Roller and Jade Face Massager 100% Real Natural Jade Facial Roller Anti Aging Face Roller Massager by Rayfarmo\nRAYFARMO\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '6 x 2 x 0.5 inches; 7.04 Ounces', 'UPC': '680727935887', 'Manufacturer': 'RAYFARMO'}\nI like the cool feel of the stone on my face.
