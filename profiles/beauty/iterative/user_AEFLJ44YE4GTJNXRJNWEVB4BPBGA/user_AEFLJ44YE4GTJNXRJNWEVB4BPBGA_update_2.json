He enjoys us running it over his coat, but we're working on building up his tolerance to it so we haven't gotten to brush him with it fully. He is a husky mix with a short length coat. The brush is really easy to clean when needed,  just press the button.\nReview Title: great for training puppy\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
