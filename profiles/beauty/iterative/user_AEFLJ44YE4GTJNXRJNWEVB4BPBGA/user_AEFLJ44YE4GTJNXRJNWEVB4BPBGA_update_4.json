I am disappointed this set doesnt come with glue (just the little sticker pads) but I have some on hand so no big deal. Also there are so few of the cute design nails, mostly just the black ones.\nEdgy designs cute style\n(YOUMIDI) Brush and Cat Brush-Smooth combing brush for short and long hair-Pet shedding combing brush, which can remove loose hair, mats, tangles (Gray)\nyoumidi\n{'Brand': 'Youmidi', 'Color': 'Gray', 'Shape': 'Oblong', 'Product Benefits': 'Smoothing', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '10.31 x 5.04 x 2.28 inches; 3.53 Ounces', 'Item model number': '021', 'UPC': '768647685706'}\nWe ordered this brush to help train our puppy to enjoy being brushed because the bristles are small and it wont pull on him too much. He enjoys us running it over his coat, but we're working on building up his tolerance to it so we haven't gotten to brush him with it fully. He is a husky mix with a short length coat. The brush is really easy to clean when needed,  just press the button.\ngreat for training puppy\nBy Terry Hyaluronic Pressed Hydra-Powder | Transcluscent | Infused with Hyaluronic Acid | Vegan\nBy Terry\n{'Brand': 'By Terry', 'Item Form': 'powder', 'Finish Type': 'Matte', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '3.19 x 3.15 x 0.75 inches; 2.82 Ounces', 'Item model number': '3700076457087'}\nThis powder is awesome because of the color it will always match with my foundation. It goes on a little white, but after letting it set for a few minutes it dusts off to be completely clear. I love the compact and think this powder holds up well with setting spray.\ngreat matte powder\nMAEPEOR Body Luminizer 5 Colors Waterproof Shimmer Face Body Glow Illuminator Non-sticky Liquid Body Highlight Illuminator (Pearl White, 30 ML)\nMAEPEOR\n{'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Coverage': 'Light', 'Brand': 'MAEPEOR', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Fl Oz', 'Product Dimensions': '1.18 x 0.79 x 0.39 inches; 3.53 Ounces'}\n[[VIDEOID:23fcf2a166170d46e6854b0d5be13433]] This body luminizer is so pretty once applied!
