The wand is great for separation of each lash which helps evenly apply the formula to each lash. The formula goes on kind of clumpy as shown by other reviewers and flakes with wear. I had to wipe the fallout twice which would be terrible if I were wearing full coverage foundation. It does, however, remove easy with facial wipes.\nReview Title: Volumizing at a Cost\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Bath Roman Japanese Cypress (Hinoki) Bath Salts - 680g\nEARTH\n['Japanese Bathsalt Bathroman cypress bath']\n{'Brand': 'EARTH', 'Unit Count': '680 gram', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Item Weight': '1.8 Pounds', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '6.1 x 4.6 x 3.4 inches; 1.76 Pounds', 'Item model number': '4901080536013', 'Manufacturer': 'Bathroman'}\nI enjoy woodsy, earthy scents so this was a great choice. This hinoki smells like evergreen, dry cedar, with a lemon-like undertone; the scent has a calming effect and lasts throughout your soak. You can splurge a little for these salts because you only need to use a small amount to get the full effect.\nSacred Hinoki - Calming, Grounding Scent\nITECHNIK Sonic Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush for Adults, with TPU Wrapped Handle, Inductive Fast Charge, 5 Brushing Modes, Waterproof, Smart Timer, 3 Replacement Heads&Covers, ST-102 (Black)\nITECHNIK\n{'Product Dimensions': '7.87 x 3.94 x 1.97 inches; 0.01 Ounces', 'UPC': '779186943264'}\nThe top settings are very strong and get your teeth clean. The lowest setting however are perfect for sensitive teeth. Unit charges really fast and can be plugged into a laptop or phone charger for travel. I also like the fact that the charger is a little more present than some others, so you can find it more easier. I had one with just a cable and the cable got tossed. The faux leather on the back fits well into any size hands.\nFast and Functional\nQueendom Unlashed Mascara | Volumizing and Lengthening | Boosts Lash Length | Vegan, Cruelty Free, Paraben Free\nQueendom\n{'Package Dimensions': '5.28 x 0.94 x 0.63 inches; 0.85 Ounces'}\nThis mascara provides volume and length, but at a clumpy price.
