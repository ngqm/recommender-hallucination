The lowest setting however are perfect for sensitive teeth. Unit charges really fast and can be plugged into a laptop or phone charger for travel. I also like the fact that the charger is a little more present than some others, so you can find it more easier. I had one with just a cable and the cable got tossed. The faux leather on the back fits well into any size hands.\nReview Title: Fast and Functional\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

This hinoki smells like evergreen, dry cedar, with a lemon-like undertone; the scent has a calming effect and lasts throughout your soak.
