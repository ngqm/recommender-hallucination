  "reference_summary": "Bath Roman Japanese Cypress (Hinoki) Bath Salts - 680g\nEARTH\n['Japanese Bathsalt Bathroman cypress bath']\n{'Brand': 'EARTH', 'Unit Count': '680 gram', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Item Weight': '1.8 Pounds', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '6.1 x 4.6 x 3.4 inches; 1.76 Pounds', 'Item model number': '4901080536013', 'Manufacturer': 'Bathroman'}\nI enjoy woodsy, earthy scents so this was a great choice. This hinoki smells like evergreen, dry cedar, with a lemon-like undertone; the scent has a calming effect and lasts throughout your soak. You can splurge a little for these salts because you only need to use a small amount to get the full effect.\nSacred Hinoki - Calming, Grounding Scent\nITECHNIK Sonic Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush for Adults, with TPU Wrapped Handle, Inductive Fast Charge, 5 Brushing Modes, Waterproof, Smart Timer, 3 Replacement Heads&Covers, ST-102 (Black)\nITECHNIK\n{'Product Dimensions': '7.87 x 3.94 x 1.97 inches; 0.01 Ounces', 'UPC': '779186943264'}\nThe top settings are very strong and get your teeth clean. The lowest setting however are perfect for sensitive teeth. Unit charges really fast and can be plugged into a laptop or phone charger for travel. I also like the fact that the charger is a little more present than some others, so you can find it more easier. I had one with just a cable and the cable got tossed. The faux leather on the back fits well into any size hands.\nFast and Functional\nQueendom Unlashed Mascara | Volumizing and Lengthening | Boosts Lash Length | Vegan, Cruelty Free, Paraben Free\nQueendom\n{'Package Dimensions': '5.28 x 0.94 x 0.63 inches; 0.85 Ounces'}\nThis mascara provides volume and length, but at a clumpy price. The wand is great for separation of each lash which helps evenly apply the formula to each lash. The formula goes on kind of clumpy as shown by other reviewers and flakes with wear. I had to wipe the fallout twice which would be terrible if I were wearing full coverage foundation. It does, however, remove easy with facial wipes.\nVolumizing at a Cost\nVeta \u2013 Lash and Eyebrow Serum \u2013 2-in-1 Lash & Brow Pen \u2013 Produces Longer, Healthier, Denser Lashes and Thicker Brows \u2013 Eyelash Serum \u2013 Boosts Skin Collagen \u2013 Drug-Free Formula - 1 fl oz.\nVeta\n{'Color': 'Silver, Black', 'Brand': 'Veta', 'Item Form': 'lotion', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Package Information': 'Tube', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.2 x 1.61 x 1.57 inches; 1.13 Ounces', 'UPC': '861121002645'}\nI thought this might be a gimmick, but it honestly showed results. It won't regrow lost hairs or give you brand new volume you never had, but it promotes healthy growth in the hair you have. I lost some eyelashes due to a cruddy fake lash application. Using this regrowth was pretty obvious and lashes looked longer and fuller.\nPromotes Healthy Hairs\nCremorlab Mineral Treatment Essence 9.1 Fl. Oz. 270ml Water Essence, Serum for Face, Face Moisturizer\nCREMORLAB\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '4.76 x 2.13 x 6.69 inches; 11.29 Ounces', 'Item model number': '8.80934E+12'}\nI used for more than a month with no visible results. I still have clogged pores and dry skin. I haven't experienced any I'll effects, but I was hoping for basic results.\nNo Effects\n2Pcs Mascara Black Volume and Length 4D Natural and Long Lasting Lash Blast Mascara, 0.27 Fl Oz\nMarine Forest\n{'Brand': 'Marine Forest', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Item Volume': '0.27 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Information': 'Tube', 'Water Resistance Level': 'Waterproof', 'Package Dimensions': '4.84 x 2.01 x 0.98 inches; 3.17 Ounces', 'UPC': '729843907382'}\nIt is on the dry side and eventually smudges or flakes. It doesn't curl and it's as good as discount store mascara.\nNo Curl\nDr. Bessette Naturals Facial Beauty Bars | Doctor Created (French Green Sea Clay)\nDR. BESSETTE NATURALS\n{'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'DR. BESSETTE NATURALS', 'Scent': 'French Green', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '5.59 x 4.25 x 0.71 inches; 1.13 Ounces', 'UPC': '696550973774'}\nThis costs as much as a popular brand of 4 oz soaps, but in a small size. It comes in an envelope and is a sliver. I used it all quickly and it wasn't moisturizing.\nSample Size\nAloe Vera Gel 100% Natural Moisturisers - Pure Organic Fresh Soothing Aloe-Vera Moisturizing Gel Skin Hair, Aloe Leaf Wash-free Clean After Sun Face Body (8.8 oz)\nCIMIY\n{'Brand': 'CIMIY', 'Scent': 'Aloe Vera', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Unit Count': '8.8 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Product Dimensions': '5.91 x 1.57 x 1.57 inches; 11.22 Ounces'}\nWell worthwhile the price. Has another of different purposes and delivers.\nDelivers",
