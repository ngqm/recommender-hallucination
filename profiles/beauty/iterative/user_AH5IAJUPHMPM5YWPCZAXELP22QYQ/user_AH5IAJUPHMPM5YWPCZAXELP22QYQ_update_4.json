I like that they included pumps aw well as spray bottle tops. Each one is interchangeable when you get them. My pump straws were too long, so I put them in the taller bottles, and put the spray tops on the smaller bottles. The pumps have a neck brace so it can't be pushed down by accident. There is a little funnel, and three lids for the sprayers. However, I did measure the size of the larger bottle with liquid and it holds more than the 100 ml that they advertised (3.30oz). They actually holds about 4 ounces, so keep that in mind if you are limited on space when traveling. The pumps and sprayers work well - they will be used on a future vacation.\nReview Title: Perfect Set!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Emilia Hypoallergenic Baby Lotion - Quick-Absorbing, Non-Greasy, Alcohol-Free Baby Body Oatmeal Cream With Natural Colloidal Oatmeal for Dry Skin Eczema - Provides 24 Hour Moisturization - 8.8 fl.oz.\nEmilia\n{'Brand': 'Emilia', 'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Unit Count': '8.8 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.32 x 2.52 x 2.24 inches; 10.12 Ounces'}\nEmilia Baby Body Lotion will really make your skin as soft as your babies! I just had to try it on myself because I have eczema and they said it is hypoallergenic. I can tell you that it doesn't irritate my skin ad the softness is really noticeable...and that you might not be able to notice on your baby because a babies skin is (usually) already soft. I am an adult that has allergies to a lot of things that show up in skin irritations, and I do not think that you can go wrong with buying this lotion. This is a great one for your newborn, baby, and the whole family. The only con would be if you don't like the smell of baby powder. It smells like a creamy baby powder, and I like it.\nWhat a difference in softness!\nReusable Makeup Remover Cloth Towels Set - Remove mascara, exfoliate skin, clean your face - Eraser for you makeup! Wipe your face free only with warm water - MAKEUP BLUR (Leopard Print 9-Pack)\nMAKEUP BLUR\n{'Brand': 'MAKEUP BLUR', 'Material Feature': 'Reusable', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '6.1 x 3.7 x 1.8 inches; 1.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '081227858148'}\nThese amazingly do the job of wiping makeup off my face without any products but warm water! It's gentle on my skin too. They are so soft, thick, and I want a blanket made of this material! I just want to hug it because it feels so nice.\nSoft and Efficient!\nEmpty Plastic Mini Fine Mist Spray Bottles Refillable Pump Bottle 3.4oz / 100ml Small Travel Size with Labels Funnels Cleaner\nDURSI\n{'Brand': 'DURSI', 'Material': 'Plastic', 'Capacity': '100 Milliliters', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '1.73 x 1.73 x 5.31 inches'}\nThese are FOUR (4) ounce containers! These are a little bigger than we expected. They will take up more room in a carry-on quart sized bag than I want. However, the bottles and everything that came with them work well as expected. I just wish that the seller would verify information before advertising. I took off only one star for the advertisement disappointment, but I kept the other four stars because the set works well for the size that they are.\nThey are a little bigger than advertised. I measured 4 ounces!\n6 Pack Spray Bottles,Empty Plastic Clear Small Transparent Travel Bottles Pump Bottle Lotion Dispenser Bottle Set,Refillable Liquid Containers 3oz and 2 oz\nCehomi\n{'Package Dimensions': '8.98 x 6.14 x 1.1 inches; 0.81 Ounces'}\nThese can go on an airplane or be carried anywhere because they don't leak.
