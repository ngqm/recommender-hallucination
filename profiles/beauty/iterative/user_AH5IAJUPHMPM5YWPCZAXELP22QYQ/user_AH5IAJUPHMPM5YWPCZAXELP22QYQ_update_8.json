It keeps your head and ears from getting burned, while it lets your hair glide through the hot slits of the comb. The hot comb can be used for people with any colored hair. I know because I tried it on my slightly wavy thin light colored hair, and to my amazement, it worked! It has a digital display and a 360 degree cord (it can spin in circles without tangling). The temperature control knob is right where I place my hand, so I have to make sure that I don't hit it by accident. Other than that, it performs well, as advertised.\nReview Title: The hot comb can be used for people with any color of hair, not just \"Black Hair, Beard and Wigs\"\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Emilia Hypoallergenic Baby Lotion - Quick-Absorbing, Non-Greasy, Alcohol-Free Baby Body Oatmeal Cream With Natural Colloidal Oatmeal for Dry Skin Eczema - Provides 24 Hour Moisturization - 8.8 fl.oz.\nEmilia\n{'Brand': 'Emilia', 'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Unit Count': '8.8 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.32 x 2.52 x 2.24 inches; 10.12 Ounces'}\nEmilia Baby Body Lotion will really make your skin as soft as your babies! I just had to try it on myself because I have eczema and they said it is hypoallergenic. I can tell you that it doesn't irritate my skin ad the softness is really noticeable...and that you might not be able to notice on your baby because a babies skin is (usually) already soft. I am an adult that has allergies to a lot of things that show up in skin irritations, and I do not think that you can go wrong with buying this lotion. This is a great one for your newborn, baby, and the whole family. The only con would be if you don't like the smell of baby powder. It smells like a creamy baby powder, and I like it.\nWhat a difference in softness!\nReusable Makeup Remover Cloth Towels Set - Remove mascara, exfoliate skin, clean your face - Eraser for you makeup! Wipe your face free only with warm water - MAKEUP BLUR (Leopard Print 9-Pack)\nMAKEUP BLUR\n{'Brand': 'MAKEUP BLUR', 'Material Feature': 'Reusable', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '6.1 x 3.7 x 1.8 inches; 1.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '081227858148'}\nThese amazingly do the job of wiping makeup off my face without any products but warm water! It's gentle on my skin too. They are so soft, thick, and I want a blanket made of this material! I just want to hug it because it feels so nice.\nSoft and Efficient!\nEmpty Plastic Mini Fine Mist Spray Bottles Refillable Pump Bottle 3.4oz / 100ml Small Travel Size with Labels Funnels Cleaner\nDURSI\n{'Brand': 'DURSI', 'Material': 'Plastic', 'Capacity': '100 Milliliters', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '1.73 x 1.73 x 5.31 inches'}\nThese are FOUR (4) ounce containers! These are a little bigger than we expected. They will take up more room in a carry-on quart sized bag than I want. However, the bottles and everything that came with them work well as expected. I just wish that the seller would verify information before advertising. I took off only one star for the advertisement disappointment, but I kept the other four stars because the set works well for the size that they are.\nThey are a little bigger than advertised. I measured 4 ounces!\n6 Pack Spray Bottles,Empty Plastic Clear Small Transparent Travel Bottles Pump Bottle Lotion Dispenser Bottle Set,Refillable Liquid Containers 3oz and 2 oz\nCehomi\n{'Package Dimensions': '8.98 x 6.14 x 1.1 inches; 0.81 Ounces'}\nThese can go on an airplane or be carried anywhere because they don't leak. I like that they included pumps aw well as spray bottle tops. Each one is interchangeable when you get them. My pump straws were too long, so I put them in the taller bottles, and put the spray tops on the smaller bottles. The pumps have a neck brace so it can't be pushed down by accident. There is a little funnel, and three lids for the sprayers. However, I did measure the size of the larger bottle with liquid and it holds more than the 100 ml that they advertised (3.30oz). They actually holds about 4 ounces, so keep that in mind if you are limited on space when traveling. The pumps and sprayers work well - they will be used on a future vacation.\nPerfect Set!\nQiray Hair Ties For Women Coil Hair Ties,Large Lace Phnom Penh,5 Colors 10 Pieces.\nQiray\n{'Material': 'Rubber', 'Item Form': 'elastic', 'Brand': 'Qiray', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '3.15 x 3.15 x 2.36 inches', 'Number of Pieces': '10', 'Product Dimensions': '3.15 x 3.15 x 2.36 inches; 2.82 Ounces', 'UPC': '655160582486'}\nThese hair ties are exactly as advertised. You get 10 ties in 5 different colors. They have beads that resemble pearls attached to them. I wondered if they would look nice or if they would be too twisted to see the pearly beads on the outside. The result is that they look absolutely perfect!! You don't even have to do anything special to make them look nice. Just put it on as you normally would and the beads show well along with a nicely colored scrunchy hair tie! Good value!\nLooks really nice!\nGentlehomme Face Moisturizer For Men - Mens Facial Lotion with Neroli Essential Oil Scent - Collagen & Stem Cells - Daily Anti-Aging Moisturizer for Dry & Oily Skin - 4 oz\nGentlehomme\n{'Brand': 'Gentlehomme', 'Scent': 'Fresh', 'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '3 x 2.83 x 2.4 inches; 4 Ounces', 'UPC': '860001419924'}\nThis moisturizer leaves my boyfriend's skin so soft feeling. The scent is light and very likable! When the container arrives, it is in a box that looks really nice. After you unscrew the cap of the container, there is a plastic moisture cap that lays on top. That is good to keep on the container because it keeps keep moisture inside. It has a little finger handle on the top so it is easy to remove. It's a great product but it costs a bit too much as there are other products that can do the same for a lot less.\nLeaves skin SO Soft, BUT Propylene Glycol is the 2nd ingredient (water is 1st)!\n20pcs Nail Tips Clips for Quick Building Polygel Nail Forms Nail Tips Clip for Finger Nail Extension DIY Manicure Nail Art Tool\ntiggell\n{'Size': '20 Count (Pack of 1)', 'Material': 'Plastic', 'Brand': 'Tiggell', 'Style': 'French', 'Coverage': 'Full Well Tips', 'Package Dimensions': '8.98 x 6.85 x 2.2 inches; 4.16 Ounces', 'UPC': '795853588163'}\nThese work as advertised. Big enough to fit my large fingertips without hurting them. They are a hard clear plastic with a metal rod and a metal spring. Make sure when you get yours to check the back end to see if the springs are aligned in the slots. If not, slide them with a fingernail or tool until they go into the slot. The batch that I received have metal springs that barely make it into the slot, which makes the spring pop-out if I open the clips all the way. If the springs were long enough, these would get a 5 star rating from me. As they are, I cannot recommend them. However, I do like that they come individually wrapped so they could be gifted in sets of 5 or 10 and the receiver would know the clips are unused.\nVersatile, but watch out for short springs that come loose!\nDAN Technology Anti-Scald 200\u2109-500\u2109 Electric Press Hot Comb for Black Hair, Beard and Wigs, Ceramic Unisex Hair Beard Straightener and Curler, Dual Voltage for Travel, Home and Salon Use\nDAN Technology\n{'Brand': 'DAN Technology', 'Hair Type': 'All, Curly', 'Material': 'Ceramic', 'Size': 'Medium', 'Item Weight': '0.6 Pounds', 'Package Dimensions': '12.9 x 4.8 x 2.4 inches; 9.6 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'DAN Technology'}\nThe anti scold comb protector is the best addition to this type of hair straightener.
