  "reference_summary": "Emilia Hypoallergenic Baby Lotion - Quick-Absorbing, Non-Greasy, Alcohol-Free Baby Body Oatmeal Cream With Natural Colloidal Oatmeal for Dry Skin Eczema - Provides 24 Hour Moisturization - 8.8 fl.oz.\nEmilia\n{'Brand': 'Emilia', 'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Unit Count': '8.8 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.32 x 2.52 x 2.24 inches; 10.12 Ounces'}\nEmilia Baby Body Lotion will really make your skin as soft as your babies! I just had to try it on myself because I have eczema and they said it is hypoallergenic. I can tell you that it doesn't irritate my skin ad the softness is really noticeable...and that you might not be able to notice on your baby because a babies skin is (usually) already soft. I am an adult that has allergies to a lot of things that show up in skin irritations, and I do not think that you can go wrong with buying this lotion. This is a great one for your newborn, baby, and the whole family. The only con would be if you don't like the smell of baby powder. It smells like a creamy baby powder, and I like it.\nWhat a difference in softness!\nReusable Makeup Remover Cloth Towels Set - Remove mascara, exfoliate skin, clean your face - Eraser for you makeup!
