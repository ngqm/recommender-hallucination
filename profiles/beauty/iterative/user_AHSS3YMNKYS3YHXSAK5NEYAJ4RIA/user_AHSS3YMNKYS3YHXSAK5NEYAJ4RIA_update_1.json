Let me tell  you - this is a headband style crown and absolutely gorgeous! It looks much more expensive, it is sparkley and highly detailed. I love the chain details that go over the forehead. It does not look anywhere like real diamonds - but more like good quality costume piece. My first photoshoot with this crown was a child model portrait session - and it did not disappoint. What I love about it that it is a headband style - it is slightly flexible - so it can fit adult or child head just fine. It does pinch a little if tilted forward, but if worn over the top of the head - it is fine. This can be dressed up many ways - as a princess, flapper, belly dancer and more.. I really love this headpiece and will definitely use it for more creative photoshoots and for my own costume.\nReview Title: Gorgeous! Unique headpiece!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
