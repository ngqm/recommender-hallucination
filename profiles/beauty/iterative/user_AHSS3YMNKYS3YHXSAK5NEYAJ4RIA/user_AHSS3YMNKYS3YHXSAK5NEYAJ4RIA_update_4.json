  "reference_summary": "BABEYOND Roaring 20s Forehead Band 1920s Bridal Headpiece Vintage Forehead Chain for Wedding Bridesmaid Gatsby Costume Accessories with Gift Box\nBABEYOND\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '10.2 x 7.28 x 3.7 inches; 10.86 Ounces'}\nI got this headpiece as a photography prop and part for my costume for an upcoming masquerade ball. Let me tell  you - this is a headband style crown and absolutely gorgeous! It looks much more expensive, it is sparkley and highly detailed. I love the chain details that go over the forehead. It does not look anywhere like real diamonds - but more like good quality costume piece. My first photoshoot with this crown was a child model portrait session - and it did not disappoint. What I love about it that it is a headband style - it is slightly flexible - so it can fit adult or child head just fine. It does pinch a little if tilted forward, but if worn over the top of the head - it is fine. This can be dressed up many ways - as a princess, flapper, belly dancer and more.. I really love this headpiece and will definitely use it for more creative photoshoots and for my own costume.\nGorgeous! Unique headpiece!\nBlackhead Remover Pore Vacuum Cleaner - Blackhead Vacuum Comedone Extractor Tool Device Comedo Suction Kit Electric Face Nose Blackhead Whitehead Remover with 4 Replaceable Suction Head\ncoppy\n[\"don't buy !!!\"]\n{'Package Dimensions': '6.81 x 3.03 x 1.89 inches; 5.71 Ounces', 'Batteries': '1 Lithium Polymer batteries required. (included)', 'UPC': '705586525663'}\nSo this little devise exceeded my expectations - try this on the back of your hand before trying it on your face. This thing is really powerful even on the mildest setting. You have to keep this moving or it will bruise you! Use it on the lowest setting fits while you getting used to it. Best use on freshly steamed skin. I only using this on my nose since this is so powerful I am concerned I will end up with red lines on my face.\nWhat a powerful little tool!\nN3 No Name Necessary Pore-Minimizing Mattifying Oil and Shine Control Anti-aging Makeup Face Primer Spray (200ml)\nNo Name Necessary\n{'Brand': 'No Name Necessary', 'Skin Type': 'Combination', 'Package Information': 'Bottle', 'Finish Type': 'Matte', 'Specialty': 'Mattifying', 'Product Dimensions': '1.7 x 1.7 x 7.5 inches; 8.78 Ounces'}\nI really wanted to love this product and have been using it for a few weeks, before applying my makeup. My skin is oily and I get shiny really quickly. I was excited to try this product because I was hoping it would diminish appearance of pores and keep my makeup on looking matte longer. But with or without this primer my results are about the same. I get shiny within just a couple of hours. I did not notice much result from it at all. It works like a mist - and it\u2019s quite pleasant, makes it easier to apply my makeup, but other than that no promised results.\nDid not work on my oily skin\nTaya Beauty Inner Core Hair Strong Anti-Breakage Shampoo & Conditioner Duo - Strengthening and Repairing Formula - Free From Sulfates and Parabens - 8 fl oz Bottles\nTAYA I AM.\n['INNER CORE SHAMPOO: Ingredients: Water/Aqua/Eau, Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Acrylates Copolymer, Glycerin, Glycol Distearate, Bambusa Vulgaris Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Panthenol, Dimethicone, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Cetrimonium Chloride, Hydroxypropyl Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Cetyl Alcohol, Bis-Cetearyl Amodimethicone, Polyquaternium-11, Laureth-4, Laureth-23, Decylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Amodimethicone, Cocamide MIPA, Trideceth-12, Kaolin, Polysorbate 20, Fragrance/Parfum, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Coconut Acid, Sodium Methyltaurate, Isopropanolamine, Tocopherol, Salicylic Acid, Cyclotetrasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Amyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Salicylate, Linalool.
