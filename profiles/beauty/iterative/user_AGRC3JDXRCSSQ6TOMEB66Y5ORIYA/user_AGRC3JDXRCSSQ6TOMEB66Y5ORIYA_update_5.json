My hair was getting unmanageable so I cut it off. After donating 4 pony tails to locks of love, as my hair reached all the way down to my knees when I was standing up, I thought my hair would be easy to care for. But if I'm not careful, I still get very bad tangles in my short hair. Now that I am starting to grow it out again, I thought my troubles would be back, but I received an opportunity to try this brush at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest, unbiased, review. (all opinions are my own) I took my hair down from it's ponytail and ran the brush through, figuring it would get caught fairly quickly. To my surprise, it didn't really snag at all. It actually did as it claimed. My hair was smooth and the spot at the base of my skull that always gets missed no matter how hard I try, was also smooth and untangled. I am really shocked. I have tried so many brushes for myself and had sort of given up on finding something just for me. I will be keeping my brush in a safe place so my kids don't lose it and recommending to all of my friends. I am very happy with this purchase and would buy it again. It is worth the money.\nIt actually detangled my extremely thick hair\nUNGLINGA Black Mask Blackhead Remover Purifying Peel Off Mask Bamboo Activated Charcoal Face Deep Pore Cleansing Mask For Face Nose and Acne Blemishes Treatment\nUNGLINGA\n['CONCERNS: Enlarged pore, Blackheads, Anti-aging, Fine lines and blemishes, Oily skin, Strawberry nose.

Especially when things are stressful or it's just that time of the month. I had some friends tell me that mud masks are especially helpful for this, but that they are also good for exfoliating and keeping skin healthy. I tried using some bentonite clay as it says you  can use it as a mud mask, but it ended up clumpy and hard to spread on my face. I always ended up making too much too, which only wasted it. It was too much trouble and I stopped using it. I decided to give the dead sea mud mask a go. It is much darker than I expected, my entire face was blue/grey. It's very easy to spread on, I just used one finger and small swisp on each section of my face. It doesn't take too much, I figured it would take a big scoop, but really it took much less. I have used it three times already, each before bed, and you can't even see a dent in how much was in the jar. I left it on about 10 minutes each time and then wiped it off with a wet wash cloth. My skin feels softer, is not breaking out, and my husband even noticed a difference.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT TO TRY IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.

Losing a screw from the hinge on your glasses? Scared of the massive ball of hair stuck in your shower drain? Sick of trying to thread needles with nearly-invisible thread?  You need tweezers! Make difficult tasks easy with the right tools. Our Love It tweezers are perfect for grabbing, twisting, shaping and holding on to anything that's too delicate, small, fragile, or hard to grasp with your hands.   These tweezers are built to last. Too often, tweezers are made with cheap material and careless manufacturing standards. This means that they quickly bend out of alignment and become useless. We don't want that to happen to you... which is why we build our tweezers out of stainless steel, machined carefully to come together in exactly the right position.   A variety of tips for a variety of jobs. When you're handling anything small or fragile, the shape of your tweezers becomes extra important. That's why our Love It tweezer set ships with three different sizes of tool: standard, slanted, and extra-small. They're sharp, too-perfect for dislodging splinters or pulling that one annoying hair.  And because they're sharp, we ship our Love It tweezers with a stylish leather carrying case, perfect for keeping them safe and protecting the other objects in your purse.   No more squinting and fumbling when you try to do delicate jobs - order your set of Love It tweezers today!\"]\n{'Brand': 'OMAROA', 'Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '3 x 0.1 x 0.3 inches', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '3 x 0.1 x 0.3 inches; 0.1 Ounces', 'Item model number': '3179654', 'UPC': '646437258098', 'Manufacturer': 'OMAROA'}\nThere are so many uses for tweezers, and I am used to having some from brands like Revlon and such that are okay, but they are not very high quality. The ends are usually dull and they have a hard time grabbing anything. I was extremely happy when I opened this pack of 3. They are a sturdy stainless steel metal, no plastic or cheap aluminum. The ends of the silver one are extremely pointy, perfect for pulling out things like splinters and anything that might get stuck in the skin. My husband was working and ended up with a large splinter under his finger nail. Since you can't exactly get it from the top, we decided to use the silver sharp pair of tweezers and were able to extract the splinter from under his nail. They also work very well for removing hair. I pluck from time to time and the black and pink pair are really nice for that. The silver is easy to get out any ingrown hairs. Overall the set is very high quality and very professional.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS ITEM TO TRY IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.

This bottle took me by surprise, it has a dropper top similar to those in essential oil bottles (which makes sense with the dark blue bottle and it being made with oils like jojoba)<br />The oil goes on easy, he can just shake a few drops out and rub it in.<br /><br />He uses a boar bristle brush to help him get the oil down to the skin, it helps his beard stay softer and it has grown a lot longer than he usually lets it get. By now he usually gets fed up of it being itchy and shaves, but the oil stops the itchy issue.<br /><br />The bottle is 4 ounces, so it will last quite some time.
