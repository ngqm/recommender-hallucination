It has a hint of a lemon/lime smell to it. Just touching the bar of soap right out of the box, I knew it was a quality product. It is just a bit soft and silky-feeling, just like artisans soaps. It lathers up well and I love all of its ingredients. Highly recommend!!\nReview Title: Quality charcoal soap!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "No Brainer Gentle Facial Cleanser, 6 fl. oz, For Dry & Sensitive Skin, Leaves Skin Feeling Clean, Soft and Hydrated, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein & Amino Acids Restores Skin by Higher Education Skincare\nHigher Education\n{'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Brand': 'Higher Education', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '6.00 Fl Oz', 'Package Dimensions': '7.2 x 2.3 x 2.3 inches; 8.01 Ounces', 'UPC': '811381030056'}\nI like the smell of this and how light it is. It does kinda feel like jelly and doesn\u2019t lather up super great for me, but it gets the job done and makes my face feel good. Haven\u2019t broken out or had irritated skin from it. The smell is light and reminds me of something I can\u2019t put my finger on...maybe light citrus candy or something? It smells pretty good to me and I enjoy washing with this in the shower. Good size too!\nA pleasant, non-irritating face wash\nStudy Buddy Clay Mask with Detoxifying Bentonite, 3 fl. oz., Exfoliates, Brightens and Clears Pores, Clay Draws Out Impurities and Improves Skin's Texture and Tone by Higher Education Skincare\nHigher Education\n{'Brand': 'Higher Education', 'Item Form': 'Clay', 'Product Benefits': 'Exfoliating', 'Scent': 'Exfoliating', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.6 x 3.6 x 1.3 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'UPC': '811381035006'}\nI love a good face mask - this hits all the marks for me. It is thick and basically feels like wet pottery in your hands (hence the clay), smells nice (somewhat perfume-y) and most importantly, feels like something I\u2019d get at a spa. When I first put it on, I was surprised by the warming sensation, since I didn\u2019t realize it had that effect. I liked it! I\u2019ve had masks like that before and they just add another dimension to the experience. I left it on for 10 minutes and washed it right off. Some clay masks I\u2019ve used are hard to wash off - not this one. Face felt smooth and had no irritation afterward. I really like this brand.\nWarming sensation is so good\nButt Naked Baby Organic Sunshine Lotion | Everyday Moisturizer | Lightweight, Non-Greasy | Normal-to-Dry Skin | Aloe, Shea Butter, Sunflower Oil, Calendula, White Tea, Green Tea, Rooibos Tea, Lemon Oil | 6.7 oz\nButt Naked Baby\n{'Brand': 'Butt Naked Baby', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Active Ingredients': 'Vitamin_e', 'Unit Count': '6.7 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '7.52 x 2.24 x 2.09 inches; 7.8 Ounces'}\nI really wanted to like this. The name, packaging and labeling is cute. \u201cThe 91%\u201d organic label on the front was odd, yet reassuring that they are a transparent and honest brand (I mean, where else have you seen such a random percentage?) Yet, when I smelled it, I did not like it. At all. I can\u2019t describe it really; it\u2019s a faint, cheap perfumey sunflower smell. I didn\u2019t like it for our toddler and couldn\u2019t even tolerate it for me. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m really that picky of a person, but I just didn\u2019t jive with the smell. I even offered it to my husband because he likes organic lotions for the back of his arms where he has some KP but even he didn\u2019t like it! I guess in a pinch we could use it, but it will not be preferred over other scents.\nThe packaging is cute, the smell is not\nNEW Challenger Men's Rinse Free Hand Wash - 1oz - Portable, 30% Alcohol Hand Wash both Cleans & Moisturizes. Hydrates Hands, Forearms, & Skin - Cleansing 30% Alc. Based Formula Washes and Nourishes\nChallenger\n{'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Brand': 'Challenger', 'Scent': 'Aloe Vera', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '4 x 1 x 1 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '851264008338'}\nClean fresh scent and well moisturized after using. Not greasy at all, very happy with quality of this product. Sleek packaging and convenient size for car, home, or even keeping in your pockets. I highly recommend.\nGood option for hand sanitizer\nSoo'AE Sweet Pink Bubble Mask, Clarifying & Softening, 1 Count\nSOOAE\n{'Brand': 'SOOAE', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Product Benefits': 'Softening,Softer', 'Scent': 'Peach', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Product Dimensions': '3.5 x 0.1 x 5.5 inches; 0.32 Ounces'}\nI\u2019m pretty spoiled when it comes to facial products. I would say this is fine, not great, not terrible. It is a nicely packaged one time mask for a little at home spa day, but not something I\u2019d go out and purchase over and over. It would make a really nice stocking stuffer or small gift for someone.\nIt\u2019s nice! But not incredible\nRose Quartz Roller with Derma Roller 0.25mm, Facial Kit with Microneedle and Pink Jade Rollers\nLOLYSENTA\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.1 x 5.1 x 1.6 inches; 8.78 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'LS17', 'UPC': '850002524062', 'Manufacturer': 'LOLYSENTA, LLC'}\nWhat I liked? Really beautiful roller and I thought the derma roller was really cool...until I read the instructions. \u201cRoll back and forth 4-5 times...only apply light pressure and do not PUNCTURE the skin....sterilize the roller before and after each use for 30 MINUTES in disinfecting alcohol\u201d. Y\u2019all, I\u2019m a busy mom with a toddler, I do not have the time to disinfect something for almost an hour each time I use it, and by use it, I mean roll it 4-5 times total. So while the jade roller is really beautiful and easy to use in of itself, this derma roller kinda seems...extra. I personally would prefer this to just be the roller; I\u2019m too worried about actually using the roller incorrectly and hurting my skin, so I\u2019ll just leave that type of work to the professionals. If you are looking for a jade roller only, there are lots of other options. If you want the full derma experience, then this option would be great for you.\nReally nice combo, but with one caveat\nKidskin- Foaming Body Wash with Tea Tree Oil- Helps Combat Body and Foot Odor and Stubborn Body Acne and Skin Issues - Cruelty Free, Gluten Free, Paraben Free, Sulfate Free, Unscented, and Vegan- Made in USA\nKidskin\n['Kidskin Foaming Body Wash with Tea Tree Oil is designed exclusively for teens, tweens, pre teens, and boys and girls to work as an effective, yet gentle body wash.

Has a nice, strong tea tree smell but it's not so overpowering that it's annoying.
