It does kinda feel like jelly and doesn\u2019t lather up super great for me, but it gets the job done and makes my face feel good. Haven\u2019t broken out or had irritated skin from it. The smell is light and reminds me of something I can\u2019t put my finger on...maybe light citrus candy or something? It smells pretty good to me and I enjoy washing with this in the shower. Good size too!\nA pleasant, non-irritating face wash\nStudy Buddy Clay Mask with Detoxifying Bentonite, 3 fl. oz., Exfoliates, Brightens and Clears Pores, Clay Draws Out Impurities and Improves Skin's Texture and Tone by Higher Education Skincare\nHigher Education\n{'Brand': 'Higher Education', 'Item Form': 'Clay', 'Product Benefits': 'Exfoliating', 'Scent': 'Exfoliating', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.6 x 3.6 x 1.3 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'UPC': '811381035006'}\nI love a good face mask - this hits all the marks for me. It is thick and basically feels like wet pottery in your hands (hence the clay), smells nice (somewhat perfume-y) and most importantly, feels like something I\u2019d get at a spa. When I first put it on, I was surprised by the warming sensation, since I didn\u2019t realize it had that effect. I liked it! I\u2019ve had masks like that before and they just add another dimension to the experience. I left it on for 10 minutes and washed it right off. Some clay masks I\u2019ve used are hard to wash off - not this one. Face felt smooth and had no irritation afterward. I really like this brand.\nWarming sensation is so good\nButt Naked Baby Organic Sunshine Lotion | Everyday Moisturizer | Lightweight, Non-Greasy | Normal-to-Dry Skin | Aloe, Shea Butter, Sunflower Oil, Calendula, White Tea, Green Tea, Rooibos Tea, Lemon Oil | 6.7 oz\nButt Naked Baby\n{'Brand': 'Butt Naked Baby', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Active Ingredients': 'Vitamin_e', 'Unit Count': '6.7 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '7.52 x 2.24 x 2.09 inches; 7.8 Ounces'}\nI really wanted to like this. The name, packaging and labeling is cute. \u201cThe 91%\u201d organic label on the front was odd, yet reassuring that they are a transparent and honest brand (I mean, where else have you seen such a random percentage?) Yet, when I smelled it, I did not like it. At all. I can\u2019t describe it really; it\u2019s a faint, cheap perfumey sunflower smell. I didn\u2019t like it for our toddler and couldn\u2019t even tolerate it for me. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m really that picky of a person, but I just didn\u2019t jive with the smell. I even offered it to my husband because he likes organic lotions for the back of his arms where he has some KP but even he didn\u2019t like it! I guess in a pinch we could use it, but it will not be preferred over other scents.\nThe packaging is cute, the smell is not\nNEW Challenger Men's Rinse Free Hand Wash - 1oz - Portable, 30% Alcohol Hand Wash both Cleans & Moisturizes.
