It is thick and basically feels like wet pottery in your hands (hence the clay), smells nice (somewhat perfume-y) and most importantly, feels like something I\u2019d get at a spa. When I first put it on, I was surprised by the warming sensation, since I didn\u2019t realize it had that effect. I liked it! I\u2019ve had masks like that before and they just add another dimension to the experience. I left it on for 10 minutes and washed it right off. Some clay masks I\u2019ve used are hard to wash off - not this one. Face felt smooth and had no irritation afterward. I really like this brand.\nReview Title: Warming sensation is so good\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

It does kinda feel like jelly and doesn\u2019t lather up super great for me, but it gets the job done and makes my face feel good. Haven\u2019t broken out or had irritated skin from it. The smell is light and reminds me of something I can\u2019t put my finger on...maybe light citrus candy or something? It smells pretty good to me and I enjoy washing with this in the shower.
