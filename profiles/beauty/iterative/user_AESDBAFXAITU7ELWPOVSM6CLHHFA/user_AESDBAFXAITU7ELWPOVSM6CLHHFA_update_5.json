Out the package the hair was a bit dry but i washed it and then deep conditioned and the hair had a nice wave to it and was soooooo soft, no shedding, few small hairs and true to length. I colored the ends using Loreal Hicolor in the color natural blonde and the hair colored amazing. Did not damage the hair and the color is so vibrant and amazing. The only reason im giving this 4 stars is because the ends of the hair were thinner than any hair i've ever receieved. But the hair is absolutely gorg. Ive had this hair for almost 2 months and still is as soft and great as when I purchased it. This hair never tangles and I only get 1-2 strands of shedding per day if that.\nReview Title: Soooooo Soft.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
