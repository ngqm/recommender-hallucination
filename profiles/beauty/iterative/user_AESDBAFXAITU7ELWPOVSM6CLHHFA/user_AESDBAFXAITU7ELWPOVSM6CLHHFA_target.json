I got color #2 in 14 and 16 in. Then got a #33 14in and #4 16in. This hair was colored so perfectly. The texture of the hair was great and the bundles have a great luster. The bundles have thin ends and that's the only thing I disliked. But for the price of the bundles I expected that. No tangling, shedding, the color is even and the wig turned out great a pop with the peek a boo color underneath. I wore it to a concert and was asked 3 times about my hair. Good Buy!\nReview Title: So Silky and Flowy!!!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I usually get the 10 or 12 inch closures but this time I got the 18 inch closure and its still beautiful. The hair is soft and luscious as always and the ends are healthy and full. I used these closure every time I make a wig I DO NOT WEAR SEW-INS only wigs. I have purchased over 15 of these closures, I love them and will continue to buy.\nGreat closure and great hair as ALWAYS!!\nMoroccan Argan Oil Shampoo, 8 Fl Oz - Smooths and Repairs - Sulfate Free - Natural - Imported from Morocco by Pure Body Naturals\nPure Body Naturals\n{'Brand': 'Pure Body Naturals', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Hair Type': 'All, Color Treated', 'Scent': 'Coconut', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '3.9 x 5.91 x 5.91 inches; 8 Ounces', 'UPC': '646437736398 646437319751'}\nThis is some great shampoo. I have tried several argan oil shampoos and this is by far the best. Great smell and leaves the hair soft before conditioning. Usually with shampoo, the hair feels dry but not with this. I even used this one time without conditioning afterwards and my hair was still soft and smelled really good.\nI have tried several Argan oil shampoos and this is by far the best.\nSunwell Brazilian Virgin Human Hair Closure 3.5x4 Kinky Curly Human Hair Lace Closure with Baby Hair Bleached Knots Natural Color Free Part 10\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '9 x 6.5 x 0.3 inches; 0.64 Ounces', 'UPC': '732840237895'}\nOrdered 3 curly bundles from another vendor and needed a closure. This closure blended great. I bleached the knots of the closure. Soft and great hair. This texture of hair requires heavy maintenance but it's amazing hair for the price.\nLove this texture.\nATOZWIG 7A Malaysian Virgin Hair Straight Lace Frontal Closure 13\"x4\" Lace Frontal Closure Soft Malaysian Straight Closure 16 inch\n{'Package Dimensions': '9.5 x 7.5 x 0.5 inches; 1.6 Ounces'}\nGreat Frontal.

Out the package the hair was a bit dry but i washed it and then deep conditioned and the hair had a nice wave to it and was soooooo soft, no shedding, few small hairs and true to length. I colored the ends using Loreal Hicolor in the color natural blonde and the hair colored amazing. Did not damage the hair and the color is so vibrant and amazing. The only reason im giving this 4 stars is because the ends of the hair were thinner than any hair i've ever receieved. But the hair is absolutely gorg. Ive had this hair for almost 2 months and still is as soft and great as when I purchased it. This hair never tangles and I only get 1-2 strands of shedding per day if that.\nSoooooo Soft.\nUSOFT Brazilian Virgin Straight Human Hair Bundles 1 Bundle (20 inch) Natural Color 100% Unprocessed 8A Grade Brazilian Virgin Hair Soft And Tangle Free\n{'Color': 'Natural', 'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Extension Length': '20 Inches', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '8 x 5 x 0.7 inches; 3.52 Ounces', 'UPC': '613852777947'}\nGreat hair super soft and full.
