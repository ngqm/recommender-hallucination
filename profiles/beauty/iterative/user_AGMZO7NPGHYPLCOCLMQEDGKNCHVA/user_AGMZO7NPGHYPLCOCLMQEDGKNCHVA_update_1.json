I will also mention that when I made my purchase, it was sold as one cover for $8.50. It is a very long lasting cover! Not only did it survive 7 months of use in school, it has been part of my cover collection used for almost 2 years in my practice. It has been laundered and has held up beautifully - no rips, tears, fading or loss of softness. I am considering purchasing more now as my clientele has grown. With the current offer of $32 for a pack of 6, that makes each cover only a little over $5 each. With the track record the one I already have has, I am more than confident in purchasing more!\nReview Title: Lasts and Lasts\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
