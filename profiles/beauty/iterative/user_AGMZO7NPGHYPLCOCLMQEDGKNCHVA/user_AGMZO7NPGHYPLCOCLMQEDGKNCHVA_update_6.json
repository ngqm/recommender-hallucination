I have found that it is tasteless, odorless and does give me very soft lips by the next morning. However, it is extremely thick and sticky and it doesn't absorb very well. I apply it right before bed and no matter how careful I am to apply a very small amount I always need to use a tissue to dab the excess off so my lips don't stick to my pillowcase and so lint isn't attracted to and stick to my lips while I sleep. So, even though I have soft lips in the A.M., this is a pass for me.\nReview Title: Gives soft lips but doesn't absorb well\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Face Cradle Cover - APPEARUS Massage Fitted Headrest Covers (6 Count/BD1005x6)\nAPPEARUS\n{'Brand': 'APPEARUS', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Care Instructions': 'Machine Wash', 'Package Dimensions': '11.9 x 4.2 x 1.2 inches; 1.6 Ounces', 'UPC': '794168357655'}\nI purchased this cover January 17, 2011 when I started massage therapy school. I will also mention that when I made my purchase, it was sold as one cover for $8.50. It is a very long lasting cover! Not only did it survive 7 months of use in school, it has been part of my cover collection used for almost 2 years in my practice. It has been laundered and has held up beautifully - no rips, tears, fading or loss of softness. I am considering purchasing more now as my clientele has grown. With the current offer of $32 for a pack of 6, that makes each cover only a little over $5 each. With the track record the one I already have has, I am more than confident in purchasing more!\nLasts and Lasts\nCURECODE Neuromide Ampoule (30 ml), Concentrated Formula of Active Ingredients, Microbiome Science for Extremely Sensitive & Dry Skin, Repair and Protect Skin Barrier Function, Brightening and Firming for Mature Skin Types\nCURECODE\n{'Brand': 'CURECODE', 'Scent': 'Aloe Vera', 'Item Form': 'Serum', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Product Dimensions': '1.5 x 1.5 x 4.25 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'Item model number': '40006'}\nI got this CURECODE serum in hopes of introducing more moisture to my dry face (gotta love winter). The very first thing I noticed was that, while there are directions on the box, there are NO instructions on the bottle itself. I'm not in the habit of keeping the packaging (who does that?!).. they need to add the directions onto the bottle label!<br /><br />The serum itself is pleasing. There was NO scent (THANK YOU!), my sensitive skin had no negative reactions at all and I was pleased with the thickness. It didn't completely absorb into my skin.. I had a few pieces of pillow lint (flannel sheets) stuck to my cheeks the next morning. I can't say how well it works long term yet, but I have high hopes as my skin was more supple the next am. I will update this review if I have any negative reactions.\nPlease put the directions on the bottle!\nFrench Girl Hibernation Essentials\nFRENCH GIRL\n{'Brand': 'FRENCH GIRL', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Product Benefits': 'Cleansing,Hydrating', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Package Dimensions': '7.52 x 5.59 x 3.58 inches; 14.46 Ounces', 'UPC': '850000595255'}\nThe cuticle oil is so very hydrating. My cuticles (both on my feet and hands) are always dry and cracked and this oil really helped them not only look better but feel so much better! I appreciated the easy roll-on applicator too. The body lotion is a decent lotion. I wouldn't say it is earth-shattering or mind-blowing.. but it does smell really good and the scent isn't too overwhelming or powerful. My grandma is sensitive to powerful scents and she didn't turn her nose up at it so there's that. It is a decent thickness (not too runny or too thick), it absorbed relatively quickly and it makes my skin feel soft. The packaging is over the top, in a bad way. As a eco-minded person, the amount of packaging used was just ridiculous and unnecessary, IMO. My experience doesn't justify the price.. for the amounts you get and the average results are not equal to the price paid. Overall, this is a nice set and gift-worthy, but I probably won't purchase it again.\nDecent products but over-priced and over-packaged\nKYM NOVA Real Scrunchies for Hair, No Damage Hair Ties, Ponytail Holder Scrunchies, Assorted Scrunches Thick Hair\u00a0Bands Red 5 pack\nKYM NOVA\n{'Material': 'Cotton', 'Item Form': 'Scrunchie', 'Brand': 'KYM NOVA', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Item Weight': '50 Grams', 'Package Dimensions': '7.87 x 5.51 x 0.79 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '691206829757', 'Manufacturer': 'KYM NOVA'}\nFINALLY!! Hair scrunchies that will not only hold my thick, medium length hair in a ponytail but will also STAY in my hair! I am so tired of scrunchies that fall out of my hair. Seriously. But I got these and they stay put! I am SO happy that I don't have to mess with a falling ponytail all the time anymore! The colors are very nice and the elastic is the best I've ever found in a scrunchie. I will be buying more in other colors!!\nGot thick hair?

Add to that the scent is not overpowering and there was more than enough serum to get the job done.
