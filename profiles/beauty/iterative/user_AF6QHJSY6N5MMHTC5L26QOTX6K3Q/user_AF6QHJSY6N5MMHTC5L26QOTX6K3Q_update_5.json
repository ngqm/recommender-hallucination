One thing I am always on the lookout for is a good product to help with the occasional breakout in my T-zone or the god-awful cystic acne that pops up every so often along my chin and jaw. Since my cheeks are on the dry side, I've only used this on my T-zone to deal with some of the stubborn clogged pores there, and so far so good.  I like how the mask warms up a bit to help pores relax (if that's the right word since pores don't actually open or close) and the AHAs help to soften/dissolve the gunk inside the pores so it is easier to remove. Since I've not had to use more moisturizer than normal, this mask hasn't caused any dry or flaky skin. I also didn't leave it on for a full 20 minutes like the directions say you can do, instead opting to wash it off after just 10 (based on my patch test). Between the AHAs and the bentonite clay and the self-warming, I didn't want to push my skin to the point of irritation. The directions also say you can use this up to twice a week, but since I am also using retinol, I will likely keep this mask to once a week.<br /><br />After checking out their main site, I found this line was created by pediatric dermatologist specifically to deal with skin concerns/conditions more specifically associated with those in their early 20\u2019s such as stress breakouts, hormone changes, excess oil, etc., but they also offer products for dry and sensitive skin. I'm in my 40's and still deal with stress breakouts and hormone changes, and it's nice to see a product address the actual causes behind the breakouts rather than only the end result (the breakout itself).<br /><br />The packaging for this product gets its own star. A full set of directions, possible side effects, and ingredient list - all printed in multiple languages - is included in folded pamphlet form along with the product, so no more hanging on to the box 'just in case.'  You also get a little flag shaped card with a positive message printed on it is included. Tacky glued underneath is an information card underneath that says what the product is for, how to use it, what to expect, possible side effects, and a coupon code for either a percentage off or a free product if you decide to purchase directly from their main website.  Additionally, a sample packet of another of Higher Education's products is included for you to try.  You can tell that a lot of thought went into making the purchase and use of this product a pleasant experience.\nReview Title: Clogged pores rejoice!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "SALOCY Facial Mask Applicator,Facial Mask Brush 4 Piese with 2 Piese Cat ear Headbands\nSALOCY\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.8 x 4.9 x 1.7 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '756244688534'}\nLove the headbands, the brushes are pretty good. I took a pair of pliers and crimped down the metal onto the bristles so it held them better as I don't know how long the glue holding the bristles in will last after repeated washings. The handles are smooth and splinter free. The brush bristles are soft and won't scratch your skin, and smoothly applies masks from clay to gel. The bristles wash clean easily and haven't stained or changed color. The headbands are soft, totally adorable, and stay put. They wash well, but I've never put mine in the dryer and instead hang them up to air dry.\nGreat set for home spa\n10Pcs Foldable Duo Angled Eyebrow Brush and Spoolie Brush Mascara Applicator Eyelash Separator Eyebrow Grooming Brush Tool\nBTYMS\n{'Brand': 'BTYMS', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Eyelashes, Eyebrow, For Mascara', 'Material': 'Plastic', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Item Form': 'Wand', 'Number of Pieces': '10', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Ferrule Material': 'Aluminum', 'Package Dimensions': '6 x 2.4 x 0.7 inches; 0.81 Ounces'}\nThese turned out to be really well made little eyelash/eyebrow spoolies!  The brush side has soft bristles that are cut evenly and are securely attached to the base so there's been no bristle fallout anytime I use them. The spoolie side has a thick brush that works great to catch clumps and separate lashes. Both ends are easy to use, easy to clean, and the tool folds up for easy storage.  One thing I didn't overly like about this tool is how super lightweight it is - like 'light as a feather' light. Part of that is due to it only being just over four inches long, but from looking at the picture on the listing I expected these to weigh a bit more.  Another dislike is that none of the tools came with any protective sleeves on either end to protect the brush or spoolie. This was easily fixed by cutting up a drinking straw to slide over the brushes, but considering the nature of the brushes I had incorrectly thought that some type of cover would be on the brushes.  Still, for the price I can't gripe too much. These little guys do their jobs well and I have no complaints. I am happy to have backups for the one makeup tool that I seem to constantly lose or misplace.\nInexpensive but work perfectly\nSpa Grade Jade Roller for Face with Gua Sha | Jade Face Roller Massager | Jade Facial Roller | Face Roller Massager | Jade Rollers | Wrinkle Roller\nJane Cosmetics\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.1 x 3.4 x 1.2 inches; 4.8 Ounces', 'UPC': '814689026516', 'Manufacturer': 'Jane & Co.'}\nThis roller does indeed turn applying skin care products into a spa experience. Pop this baby in the fridge on hot summer days as a way to take your skin from tired to taut. Warm it up to help your skin absorb products more easily. It washes clean and doesn't absorb any of the products. The trouble comes from how it's put together. The metal caps that hold the rollers on each end of the wand/handle come off too easily. They aren't glued or crimped on, nor are the little metal caps snug fitting. Both ends where off when my roller arrived so I actually thought I had to assemble everything prior to each use. If I hold the roller up to where it's straight up and down, the roller that is facing the floor slides right off the handle. In a way this isn't a completely horrible thing since being able to disassemble the roller works better for travel.  Just please be careful when opening your storage bag and pulling out the roller in case yours is the same way. If it were to fall onto a hard enough surface from a high enough height, the rollers could crack or shatter.<br /><br />Aside from the poor craftsmanship, I do enjoy using this roller and not only for applying skincare products. Sticking the roller in the freezer for 20 minutes then using it on my face and neck when I am suffering from a migraine is a godsend. I recommend having two so that you can use one to battle your headache while the other one cools down. The rollers hold cold (or heat) for several minutes, and can be wonderful tools to help relieve pain from stuffed up sinuses as well as headaches. The little gua sha tool that is included is also wonderful for more than applying skin care products. Chilling the gua sha before use can help treat puffy eyes, headaches, small bruises, mosquito bites, foot massages, and so on. Both this and the roller are completely smooth  - no rough edges or bumps.<br /><br />Also included are a black velvet bag for storage, a handy booklet showing how to use both the roller and gua sha, and a hand written note thanking me for my purchase which is a really sweet gesture. All-in-all the tools are nice products, but for the price you'd think the manufacturers could afford glue to keep the rollers on the handle.\nNice but could be made better\nBololo Baby Hair Clippers - Quiet Kids Hair Trimmer, Cordless & Waterproof Chargeable, Children with Autism, ABS Ceramic Blade, Haircut Kit for Kids Infants Men and Women,Green,\nMOM&HOME\n{'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Trimming', 'Color': 'White', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'MOM&HOME', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.38 x 3.66 x 2.32 inches; 8.47 Ounces', 'Batteries': '1 Lithium Ion batteries required. (included)', 'UPC': '691608094128', 'Manufacturer': 'Mom&Home'}\nThis is an excellent set of clippers for more than just younger children. My nephew is on the spectrum and has trouble with various sensations and noise, so haircuts have always been an exercise in patience.<br /><br />Unlike other hair clippers, the sound level with these is lower and less irritating to him. The ceramic blades and guides are also more gentle on skin. He's been nicked before by barbers and stylists, and that has only added to this apprehension of getting his hair cut. The blades on this set of clippers isn't as sharp as what you'd find in a barbershop (probably because they are ceramic versus steel), so you do have to make a couple more passes to cut hair and to get a close shave on the neck, but that's okay because he doesn't fear being cut by these clippers.  The blade covers are also smoother without any edges from the plastic molds or those sharp little nodes from where plastic was injected into the molds or where the guides were snapped apart. It's almost as if they went through a sanding process. It's a little thing, but then again it's not, you know?<br /><br />Battery life is pretty good as well. One full charge is more than enough to get through a haircut even if the person has thick hair.\nGreat set of gentle clippers\nStudy Buddy Clay Mask with Detoxifying Bentonite, 3 fl. oz., Exfoliates, Brightens and Clears Pores, Clay Draws Out Impurities and Improves Skin's Texture and Tone by Higher Education Skincare\nHigher Education\n{'Brand': 'Higher Education', 'Item Form': 'Clay', 'Product Benefits': 'Exfoliating', 'Scent': 'Exfoliating', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.6 x 3.6 x 1.3 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'UPC': '811381035006'}\nI'm a wee bit of a skincare addict, and I love trying out products (my husband jokes that my bathroom looks like an Ulta blew up).
