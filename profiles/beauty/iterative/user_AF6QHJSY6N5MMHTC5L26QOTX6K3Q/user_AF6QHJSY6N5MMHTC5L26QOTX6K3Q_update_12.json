The ties with the longer ends look better than the ones with the little short ones, so the short ones are those I tend to wear only around the house.  Stretch is good, and there is enough fabric around the elastic that you don't risk tears when putting in your hair. I've laundered these every so often over the last year, and they come through just fine.<br /><br />Ignore the part of the listing that claims you get 75 pieces as you only get 10. Either that's from an old listing they reused for this set (which these companies do A LOT in order to keep positive review ratings from another product to make a new product look like a great option), or someone made a big mistake when entering the info for the listing.\nReview Title: Nice change from plain hair ties\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "SALOCY Facial Mask Applicator,Facial Mask Brush 4 Piese with 2 Piese Cat ear Headbands\nSALOCY\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.8 x 4.9 x 1.7 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '756244688534'}\nLove the headbands, the brushes are pretty good. I took a pair of pliers and crimped down the metal onto the bristles so it held them better as I don't know how long the glue holding the bristles in will last after repeated washings. The handles are smooth and splinter free. The brush bristles are soft and won't scratch your skin, and smoothly applies masks from clay to gel. The bristles wash clean easily and haven't stained or changed color. The headbands are soft, totally adorable, and stay put. They wash well, but I've never put mine in the dryer and instead hang them up to air dry.\nGreat set for home spa\n10Pcs Foldable Duo Angled Eyebrow Brush and Spoolie Brush Mascara Applicator Eyelash Separator Eyebrow Grooming Brush Tool\nBTYMS\n{'Brand': 'BTYMS', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Eyelashes, Eyebrow, For Mascara', 'Material': 'Plastic', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Item Form': 'Wand', 'Number of Pieces': '10', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Ferrule Material': 'Aluminum', 'Package Dimensions': '6 x 2.4 x 0.7 inches; 0.81 Ounces'}\nThese turned out to be really well made little eyelash/eyebrow spoolies!  The brush side has soft bristles that are cut evenly and are securely attached to the base so there's been no bristle fallout anytime I use them. The spoolie side has a thick brush that works great to catch clumps and separate lashes. Both ends are easy to use, easy to clean, and the tool folds up for easy storage.  One thing I didn't overly like about this tool is how super lightweight it is - like 'light as a feather' light. Part of that is due to it only being just over four inches long, but from looking at the picture on the listing I expected these to weigh a bit more.  Another dislike is that none of the tools came with any protective sleeves on either end to protect the brush or spoolie. This was easily fixed by cutting up a drinking straw to slide over the brushes, but considering the nature of the brushes I had incorrectly thought that some type of cover would be on the brushes.  Still, for the price I can't gripe too much. These little guys do their jobs well and I have no complaints. I am happy to have backups for the one makeup tool that I seem to constantly lose or misplace.\nInexpensive but work perfectly\nSpa Grade Jade Roller for Face with Gua Sha | Jade Face Roller Massager | Jade Facial Roller | Face Roller Massager | Jade Rollers | Wrinkle Roller\nJane Cosmetics\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.1 x 3.4 x 1.2 inches; 4.8 Ounces', 'UPC': '814689026516', 'Manufacturer': 'Jane & Co.'}\nThis roller does indeed turn applying skin care products into a spa experience. Pop this baby in the fridge on hot summer days as a way to take your skin from tired to taut. Warm it up to help your skin absorb products more easily. It washes clean and doesn't absorb any of the products. The trouble comes from how it's put together. The metal caps that hold the rollers on each end of the wand/handle come off too easily. They aren't glued or crimped on, nor are the little metal caps snug fitting. Both ends where off when my roller arrived so I actually thought I had to assemble everything prior to each use. If I hold the roller up to where it's straight up and down, the roller that is facing the floor slides right off the handle. In a way this isn't a completely horrible thing since being able to disassemble the roller works better for travel.  Just please be careful when opening your storage bag and pulling out the roller in case yours is the same way. If it were to fall onto a hard enough surface from a high enough height, the rollers could crack or shatter.<br /><br />Aside from the poor craftsmanship, I do enjoy using this roller and not only for applying skincare products. Sticking the roller in the freezer for 20 minutes then using it on my face and neck when I am suffering from a migraine is a godsend. I recommend having two so that you can use one to battle your headache while the other one cools down. The rollers hold cold (or heat) for several minutes, and can be wonderful tools to help relieve pain from stuffed up sinuses as well as headaches. The little gua sha tool that is included is also wonderful for more than applying skin care products. Chilling the gua sha before use can help treat puffy eyes, headaches, small bruises, mosquito bites, foot massages, and so on. Both this and the roller are completely smooth  - no rough edges or bumps.<br /><br />Also included are a black velvet bag for storage, a handy booklet showing how to use both the roller and gua sha, and a hand written note thanking me for my purchase which is a really sweet gesture. All-in-all the tools are nice products, but for the price you'd think the manufacturers could afford glue to keep the rollers on the handle.\nNice but could be made better\nBololo Baby Hair Clippers - Quiet Kids Hair Trimmer, Cordless & Waterproof Chargeable, Children with Autism, ABS Ceramic Blade, Haircut Kit for Kids Infants Men and Women,Green,\nMOM&HOME\n{'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Trimming', 'Color': 'White', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'MOM&HOME', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.38 x 3.66 x 2.32 inches; 8.47 Ounces', 'Batteries': '1 Lithium Ion batteries required. (included)', 'UPC': '691608094128', 'Manufacturer': 'Mom&Home'}\nThis is an excellent set of clippers for more than just younger children. My nephew is on the spectrum and has trouble with various sensations and noise, so haircuts have always been an exercise in patience.<br /><br />Unlike other hair clippers, the sound level with these is lower and less irritating to him. The ceramic blades and guides are also more gentle on skin. He's been nicked before by barbers and stylists, and that has only added to this apprehension of getting his hair cut. The blades on this set of clippers isn't as sharp as what you'd find in a barbershop (probably because they are ceramic versus steel), so you do have to make a couple more passes to cut hair and to get a close shave on the neck, but that's okay because he doesn't fear being cut by these clippers.  The blade covers are also smoother without any edges from the plastic molds or those sharp little nodes from where plastic was injected into the molds or where the guides were snapped apart. It's almost as if they went through a sanding process. It's a little thing, but then again it's not, you know?<br /><br />Battery life is pretty good as well. One full charge is more than enough to get through a haircut even if the person has thick hair.\nGreat set of gentle clippers\nStudy Buddy Clay Mask with Detoxifying Bentonite, 3 fl. oz., Exfoliates, Brightens and Clears Pores, Clay Draws Out Impurities and Improves Skin's Texture and Tone by Higher Education Skincare\nHigher Education\n{'Brand': 'Higher Education', 'Item Form': 'Clay', 'Product Benefits': 'Exfoliating', 'Scent': 'Exfoliating', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.6 x 3.6 x 1.3 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'UPC': '811381035006'}\nI'm a wee bit of a skincare addict, and I love trying out products (my husband jokes that my bathroom looks like an Ulta blew up). One thing I am always on the lookout for is a good product to help with the occasional breakout in my T-zone or the god-awful cystic acne that pops up every so often along my chin and jaw. Since my cheeks are on the dry side, I've only used this on my T-zone to deal with some of the stubborn clogged pores there, and so far so good.  I like how the mask warms up a bit to help pores relax (if that's the right word since pores don't actually open or close) and the AHAs help to soften/dissolve the gunk inside the pores so it is easier to remove. Since I've not had to use more moisturizer than normal, this mask hasn't caused any dry or flaky skin. I also didn't leave it on for a full 20 minutes like the directions say you can do, instead opting to wash it off after just 10 (based on my patch test). Between the AHAs and the bentonite clay and the self-warming, I didn't want to push my skin to the point of irritation. The directions also say you can use this up to twice a week, but since I am also using retinol, I will likely keep this mask to once a week.<br /><br />After checking out their main site, I found this line was created by pediatric dermatologist specifically to deal with skin concerns/conditions more specifically associated with those in their early 20\u2019s such as stress breakouts, hormone changes, excess oil, etc., but they also offer products for dry and sensitive skin. I'm in my 40's and still deal with stress breakouts and hormone changes, and it's nice to see a product address the actual causes behind the breakouts rather than only the end result (the breakout itself).<br /><br />The packaging for this product gets its own star. A full set of directions, possible side effects, and ingredient list - all printed in multiple languages - is included in folded pamphlet form along with the product, so no more hanging on to the box 'just in case.'  You also get a little flag shaped card with a positive message printed on it is included. Tacky glued underneath is an information card underneath that says what the product is for, how to use it, what to expect, possible side effects, and a coupon code for either a percentage off or a free product if you decide to purchase directly from their main website.  Additionally, a sample packet of another of Higher Education's products is included for you to try.  You can tell that a lot of thought went into making the purchase and use of this product a pleasant experience.\nClogged pores rejoice!\nFolora 4pcs Premium 1 Inch Wide Solid Color Floral Plaid Headband Set for Women Girls, Blue-2\nFolora\n{'Material': 'Plastic', 'Brand': 'Folora', 'Unit Count': '4.00 Count', 'Product Dimensions': '4.72 x 0.98 x 5.51 inches; 2.26 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'FLR-HB-4pcs Blue-2'}\nThis is a nice assortment of headbands for adding some pizzaz to your hair, but they are kind of frustrating when it comes to keeping your hair held back because the inside of the band is soft rather than having the little 'teeth' that help hold your hair in place. Unless you use bobby pins underneath to hold your hair back and use these headbands to cover up the pins, you will be constantly pulling this band off and sliding it back in place to rescuer your hair due to hair coming loose.  Not having the teeth makes these comfortable to wear, which makes these good for little ones who aren't fans of any pokey edges on their hair accessories. The bands are pretty thin, just fabric over plastic, so they don't weigh much at all (another plus) or squeeze your head too tight and cause a headache.  Overall I like them and how they look, but I wish they had at least a few teeth to help keep hair in place better.\nPretty headbands\n[the SAEM] Derma Plan Cleansing Bubble Pad 15pcs - One Step Gentle Makeup Cleansing Wipes Produce Fine & Dense Bubbles, Hypoallergenic Formula, Pore Clean, Mild Exfoliation\nTHESAEM\n{'Brand': 'THESAEM', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Unit Count': '15.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '3.9 x 3.9 x 1.8 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nI was so happy when I saw these little cleansing pads on Amazon! I was a HUGE fan of the just-add-water cleaning pads that used to be on the market several years ago (not sure if it was Ponds or Oil of Olay that made them), but then those stopped being sold. They were the best for traveling since they were dry until you planned to use them. Like these pads from the SAEM, you never had to worry about leakage in your bag, TSA pulling them, or the pads drying out. Just like those old cleansing pads, these also have a smooth side for cleansing and a textured side for exfoliating.  Unlike those other pads, these have a nifty little pocket to slide over your fingers.<br /><br />The cleanser used is pretty gentle, and the exfoliation aspect comes from the pad's textured side. The cleanser used smells wonderful and does a good job at getting off makeup and dirt. The textured side will exfoliate well enough to remove any flaky skin you may have, but if you suffer from acne and/or congested skin and blackheads, you will still need to use a chemical exfoliator to deal with the gunk down in your pores as this won't deal with that. Unlike pre-moistened cleansing pads and wipes, you will need to rinse your face afterwards with water. The soapy foam comes off completely without any residue that makes your skin feel sticky or oily. In fact, the cleanser the SAEM uses is gentle enough that my face didn't feel dry or tight, just clean.<br /><br />These little pads are also handy to have if you need to do a quick leg shave! If you need to do each full leg, one per each works. If you just need to get from the knee down, one pad should work for both. Get your leg wet, later up one of these pads, quickly wipe the pad of a section of leg, then shave. Repeat, then rinse off your legs. Desperate times, desperate measures, but it works.\nLove these little pads!\n5pcs Nail Art Liner Brushes, Lystaii Dual-ended Painting Nail Design Brush Pen Include Liner Brushes and Dotting Pen Nail Art Point Drill Drawing Brush Double Ended Dotting Tools Set 5,7,9,11,14mm\nLystaii\n{'Package Dimensions': '9.41 x 3.86 x 0.75 inches; 1.41 Ounces'}\nI am truly surprised by how great the brush end is of these nail tools. My prior set of nail art tools had brushes as well, but the tips were definitely NOT as precise as these. The quality of these brushes is definitely comparable to some of my more expensive art brushes I use for minuscule detail work. Even after cleaning, the bristles haven't frayed or bent and the points are still precise. I paint ceramic houses and people each year for my mom to add to the Christmas village I started for her some 30 years ago, and I plan to buy another set or two of these nail art brushes to use instead of my regular paint brushes because these work so much better. They are also a fraction of the cost for art brushes with such tiny tips. The only fault I have with these tools is that the brush end is not glued on. If you pull on the metal portion, it comes right off. They aren't so loose that they fall off on their own, but I did glue them on to keep the brushes securely in place. The ends with the little ball tips don't have this problem and are securely attached to the plastic shaft. I highly recommend these brushes not only for nail art, but for any art or painted craft projects you may have planned. Even with the loose brush caps, I have to give these five stars.\nAmazing as paint brushes, too!\nWig Head Wig Stands (Purple)\nBAIHONG\n{'Manufacturer': 'XUCHANG BAIHONG HAIR PRODUCTS CO., LTD.'}\nThis set of scrubby brushes with silicone points is a cheap but effective way at getting your scalp clean from all the products and dead skin that build up on it every day. Compared to the similar version that has hard plastic point, this style is much kinder to your skin while working just was effectively.  The first time you use one of these to help wash your hair you will notice a difference in how much cleaner your scalp and hair feels.  These little scrubbies are also fanatics for giving pets a bath because the points get down through their fur and help get their skin clean. They also help do a better job than just spraying water to get all the product out of your pet's fur while rinsing them off. I highly recommend using a hair catcher for your tub drain as these will also help your pet shedding process.<br /><br />Besides washing hair, these also work well for head massages if you have a headache (help increase blood flow), massaging in and distributing any serums/oils/tinctures you may be applying to your scalp to heal with hair growth, relaxing and gentle back massage (us lotion or oil so the points move easily across skin), grooming your cat or dog, or giving a gentle hip and leg massage to your pup if they are older and have arthritis. Heck, you can even use one for planting seeds - gently pack the dirt a little, level it flat, then use one of these to create perfect holes to place seeds in.  Kids can also use these to paint - dip in washable paint and make giant spirographs.  Oooh, they also work to gently itch things like hives or an allergic rash when you can't use something sharp like fingernails, and these can be easily disinfected.<br /><br />The included shower cap is okay. The outside is a light blue satiny material with a white edging that reminds me of the old fashioned sleep caps worn a centuries ago, like the grandma in \"Little Red Riding Hood.\"  The plastic lining is too loud and crinkly to be worn while sleeping. It's fine if used for a head covering while doing a deep conditioning treatment and it's easy to rinse clean. If you were to turn it inside out to use to keep your hair from getting wet, it would work fine for a bath but not for a shower. The white edging material is fabric and is on both sides of the cap, so that at least would get wet and possibly allow water to soak up through the rest of the fabric. Still, it's a nice little freebie that the seller includes.\ngreat for people and pets\nEmpty Brown Glass Spray Bottles2-Pack, Refillable 16 oz Containers for Essential Oils, Cleaning Products, Aromatherapy, Misting Plants, or Cooking - Reliable Sprayer with Mist and Stream Settings\nCherry\n{'Brand': 'Cherry', 'Material': 'Glass', 'Capacity': '16 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Product Care Instructions': 'Hand Wash Only', 'Package Dimensions': '9.09 x 6.46 x 3.35 inches; 4.94 Ounces', 'UPC': '791523234187'}\nThese two spray bottles are fairly decent for light to medium usage. They are glass, but not thick and hefty as you might expect. They feel like plastic even though they aren't. If dropped, these things are going to shatter. The internal spray tubes are plenty long enough to reach every bit of liquid in the bottle and wide enough to pull up good amounts of fluid. There's no excessive spraying because the amount discharged is so little. We've not had any trouble with the nozzles (going from on to off, clogging up, shooting the liquid off at a weird angle, etc). I don't recommend these for heavy duty work or for use in an area where they are likely to be knocked off to the floor.\nNot heavy duty glass\nHair Silk Scrunchies Satin Elastic Hair Bands Velvet Scrunchy Chiffon Hair Ties Ropes Scrunchie for Women Girls Hair Accessories (Chiffon 2-6PCS)\nDEVPSISR\n{'Material': 'Silk', 'Item Form': 'Scrunchie', 'Brand': 'DEVPSISR', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Number of Pieces': '6', 'Package Dimensions': '7.56 x 5.2 x 1.65 inches; 0.63 Ounces', 'UPC': '791535532806'}\nThey're tight enough to keep hair in place through high movement activities, but I really like that they don't rip out several strands of hair when I take them out. I love the daisy pattern, too. A little price for six, but on par with what you find in mass retail stores.\nCute, made well, and easy on hair.\n75 Pcs Hair Scrunchies Velvet Elastic Hair Bands Scrunchie Soft Hair Ties Ropes Scrunchy Ponytail Holder Hair Accessories,Great Gift for halloween Thanksgiving day and Christmas\nCehomi\n{'Material': 'Silk', 'Item Form': 'Scrunchie', 'Brand': 'Cehomi', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '7.94 x 6.74 x 2.74 inches', 'Hair Type': 'Thick, Thin', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '7.94 x 6.74 x 2.74 inches; 4.16 Ounces', 'UPC': '742186023960'}\nInexpensive and cute way to change up from the same old elastic hair bands anytime you want to put your hair up.
