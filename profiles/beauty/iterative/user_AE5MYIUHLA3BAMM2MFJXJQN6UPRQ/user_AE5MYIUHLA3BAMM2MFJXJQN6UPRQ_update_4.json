After the perfume warms up, you could clearly smell the scent that resembles tobacco. It also has hints of blueberry and rosemary. The silage is heavy and strong. I think this kind of a heavy scent is better suited for evenings. I do like the packaging. It looks classy and very elegant.\nReview Title: Strong silage\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "SwanMyst Curling Iron 1.5 inch Ceramic Hair Curling Wand 1 1 2 inch with Cool Tip and Heat Resistant Glove, Dual Voltage\nSwanMyst\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '17 x 3.9 x 2.4 inches; 1.15 Pounds', 'Manufacturer': 'SwanMyst'}\nThe hand curling wand works well. I have long hair and it allows me to curl the full length of the hair. It heats quickly and to high temperature. Curled hair hold their form for a while.\nWorks well for long hair\nCaudalie Favorites Set\n{'Package Dimensions': '9.09 x 6.54 x 2.05 inches; 9.59 Ounces', 'Item model number': '2346203'}\nThis is one of my favorite cosmetics brands. I\u2019ve been looking for portable sized bottles for a while. I love their scents and that they are based on grape ingredients. The set includes some of my favorites. One of them is the foaming cleanser that actually has lightweight and airy foam texture and Vinosource sorbet that has a great moisturizing effect on my skin and makes it look fresh. All of them have light scents that I like and and works gentle with my facial skin. This set is great if you would like to try a few things at once without spending extra money on the full bottles. I would also say that their size is perfect for traveling and it has nice packaging that might work as a gift.\nGood texture and light scents\nBFWood\nBFWood\n{'Brand': 'BFWood', 'Shape': 'Oblong', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Hair Type': 'All, Dry, Curly, Thick', 'Material': 'Nylon', 'Package Dimensions': '9.92 x 9.45 x 1.85 inches; 5.08 Ounces'}\nI have a good impression of this set. The brush feels pleasant my on head. I like the feel of natural wood in my hand. Works excellent as a brush as it\u2019s bristles are made of wood and don\u2019t scratch my scalp. It feels as if I\u2019m getting a massage. Comb works well also, especially with wet hair. Sometimes I have problems with knotty hair after a wash but the comb helps yo comb the knots out. Good value set.\nGood value set\nRETAL, Eau de Parfum 80 mL from the SAWALEF Boutique Range | Unisex Sweet Floral Niche Release | Long Lasting with Intense Sillage | Cologne for Men and Perfume for Women | by Swiss Arabian Oud\nSwiss Arabian\n{'Brand': 'Swiss Arabian', 'Item Volume': '100 Milliliters', 'Special Feature': 'Long Lasting', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Product Dimensions': '5.5 x 3 x 3.25 inches; 0.1 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'SP-619676'}\nThis perfume has a rather overwhelming scent to it.
