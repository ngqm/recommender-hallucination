I\u2019ve been looking for portable sized bottles for a while. I love their scents and that they are based on grape ingredients. The set includes some of my favorites. One of them is the foaming cleanser that actually has lightweight and airy foam texture and Vinosource sorbet that has a great moisturizing effect on my skin and makes it look fresh. All of them have light scents that I like and and works gentle with my facial skin. This set is great if you would like to try a few things at once without spending extra money on the full bottles. I would also say that their size is perfect for traveling and it has nice packaging that might work as a gift.\nReview Title: Good texture and light scents\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
