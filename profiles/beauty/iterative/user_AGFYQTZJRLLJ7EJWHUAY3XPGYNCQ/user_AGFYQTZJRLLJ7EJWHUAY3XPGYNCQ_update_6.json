I received exactly 50. They seem nice and sturdy. The one I tried out picked up the eye shadow color well, and also worked very nicely for blending.  I chose them for the longer handles, which are easier for me to use than short ones. The foam heads seem to be attached well and I'm trusting will hold up to cleaning, as I hope to be able to get multiple uses out of these (I don't want to be throwing away lots of plastic). If they do hold up there will be way more than I will need myself, but maybe I can find someone to share them with.\nReview Title: Seem to work well\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Professional Quality Nail Art Set With 3 Different Stamps/Stampers/Stamping Tools With Rubber Heads for Nails Designs/Patterns And Flat Head Scraper By VAGA\nVAGA\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'UPC': '646437939416'}\nI love these stampers. They all came individually packaged. They are comfortable for me to hold, fairly squishy with a tacky/slightly sticky feel, and all of them picked up images beautifully right out of the package with no priming. I like having the two colors, because white or very light colored polish will show up on the red. I think these are very good value for the price. It's nice that the scraper has a plastic, not metal edge. I still prefer credit/gift cards sor scraping, as theyare slightly flexible, but I think this one would work very well for anyone who prefers a stiffer scraper.\nVERY happy with this purchase.\nProfessional Quality Nail Art Set With 3 Different Stamps/Stampers/Stamping Tools With Rubber Heads for Nails Designs/Patterns And Flat Head Scraper By VAGA\nVAGA\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'UPC': '646437939416'}\nI love these stampers.

The stamping plates alone are *well* worth $3.99, even with shipping added.  I have always found Born Pretty plates to be good quality, and these are no exception. All the designs I have tried so far (most of them) have been well etched. The plates have sturdy plastic backings that extend slightly beyond the edges so you can grasp them without worrying about getting cut.  It's nice to have such a variety of different style designs to work with.The scraper is credit card style, which I like, but it is a little thinner and more flexible than I am used to using. I like a bit more body than this one has. Still it is usable. The stamper is small but nice. I like the transparent style so I can see where I am placing an image. I had a little trouble picking up polish with it at first, so I primed it by repeatedly stamping it on a lint roller, and now it works just fine. All in all, I would say this could be an excellent starter kit for anyone wanting to try nail stamping.<br /><br />The template with cutouts is something I hadn't tried before. The way it works is that you apply polish to the stamping plate and scrape it. Then lay the template on the stamping plate, and stamp on/through the opening. You need a fairly soft stamp for this to  press down through the opening. (The one in this kit works fine.) Then you stamp your nail. You have to work fairly quickly to get it placed after scraping the polish (or use polish that dries slowly), but it does work.. I will  say that the cut out areas are a little bit on the large side for my not too long nails. It might be fun to try using it to make decals, but I haven't gotten so far as trying that yet.<br /><br />So as a starter kit, or to expand your plate collection I would recommend this item. Note: I have no affiliation with the seller, and purchased this with my own funds-no promotional discount.\nThe plates alone are more than worth the price.\nNail Art Stamp Stamping Templates Stamping Tool Set 2.8cm Clear Silicone Stamper Scraper Stamping Plate Guide Template 6PCS\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.1 x 4.61 x 1.1 inches; 7.2 Ounces'}\nThis is such a good deal!
