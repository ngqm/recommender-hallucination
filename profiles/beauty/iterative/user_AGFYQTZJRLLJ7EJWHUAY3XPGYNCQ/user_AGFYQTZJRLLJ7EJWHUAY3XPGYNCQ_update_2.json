They all came individually packaged. They are comfortable for me to hold, fairly squishy with a tacky/slightly sticky feel, and all of them picked up images beautifully right out of the package with no priming. I like having the two colors, because white or very light colored polish will show up on the red. I think these are very good value for the price. It's nice that the scraper has a plastic, not metal edge. I still prefer credit/gift cards sor scraping, as theyare slightly flexible, but I think this one would work very well for anyone who prefers a stiffer scraper.\nReview Title: VERY happy with this purchase.\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
