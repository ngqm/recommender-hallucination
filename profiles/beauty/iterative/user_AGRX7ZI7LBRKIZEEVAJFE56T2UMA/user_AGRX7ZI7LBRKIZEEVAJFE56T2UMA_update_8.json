Lol, I got toothpaste everywhere and learned this the hard way. Functionally, the vibrations are powerful by default, so if you are sensitive like me, turn it down. I\u2019ve used it 4 times now and the first time it was strange, but now I am use to it. There are 5 different pulsating settings (see video). The plus and minus icons allow for easy and quick adjustment of how hard/soft - fast/slow the vibrating brush-head will pulsate. The bristles on the brush attachment is firm, but soft on gums; so there is some bend to the bristles and was comfortable for me. It sits on a charger to power it up via usb cord that plugs into standard charger plug. The case is beyond awesome. I travel for conferences and this stores the brush and charger with the brush head in a beautiful pink bottom and clear top hard case. Easy to pack and go. My teeth feels very clean after using this electronic toothbrush. For my set, I have 5 extra brush head attachments for exchanging after wearing out. This set looks exactly like advertised. I love the pink design. It is long and slender with sliver trim. My video will show the different settings and I hope you can hear the slight vibration changes because you could easily tell from the sound of the pulse by which setting it is on through a couple of uses. My favorite thing about it is that the charger is small and doesn\u2019t take up any room on the sink countertop. The travel case is sturdy. The quality of this brush is so great that I don\u2019t want to ever go back to a standard manual toothbrush. I highly recommend if you need a travel brush that is electronic! Update: A week later and I still love it! Everything works very well!!\nGreat travel toothbrush!\nPersephone Ombre Blonde Lace Front Wig Wavy Soft Brown Roots Ash Blonde Ombre Wigs for Women Glueless Long Wavy Synthetic Wig with Middle Parting Heat Resistant 22 Inches\nPersephone\n{'Color': 'Brown Roots Ash Blonde Ombre', 'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Special Feature': 'Glueless', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.7 x 6.2 x 2.3 inches; 14.39 Ounces', 'UPC': '708210345712'}\n[[VIDEOID:e6486dec3002b28b72d65864eaf95d53]] Y\u2019all!!! I can\u2019t give this wig enough stars! For the price, this is an outstanding wig - Persephone Ombr\u00e9 Blonde! Now, I cut the pace all the way back and place it about 1-2\u201d behind my hairline, so I\u2019ve pulled out my front hair to blend with the wig. It does have wig combs to keep it secure and, although it comes with an awesome wig cap, I do NOT wear a cap. Stays on securely all day. Great wig cap construction with adjustable straps to help custom to head. Didn\u2019t tangle. Soft! Huge fan!! This is an outstanding wig and the price is a great value!!! L O V E !!\nLOVE!\nMiss U Hair Long Wavy Dyeing Color Wig Burgundy Ombre Blonde Cosplay Costume Wig\nM MISS U HAIR\n{'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy', 'Style': 'Wavy', 'Brand': 'M MISS U HAIR', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '10.2 x 8 x 1.7 inches; 11.36 Ounces'}\n[[VIDEOID:70e9f5c0d3612527c251dde5937efab3]] This Miss U Hair is just pass shoulder length with good curl. This is a good quality character, cosplay, or Halloween wig. Cap construction is good and comfy, but no combs to secure in place, so it did slide around on my head. It came with a wig cap. The part is fluffy and thick, as is the hair line, so I was unable to get a natural look from forehead to hairline, but for the function of Cosplay character, this is on the higher quality.\nNice for Cosplay purposes.\nSam&Helen Magnetic Eyelashes With Eyeliner Kit, 5Pairs Magnetic Eyelashes And 2 Tubes Magnetic Eyeliners With Eyelash Applicator-No Glue Needed\nSam&Helen\n{'Brand': 'Sam&Helen', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '5.51 x 5.71 x 0.63 inches', 'Material Feature': 'Gluten Free', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Mounting Type': 'Eyelash Glue', 'Product Dimensions': '5.51 x 5.71 x 0.63 inches; 2.4 Ounces'}\n[[VIDEOID:f429642b52f8b0f5ebb4606cb77edc77]] I love these magnetic eyelashes. It\u2019s so much easier than applying glue, in my opinion. I did two thin layers of magnetic eyeliner and allowed to dry. It did stick to my upper lid when I moved my eyelids up as I waited for them to dry. Once dry, I used the tweezer to apply the magnet eyelash. Each eyelash has tiny magnetics that adhere to the liner. I was pleasantly surprised that it worked!! The tweezers was not helpful to me for applying, and the second lash I applied with my hands without a problem. Beautiful lashes!! Wore them all day yesterday and wasn\u2019t uncomfortable at all. Didn\u2019t come off in the wind going to dinner. I simply removed with my hands to replace on the storage palette and removed liner with coconut oil. Lashes are glamorous and reusable. LOVE THEM!!!\nWorks great for all day wear!!!\nAokiya Short Blonde Bob Wig with Bangs Ombre Brown Wigs for Women Straight Synthetic Cosplay Wigs (14 Inch)\nAokiya\n{'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Brand': 'Aokiya', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '11.1 x 6.5 x 2.3 inches; 8.01 Ounces'}\n[[VIDEOID:b006e218d4cd890bb0d873b2068e6133]] This is a very pretty light brown ombr\u00e9 to blonde, above the shoulders, bob-style wig. Better than I expected! I was expecting a cosplay type, but this is a very natural and great quality wig! It didn\u2019t have combs in the cap construction, but the adjustment hook straps in the back nape is present for tightening. Feels silky soft. Hair moves beautifully! The part is not a free- part and it will show some wefts if altered. I wanted to see if I could create a side vs middle part and was not successful. Overall, I\u2019m surprised at the quality and realness of the wig! I recommend!\nGreat natural looking wig!!\nSUIBOBO skincare pink rose quartz jade roller and Essential Oil bottle eye roller-real jade crystal gem stone marble cuarzo ice cold anti aging anti puff facial face roller eye roller massager\nSUIBOBO\n['\u221a In Time Service -there is instruction paper in the set to help you to use them.And as you know the squeak free jade quartz roller is fragile, easy to be damage in transit, though we pack it very carefully.

The essential oil bottle rolls a smooth amount of my favorite RoseHip Oil on my face to follow up with a relaxing rose quartz face roller. Beautiful set!

It is very shiny and staticky, but a sprinkle of powder will tone that shine. I did it fast and it definitely needs a bit more powder, but it did reduce shine for a more realistic hair wig. The cap construction is very nice, but there are NO combs or clips, which is common for a banged wig. I\u2019m a 21\u201d wig wearer and this fit me comfortably with my long/thick hair in a bun at the nape of my neck. Long! I\u2019m 5\u20192-ish and this hit me lower back. I brushed this wig several times and ran a dryer sheet over it for static. No loose hairs yet. Overall, this does look wiggy with shine and static, but for a cosplay wig, it lays very naturally and moves well. Decent wig for a natural wear and excellent wig for a cosplay wear!\nGreat Cosplay Wig!\n3 Pieces Messy Donut Chignons Hair Piece Scrunchies Synthetic Extensions Updo Hair Bun for Women Scrunchies #12/24 Dark Blonde\nSHINYSHOW\n{'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Brand': 'SHINYSHOW', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '3.94 x 3.94 x 1.18 inches; 2.47 Ounces', 'UPC': '738630490303'}\nWow, I can\u2019t love these enough!! 3 curly bun wraps to add so much volume to my bun!!
