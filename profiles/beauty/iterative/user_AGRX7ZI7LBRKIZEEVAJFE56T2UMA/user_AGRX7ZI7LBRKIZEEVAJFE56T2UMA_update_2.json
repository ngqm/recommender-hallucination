I can\u2019t give this wig enough stars! For the price, this is an outstanding wig - Persephone Ombr\u00e9 Blonde! Now, I cut the pace all the way back and place it about 1-2\u201d behind my hairline, so I\u2019ve pulled out my front hair to blend with the wig. It does have wig combs to keep it secure and, although it comes with an awesome wig cap, I do NOT wear a cap. Stays on securely all day. Great wig cap construction with adjustable straps to help custom to head. Didn\u2019t tangle. Soft! Huge fan!! This is an outstanding wig and the price is a great value!!!

Lol, I got toothpaste everywhere and learned this the hard way. Functionally, the vibrations are powerful by default, so if you are sensitive like me, turn it down. I\u2019ve used it 4 times now and the first time it was strange, but now I am use to it. There are 5 different pulsating settings (see video). The plus and minus icons allow for easy and quick adjustment of how hard/soft - fast/slow the vibrating brush-head will pulsate. The bristles on the brush attachment is firm, but soft on gums; so there is some bend to the bristles and was comfortable for me. It sits on a charger to power it up via usb cord that plugs into standard charger plug. The case is beyond awesome. I travel for conferences and this stores the brush and charger with the brush head in a beautiful pink bottom and clear top hard case. Easy to pack and go. My teeth feels very clean after using this electronic toothbrush. For my set, I have 5 extra brush head attachments for exchanging after wearing out. This set looks exactly like advertised. I love the pink design. It is long and slender with sliver trim. My video will show the different settings and I hope you can hear the slight vibration changes because you could easily tell from the sound of the pulse by which setting it is on through a couple of uses. My favorite thing about it is that the charger is small and doesn\u2019t take up any room on the sink countertop. The travel case is sturdy. The quality of this brush is so great that I don\u2019t want to ever go back to a standard manual toothbrush. I highly recommend if you need a travel brush that is electronic! Update: A week later and I still love it! Everything works very well!!\nGreat travel toothbrush!\nPersephone Ombre Blonde Lace Front Wig Wavy Soft Brown Roots Ash Blonde Ombre Wigs for Women Glueless Long Wavy Synthetic Wig with Middle Parting Heat Resistant 22 Inches\nPersephone\n{'Color': 'Brown Roots Ash Blonde Ombre', 'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Special Feature': 'Glueless', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.7 x 6.2 x 2.3 inches; 14.39 Ounces', 'UPC': '708210345712'}\n[[VIDEOID:e6486dec3002b28b72d65864eaf95d53]] Y\u2019all!!!
