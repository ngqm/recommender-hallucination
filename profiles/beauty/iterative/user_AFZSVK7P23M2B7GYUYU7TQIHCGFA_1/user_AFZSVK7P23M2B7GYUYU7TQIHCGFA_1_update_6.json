Also the delineation between the four prongs blended into one.<br />It could have been better but sadly it's not working.\nStarted off good but\nQIC 4D Silk Fiber Lash Mascara, Fiber Mascara, Waterproof Mascara, Natural Thick Thickening and Lengthening Mascara Lasting All Day, Waterproof, Smudge Proof Eyelashes\nJoruby\n{'Special Feature': 'Smudge Proof, Waterproof', 'Brand': 'Joruby', 'Specialty': 'Waterproof', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Information': 'Tube', 'Package Dimensions': '5.1 x 2 x 1 inches; 0.63 Ounces'}\nI'm always looking for a good mascara that will make my lashes appear thicker and longer.  I thought this product worked well.  Some other fiber mascara 's have various steps to achieve this while this is a one step process.  I do  find d the fiber mascara to be thicker and sticker than traditional mascara 's.<br />Although this does have a faint odor it worked well\nGood but a little smelly\nPurple Hair Mask for Blonde with Keratin & Jojoba Oil - Platinum & Silver Hair - Instantly Eliminate Brassiness & Yellows - Made in USA - Hair Toner - Bleached & Highlighted Hair - Sulfate Free - 8 oz\nWELLUTION\n{'Brand': 'WELLUTION', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Hair Type': 'Damaged,Dry,Color-treated', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating Treatment', 'Package Dimensions': '3.07 x 2.9 x 2.8 inches; 8 Ounces', 'UPC': '749715278440'}\nI\u2019m outside a lot in the summer and my hair sees a lot of sun and chlorine from the pool.  It\u2019s also becoming lighter with more grey.  I was excited about trying this.  I\u2019ve used it for a few days and adult didn\u2019t notice a huge change in the tone.  It does feel somewhat softer though<br />I\u2019m also not a fan of the packaging.  There isn\u2019t a pump or squeeze bottle. You just stick your hand in the jar.\nNot a change in tone\nPHOERA 30ml Foundation Liquid Full Coverage 24HR Matte Oil Control Concealer (Nude & Buff Beige) with 6ml Makeup Face Primer & Kabuki Foundation Brush Flat Top\nSIGHTLING\n{'Product Dimensions': '1.18 x 0.79 x 1.18 inches; 4.97 Ounces', 'UPC': '779296966696'}\nI really liked the look and feel of this foundation.  It went on easily for a full coverage smooth look.  I usually use a sponge when applying foundation but I really liked the easy of the brush.  The only downside is that neither color worked.\nGreat coverage\nLAPOTHICELL Blemish Out Serum 55mL, Blemish care, soothing care, for brighten & luminous skin\nLAPOTHICELL\n{'Product Dimensions': '1.65 x 1.65 x 4.13 inches; 3.77 Ounces'}\nI've been using this for about a week a cm I know it usually takes about 21 days to see a change but I'm hopeful that the positive results will continue.  I have sun damage spots and I'm  hoping to diminish them for a more even skin tone.  This product is easy to use.  You use the dropper and spread the product on you face.  I like to use at night after washing my face but I suppose you can use it in the morning if you prefer.  It does go on a little sticky but it dries quickly.\nRefreshing\nLUXAZA 6 PCS Purple Eyeshadow Stick,Light Shimmer Cream Eyeshadow Crayon,Pro Smoky Waterproof & Long Lasting Eyeshadow Stick Set\nLUXAZA\n{'Brand': 'LUXAZA', 'Item Form': 'Crayon,Cream Eyeshadow', 'Finish Type': 'Metallic', 'Special Feature': 'Waterproof, Long lasting', 'Product Benefits': 'Long Lasting', 'Package Dimensions': '5.83 x 5 x 0.87 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nThese are fun and easy to use.
