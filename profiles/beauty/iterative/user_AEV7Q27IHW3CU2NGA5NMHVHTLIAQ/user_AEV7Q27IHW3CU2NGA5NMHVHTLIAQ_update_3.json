My skin feels refreshed and truly soft after using, without need to resort to facial cloths to do the scrubbing. A double pea size amount goes a long way for scrubbing face and neck, so amount will last a long while. 4/5.\nReview Title: Pleased with scrubbing properties, smells a little chemically\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

It cuts with precision, even toenails that are thick or semi ingrown. curvature of clip is wide so it will not clip nails leaving edges, and you do not have to use more than once per nail except toe nail. I also like the little case that does with it and the curved body gives thumb more leverage to hold in place when clipping. It comes with a nail filer but I didn't find much use for it.\nStrong clipping power, case is great for traveling\nGrinding Away Skin Polishing Scrub, 3 fl. oz., Polishing Scrub Works to Improve Skin's Texture and Tone by Buffing Away Dead Skin Cells by Higher Education Skincare\nHigher Education\n{'Brand': 'Higher Education', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Product Benefits': 'Smoother', 'Material Feature': 'Gluten Free, Cruelty Free', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.59 x 3.58 x 1.61 inches; 3 Ounces', 'UPC': '811381031008'}\nAlthough the Higher Education facial scrub has a bit of a chemical induced rather than fragrant smell, its texture and cleansing power is great at getting rid of dead skin cells and dull patches.
