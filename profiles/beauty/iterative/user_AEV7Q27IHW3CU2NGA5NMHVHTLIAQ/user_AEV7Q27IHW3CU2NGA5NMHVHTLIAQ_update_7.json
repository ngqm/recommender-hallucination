After each morning use of a few drops, my face is hydrated for the rest of the day and the moisture it provides is even more long-lasting in more humid/hot weather. Although not too viscous, it can become sticky if you apply more than necessary, so a small amount is enough to give your skin the desired effects. Also perfect for sensitive skin and it has a very very faint floral smell that is undetectable soon after applying.\nReview Title: Perfect viscosity for face, a little goes a long way\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I use liquid foundation and I noticed that the sponge was soaking up the makeup. I started using these only to apply powdered makeup like rouge or shimmer and they work very well.\ngood for powder but not liquid makeup\nManicure and Pedicure Nail Clipper from POWERGROOMING - Powerful Trimmer for Thick and Thin Finger Nails and Toe Nails - Included Nail File and\"Catcher\" for Easy Cleanup (1 Pack)\nPOWERGROOMING\n{'Brand': 'POWERGROOMING', 'Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Blade Edge': 'Straight', 'Blade Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Target Audience': 'Women, Men', 'Package Dimensions': '3.8 x 1.3 x 1 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'UPC': '653233212735', 'Manufacturer': 'POWERGROOMING'}\nThis has been one of my favorite nail clippers I have used. It cuts with precision, even toenails that are thick or semi ingrown. curvature of clip is wide so it will not clip nails leaving edges, and you do not have to use more than once per nail except toe nail. I also like the little case that does with it and the curved body gives thumb more leverage to hold in place when clipping. It comes with a nail filer but I didn't find much use for it.\nStrong clipping power, case is great for traveling\nGrinding Away Skin Polishing Scrub, 3 fl. oz., Polishing Scrub Works to Improve Skin's Texture and Tone by Buffing Away Dead Skin Cells by Higher Education Skincare\nHigher Education\n{'Brand': 'Higher Education', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Product Benefits': 'Smoother', 'Material Feature': 'Gluten Free, Cruelty Free', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.59 x 3.58 x 1.61 inches; 3 Ounces', 'UPC': '811381031008'}\nAlthough the Higher Education facial scrub has a bit of a chemical induced rather than fragrant smell, its texture and cleansing power is great at getting rid of dead skin cells and dull patches. My skin feels refreshed and truly soft after using, without need to resort to facial cloths to do the scrubbing. A double pea size amount goes a long way for scrubbing face and neck, so amount will last a long while. 4/5.\nPleased with scrubbing properties, smells a little chemically\nMoisturizing Facial Emulsion for Restoring Hydrating Smoothing Skin from Manilla Natural Skincare\nManilla Natural Skincare\n{'Brand': 'Manilla Natural Skincare', 'Scent': 'Coconut', 'Item Form': 'Serum', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Fl Oz', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.5 x 1.5 x 5.9 inches; 2.19 Ounces'}\nThe nudity facial emulsion absorbs quirkily and without leaving residue. With a lightly scented floral fragrance, it feels and smells refreshing. However, moisture is short lasting if you have dry prone skin and would recommend adding a longer lasting moisturizer if you need good moisture for an 8 hour day.\nlight, fast absorbing\nCastor Oil (60ml) - w/Free Lash and Brow Brushes,Pure Castor Oil for Hair,Eyelashs,Eyebrows,Skin,Hair Growth and Face, Birthday Gifts for Women Men\nELBBUB\n{'Hair Type': 'Aging', 'Material Type Free': 'Chemical Free', 'Scent': 'Natural', 'Liquid Volume': '60 Milliliters', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Package Dimensions': '4.9 x 1.8 x 1.8 inches; 4.8 Ounces'}\nI have been using this castor oil to promote hair growth and calm the itchiness and discomfort of my scalp due to issues with dandruff. a few drops help soothe my scalp and after some consistent use, I notice that my hair falls out less than before when brushing it. It is a legitimately unrefined oil when compared to other less expensive brands for the amount, this one is less sticky and darker, and the darkened bottle allows for good preservation from UV rays.\nquality oil for hair/ scalp, good packaging\nMHSY Electric Razor for Women, 3 in 1 Womens Shaver for Pubic Hair Wet & Dry Painless Cordless Hair Removal Shaver for Shaving Legs, Bikini Trimmer Line, Arms and Underarms\nMHSY\n{'Brand': 'MHSY', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Back Hair, Pubic, Armpit', 'Special Feature': '\u666e\u901a', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Included Components': 'Cleaning Brush, Battery', 'Package Dimensions': '7.8 x 5.43 x 2.17 inches; 3.84 Ounces', 'Batteries': '1 AAAA batteries required. (included)', 'UPC': '616908499251', 'Manufacturer': 'MHSY'}\nThis MHSY Electric Razor for Women does not require, or specify in the instructions, about using shaving cream or oil. It does not state anything was needed, so I did not use anything. My leg hair was quite long when I used it the first time, and it shaved pretty well. When I went to use it again, even the strongest blade setting, it did not seem to be getting the hair for a close enough shave. So it seemed to do well when the hair is longer. It gave me ingrown hair bumps in some areas. I am not sure if it's not due to not using a lubricant or not. It holds pretty well in the shower. But I don't think it's supposed to be used while you are showering. It is very light to hold. I appreciate the left and right blades for sensitive areas, however, the curve around the middle blade has no use. I am not sure what its purpose is for, as much as I have tried to figure it out, it seems to do nothing. The battery lasts quite a while, as I have had it for about a month and only needed to charge it once.\nDoes a good job shaving long hairs, but struggles to get close shave after\nTerre De Mars Resonance Facial Oil, Certified Organic, Plumping and Nourishing Oil for Men and Women, Infused With Coffee and Evening Primrose Oil to Protect and Illuminate Skin, Perfect for All Skin Types, Made in France, Vegan and Cruelty Free (1 FL Oz)\n{'Brand': 'TERRE DE MARS', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Active Ingredients': 'caffeine,squalane', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Product Dimensions': '1.34 x 1.34 x 4.25 inches; 2.89 Ounces'}\nThe Terre de Mars oil serum is a nice emulsion made partly of primrose oil and caffeine with the purpose of brightening and hydrating the facial area for several hours.
