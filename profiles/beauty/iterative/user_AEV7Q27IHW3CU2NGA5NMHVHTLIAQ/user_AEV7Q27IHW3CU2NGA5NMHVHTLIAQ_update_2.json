It cuts with precision, even toenails that are thick or semi ingrown. curvature of clip is wide so it will not clip nails leaving edges, and you do not have to use more than once per nail except toe nail. I also like the little case that does with it and the curved body gives thumb more leverage to hold in place when clipping. It comes with a nail filer but I didn't find much use for it.\nReview Title: Strong clipping power, case is great for traveling\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
