After looking for a while, I decided to get the \"ANZUO Shimmer Gel Nail Polish Set Christmas Party 6 Colors UV LED Soak Off Gold Silver Nail Polish Kit for Women\" with hopes that it would work well.<br />I'm glad that I did, because this polish is great. Aside from the fact that the glitter is very messy, this polish is very nice. It is very smooth and hardens quickly, as well. Whenever I went to remove the polish, I could glitter everywhere. I kinda saw it coming, but it was still a little bit annoying. This polish does last quite a long time, though.<br />Overall, this polish gets a 4 out of 5. If the glitter wasn't so messy, my rating would be higher.\nReview Title: Great polish, messy to apply and/or remove\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
