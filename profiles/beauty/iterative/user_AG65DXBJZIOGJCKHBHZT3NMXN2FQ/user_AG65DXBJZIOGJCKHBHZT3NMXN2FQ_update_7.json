Other than that, this polish is great. It came with a base coat and a top coat, as well as 6 fall-inspired shades. The polish is very beautiful and doesn't make a huge mess. I had her put them under the lamp for 3 minutes after each coat and wound up using 2 coats of the colored polish on her nails. This gel polish hardens very nicely an doesn't get any dents or fingerprints.<br />Overall, I recommend this polish to people who are tired of overpaying at the salon.\nGreat polish\nGel Nail Polish Set, Glitter 6 Colors Gel Polish Kit Popular Nail Art Design Soak Off LED Lamp Nail Polish Gel Manicure Kit Gifts Set for Girls Women Professional DIY Home Use\nAnzuo\n{'Brand': 'Anzuo', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'gel', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Special Feature': 'Long Lasting', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '6.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '6', 'Number of Pieces': '6', 'Product Dimensions': '5.12 x 3.15 x 3.54 inches; 10.23 Ounces'}\nI grew tired of paying to have my gel done at a salon, so I decided that I would do it myself now. After looking for a while, I decided to get the \"ANZUO Shimmer Gel Nail Polish Set Christmas Party 6 Colors UV LED Soak Off Gold Silver Nail Polish Kit for Women\" with hopes that it would work well.<br />I'm glad that I did, because this polish is great. Aside from the fact that the glitter is very messy, this polish is very nice. It is very smooth and hardens quickly, as well. Whenever I went to remove the polish, I could glitter everywhere. I kinda saw it coming, but it was still a little bit annoying. This polish does last quite a long time, though.<br />Overall, this polish gets a 4 out of 5. If the glitter wasn't so messy, my rating would be higher.\nGreat polish, messy to apply and/or remove\nMarshique Skin Fit Flat Auto Eyebrow Pencil(Golden Brown)- including Spoolie Brush, Soft Texture, Natural Looking, Long Lasting\nMarshique\n{'Brand': 'Marshique', 'Item Form': 'Pencil', 'Finish Type': 'Natural', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Product Benefits': 'Softening,Long Lasting', 'Package Dimensions': '5.63 x 0.67 x 0.67 inches; 0.32 Ounces'}\nI was tired of paying twenty dollars for my eyebrow pencils, so when I found the \"Marshique Skin Fit Flat Auto Eyebrow Pencil(Golden Brown)- including Spoolie Brush, Soft Texture, Natural Looking, Long Lasting\" I didn't hesitate to get it.<br />This eyebrow pencil is very natural-looking and easy to apply.
