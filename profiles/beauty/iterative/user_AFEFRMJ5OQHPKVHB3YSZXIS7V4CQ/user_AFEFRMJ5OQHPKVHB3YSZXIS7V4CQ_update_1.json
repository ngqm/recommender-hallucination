The materials used are pretty nice and make it have a great feel when you touch it. The kneading balls are well lubricated at the base making them rotate with ease and never clunks around.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the unit I received does not have a functioning micro current. I put it under the sun for over a day and I couldn't feel a thing. The place where the solar chargers are almost look like just a dark plastic shell with nothing behind it. Either I received a defective unit or this product has a misleading aspect to it. In addition, it says the product comes with a velvet cloth which is something I never received inside my packaging.<br /><br />It's really an average product for its price point but I had to knock another star because off missing items and a nonfunctioning microcurrent.\nReview Title: Average face roller with nonfunctioning microcurrent.\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
