  "reference_summary": "LANDWIND Face Roller Massager, Y-Shape 3D Roller for Anti Aging, Face Lift, Anti Wrinkles, Skin Tightening (BA311)\nLANDWIND\n{'Product Dimensions': '5.8 x 1.8 x 1.6 inches; 12.8 Ounces', 'UPC': '791280480612'}\nOverall, the item feels premium and has a nice weight to it. The materials used are pretty nice and make it have a great feel when you touch it. The kneading balls are well lubricated at the base making them rotate with ease and never clunks around.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the unit I received does not have a functioning micro current. I put it under the sun for over a day and I couldn't feel a thing. The place where the solar chargers are almost look like just a dark plastic shell with nothing behind it. Either I received a defective unit or this product has a misleading aspect to it. In addition, it says the product comes with a velvet cloth which is something I never received inside my packaging.<br /><br />It's really an average product for its price point but I had to knock another star because off missing items and a nonfunctioning microcurrent.\nAverage face roller with nonfunctioning microcurrent.\nallez outdoor | Biodegradable Cleansing Cloths | Natural Plant-Based Face and Body Wipes | PH Balanced | Cactus Bloom and Chaparral Scent | 20ct Individually Wrapped Towelettes\nAllez\n{'Brand': 'Allez', 'Skin Type': 'Oily, Combination, Dry, Normal', 'Material Feature': 'Biodegradable Warning', 'Unit Count': '20.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '6.2 x 5.4 x 4.2 inches; 13.62 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'ABWPS001', 'UPC': '860000823210', 'Manufacturer': 'Allez Outdoor, LLC'}\nGoing on those long hiking trips you always dread the smell you carry on the way back and wish there was a convenient way to clean yourself up. With the Allez outdoor cleansing cloths I would say that your problems are solved!<br /><br />The individually packed cloths fold out to a large size and retains moisture while being used heavily. I've used one wipe to clean my face, arms, legs, and back and there's still a good portion of moisture left on the wipe. In addition, with a nice scent to the wipe you feel really refreshed and clean after using them which is an amazing plus. I would say the best thing about these cloths compared to others is that they are well made and don't break apart after using them vigorously.<br /><br />Overall, going hiking and staying outdoors this item should become an essential item in your pack!\nGreat cleansing cloth that is biodegradable!\n2oz / 60ml Glass Spray Bottles for DIY Refill, Essential Oils, Pillow Mists,Fine Mist Spray -3Packs Amber Color\nEagleKing\n{'Brand': 'EagleKing', 'Material': 'Glass', 'Capacity': '2 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '3', 'Special Feature': 'Mist Spray', 'Package Dimensions': '6.3 x 6.1 x 1.7 inches; 8.78 Ounces'}\nFor 5.99 these are some amazing quality spray bottles. I've been putting in hand sanitizer and essential oils in them and they're the perfect size. Good thick glass and a decent spray attachment makes the build quality on these pretty great.<br /><br />if you're putting in liquids that can be damaged from UV light I would definitely suggest going for the amber clear color.\nGreat portable glass spray bottles!\nEmpty Brown Glass Spray Bottles2-Pack, Refillable 16 oz Containers for Essential Oils, Cleaning Products, Aromatherapy, Misting Plants, or Cooking - Reliable Sprayer with Mist and Stream Settings\nCherry\n{'Brand': 'Cherry', 'Material': 'Glass', 'Capacity': '16 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Product Care Instructions': 'Hand Wash Only', 'Package Dimensions': '9.09 x 6.46 x 3.35 inches; 4.94 Ounces', 'UPC': '791523234187'}\nlike this amber color, I used one bottle mixed with lemon essential oil to use in kitchen and family room, and another bottle mixed with lavender to use in laundry room.  very neat and stylish to use.\nstylish, amber color\nEmpty Clear Glass Spray Bottles 2-PACK,Refillable 16 oz Containers for Essential Oils, Cleaning Products, Aromatherapy, Misting Plants, or Cooking - Reliable Sprayer with Mist Settings\nCherry\n{'Brand': 'Cherry', 'Material': 'Glass', 'Capacity': '16 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Special Feature': 'Mist Spray', 'Package Dimensions': '10 x 6.5 x 3.4 inches; 1.4 Pounds', 'UPC': '791523234156'}\nUpon receiving the product I was really satisfied with the glass bottle used as it felt and looked high quality.
