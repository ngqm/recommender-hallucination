With the Allez outdoor cleansing cloths I would say that your problems are solved!<br /><br />The individually packed cloths fold out to a large size and retains moisture while being used heavily. I've used one wipe to clean my face, arms, legs, and back and there's still a good portion of moisture left on the wipe. In addition, with a nice scent to the wipe you feel really refreshed and clean after using them which is an amazing plus. I would say the best thing about these cloths compared to others is that they are well made and don't break apart after using them vigorously.<br /><br />Overall, going hiking and staying outdoors this item should become an essential item in your pack!\nReview Title: Great cleansing cloth that is biodegradable!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

The materials used are pretty nice and make it have a great feel when you touch it. The kneading balls are well lubricated at the base making them rotate with ease and never clunks around.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the unit I received does not have a functioning micro current. I put it under the sun for over a day and I couldn't feel a thing. The place where the solar chargers are almost look like just a dark plastic shell with nothing behind it. Either I received a defective unit or this product has a misleading aspect to it. In addition, it says the product comes with a velvet cloth which is something I never received inside my packaging.<br /><br />It's really an average product for its price point but I had to knock another star because off missing items and a nonfunctioning microcurrent.\nAverage face roller with nonfunctioning microcurrent.\nallez outdoor | Biodegradable Cleansing Cloths | Natural Plant-Based Face and Body Wipes | PH Balanced | Cactus Bloom and Chaparral Scent | 20ct Individually Wrapped Towelettes\nAllez\n{'Brand': 'Allez', 'Skin Type': 'Oily, Combination, Dry, Normal', 'Material Feature': 'Biodegradable Warning', 'Unit Count': '20.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '6.2 x 5.4 x 4.2 inches; 13.62 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'ABWPS001', 'UPC': '860000823210', 'Manufacturer': 'Allez Outdoor, LLC'}\nGoing on those long hiking trips you always dread the smell you carry on the way back and wish there was a convenient way to clean yourself up.
