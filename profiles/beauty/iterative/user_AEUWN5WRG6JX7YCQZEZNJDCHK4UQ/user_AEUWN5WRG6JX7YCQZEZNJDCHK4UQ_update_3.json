And the spray bottle is nice but to my surprise as I squeezed the trigger it already had some sort of liquid in it. I'm not sure if that's from the company testing it or what. But to me that is strange when you receive a new product. However, the spray bottle does work well.\nSpray bottle already had liquid in it.\nYouClean 300 Antibacterial Travel Hand Soap Sheets - Pocket/Purse/Wallet/Backpack -Great for Outdoor Camping or Daily Use (Tea Party) (Tea Party)\nYouClean\n['Brand:', 'YouClean', 'Item Form:', 'Sheet', 'Formulation:', 'Concentrated plant-based soap', 'Scent:', 'Tea Party (Chamomile, Green Tea, Tea Tree)', 'Package Box Size:', '2 x 1 x 1.5 inch', 'www.shopyouclean.com', \"We are changing our packaging.
