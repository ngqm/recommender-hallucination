I like the long handle with slanted tip to help scrape off any side residue of polish or even acrylic powder before it drys for us beginners lol! The size seems to be true! Not<br />short teeny tiny bristles! The hair is soft but I don't feel it's 100% pure kolinsky! It's just not as soft or even high quality as my other truly true kolinskys from MelodieSusie!!!!\nReview Title: Not sure if it's authentic kolinsky!\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
