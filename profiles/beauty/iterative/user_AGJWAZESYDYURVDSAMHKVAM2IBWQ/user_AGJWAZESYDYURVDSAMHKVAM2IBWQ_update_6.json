You also get 5 facemask which are also individually wrapped. There's a big container of 60 makeup remover wipes and they work really well to remove my makeup.<br />I saw someone say the mask didn't fit them.  My head is pretty small to average size and it fit mine fine. I still had room on the velcro part to make it bigger. The mask fits comfortably and can be refrigerated to help with eye swelling or puffiness.<br />What I liked most about everything is it all says it's not tested on animals and most of it has a cruelty free bunny logo on the back. I always try to buy cruelty free cosmetics and spa products so this is perfect.\nReview Title: Great for traveling!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Hair Straightener Flat Iron for Straightening and Curling, Milantia 3/4 Inch Straightener for Bangs and Short Hair, Dual Voltage Ionic Mini Straightening Iron with Travelling Pouch and EU Adapter\nMilantia\n{'Shape': 'Flat', 'Brand': 'Milantia', 'Hair Type': 'Frizzy', 'Material': 'Ceramic', 'Size': '1 Count (Pack of 1)', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '7.09 x 0.79 x 1.57 inches; 7.1 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'LM-161', 'Manufacturer': 'Milantia'}\nI straighten my hair daily. This mini straightener is perfect for camping and on the go. I actually got this to keep at the office for emergencies but I'll be taking it with me when I go camping too.<br />Due to the smaller size it takes a little longer to straighten my hair. This isn't ideal for every day use unless you have really short hair, but it works great in a pinch or when you are trying to pack light.<br />It comes with a pretty blue green travel case/bag. It has dual voltage 100-240V and an adapter for worldwide travel.<br />It has 1 heat setting and that's 410\u00b0. This worked fine for me because that's the temp my regular straightener is set at.\nPerfect for my purse, the office and camping.\nMagnetic Eyelashes and Magnetic Eyeliner Kit, Magnetic Eyelashes with Eyeliner, 5 Pairs Reusable Magnetic Eyelashes with Tweezer, False Lashes\nEyenjoy\n{'Brand': 'Eyenjoy', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '5.71 x 5.39 x 0.71 inches', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Mounting Type': 'Magnet', 'Product Dimensions': '5.71 x 5.39 x 0.71 inches; 2.12 Ounces', 'UPC': '736067423758'}\nI've always struggled with gluing in lashes and I had pretty much given up. I ordered these after a friend was telling me about how great magnetic liner is. I was super impressed with how easy it is for me to put these on.<br />I'm kind of confused on whether the liner is sticky and magnetic or just magnetic. I didn't let it dry all the way before doing my eyebrows and my lower eyelid got stuck to my upper eyelid. I couldn't tell if that was magnet pull or glue.<br />Whatever the liner is, it keeps those lashes in place and they are so easy to put on. The brush is thin but the thicker the line, the better it will hold on to the lashes.<br />My eye lids are sort of small and I think I'm going to have to trim these a tiny bit or the ends can be a little jabby in the corner of my eye.<br />I haven't worn these out yet due to the pandemic but I know the liner lasts because you have to scrub hard to get it off. These should last all day.\nNice selection, super easy to use.\nPurple Hair Mask for Blonde with Keratin & Jojoba Oil - Platinum & Silver Hair - Instantly Eliminate Brassiness & Yellows - Made in USA - Hair Toner - Bleached & Highlighted Hair - Sulfate Free - 8 oz\nWELLUTION\n{'Brand': 'WELLUTION', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Hair Type': 'Damaged,Dry,Color-treated', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating Treatment', 'Package Dimensions': '3.07 x 2.9 x 2.8 inches; 8 Ounces', 'UPC': '749715278440'}\nI've followed the directions and used this twice after shampooing with my purple shampoo. I notice a slight difference in tone but it's not that noticeable. This mask really conditioned my hair and it made my hair feel so soft. It would be great right after I bleach my hair. It also has a light pleasant scent.\nVery conditioning but doesn't really tone my hair\nAmbari Black Crowns for Women Tiara Vintage Style Crown Hair Piece Accessories for Bride, Wedding, Prom, Birthday, Engagement, Bridal Shower - Baroque Jewelry for Women, New Packaging\nambari\n{'Product Dimensions': '4.53 x 4.53 x 2.36 inches; 6.38 Ounces', 'UPC': '645312483587'}\nOwn your QUEEN status by getting this crown so you can pin it in your hair and wear it all day long so no one forgets who runs the place.<br />I really love this crown. It's sort of heavy and not flimsy at all.  The rhinestones are obviously fake and not very clear but that won't stop me from rocking it.<br />The metal is sort of a coppery tarnish gold color in person. It has two little holes where you can use clips or even string to attach it to your head so it doesn't move around.<br />This would be cute for photo shoots, even for kids or pets.\nGreat for photo shoots, dress up or  just for fun.\nSTYLEAGAL Portable Electric Nail Drill, Manicure Pedicure Drill Kit Professional nail starter kit for beginners acrylic with drill\uff082020 Upgraded\uff09\nstyleagal\n{'Brand': 'styleagal', 'Voltage': '5 Volts', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.8 x 4.5 x 2 inches; 8.01 Ounces', 'UPC': '782913461771', 'Manufacturer': 'STYLEAGAL'}\nThis nail drill is exactly as pictured. It has an on/off switch and an intensity level setting.  It comes with lots of attachments and even several sandpaper pieces to use.<br />I used it to remove stubborn gel polish and I've used it to prep my nails for press on nails. I like that it's small and basically the size of a highlighter. It has a little weight to it but it's easy to hold and use.<br />It powers through a USB cable, it doesn't come with a wall socket.\nSmall, easy to use,  USB powered.\nFacial Kit For Women - Includes Facial Mask, Facial Makeup Wipes, Nose Strips, Facial Cleansers, Facial- Self Care Package For Women (Multivitamin Facial Kit)\nGolden Gift Box\n{'Brand': 'Golden Gift Box', 'Item Form': 'Wipes', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Product Dimensions': '9 x 9 x 3 inches; 2.47 Pounds', 'UPC': '758176585684'}\nYou get 5 sets of under eye pads and each one is individually wrapped so you can throw it in your luggage when you travel.
