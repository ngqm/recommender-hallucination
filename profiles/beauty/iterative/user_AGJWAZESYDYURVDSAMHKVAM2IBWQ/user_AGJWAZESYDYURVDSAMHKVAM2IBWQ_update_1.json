This mini straightener is perfect for camping and on the go. I actually got this to keep at the office for emergencies but I'll be taking it with me when I go camping too.<br />Due to the smaller size it takes a little longer to straighten my hair. This isn't ideal for every day use unless you have really short hair, but it works great in a pinch or when you are trying to pack light.<br />It comes with a pretty blue green travel case/bag. It has dual voltage 100-240V and an adapter for worldwide travel.<br />It has 1 heat setting and that's 410\u00b0. This worked fine for me because that's the temp my regular straightener is set at.\nReview Title: Perfect for my purse, the office and camping.\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
