I like the color choices, and that these are already matte.  This is so easy for anyone who doesn't have a lot of time, but wants to do quick nails.  I really appreciate these.  There are a lot, and you have lots of choices.  I wish the maker gave an option for a round cuticle area, instead of these square cuticle area nails.  Looking at these from the side, you can see the space between my real nails and the fake nails...so for anyone who has a long nail bed, their real nails will more than likely show as mine do.  I will use these for nail art, I just can't see changing my real nail shape at the side walls to fit these, that can be hazardous.  The curve of these is good, fitting to the nail plate well.  If you use gel polish, this curve will be more drastic when the gel cures, so be aware of that possibility.  I'm dropping 1 star for fit at the cuticle, seller should give an option for a more round cuticle line too.\nReview Title: a bit too square for my nail beds.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "ECBASKET 500 PCS Stiletto False Nails Short Acrylic Nail Tips 10 sizes Full Coverage Fake Nails (100PCS Nail Forms)\nECBASKET\n{'Size': 'Small', 'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'ECBASKET', 'Style': 'French', 'Coverage': 'Full Well Tips', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.5 x 3.25 x 0.75 inches; 0.64 Ounces', 'UPC': '701392295127'}\nA decent product for a decent price.  These are nice and flexible, making removal super easy.  They can be reused, once you clean them and sanitize them with rubbing alcohol.  These are more square at the cuticle area, great for those with a more square shaped nail bed, my thumbs are pretty square.  They come in 10 sizes (10 of each size) and the sizes are reasonable sizing too.  I have dual forms from another brand and half of them are unreasonably HUGE, whereas these are for normal people.  For my thumb I used size 2 and my other fingers fit 4-8.  They came in a plastic organizer case that is way smaller than my other case, so they don't take up a ton of room in my nail station.  The latch on mine didn't close tight, so I had to use a piece of tape, but I'm not taking off any stars because that didn't affect the usefulness of the product itself.  All in all, the C curve was perfect, easy to load, cure and pinch off.  I found these to be perfect for anyone who wants a square cuticle line, rather than a round one. I purchased this thru my Amazon Prime account and did not receive any compensation for this completely unbiased review.\nI found these to be perfect for anyone who wants a square cuticle line, rather than a round one.\n10Pack 2oz Plastic Empty Spray Bottle, Mostof Fine Mist Small Clear Travel Plastic Bottles Container with Funnels Labels\nMostof\n{'Brand': 'Mostof', 'Capacity': '2 Ounces', 'Special Feature': 'Mist Spray', 'Product Care Instructions': 'Hand Wash Only', 'Reusability': 'Reusable', 'Package Dimensions': '6.5 x 6.3 x 3.9 inches; 8.78 Ounces', 'UPC': '634715829481'}\nThis is a nice spray bottle kit, it comes with 2 funnels and a sheet of labels, I found the labels too small for use, each one is approximately 1 inch x 1/2 inch in diameter, and not sure if it can be used in an inkjet printer or not. All 10 spray bottles included all the necessary parts, and the stem that draws up liquid was long in each one, none were short and I really appreciated that. You should be able to spray down to the last drop.  I tested mine with rubbing alcohol, for sanitizing my phones. The funnel came in handy for filling the bottle. It made the job so easy! The sprayer does spray a very fine mist. I used it several times to clean some things then left it overnight with the cap on. Next day I tested it again. First off, the cap contained some of the rubbing alcohol inside it, which means the container will leak into the cap standing up. Not necessarily a huge deal breaker, but a negative for me. Holding it in my hand I got the rubbing alcohol on my finger too, so this may waste product just from this. Several drops every 24 hours may not seem like a lot, but if you make your own essential oil room spray then this could be an expensive waste. Lastly, I had an issue with the spray top, the angle is so slight I wasn't sure if I would spray myself in the face of I wasn't wearing eyeglasses. You have to be careful, ensuring you're spraying away from yourself. I did not get any leakage of the alcohol out of the cap, it seemed pretty tight.  It did pool in the cap, didn't run down the bottle.  I did get a rubbing alcohol ring when I set down the cap on my coffee table tho.  Beware of that possibility whatever you use in these bottles.<br />All in all, a nice kit and I give it 4 stars.\nI got leaking inside the cap, but it didn't come out.\nUV LED Nail Lamp 36w, Portable USB Gel Nail Dryer, Polish Nail Light for Home and Travel, White\nKOCECER\n{'Brand': 'KOCECER', 'Special Feature': 'Rechargeable', 'Light Source Type': 'LED', 'Room Type': 'Usb', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Package Dimensions': '7.9 x 7.5 x 3.5 inches; 10.09 Ounces', 'UPC': '791555028525'}\nThis is a nice little UV & LED cure lamp, it is smaller than the other ones I have, so it takes up less space.  It is a bit more costly for what you get, compared with similar items, at $26 that is a slight negative for me.  This does come with little gloves that were to protect the skin, and I'm sure they help a little bit.  I did have plenty of room to cure my full hand, but I did my thump separately.  I find that when you use these lamps it is best to turn on the lamp and slowly insert your hand with the timer started so you don't get those heat spikes.  I did not have any problems with cure time or curing with this lamp.  I will continue to use it and if I have any issues, I will reevaluate my review accordingly.  Dropping a star for the cost.\nCute little lamp, takes up 7.5 \" or 19 cm squared of table space.\nYolife Acrylic Nail Brush with100% Pure Kolinsky Sable, Nail Art Brush With Brilliant crystal Handle, for Manicure Pedicure (6#, Silver)\nYOLIFE\n{'Color': 'Silver', 'Brand': 'YOLIFE', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.75 x 2 x 0.3 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nThis arrived with 2 of the brushes missing completely, and the dotting tool had a bent tip.\n2 brushes missing.\nNail Polish Set - Eternal 4 Piece Kit: Long Lasting, Quick Dry and Cruelty Free. Made in USA - 0.46 Fluid Ounces Each (Girly Nautical)\nEternal\n{}\nThis is a nice Nautical gift set with 4 pretty polishes.  They are 13.5 ml each, and made in the U.S.A.  Initially I thought I would love Stay Nude the most, but it ended up being my least favorite of the set, only because it is pearl and streaks are unavoidable due to the type of finish it is.  All 4 have a shiny topcoat built into the formula.  The 3 cremes are all very sheer formulas, not super opaque.  The thickness of the formula for all of these is good.  If you like a sheer formula, where you can see your nail bed thru the polish, then these are your jam.  I did several manicures with each of them, and found that if I wanted a sheer look then 1 coat worked perfectly, otherwise 2 or 3 coats for full coverage and less peek thru of your natural nail and smile line.  I did 2 easy coats for each of my manicures.  The blue (Hypnosis) seemed to have the best coverage, and the formula for that was my favorite of the 4, it dried the fastest at 8 minutes to the touch.  They all go on easily, with a regular round brush (not flat) and they dry fairly well, in about 10-15 minutes each layer.  I did find that using my own quick drying topcoat that these wore much better, but from the manufacturer neither base nor top coat are required.  I did not get any staining from these, which I love.  The pink and white will both be really good polishes for doing either French tip or pond manicures when you just want a sheer base, where you do a layer, do art over it, then cover it again, and more art on that layer-it gives a layered effect that is fun to do.  The color palate is a fun one, with lots of options for artwork.  These are not quick drying-more of the typical 10 minutes per layer, and I expected them to be hardened on their own, without the help of a quick drying topcoat, but that was not the case with them.\nSheer formula, builds well.\n576 Pieces Medium Length Short Square Press on Nails Matte Fake Nails Full Cover Artificial Acrylic colorful Coffin Nails Tips Kit for DIY Nail Art Salon Nail Gifts for Women Girls\nKXAMELIE\n{'Size': '576 Count (Pack of 1)', 'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'KXAMELIE', 'Style': 'French', 'Pattern': 'Solid', 'Package Dimensions': '9.76 x 6.73 x 0.98 inches; 2.89 Ounces', 'UPC': '749212759893'}\nI do like these, first off!
