These are nice and flexible, making removal super easy.  They can be reused, once you clean them and sanitize them with rubbing alcohol.  These are more square at the cuticle area, great for those with a more square shaped nail bed, my thumbs are pretty square.  They come in 10 sizes (10 of each size) and the sizes are reasonable sizing too.  I have dual forms from another brand and half of them are unreasonably HUGE, whereas these are for normal people.  For my thumb I used size 2 and my other fingers fit 4-8.  They came in a plastic organizer case that is way smaller than my other case, so they don't take up a ton of room in my nail station.  The latch on mine didn't close tight, so I had to use a piece of tape, but I'm not taking off any stars because that didn't affect the usefulness of the product itself.  All in all, the C curve was perfect, easy to load, cure and pinch off.  I found these to be perfect for anyone who wants a square cuticle line, rather than a round one. I purchased this thru my Amazon Prime account and did not receive any compensation for this completely unbiased review.\nReview Title: I found these to be perfect for anyone who wants a square cuticle line, rather than a round one.\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
