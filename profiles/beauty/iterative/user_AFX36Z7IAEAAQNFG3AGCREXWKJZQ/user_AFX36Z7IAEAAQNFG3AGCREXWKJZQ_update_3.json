It helped to get rid of buildup while also gently exfoliating the scalp. It\u2019s paraben and silicone-free, but it\u2019s not sulfate-free. I would be careful to not over-use this product, since sulfates can really dry and damage your hair.\nReview Title: Read the instructions, use for no longer than 2 minutes!\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Blonde Tape in Hair Extensions Human Hair 20pcs/50g 14in Tape in Platinum Blonde Hair Extensions Remy Human Hair Straight For Women With Salon Style\nLaaVoo\n{'Brand': 'LaaVoo', 'Color': 'Platinum blonde', 'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Extension Length': '14 Inches', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Product Dimensions': '14 x 1 x 1 inches; 1.76 Ounces'}\nThese hair extensions are gorgeous and the hair itself is good quality. My only complaint is how weak the tape is. I\u2019ve only had them on for a couple days before the first one fell off. I\u2019ve never had tape extensions fall off this soon. It seems this is anticipated as the box comes with replacement tapes.\nSoft hair, weak tape\nUltimate Essentials Kit\n{'Brand': 'Olaplex', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Hair Type': 'Damaged', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Benefits': 'Repairs, Strengthens & Protects hair. Restores texture. Adds shine.', 'Product Dimensions': '6 x 1.38 x 4.88 inches; 7.83 Ounces', 'UPC': '850018802420', 'Manufacturer': 'Olaplex'}\nThe kit comes with No. 0, 3, 4, 5, and 8. No. 1 and 2 are only for professional use, thus why they are not included. Like how the numbers imply, start with No.0 and work upward. Everything included in the kit has little-to-no scent. My favorite has to be No.3. I saw the most change in my hair after using it. Despite my hair being damaged, No.3 made it appear healthier. The items in this kid are small, making them perfect for traveling.\nHair repair kit\nL'ANGE HAIR Exfolier Purifying Scalp Scrub | Gentle Cleansing Salt Scrub for Scalp | Helps Exfoliate, Balance, and Hydrate Scalp | Free of Parabens and Silicones\nL'ANGE HAIR\n{'Brand': \"L'ANGE HAIR\", 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Product Benefits': 'Targets buildup and impurities, nourishes hair and scalp, gently cleanses and exfoliates, soothes and restores bodyTargets buildup and impurities, nourishes hair and scalp, gently cleanses and exfoliates, soothes and restores body  See more', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Product Dimensions': '2.9 x 2.9 x 2.5 inches; 6.38 Ounces', 'UPC': '810108190721', 'Manufacturer': \"L'ANGE HAIR\"}\nI liked using L\u2019ange\u2019s exfoliar purifying scalp scrub.
