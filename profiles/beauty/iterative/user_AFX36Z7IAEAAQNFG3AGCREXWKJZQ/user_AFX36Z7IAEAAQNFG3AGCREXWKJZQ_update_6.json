The item is collapsible, yet very sturdy and makes for easy storage. The remote control is magnetically attached to the top of the machine and has the options for Bubbles, Heat- Low Temperature, Medium Temperature, and High Temperature, a Timer, and an ON/OFF button. The bubbles function is relaxing. I have a slight issue with the heat functions.The machine heats up very quickly and it can overheat. I wish there was an option for only bubbles without heating up the foot spa.\nReview Title: Heats up fast\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Blonde Tape in Hair Extensions Human Hair 20pcs/50g 14in Tape in Platinum Blonde Hair Extensions Remy Human Hair Straight For Women With Salon Style\nLaaVoo\n{'Brand': 'LaaVoo', 'Color': 'Platinum blonde', 'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Extension Length': '14 Inches', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Product Dimensions': '14 x 1 x 1 inches; 1.76 Ounces'}\nThese hair extensions are gorgeous and the hair itself is good quality. My only complaint is how weak the tape is. I\u2019ve only had them on for a couple days before the first one fell off. I\u2019ve never had tape extensions fall off this soon. It seems this is anticipated as the box comes with replacement tapes.\nSoft hair, weak tape\nUltimate Essentials Kit\n{'Brand': 'Olaplex', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Hair Type': 'Damaged', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Benefits': 'Repairs, Strengthens & Protects hair. Restores texture. Adds shine.', 'Product Dimensions': '6 x 1.38 x 4.88 inches; 7.83 Ounces', 'UPC': '850018802420', 'Manufacturer': 'Olaplex'}\nThe kit comes with No. 0, 3, 4, 5, and 8. No. 1 and 2 are only for professional use, thus why they are not included. Like how the numbers imply, start with No.0 and work upward. Everything included in the kit has little-to-no scent. My favorite has to be No.3. I saw the most change in my hair after using it. Despite my hair being damaged, No.3 made it appear healthier. The items in this kid are small, making them perfect for traveling.\nHair repair kit\nL'ANGE HAIR Exfolier Purifying Scalp Scrub | Gentle Cleansing Salt Scrub for Scalp | Helps Exfoliate, Balance, and Hydrate Scalp | Free of Parabens and Silicones\nL'ANGE HAIR\n{'Brand': \"L'ANGE HAIR\", 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Product Benefits': 'Targets buildup and impurities, nourishes hair and scalp, gently cleanses and exfoliates, soothes and restores bodyTargets buildup and impurities, nourishes hair and scalp, gently cleanses and exfoliates, soothes and restores body  See more', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Product Dimensions': '2.9 x 2.9 x 2.5 inches; 6.38 Ounces', 'UPC': '810108190721', 'Manufacturer': \"L'ANGE HAIR\"}\nI liked using L\u2019ange\u2019s exfoliar purifying scalp scrub. It helped to get rid of buildup while also gently exfoliating the scalp. It\u2019s paraben and silicone-free, but it\u2019s not sulfate-free. I would be careful to not over-use this product, since sulfates can really dry and damage your hair.\nRead the instructions, use for no longer than 2 minutes!\nHempz Triple Moisture Hydrating Herbal Hand Creme, 4 oz\nHempz\n['We put hemp seed oil into everything we make, so you get vitamin E, amino acids, and omega fatty acids in every squeeze or swipe.']\n{'Product Dimensions': '2.13 x 1.38 x 7.25 inches; 4 Ounces', 'Item model number': '110-2758-03', 'UPC': '676280046580', 'Manufacturer': 'Hempz'}\nI got this for my mother, who has arthritis and it\u2019s helped her tremendously with her pain. The hand cream smells like citrus, and it\u2019s strong enough to cover up the hemp seed oil smell. It\u2019s also moisturizing and a little bit greasy when it\u2019s first applied. It absorbs well into the skin, despite how thick the cream is.\nCitrus scent, hides the hemp seed oil smell very well!\nL'ANGE HAIR Detangling Comb Brush | Lightweight, Comfortable, Non-slip Design | Easy Glide, Smooth, Snag-Free Comb | Blush\nL'ANGE HAIR\n{'Brand': \"L'ANGE HAIR\", 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Color': 'Blush', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '11.1 x 3.5 x 0.51 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'Item model number': '2335', 'UPC': '810108190264', 'Manufacturer': \"L'ANGE HAIR\"}\nBeing honest, I only got this because it was such a pretty shade of pink, however, I was very surprised by the quality. The teeth are wide and very sturdy. None of them have broken off nor bent while in use. The teeth are also polished, so they brush smoothly and gently detangles hair. This comb is definitely meant for thick and coarse hair.\nSturdy wide-tooth comb\nTimeRelish Collapsible Foot Spa Bath Massager with Heat Bubbles and Massage and Jet, Pedicure Foot Spa Massager with Remote, Foot Soak Tub with Pumice Stone and Lavender Epsom, Gift for Woman Blue\nTimeRelish\n{'Use for': 'Feet', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Material': 'Stone', 'Brand': 'TimeRelish', 'Color': 'Blue', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '16 x 13 x 7.5 inches; 4.7 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'HT-001A', 'UPC': '797823642509', 'Manufacturer': 'TimeRelish'}\nReally enjoyed using this foot spa massager.
