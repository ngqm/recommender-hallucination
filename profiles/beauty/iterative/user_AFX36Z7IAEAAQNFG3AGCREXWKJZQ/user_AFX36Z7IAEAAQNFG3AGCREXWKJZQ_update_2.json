No. 1 and 2 are only for professional use, thus why they are not included. Like how the numbers imply, start with No.0 and work upward. Everything included in the kit has little-to-no scent. My favorite has to be No.3. I saw the most change in my hair after using it. Despite my hair being damaged, No.3 made it appear healthier. The items in this kid are small, making them perfect for traveling.\nReview Title: Hair repair kit\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Blonde Tape in Hair Extensions Human Hair 20pcs/50g 14in Tape in Platinum Blonde Hair Extensions Remy Human Hair Straight For Women With Salon Style\nLaaVoo\n{'Brand': 'LaaVoo', 'Color': 'Platinum blonde', 'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Extension Length': '14 Inches', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Product Dimensions': '14 x 1 x 1 inches; 1.76 Ounces'}\nThese hair extensions are gorgeous and the hair itself is good quality. My only complaint is how weak the tape is. I\u2019ve only had them on for a couple days before the first one fell off. I\u2019ve never had tape extensions fall off this soon. It seems this is anticipated as the box comes with replacement tapes.\nSoft hair, weak tape\nUltimate Essentials Kit\n{'Brand': 'Olaplex', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Hair Type': 'Damaged', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Benefits': 'Repairs, Strengthens & Protects hair.
