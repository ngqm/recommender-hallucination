My only complaint is how weak the tape is. I\u2019ve only had them on for a couple days before the first one fell off. I\u2019ve never had tape extensions fall off this soon. It seems this is anticipated as the box comes with replacement tapes.\nReview Title: Soft hair, weak tape\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
