I thought it would be bigger because of the price. Is is a very soft brush and good for blending powder and buffing because it's not scratchy, I hate scratchy brushes. It's good to travel with. It also sheds a little bit at first washing.\nIs is a very soft brush and good for blending powder and buffing because it's not scratchy\nMountain Falls Regular Dip-It Nail Polish Remover for Natural Nails, with Vitamin E and Panthenol, 9 Fluid Ounce\nMountain Falls\n{'Brand': 'Mountain Falls', 'Item Weight': '0.5 Pounds', 'Unit Count': '9 Fl Oz'}\ni love the convenience and ease of use. just dip your finger in the hole and it erases the polish like it never happened. it is potent stuff. it's basically just remover with a foam soaked inside with a bunch of incisions that you can insert your nails in. no complaints except that you will taste the fume (bitter) when you first open it. just keep it away from nose.\neasy to use and effective\nJPNK 4PCS Anti-Static Detangling Fine & Wide Tooth Shower Comb Set\nJPNK\n{'Material': 'Plastic', 'Brand': 'JPNK', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy,Straight', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '12 x 3.1 x 0.7 inches;

5.29 Ounces', 'UPC': '850016254009'}\ni wanted to like this but i can't. it has coverage like a light coverage foundation but too dark in color, if you are very tan yes the color would work. i can't believe this is a \"moisturizer\" because it is super thick and sticky, it feels so heavy on the skin, it doesn't set or feel dry after unless you powder it. i can work with the color, i just don't like how this feels, your skin will feel warm and sticky. it's a shame because there is a lot in the bottle. if you want this for the coverage, might as well buy a bottle of foundation.\nthis feels sooo heavy!\nEyebrow Stencil ,Eyebrows Grooming Stencil Kit Reusable Styling Tool with 1 Eyebrow Pencil (8pcs Gray Eyebrow stencils\uff08new style\uff09)\nVANGAY\n{'Brand': 'VANGAY', 'Item Form': 'Pencil', 'Special Feature': 'Reusable', 'Material Feature': 'Reusable, Natural', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '8.8 x 6.3 x 0.9 inches; 2.4 Ounces'}\nwhen i first saw these i didn't have much faith. i have bought something like this before that was a waste of money, i hated it so much i got mad -- even though i only paid less than 5 dollrs.<br /><br />this is pretty cool, depending on your preferred shape, you can choose from the stencils they have and load it up to the holder. the stencils are not super stiff, they have some give so you can push them hard against your forehead.<br /><br />this helped me a lot. i have very uneven eyebrows, they take me almost 30 minutes to do just trying to make them look like they are on the same level, one is at the basement and the other one is on the 3rd floor.<br /><br />i don't use this to stencil my whole entire eyebrows, i use this to guide the top and the beginning of my eyebrows because that is where my struggle is and i freestyle the rest. and it has helped me alot. although it's not perfect, there could be improvements, it is still very useful.<br /><br />it comes with a razor even so you can shape your brows.<br /><br />the stencils were a little confusing at  first, but to help you: I use E1 and E2. they are alphabetical and the pair should match in the letters but would be 1 & 2.<br /><br />the elastic that came with it, supposedly to hold the stencil in place just broke right away, did not even start using it yet, but i don't think it's necessary.<br /><br />hope this helps you.\ngreat tool for uneven eyebrows\nArgan Magic 100% Pure Argan Oil \u2013 Moisturizing Oil that Infuses Skin with Enriched Hydration | Leaves Skin Restored & Refreshed | Non-Greasy | Rich in Vitamin E | Made in USA | Cruelty Free (2 oz)\nArgan Magic\n{'Brand': 'Argan Magic', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Active Ingredients': 'Vitamin e', 'Unit Count': '2 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.2 x 1.1 x 1.1 inches; 2 Ounces', 'UPC': '605923474046'}\nbelieve it or not, i love this. i know most of the reviews are complaining about the smell. if you are a purist and are sensitive to fragrances, you will love this. i have allergic rhinitis that gets triggered by scented stuff and my husband gets a headache and it is so hard to find unscented/fragrance free hair products. glad i found this.<br /><br />my husband bought me argan oil without fragrance but it was super heavy, thick and sticky. this one is super lightweight. when first applied, my hair looks oily but it goes away, it just keeps my hair soft. i have very frizzy hair and dry -- not damaged, it's just the texture of my hair, and i love this.\nit is pure -- no added scents.\nHard Wax Beads,WAXNOW 2lb Wax Beans for Hair Removal, All-Purpose Use for Full Body, Golden Glitter Added, Hard Wax for Legs, Brazilian Bikini, Underarm, Face, Larger Refill for Wax Warmer Kit\nWAXNOW\n{'Item Form': 'Wax', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Brand': 'WAXNOW', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Unit Count': '32 Ounce', 'Package Dimensions': '10.08 x 6.93 x 2.28 inches;
