Even though they are all butterflies, there are a variety of styles. There are multicolored butterflies as well as some in a single color. You can really create the design that fits your style.<br /><br />There are directions on each sheet of butterflies, although the directions are the same for all of them. The directions are easy to follow even though they aren't always grammatically correct. My one complaint would be that I wish that there were directions for using the two jars of holographic butterflies. I'm sure that I can figure it out somewhere online, and it's probably pretty similar to how you apply the stickers, but directions still would have been nice. You really get an impressive amount for this price.\nReview Title: So Many Butterflies\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Pumice Stone for Feet, 2 in 1 Double Sided Hard Skin Callus Remover for Feet,Hands and Body, Exfoliator Pedicure File Block Callus Remover Scrubber (Pack of 4)\nKSang\n{'Brand': 'KSang', 'Material': 'Volcanic Stone', 'Is Electric': 'No', 'Item Form': 'Scrubber, Filer', 'Unit Count': '4.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '6 x 5.6 x 2.7 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'UPC': '192242957393'}\nI feel like these do a good job of making rough skin a lot smoother. After just one use, I did notice that my skin was not quite as rough. Each time that I've used them, I've noticed my skin is a little smoother and softer. I think I've used it five or six times now. I'm used both the pumice stone side and the colored side. I actually like the colored side better, but when using the colored side, it leaves behind a bit of a grimy residue. If you're using it in the shower, as I do, this isn't a huge deal as you can just rinse it off. It does, though, make me wonder how long the colored side will last if it keeps coming apart a little each time that I use it.\nCan Be Crumbly\nButterfly Nail Art Decals Water Transfer Stickers, 22 Sheets Butterfly Nail Sticker DIY Nail Decals, 2 Set Butterfly Nail Glitter Holographic Stickers Reflected Butterfly Designs for Nails Supply\nB bangcool\n{'Surface Recommendation nail': '', '': 'Unit Count 1.00 Count', 'Shape Irregular': '', 'Brand': 'B bangcool', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '6.3 x 3.54 x 1.57 inches', 'Theme': 'Butterfly', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Reusability': 'Single Use', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Pattern': 'Insects', 'Product Dimensions': '6.3 x 3.54 x 1.57 inches; 5.61 Ounces'}\nThere are sheets and sheets of butterflies in different sizes, ranging from small enough for a child's nails all the way up to big enough that I'd need long fake nails to use them.
