Unfortunately, it's not a citrusy fresh lemon scent like I would want for a soap or another product that I'd put on my body. Instead, it reminds me more of a wood furniture polish smell. It's a pretty strong scent too. You can definitely smell it as you are washing your hands. Unfortunately, that smell lingers. I could still smell it on my hands about an hour after washing them. It also seemed to dry out my hands a lot more than other hand soaps that I've been using lately. I found that using a scented lotion on my hands after using this soap did help with both the wood furniture polish smell and with my dry hands.<br /><br />This soap does lather up well. I'm not a fan of the texture, though. For me, it felt like I had a slimy film on my hands. While I'm sure that other people will like this soap, I was not a fan.\nReview Title: The Smell Is Overwhelming\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Pumice Stone for Feet, 2 in 1 Double Sided Hard Skin Callus Remover for Feet,Hands and Body, Exfoliator Pedicure File Block Callus Remover Scrubber (Pack of 4)\nKSang\n{'Brand': 'KSang', 'Material': 'Volcanic Stone', 'Is Electric': 'No', 'Item Form': 'Scrubber, Filer', 'Unit Count': '4.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '6 x 5.6 x 2.7 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'UPC': '192242957393'}\nI feel like these do a good job of making rough skin a lot smoother. After just one use, I did notice that my skin was not quite as rough. Each time that I've used them, I've noticed my skin is a little smoother and softer. I think I've used it five or six times now. I'm used both the pumice stone side and the colored side. I actually like the colored side better, but when using the colored side, it leaves behind a bit of a grimy residue. If you're using it in the shower, as I do, this isn't a huge deal as you can just rinse it off. It does, though, make me wonder how long the colored side will last if it keeps coming apart a little each time that I use it.\nCan Be Crumbly\nButterfly Nail Art Decals Water Transfer Stickers, 22 Sheets Butterfly Nail Sticker DIY Nail Decals, 2 Set Butterfly Nail Glitter Holographic Stickers Reflected Butterfly Designs for Nails Supply\nB bangcool\n{'Surface Recommendation nail': '', '': 'Unit Count 1.00 Count', 'Shape Irregular': '', 'Brand': 'B bangcool', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '6.3 x 3.54 x 1.57 inches', 'Theme': 'Butterfly', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Reusability': 'Single Use', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Pattern': 'Insects', 'Product Dimensions': '6.3 x 3.54 x 1.57 inches; 5.61 Ounces'}\nThere are sheets and sheets of butterflies in different sizes, ranging from small enough for a child's nails all the way up to big enough that I'd need long fake nails to use them. Even though they are all butterflies, there are a variety of styles. There are multicolored butterflies as well as some in a single color. You can really create the design that fits your style.<br /><br />There are directions on each sheet of butterflies, although the directions are the same for all of them. The directions are easy to follow even though they aren't always grammatically correct. My one complaint would be that I wish that there were directions for using the two jars of holographic butterflies. I'm sure that I can figure it out somewhere online, and it's probably pretty similar to how you apply the stickers, but directions still would have been nice. You really get an impressive amount for this price.\nSo Many Butterflies\nCaudalie Beauty Essentials Beauty Elixir Set: 3 Piece Radiance Trio including a Pore Tightening Facial Mist, Daily Foam Cleanser, Brightening Glycolic Peel Mask\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.87 x 5.83 x 1.61 inches; 1.18 Pounds'}\nThis set comes with three different products. They are all in small packaging, but you don't need to use a lot, so they should last a while. My opinion on each product differs a lot, so I'll provide a short review of each item.<br /><br />*Instant Foaming Cleanser: I love this one. It's my favorite. It smells wonderful, and it just feels great going on my skin and after I've rinsed it off. You really don't need much. I found that if I pressed down the top about halfway, I got enough to cover my whole face. For me, the cleanser is definitely a 5-star product.<br /><br />*Glycolic Peel Mask: While I felt like the mask did its job fine, I wasn't a fan of the smell at all. The best way that I can explain it is to say that it smells like wood to me. It's like I'm sniffing the bark of a tree. I'm not sure where that smell came from. It's not a horrible smell. It's just that I've had other masks that work just as well and have a more appealing smell. I'd probably give this one 3 stars.<br /><br />*Spray Beauty Elixir: This one is the hardest for me to review. When I first used it, I did not like it at all. While I like the smell, it's a bit overwhelming. The first time I used it, it also stung in a few spots. I know that this isn't how it was meant to be used, but I found that for me, it works best when I spray it on my hands and then pat my face with it. After using it a few times, it started to grow on me, and it does seem to moisturize my skin well. I'd give this 4 stars.<br /><br />Overall, this set evens out to 4 stars. It's a nice set, and if, like me, you haven't tried products by this brand before, this is a good way to sample them to decide what you like and what you don't like.\nDepends on the Item\nBodyguard Moisturizing Immunity Soap 6pk | 7 Essential Oils Clinically Evaluated to Boost Immunity and Protect | Moisturizes with Sweet Almond Oil | Healthy PH for Skin Microbiome\nSpa-Da\n{'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Brand': 'Spa-Da', 'Scent': 'Cinnamon', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '8 x 3.3 x 2 inches; 7.2 Ounces', 'UPC': '860003618998'}\nThese are fairly small shields of soap. While the scent isn't overwhelmingly strong, you can definitely smell it when you are using the soap or if the soap is not in a container even when you are in the same room. We have a couple of bars sitting next to our bathroom sink, and you can smell them when you walk into the bathroom. To me, the most obvious scent is the clove. The other scents are cinnamon, oregano, rosemary, peppermint, parsley, and eucalyptus.<br /><br />I've liked the soap so far. It lathers up well. It's kind of a weird experience to wash with this. It's not really a scent that I generally associate with cleaning myself. While these scents might remind you more of your favorite Italian dish than what you would normally use as soap, if these are all smells that you generally enjoy, it's worth trying this soap.\nSmall But Nice\nLEAP Lemongrass Hand Soap, Natural & Moisturizing Lather, Gentle & Rinses Clean, Made with Organic Oils, Cruelty Free & Vegan, Liquid Hand Wash, Superbly Designed, 12 fl oz\nLeap Organics\n{'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'Leap Organics', 'Scent': 'Lemongrass', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2.4 x 2.4 x 6.9 inches; 12 Ounces', 'UPC': '855920002692'}\nI like the smell of lemon, so I really expected to like this hand soap a lot.
