My boyfriend says this is nowhere near as smooth as a regular shave but then again not as irritating using this shaver. It is far too expensive for a shave that isnt as satisfactory as a $10-15 high quality razor blade (4/5blade gilette for example). This is a simple shave but not a close shave. Maybe use when you dont have much time in the morning or wherever you have to go, need to save time, or want a new easier experience than a regular razor blade. Definitely wouldnt pay this price though.\nReview Title: Way too expensive\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "MUSE & Co Dazzling Rhinestone Stick On Nails, White Nails with Glitter Nails and Rhinestones \"French Sparkle\", Luxurious Elegant Nails, Squoval Medium Length Nails Press On Nails for Women and Girls Fake Nail Set 36pcs\nMUSENCO\n{'Color': 'White', 'Size': '36 Count (Pack of 1)', 'Material': 'Gel', 'Brand': 'MUSENCO', 'Style': 'French', 'Product Dimensions': '1.97 x 4.33 x 0.79 inches; 0.81 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'MUSENCO'}\nThese nails are beautiful for a french manicure but they ended up looking absolutely terrible after applying. I noticed while the nails were still in the package that they had odd chinese like symbols in the glue. I figured it might go away once I put them on but for some of them it didnt. It actually made it look worse and scratchy/bubbly underneath. These \"symbols\" should definitely get removed. I'm not one who does my nails often at all so I'm pretty critical of these. I included pictures of the flaws for others to see.<br /><br />Edit: I peeled these off the next day because of how bubbly and gross they looked underneath. They never dried overnight even after sleeping and still moved around when I tried to move them up and down and back and forth. I dont recommend these nails unless you have no other options.\nI dont recommend these nails unless you have no other options\nLANGE HAIR Extend\u00e9 Conditioning Detangler Hair Spray - Paraben Free Leave-in Conditioner Spray, Detangles and Hydrates Hair, Moisture & Shine | 4OZ\n{'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Material Feature': 'Paraben Free', 'Hair Type': 'Curly, Dry', 'Product Benefits': 'Helps protect color and reinforces strands, leaving them strong and vibrant', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '6.5 x 1.4 x 1.4 inches; 4 Ounces', 'UPC': '793150592708'}\nThis is another product that I feel unsure about the final results. I have long thick coarse curly hair that fizzes very easily and immediately after every shower if I dont use a product in it. I used this before I used any other products but it did not detangle my hair very much compared to how it normally is. I still had to pull through quite a few knots but it didnt seem to take as many pulls to get through them as it normslly does. So I guess that would be considered an improvement. I feel like my hair is volumized and softer with about 5-7 sprays throughout my entire head of hair. This is a thin spray so it is very lightweight and has the consistency similar to water so I dont feel like my hair is at all greasy from this. I used a curl definer like I always do after showers that helps deter the frizz and keep my curls bouncy and it worked well with it. I dont think this product is worth the money for what little it does do. I wouldnt repurchase.\nI wouldnt repurchase\nKaruna Oh, Glow On Face Mask Sheet, Skincare and Beauty Facial Masks with Moisturizing and Collagen Promotion Properties for Healthy Glow, Contain Green Tea, Vitamin C and Pineapple (3 Sheets)\nKaruna\n{'Brand': 'Karuna', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrate Skin,Hydrate', 'Scent': 'Pineapple', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Package Dimensions': '6.54 x 4.88 x 0.87 inches; 9.59 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'MSF1004 - CA', 'UPC': '857950007166'}\nThese were sent to me relatively quickly and I was excited to use them. But as soon as I checked out the packaging i realized they were expired. They had an expiration date of 05/03/2020 which has clearly already passed. Not very happy.\nPast the expiration date\nArgan Magic 100% Pure Argan Oil \u2013 Moisturizing Oil that Infuses Skin with Enriched Hydration | Leaves Skin Restored & Refreshed | Non-Greasy | Rich in Vitamin E | Made in USA | Cruelty Free (2 oz)\nArgan Magic\n{'Brand': 'Argan Magic', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Active Ingredients': 'Vitamin e', 'Unit Count': '2 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.2 x 1.1 x 1.1 inches; 2 Ounces', 'UPC': '605923474046'}\nMy first complaint with this argan oil is the fact that it came in the box leaking as soon as it arrived. They wrap it in a plastic bag for this reason to prevent the oil from leaking out but it still leaked through anyhow. There was at least half an inch of oil missing from the top of the bottle from leakage during commute/delivery. Second complaint is the fact that it really didnt work. Because of the benefits of argan oil with hair, I decided to use this as a mask/soak on my hair from root to tip. I have very thick and pretty long hair and I used the entire bottle to cover my head. I covered my head with a plastic shower cap and sat with it on for over an hour. I showered, shampooed twice and conditioned per usual. I really expected a big difference in the amount of frizz, softness, and shininess of my hair.. and I was highly disappointed. It really didnt tame my frizz at all, made it a slight bit softer and isnt shiny at all. Big let down.\nNot worth the mess\nMarshique Touch Fit Glitter Cream Shadow 0.2Oz (Flamingo Coral Pink) - Opal Pearl Gold Sparkle Eyeshadow, Waterproof and Longlasting for Under fat eye\nMarshique\n{'Brand': 'Marshique', 'Item Form': 'Cream,Powder,Creamy', 'Finish Type': 'Luminous,Sheer,Glitter,Shimmer', 'Special Feature': 'Waterproof', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '2.2 x 2 x 0.6 inches; 0.2 Ounces'}\nVery nice eyeshadow, but a bit too glittery for me. This has more glitter than it does pigment. For that reason alone I would use this as more of an everyday eyeshadow. I really wish I would have chosen a different color because I think I would have liked it more. It is creamy, but doesnt spread all that easily.\nToo much glitter/shimmer\nElectric Shaver for Men, SOOCAS Mens Electric Razor, Wet & Dry IPX7 Waterproof Rotary Facial Shaver, Portable Face Shaver Cordless Travel USB Rechargeable for Husband Dad, Black\nSOOCAS\n{'Brand': 'SOOCAS', 'Special Feature': 'Portable,Rechargeable,Cordless,Waterproof,Compact', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Included Components': 'Charger', 'Blade Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Package Dimensions': '7.36 x 4.21 x 2.68 inches; 11.18 Ounces', 'Batteries': '1 Lithium Ion batteries required.
