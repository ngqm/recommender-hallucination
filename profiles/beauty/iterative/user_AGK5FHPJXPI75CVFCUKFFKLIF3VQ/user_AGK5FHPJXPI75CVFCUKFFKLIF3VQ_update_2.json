I have long thick coarse curly hair that fizzes very easily and immediately after every shower if I dont use a product in it. I used this before I used any other products but it did not detangle my hair very much compared to how it normally is. I still had to pull through quite a few knots but it didnt seem to take as many pulls to get through them as it normslly does. So I guess that would be considered an improvement. I feel like my hair is volumized and softer with about 5-7 sprays throughout my entire head of hair. This is a thin spray so it is very lightweight and has the consistency similar to water so I dont feel like my hair is at all greasy from this. I used a curl definer like I always do after showers that helps deter the frizz and keep my curls bouncy and it worked well with it. I dont think this product is worth the money for what little it does do. I wouldnt repurchase.\nReview Title: I wouldnt repurchase\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I noticed while the nails were still in the package that they had odd chinese like symbols in the glue. I figured it might go away once I put them on but for some of them it didnt. It actually made it look worse and scratchy/bubbly underneath. These \"symbols\" should definitely get removed. I'm not one who does my nails often at all so I'm pretty critical of these. I included pictures of the flaws for others to see.<br /><br />Edit: I peeled these off the next day because of how bubbly and gross they looked underneath. They never dried overnight even after sleeping and still moved around when I tried to move them up and down and back and forth. I dont recommend these nails unless you have no other options.\nI dont recommend these nails unless you have no other options\nLANGE HAIR Extend\u00e9 Conditioning Detangler Hair Spray - Paraben Free Leave-in Conditioner Spray, Detangles and Hydrates Hair, Moisture & Shine | 4OZ\n{'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Material Feature': 'Paraben Free', 'Hair Type': 'Curly, Dry', 'Product Benefits': 'Helps protect color and reinforces strands, leaving them strong and vibrant', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '6.5 x 1.4 x 1.4 inches; 4 Ounces', 'UPC': '793150592708'}\nThis is another product that I feel unsure about the final results.
