  "reference_summary": "Mountain Falls Advanced Formula Nail Polish Remover Pads with 96% Acetone, for Natural Nails, 10 Count\nMountain Falls\n{'Brand': 'Mountain Falls', 'Item Form': 'Pad', 'Item Weight': '0.01 Pounds', 'Unit Count': '10 Count'}\nI used one pad to take off the two layers of medium dark polish and a top coat from my toenails.  It only took one pad to do it all.  That will give me 10 uses per box since there are 10 pads total.  It seems pricey for what you get.  That is why I took it down a star.  If you are looking for convenience this worked well for me.\nconvenient, worked well\nGirzzur fashion headbands for women-(6 Pack) yoga running headbands for women nonslip of wide boho Face washing makeup cloth hair bands\nGirzzur\n{'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material': 'Spandex', 'Fabric Type': 'Cloth,Elastic,Spandex,Nylon', 'Number of Items': '6', 'Brand': 'Girzzur', 'Package Dimensions': '11.06 x 7.68 x 2.56 inches; 4.16 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'NVSTD-01', 'UPC': '782937993012'}\nI am currently letting my gray hairs grow so I needed something to help with those awkward couple months of growth.  These headbands give me an option to hide some of the growth.  They are 4\" wide  and fairly comfortable. I can't do ponytails and clips because I get headaches.  These seem to work OK so far without a major headache.  The colors are crazy and very retro.  I think I will need a set of solid colors, too.  Not bad for the price.\ncrazy retro headbands, 4\" wide\nJARGOD 1pcs 100% Kolinsky Sable Acrylic Nails Round Nail Art Brush (size 4)\nJARGOD\n{'Brand': 'JARGOD', 'Handle Material': 'Acrylic', 'Head Material': 'Kolinsky', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '7.7 x 0.3 x 0.3 inches; 0.63 Ounces'}\nThis is a nice little brush.  I am not using it for nails so I cannot comment on how it works for its intended purpose. I am using it for rock painting.  It is impressing me so far.\nnice\nMainBasics Headband with Buttons for Face Masks (Gray)\nMainBasics\n{'Number of Items': '1', 'Brand': 'MainBasics', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '9.5 x 3.5 x 0.3 inches; 0.81 Ounces', 'UPC': '790887351233'}\nI have sewn reusable masks that I wear.  I do not wear disposable masks. I think this was designed with disposables in mind.  My masks have thicker elastics band that the button just can't hold well.  I think the lighter weight disposables would do better with this headband. It was a nice idea but it did not work.  I haven't decided if I am going to snip off the buttons and try and use it as a regular headband or if I will pass this on to someone else.\ndoesn't work for me\nPurple Hair Mask for Blonde with Keratin & Jojoba Oil - Platinum & Silver Hair - Instantly Eliminate Brassiness & Yellows - Made in USA - Hair Toner - Bleached & Highlighted Hair - Sulfate Free - 8 oz\nWELLUTION\n{'Brand': 'WELLUTION', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Hair Type': 'Damaged,Dry,Color-treated', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating Treatment', 'Package Dimensions': '3.07 x 2.9 x 2.8 inches; 8 Ounces', 'UPC': '749715278440'}\nMy curly greying hair did not like this hair mask.
