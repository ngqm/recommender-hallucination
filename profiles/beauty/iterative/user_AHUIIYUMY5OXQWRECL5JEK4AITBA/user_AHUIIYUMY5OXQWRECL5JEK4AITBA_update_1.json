It only took one pad to do it all.  That will give me 10 uses per box since there are 10 pads total.  It seems pricey for what you get.  That is why I took it down a star.  If you are looking for convenience this worked well for me.\nReview Title: convenient, worked well\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
