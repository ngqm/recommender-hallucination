These headbands give me an option to hide some of the growth.  They are 4\" wide  and fairly comfortable. I can't do ponytails and clips because I get headaches.  These seem to work OK so far without a major headache.  The colors are crazy and very retro.  I think I will need a set of solid colors, too.  Not bad for the price.\nReview Title: crazy retro headbands, 4\" wide\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Mountain Falls Advanced Formula Nail Polish Remover Pads with 96% Acetone, for Natural Nails, 10 Count\nMountain Falls\n{'Brand': 'Mountain Falls', 'Item Form': 'Pad', 'Item Weight': '0.01 Pounds', 'Unit Count': '10 Count'}\nI used one pad to take off the two layers of medium dark polish and a top coat from my toenails.  It only took one pad to do it all.  That will give me 10 uses per box since there are 10 pads total.  It seems pricey for what you get.  That is why I took it down a star.  If you are looking for convenience this worked well for me.\nconvenient, worked well\nGirzzur fashion headbands for women-(6 Pack) yoga running headbands for women nonslip of wide boho Face washing makeup cloth hair bands\nGirzzur\n{'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material': 'Spandex', 'Fabric Type': 'Cloth,Elastic,Spandex,Nylon', 'Number of Items': '6', 'Brand': 'Girzzur', 'Package Dimensions': '11.06 x 7.68 x 2.56 inches; 4.16 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'NVSTD-01', 'UPC': '782937993012'}\nI am currently letting my gray hairs grow so I needed something to help with those awkward couple months of growth.
