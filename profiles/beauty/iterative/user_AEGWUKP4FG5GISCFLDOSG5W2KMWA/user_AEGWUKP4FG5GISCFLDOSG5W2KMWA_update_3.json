I needed a new one\u2014this package of 8 was an unbelievably low price averaging 87 cents each ($6.99 total for 8 brushes)\u2014so now I have a lot of extras!  I wanted a short handled eyebrows brush to fit in my makeup bag\u2014these are only 4 1/4 inches from end to end\u2014long enough to handle comfortably, and short enough to fit.  They are exactly what I wanted, and great for travel.  They are not the highest quality brushes\u2014one brush has a single bristle out of place, and another has a couple of plastic comb prongs not quite straight\u2014but the price was a bargain, and I have plenty in the pack that are just fine (and the slight issues I mentioned don\u2019t make a difference to that one brush).  All in all, I am very happy with this purchase.<br /><br />I write honest reviews to help others make informed purchases.  I do that because I read reviews myself and appreciate how helpful they can be.  I hope my review helped you.\nReview Title: A bargain for basic eyebrow brushes!\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I don\u2019t really like the smell of eucalyptus\u2014it\u2019s great for cold relief and in cough drops to help clear your nasal passages, but not just to smell.  But this one DOES clearly smell more pure than the one I already had.  The other one I was comparing it to is only a couple of months old\u2014so age is not the difference.  This does seem to be better quality.  I am honestly surprised to be reporting that, because I just didn\u2019t think I would notice a difference.<br /><br />If my review was helpful, please let Amazon know by clicking \u201chelpful\u201d.
