A lot of clips are too big for my fine hair.  But these clips seem versatile to work for both thick hair (because they open wide) and fine hair like mine.  They are very comfortable, don\u2019t pull my hair, and they hold very well.  Although they are hard plastic, the tips are not scratchy or sharp, and the material is more like a rubber-coated plastic.  The color assortment is very good to go with pretty much any color of clothes or hair.  I like them!<br /><br />I write honest reviews to help others make informed purchases because I read reviews myself and appreciate how helpful they can be.  I hope that my review helped you.\nReview Title: Comfortable!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

It doesn\u2019t seem to dry my nails out. I appreciate that it is free of Parabens and Phthalates. But the advertised price is high in comparison to comparable nail polishes.\nGood nail polish remover. But pricey\nBloomy Essentials Organic Eucalyptus Globulus Essential Oil 10 mL - USDA Certified Organic - Natural Aromatherapy for Clear Breathing, Mucus Relief, Nausea Relief and Stress Relief - 100% Pure\nBloomy Essentials\n{'Brand': 'Bloomy Essentials', 'Scent': 'Eucalyptus', 'Special Feature': 'Aromatherapy, Pure', 'Seasons': 'All Seasons', 'Item Volume': '10 Milliliters', 'Package Dimensions': '3 x 1.6 x 1.6 inches; 1.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '680912084666', 'Manufacturer': 'Bloomy Essentials'}\nI carefully compared this eucalyptus oil to one I already had, and I was surprised to notice a clear difference\u2014this one smells better.  I don\u2019t really like the smell of eucalyptus\u2014it\u2019s great for cold relief and in cough drops to help clear your nasal passages, but not just to smell.  But this one DOES clearly smell more pure than the one I already had.  The other one I was comparing it to is only a couple of months old\u2014so age is not the difference.  This does seem to be better quality.  I am honestly surprised to be reporting that, because I just didn\u2019t think I would notice a difference.<br /><br />If my review was helpful, please let Amazon know by clicking \u201chelpful\u201d.  Thanks.\nBetter quality and more pure smelling than another one I have\nGUCTOP 8Pcs Makeup Eyelash Brush Eyebrow Comb\nGUCTOP\n{'Brand': 'GUCTOP', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Eyelashes, Eyebrow', 'Material': 'Nylon, Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Item Form': 'Wand', 'Number of Pieces': '8', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Ferrule Material': 'Aluminum', 'Package Dimensions': '5.7 x 2 x 0.8 inches; 1.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '779172386785'}\nThese brushes are great for a more finished look to your eyebrows.  I needed a new one\u2014this package of 8 was an unbelievably low price averaging 87 cents each ($6.99 total for 8 brushes)\u2014so now I have a lot of extras!  I wanted a short handled eyebrows brush to fit in my makeup bag\u2014these are only 4 1/4 inches from end to end\u2014long enough to handle comfortably, and short enough to fit.  They are exactly what I wanted, and great for travel.  They are not the highest quality brushes\u2014one brush has a single bristle out of place, and another has a couple of plastic comb prongs not quite straight\u2014but the price was a bargain, and I have plenty in the pack that are just fine (and the slight issues I mentioned don\u2019t make a difference to that one brush).  All in all, I am very happy with this purchase.<br /><br />I write honest reviews to help others make informed purchases.
