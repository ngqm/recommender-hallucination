This software suite is perfect for the small business with big goals and the features assure you can accurately assess where you are with your finances as you meet them. My brother is a real estate agent and while there are other industry-specific programs for that, he is really enjoying this QuickBooks so far because it allows him to track his expenses, listings aka inventory, commissions and taxes that must be precise with each transaction. Secure import of financials was a relief, and he was set up in about an hour or two and learning his way around the program with relative ease. He also has an assistant that he was able to easily add to the payroll and able to do so without the free support!<br /><br />Considering the list price on this new 2019 edition of Quickbooks is close to $500, the current offering is a steal and I recommend jumping on it before the price goes up again, as these sorts of offerings tend to fluctuate. QuickBooks is the most popular and affordable software compared to others on the market, and you do get what you pay for, so the value here is terrific too. I just began using the regular 2019 since I am on a smaller scale and this version is new to him, so I can't comment on the issues others are having. But considering the expense of upgrades and support on other platforms, this felt like the safest bet and I hope it stays that way!\nGreat software suite for small business at excellent price!\nLivordo Moroccan Argan Oil Essential Organic Cold Pressed Skin Moisturizer Rich in Vitamin E Powerful Antioxidants For Skin, Hair, Body, and Face 4 Oz\nLivordo\n{'Brand': 'Livordo', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Unit Count': '4.00 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Type': 'Acne prone,mature', 'Product Dimensions': '1.5 x 1.5 x 5 inches; 9.24 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'Argan Oil', 'UPC': '010725983878'}\nArgan oil has a distinct but subtle scent, and it is the first thing I look for when using it.
