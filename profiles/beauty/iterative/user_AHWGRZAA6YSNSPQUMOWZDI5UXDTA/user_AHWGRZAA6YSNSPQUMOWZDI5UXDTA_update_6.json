  "profile": "**Updated User Profile Summary:**\n\n- **Quality Concerns**: The user continues to prioritize high-quality products but has recently expressed dissatisfaction with a purchase due to their preference for thicker materials. This indicates a strong adherence to their quality standards, signaling that they are critical when products do not meet their expectations.\n\n- **Material Sensitivity**: The user's sensitivity to material quality remains prominent, as they clearly favor sturdier options. Their negative experience with a recent purchase has reinforced their demand for durability, particularly in beauty products.\n\n- **Aesthetic Preferences**: While the user values aesthetic appeal, their recent critique suggests that visual allure alone is insufficient if the product does not also deliver on quality.
