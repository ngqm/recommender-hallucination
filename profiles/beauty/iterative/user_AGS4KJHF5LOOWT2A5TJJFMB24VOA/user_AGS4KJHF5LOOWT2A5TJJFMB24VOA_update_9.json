The masks are folded in such a way that they're compressed to the size of 2 nickels stacked on top of each other. To use you simply pour lotion or facial cream onto it and then slowly and carefully unfurl it on your face. The first time around you'll likely waste a few masks as the paper is very thin and if you're not careful they tear quite easily.

Mind you 'firm' is not a 'strong' hold but it does manage to lock in short'ish hair properly in place with all the benefits of a wax styled product (ie - does not stiffen the strands). Product is listed as a 'matte' finish and while this is mostly true - when applied to dried hair it does leave behind a slightly greased finish. That said its a decent styling product that applies efficiently to the strands and gives you just the right level of control.\nFirm hold is apt\nBeast Blue Ultra Cooling Body Wash, 6 oz -Beast\nTame the Beast\n{'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Brand': 'Tame the Beast', 'Scent': 'Green Tea', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '7 x 3 x 2 inches; 7.2 Ounces', 'UPC': '817662018539'}\nZippy and refreshing body wash nicely formulated with botanicals and essences to keep you feeling fine and fresh.
