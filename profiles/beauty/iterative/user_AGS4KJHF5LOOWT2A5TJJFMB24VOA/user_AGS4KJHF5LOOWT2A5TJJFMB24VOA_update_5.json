The cleanser looks like clear liquid in the bottle but comes out as a nice foam and a couple of pumps is all that's needed for an adequate washing of your face. The active ingredient here is rice bran oil - but the wash doesn't feel oily at all. Provides a pleasant washing experience and when rinsed off leaves behind a nice, refreshed finish. Good for daily use and the 1 ounce version is compact enough for easy travel transport.\nReview Title: The power of rice bran oil\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "100 pcs Compressed Facial Mask Women DIY Beauty Facial Cotton Paper Compress Masque Disposable Dry Sheet Mask for Skin Face Care\nEvoio\n{'Brand': 'Evoio', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Scent': 'Cotton Paper', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Unit Count': '100.00 Count', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '9.29 x 4.41 x 2.87 inches; 5.96 Ounces'}\nProduct comes in a small fabric pouch containing 100 individually sealed compact paper masks. The masks are folded in such a way that they're compressed to the size of 2 nickels stacked on top of each other. To use you simply pour lotion or facial cream onto it and then slowly and carefully unfurl it on your face. The first time around you'll likely waste a few masks as the paper is very thin and if you're not careful they tear quite easily. That said once you get the hang of it they provide a decent and cost friendly way to get a homemade lotion mask treatment.\nLotion mask on the cheap\nEmbryolisse Eau de Beaute Rosamelis Face Toner, 6.76 Fl Oz\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.85 x 2.76 x 7.44 inches; 8.11 Ounces', 'Item model number': '501000', 'Manufacturer': 'Embryolisse'}\nProduct comes in a clear plastic spray bottle containing 6.76 ounces of liquid.

Mind you 'firm' is not a 'strong' hold but it does manage to lock in short'ish hair properly in place with all the benefits of a wax styled product (ie - does not stiffen the strands). Product is listed as a 'matte' finish and while this is mostly true - when applied to dried hair it does leave behind a slightly greased finish. That said its a decent styling product that applies efficiently to the strands and gives you just the right level of control.\nFirm hold is apt\nBeast Blue Ultra Cooling Body Wash, 6 oz -Beast\nTame the Beast\n{'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Brand': 'Tame the Beast', 'Scent': 'Green Tea', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '7 x 3 x 2 inches; 7.2 Ounces', 'UPC': '817662018539'}\nZippy and refreshing body wash nicely formulated with botanicals and essences to keep you feeling fine and fresh. Product comes in a plastic squeeze tube containing 6 ounces of gel. A little dab is all that's needed on a scrubby towel to generate rich lather and provide a proper wash. The menthol essence is pronounced so its best used during the warmer seasons to provide that nice, tingly cooling effect when you're done with the shower.\nKeep it minty\nI WOKE UP LIKE THIS Turn-over Rice Perfect Oil Foam Cleanser \u2013 A Hypoallergenic Cleansing oil, Foaming Face Wash with Rice Bran Extract.
