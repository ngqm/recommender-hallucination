It's very nice and stays on you for awhile. So, you pump out the 'gel' which I would call soap except for the fact that it doesn't lather much. Instructions say to pump in your hand then apply to face. I tried that, but my face felt too dry, so I moistened it a little bit and then applied the gel. I rinsed it off well and patted my skin dry. Within seconds I felt my skin drying up. If you have really dry skin, you know what I mean - that taut feeling you try to avoid. I had to get some cream and moisturize right away. I'm guessing there must be something like alcohol in this makeup remover. If you have oily skin or perhaps you're trying to remove a heavy foundation - this may be a good choice for you. But since I wear light makeup and have very dry skin, I can't use this. I'll try it again in the summer when my skin produces more oil as the scent is really nice and makes it worth a second try.\nReview Title: Not for dry skin\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

So, in preparation I also ordered clear eyelash glue. I think that did the trick. I didn't have an issue getting them off the paper as some people mentioned - just be careful knowing they're small & delicate. I used a tweezer. It's fun to have a temporary nose stud!
