So, in preparation I also ordered clear eyelash glue. I think that did the trick. I didn't have an issue getting them off the paper as some people mentioned - just be careful knowing they're small & delicate. I used a tweezer. It's fun to have a temporary nose stud! Now trying to figure out exactly where to place it was the challenge for me.\nTemporary Fashion Statement\nElfina Hair Cutting Shears, 6.0\" Professional Stainless Barber Scissors Set for Hairdressing, Thinning, Texturizing, Salon or Home Use - Flat Shears, Tooth Shears, Comb & Hair Clip Included (Pink)\nELFINA\n{'Brand': 'ELFINA', 'Included Components': 'Scissors', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Blade Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '8.5 x 3.5 x 1 inches; 8.01 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'BE-HS-GPINK', 'Manufacturer': 'ELFINA'}\nScissors work great. That's all I needed though. I don't have any use for the thinner. I would've preferred a cape instead.\nGood scissors\nBior\u00e9 J-Beauty Makeup Removing Moisturizing Cleansing Jelly, Top Japanese Makeup Remover, Gentle Skin Cleanser, Mild Floral Fragrance, Non-Greasy, 7.8 Ounce\nBior\u00e9\n['Bior\u00e9 J-Beauty Makeup Removing Moisturizing Cleansing Jelly is a non-greasy makeup remover that removes dirt and impurities from deep below the surface of your skin.

It's very nice and stays on you for awhile. So, you pump out the 'gel' which I would call soap except for the fact that it doesn't lather much. Instructions say to pump in your hand then apply to face. I tried that, but my face felt too dry, so I moistened it a little bit and then applied the gel. I rinsed it off well and patted my skin dry. Within seconds I felt my skin drying up. If you have really dry skin, you know what I mean - that taut feeling you try to avoid. I had to get some cream and moisturize right away. I'm guessing there must be something like alcohol in this makeup remover. If you have oily skin or perhaps you're trying to remove a heavy foundation - this may be a good choice for you. But since I wear light makeup and have very dry skin, I can't use this. I'll try it again in the summer when my skin produces more oil as the scent is really nice and makes it worth a second try.\nNot for dry skin\nSia Botanics Vitamin C + Lemon Peel Brightening Cleanser Concentrate (4 oz)\nSia Botanics\n{'Item Form': 'Serum', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'Sia Botanics', 'Scent': 'Lemon', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '4.13 x 1.93 x 1.93 inches; 4 Ounces', 'UPC': '713757593908'}\nI just washed my face with this Sia C + Lemon Peel wash. It lathered nicely in my hands and on my face. It has a soft lemony scent. It rinsed well - and this is where you'll feel the difference. You know the phrase 'squeaky clean'? That's what you'll feel. There's absolutely no residue left behind. If you've used Noxema to wash your face, it has a similar effect. Because I'm prone to dry skin, I had to apply cream immediately. The label on the bottle suggests washing with this, then using a toner, followed by Vitamin C. Makes sense as your skin is stripped of everything and is ready for some TLC. I think this is an ideal wash for people with oily or combination skin. For me, this will be a great summer wash to control the shine (oil). If you're skin is dry like mine, then moisturize immediately after using.\nLemony face wash \ud83c\udf4b\nAJOKE 10 pcs Soft Makeup Sponge set Blender,Flawless Beauty Sponge Blenders for Dry & Wet Use,for Cream,Powder and Liquid,Multi-colored Makeup Sponges\nAJOKE\n{'Brand': 'AJOKE', 'Color': 'Ivory', 'Material': 'Sponge,Foam', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Makeup Sponge', 'Specific Uses For Product': 'Blender', 'Package Dimensions': '7.95 x 5.12 x 1.73 inches; 5.61 Ounces'}\nI don't often wear cover-up but when I do, a good sponge can really help with the application. The sponge can get into the crevices better than your fingertip can and is much gentler to use around your delicate eye area. I've found cleaning them is somewhat of a chore, but you need to keep them clean. I rinsed mine thoroughly and let it air-dry. This 10-pack is a good value and will last awhile.\nFor makeup\nWenobby 2 PCS 3.2\" Retro Rhinestone Organic Cellulose Acetate Hair Claw Clip for Women\nWenobby\n{'Brand': 'Wenobby', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Embellishment': 'Rhinestone', 'Material': 'Wood, Plastic, Cotton', 'UPC': '797823973405'}\nThese look just as nice in person.
