  "reference_summary": "Caudalie Favorites Set\n{'Package Dimensions': '9.09 x 6.54 x 2.05 inches; 9.59 Ounces', 'Item model number': '2346203'}\nI am a big fan of caudalie products. This is a mini size kit and is perfect for travel. There are five products in this kit. I have sensitive skin and I always trust caudalie! Plus, the products always have a pleasant smell.\nFavorite\nNo Brainer Gentle Facial Cleanser, 6 fl. oz, For Dry & Sensitive Skin, Leaves Skin Feeling Clean, Soft and Hydrated, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein & Amino Acids Restores Skin by Higher Education Skincare\nHigher Education\n{'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Brand': 'Higher Education', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '6.00 Fl Oz', 'Package Dimensions': '7.2 x 2.3 x 2.3 inches; 8.01 Ounces', 'UPC': '811381030056'}\nI really like this face wash. I've used it just in my hands to wash my face really quickly, and I've also used it with my facial cleansing brush to get a deeper clean. It smells amazing. It has a thicker consistency and lathers, which I really like because it makes my face feel extra clean. Would buy this again!\nWould repurchase!\nLANGE HAIR Extend\u00e9 Conditioning Detangler Hair Spray - Paraben Free Leave-in Conditioner Spray, Detangles and Hydrates Hair, Moisture & Shine | 4OZ\n{'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Material Feature': 'Paraben Free', 'Hair Type': 'Curly, Dry', 'Product Benefits': 'Helps protect color and reinforces strands, leaving them strong and vibrant', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '6.5 x 1.4 x 1.4 inches; 4 Ounces', 'UPC': '793150592708'}\nThis has a great smell but I found the product was too thin for my damaged hair.

The packaging is beautiful and could make a nice Christmas gift. This is a great starter set to introduce someone to the brand. It comes with the cleanser, cream and serum. All the products are high quality and have been on my go to list for years. This is an excellent value.\nValue pack\nKaruna 7 Days of Glow - Face & Eye Mask Variety Pack (7 Sheets), Hydrate, Brighten and Glow\nKaruna\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.05 x 5.04 x 1.57 inches; 8.75 Ounces', 'UPC': '857950007333'}\nThis is a really fun set and would make a good gift. It comes with 7 masks and lists what order to use them in. Varies from hydrating, brightening to clarifying masks.<br /><br />These are all cloth masks and easy to use. After the week my skin did feel very well hydrated. This is a bit expensive for what it is, but is a fun splurge.\n7 masks\nSimpliGrown Bath Co.

I probably wouldn\u2019t use them on the bikini area but they\u2019re fine for legs.<br /><br />Has a bit of an unpleasant smell. Easy to use. I heat them up with a blow dryer for a few seconds then stick on my legs and pull.
