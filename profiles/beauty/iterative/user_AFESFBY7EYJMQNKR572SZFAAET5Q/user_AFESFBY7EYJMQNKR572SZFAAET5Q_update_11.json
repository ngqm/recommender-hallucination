  "reference_summary": "Caudalie Favorites Set\n{'Package Dimensions': '9.09 x 6.54 x 2.05 inches; 9.59 Ounces', 'Item model number': '2346203'}\nI am a big fan of caudalie products. This is a mini size kit and is perfect for travel. There are five products in this kit. I have sensitive skin and I always trust caudalie! Plus, the products always have a pleasant smell.\nFavorite\nNo Brainer Gentle Facial Cleanser, 6 fl. oz, For Dry & Sensitive Skin, Leaves Skin Feeling Clean, Soft and Hydrated, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein & Amino Acids Restores Skin by Higher Education Skincare\nHigher Education\n{'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Brand': 'Higher Education', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '6.00 Fl Oz', 'Package Dimensions': '7.2 x 2.3 x 2.3 inches; 8.01 Ounces', 'UPC': '811381030056'}\nI really like this face wash. I've used it just in my hands to wash my face really quickly, and I've also used it with my facial cleansing brush to get a deeper clean. It smells amazing. It has a thicker consistency and lathers, which I really like because it makes my face feel extra clean. Would buy this again!\nWould repurchase!\nLANGE HAIR Extend\u00e9 Conditioning Detangler Hair Spray - Paraben Free Leave-in Conditioner Spray, Detangles and Hydrates Hair, Moisture & Shine | 4OZ\n{'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Material Feature': 'Paraben Free', 'Hair Type': 'Curly, Dry', 'Product Benefits': 'Helps protect color and reinforces strands, leaving them strong and vibrant', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '6.5 x 1.4 x 1.4 inches; 4 Ounces', 'UPC': '793150592708'}\nThis has a great smell but I found the product was too thin for my damaged hair. I prefer a thicker hair cream spray.  If you\u2019re looking for a very light spray, you may enjoy this product.\nNot thick enough\nCaudalie Vinosource SOS Intense Hydration Set: Hydrating Trio for Sensitive Skin including a Daily Foam Cleanser, Hydrating Serum, Facial Moisturizer\n{'Package Dimensions': '6.93 x 5.35 x 2.64 inches; 14.5 Ounces'}\nI\u2019ve used this brand for years so I was excited to find this value pack! The packaging is beautiful and could make a nice Christmas gift. This is a great starter set to introduce someone to the brand. It comes with the cleanser, cream and serum. All the products are high quality and have been on my go to list for years. This is an excellent value.\nValue pack\nKaruna 7 Days of Glow - Face & Eye Mask Variety Pack (7 Sheets), Hydrate, Brighten and Glow\nKaruna\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.05 x 5.04 x 1.57 inches; 8.75 Ounces', 'UPC': '857950007333'}\nThis is a really fun set and would make a good gift. It comes with 7 masks and lists what order to use them in. Varies from hydrating, brightening to clarifying masks.<br /><br />These are all cloth masks and easy to use. After the week my skin did feel very well hydrated. This is a bit expensive for what it is, but is a fun splurge.\n7 masks\nSimpliGrown Bath Co.

I pay careful attention to what I use on my body and a lot of baby powders have a lot of not so good ingredients. This is a cleaner brand and I would use it again!\nCleaner ingredients\nREALHER Cheek Trio - Ultimate Glow Getter - Blush, Highlighter, & Bronzer Contour Palette - High Quality, Silky Formulation\nRealHer\n{'Package Dimensions': '4.84 x 2.56 x 0.67 inches; 3.25 Ounces'}\nThis is a very pretty contour kit. It has a blush color, hi lighter and a darker contour color. I like that the packaging isn\u2019t huge which makes it good for travel. The colors are very pretty and they last on my face all day. I would buy this again.\nPretty contour\nSTARAMZ 7 Set Bachelorette Scrunchies Bridesmaid Proposal Gifts Hair Ties for Women Bachelorette Party Favors ( Blush)\nSTARAMZ\n{'Material': 'Satin', 'Item Form': 'Scrunchie', 'Brand': 'STARAMZ', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Number of Pieces': '7', 'Package Dimensions': '9.69 x 7.8 x 2.44 inches; 2.89 Ounces'}\nThese are very cute scrunchies for a bridesmaid gift.

I probably wouldn\u2019t use them on the bikini area but they\u2019re fine for legs.<br /><br />Has a bit of an unpleasant smell. Easy to use. I heat them up with a blow dryer for a few seconds then stick on my legs and pull. Also comes with an oil cloth to remove any leftover wax.\nEasy to use\nNIRA Skincare Laser & Serum Bundle - Includes Anti-Aging Laser & Hyaluronic Acid Serum - Reduces Appearance of Fine Lines & Wrinkles - FDA Cleared\nNira\n{'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydration', 'Use for': 'Face', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'Nira'}\nI have been using this device for a full three months. I can honestly say that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s made a whole lot of difference in my under eye area.<br /><br />The device is easy to use and has different levels. It holds a charge very well. Occasionally I would get a little \u201czap\u201d but it wasn\u2019t anything super painful.<br /><br />This device is pretty expensive. Weighing the cost versus the results, I personally wouldn\u2019t buy this again.\nExpensive\nSilk Exfoliating Mitt,Deep Exfoliating Mitt Body Scrub And Face Scrub,Dead Skin Removal Smooth Skin And Keratosis Pilaris Treatment\nVOFEL\n{'Brand': 'VOFEL', 'Skin Type': 'Dry,Sensitive', 'Product Benefits': 'Exfoliator,Smooth Skin,Exfoliating', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '7.68 x 4.61 x 0.43 inches; 0.63 Ounces', 'UPC': '770456406847'}\nHonestly, this is just ok. It doesn\u2019t do a whole lot since it isn\u2019t rough. I was looking for something that would better exfoliate. Definitely overpriced. I wouldn\u2019t buy it again.\nOverpriced",
