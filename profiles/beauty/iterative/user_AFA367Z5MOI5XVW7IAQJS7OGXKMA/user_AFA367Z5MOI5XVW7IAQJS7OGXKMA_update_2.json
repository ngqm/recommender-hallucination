  "reference_summary": "C.O. Bigelow No. 007 Dr Hiosous Quince Hand Lotion, 4 Ounces\nC. O. Bigelow\n{'Brand': 'C. O. Bigelow', 'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Unit Count': '4 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Use for': 'Hands', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.6 x 2 x 0.7 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'Item model number': '20002240'}\nThis is a nice hand cream. The tube is a generous size. I've used C.O. Bigelow products in the past and have always enjoyed them so I was interested in trying this hand cream. It's very moisturizing! I usually use it after washing my hands or if I wake up in the night with dry hands from air conditioning. It's not so thick that it's hard to get out of the tube, and it's not very greasy, but still feels really good and moisturizing, taking a minute to really absorb. The smell is great! I wasn't really familiar with the scent of quince before. All I knew about it was that it was a fruit. The smell is really nice, I don't even know how to describe it! Subtly fruity, maybe a little spicy too, definitely enjoyable! This is a great product and will last a long time.\nLovely!\nEltaMD Skin Recovery Essence Hydrating Toner for Face, Face Toner for Oily Skin and Sensitive Skin, Alcohol Free Formula, Helps Detoxify and Hydrate Skin, pH Balanced, Oil Free, 7.3 oz Bottle\n{'Brand': 'EltaMD', 'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Product Benefits': 'EltaMD Skin Recovery Toner helps to repair damaged skin, calms skin and helps to minimize the risk of irritation.EltaMD Skin Recovery Toner helps to repair damaged skin, calms skin and helps to minimize the risk of irritation.
