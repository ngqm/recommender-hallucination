It smells amazing and very chocolate-y! The scrub itself is a good texture. I wish it was a tad less runny but it isn't a big deal. The crushed coffee beans and sea salt give good scrub and the glycerin adds moisture. I will say that it does make a big mess. My shower looked so gross afterward. Thankfully I have a detachable shower head so I was able to easily spray around and clean things up because it was all over the place! Oh well. My skin felt soft and smooth and I'm obsessed with the scent so I'll continue to use it.\nReview Title: Smells delicious!\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "C.O. Bigelow No. 007 Dr Hiosous Quince Hand Lotion, 4 Ounces\nC. O. Bigelow\n{'Brand': 'C. O. Bigelow', 'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Unit Count': '4 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Use for': 'Hands', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.6 x 2 x 0.7 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'Item model number': '20002240'}\nThis is a nice hand cream. The tube is a generous size. I've used C.O. Bigelow products in the past and have always enjoyed them so I was interested in trying this hand cream. It's very moisturizing! I usually use it after washing my hands or if I wake up in the night with dry hands from air conditioning. It's not so thick that it's hard to get out of the tube, and it's not very greasy, but still feels really good and moisturizing, taking a minute to really absorb. The smell is great! I wasn't really familiar with the scent of quince before. All I knew about it was that it was a fruit. The smell is really nice, I don't even know how to describe it! Subtly fruity, maybe a little spicy too, definitely enjoyable! This is a great product and will last a long time.\nLovely!\nEltaMD Skin Recovery Essence Hydrating Toner for Face, Face Toner for Oily Skin and Sensitive Skin, Alcohol Free Formula, Helps Detoxify and Hydrate Skin, pH Balanced, Oil Free, 7.3 oz Bottle\n{'Brand': 'EltaMD', 'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Product Benefits': 'EltaMD Skin Recovery Toner helps to repair damaged skin, calms skin and helps to minimize the risk of irritation.EltaMD Skin Recovery Toner helps to repair damaged skin, calms skin and helps to minimize the risk of irritation.

It gently tones the skin after cleansing. It leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized, not tight or dry. I'm looking forward to using it more along with other products from Elta MD. It feels gentle on my skin, which is especially nice as it gets drier during the winter months. The bottle is a nice large size as well, so it is a good value.\nSoothes my skin\nSand & Sky Face Roller & Massager Tool.

I already use jade rollers and gua sha and all that good stuff so I was excited to try this facial roller. I use it after applying serum to really help it absorb. It feels amazing! The metal feels cold on my face and it's just fun to use. It helps wake me up in the morning and feels great, like I'm doing something luxurious. It's easy to glide across the face and you can just rinse it off when you are done. A nice tool and I enjoy using it.\nSoothing\n100% PURE Cocoa Coffee Body Scrub Exfoliating Deep Cleanse with Sea Salts & Nourishing Oils Natural Moisturizing Skincare Radiant Skin Restore & Pore Cleanser for Women & Men Vegan - 10oz\n100% PURE\n['Our invigorating cacao and coffee body scrub buffs away bumps and flakes for radiant, deeply nourished skin.
