Primarily, the perm solution is really, really harsh. I cannot recommend the kit if this is the primary component of the kit you want. I would suggest looking elsewhere. On the other hand, the amount of glue rings, wands and microbrushes prove to be very useful to me. If you are after the accessories, then this is a fair value. I have no strong opinion about the pads or scrapers. Overall, this is not a product I would recommend, but if you are after the accessories in the kit, then I would say this is a decent kit to have those on hand.

  "reference_summary": "Butterfly Nail Art Decals Water Transfer Stickers, 22 Sheets Butterfly Nail Sticker DIY Nail Decals, 2 Set Butterfly Nail Glitter Holographic Stickers Reflected Butterfly Designs for Nails Supply\nB bangcool\n{'Surface Recommendation nail': '', '': 'Unit Count 1.00 Count', 'Shape Irregular': '', 'Brand': 'B bangcool', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '6.3 x 3.54 x 1.57 inches', 'Theme': 'Butterfly', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Reusability': 'Single Use', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Pattern': 'Insects', 'Product Dimensions': '6.3 x 3.54 x 1.57 inches; 5.61 Ounces'}\nThe Butterfly Nail Art Decals Water Transfer Stickers bundle is a great deal. You get 22 full sheets of stickers. Each sheet has over 50 stickers as far as I've counted them. They are either multi-colored and halographic or metallic outlined patterns. Every sheet is a little different, so there are no repeats. They apply easily, but I highly recommend doing a base coat first and a coat on top as well. There are also 2 generously filled jars of holographic butterflies that measure 4mm by 4mm at the widest points. This is a really pretty collection of butterflies and I couldn't recommend them more for both the value and variety!\nFantastic Value!\nanmas rucci Acrylic Nail Art Tools Kit Set Colorful Glitter Nail Rhinestones Acrylic Nail Art Curved Tweezer 3D Nail Butterfly Sticker Manicure Color Rhinestones #F\nanmas rucci\n{'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'Anmas rucci', 'Included Components': 'Glitter, Tweezer', 'Package Dimensions': '8.74 x 6.06 x 2.6 inches; 8.15 Ounces', 'UPC': '786118089648'}\nThe anmas rucci Acrylic Nail Art Tools Kit gives you a little bit of everything for making your nails, or even crafting creations several different options for creative expression. My favorite part of the set is the half-pearls and pixie beads, but all of the pieces are really pretty. The tape works well with my own adhesive I already had on hand. This is a really fun set and I'd recommend them to anyone that likes to get creative with their nail art!\nVery Nice Set!\nFog-free Dental Mirror and 4 Pieces of Stainless Steel Dental Pick Professional Oral Care Kit for Family including Dogs Oral Care\nSunrise glow\n{'Package Dimensions': '8.15 x 2.4 x 1.3 inches; 4.23 Ounces'}\nI'm happy with the Fog-free Dental Mirror and 4 Pieces of Stainless Steel Dental Pick. It's packaged securely and all the pieces were in excellent condition upon arrival. I visit my dentist often, but I sometimes need a little help to find rogue bits of debris in some of my teeth. The dental mirror is incredibly handy for that use. I also find the dental picks are better for me as hobby tools. I've never felt the need to scrap my own teeth to risk damage to surrounding tissues. They do a good job in tiny crevices and have a textured handle which is easy to hold. I find this set to be a good value and the versatile use is a great bonus for me.\nGreat Set\nLash Lift Kit,Cuckoo Upgraded Eyelash Lift Kit,Eyelash Perm Kit,Professional Semi-Permanent Curling Perming Wave Suitable For Salon,Lash Lift\nCuckoo\n{'Brand': 'Cuckoo', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '11.81 x 5.12 x 9.84 inches', 'Operation Mode': 'Manual', 'Product Dimensions': '11.81 x 5.12 x 9.84 inches; 7.87 Ounces'}\nI have a lot of mixed feelings about the Cuckoo Upgraded Eyelash Lift Kit.
