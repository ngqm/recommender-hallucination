  "reference_summary": "Butterfly Nail Art Decals Water Transfer Stickers, 22 Sheets Butterfly Nail Sticker DIY Nail Decals, 2 Set Butterfly Nail Glitter Holographic Stickers Reflected Butterfly Designs for Nails Supply\nB bangcool\n{'Surface Recommendation nail': '', '': 'Unit Count 1.00 Count', 'Shape Irregular': '', 'Brand': 'B bangcool', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '6.3 x 3.54 x 1.57 inches', 'Theme': 'Butterfly', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Reusability': 'Single Use', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Pattern': 'Insects', 'Product Dimensions': '6.3 x 3.54 x 1.57 inches; 5.61 Ounces'}\nThe Butterfly Nail Art Decals Water Transfer Stickers bundle is a great deal. You get 22 full sheets of stickers. Each sheet has over 50 stickers as far as I've counted them. They are either multi-colored and halographic or metallic outlined patterns. Every sheet is a little different, so there are no repeats. They apply easily, but I highly recommend doing a base coat first and a coat on top as well. There are also 2 generously filled jars of holographic butterflies that measure 4mm by 4mm at the widest points. This is a really pretty collection of butterflies and I couldn't recommend them more for both the value and variety!\nFantastic Value!\nanmas rucci Acrylic Nail Art Tools Kit Set Colorful Glitter Nail Rhinestones Acrylic Nail Art Curved Tweezer 3D Nail Butterfly Sticker Manicure Color Rhinestones #F\nanmas rucci\n{'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'Anmas rucci', 'Included Components': 'Glitter, Tweezer', 'Package Dimensions': '8.74 x 6.06 x 2.6 inches; 8.15 Ounces', 'UPC': '786118089648'}\nThe anmas rucci Acrylic Nail Art Tools Kit gives you a little bit of everything for making your nails, or even crafting creations several different options for creative expression. My favorite part of the set is the half-pearls and pixie beads, but all of the pieces are really pretty. The tape works well with my own adhesive I already had on hand. This is a really fun set and I'd recommend them to anyone that likes to get creative with their nail art!\nVery Nice Set!\nFog-free Dental Mirror and 4 Pieces of Stainless Steel Dental Pick Professional Oral Care Kit for Family including Dogs Oral Care\nSunrise glow\n{'Package Dimensions': '8.15 x 2.4 x 1.3 inches; 4.23 Ounces'}\nI'm happy with the Fog-free Dental Mirror and 4 Pieces of Stainless Steel Dental Pick. It's packaged securely and all the pieces were in excellent condition upon arrival. I visit my dentist often, but I sometimes need a little help to find rogue bits of debris in some of my teeth. The dental mirror is incredibly handy for that use. I also find the dental picks are better for me as hobby tools. I've never felt the need to scrap my own teeth to risk damage to surrounding tissues. They do a good job in tiny crevices and have a textured handle which is easy to hold. I find this set to be a good value and the versatile use is a great bonus for me.\nGreat Set\nLash Lift Kit,Cuckoo Upgraded Eyelash Lift Kit,Eyelash Perm Kit,Professional Semi-Permanent Curling Perming Wave Suitable For Salon,Lash Lift\nCuckoo\n{'Brand': 'Cuckoo', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '11.81 x 5.12 x 9.84 inches', 'Operation Mode': 'Manual', 'Product Dimensions': '11.81 x 5.12 x 9.84 inches; 7.87 Ounces'}\nI have a lot of mixed feelings about the Cuckoo Upgraded Eyelash Lift Kit. Primarily, the perm solution is really, really harsh. I cannot recommend the kit if this is the primary component of the kit you want. I would suggest looking elsewhere. On the other hand, the amount of glue rings, wands and microbrushes prove to be very useful to me. If you are after the accessories, then this is a fair value. I have no strong opinion about the pads or scrapers. Overall, this is not a product I would recommend, but if you are after the accessories in the kit, then I would say this is a decent kit to have those on hand.

I found it difficult to get a decent lather from the sheets, even when using 2 or 3 at a time. This makes them less than ideal for bathing. However, I did get them to do a great job for cleaning just my hands. I would suggest them for cleaning hands while on the go. The scent is very light when added to water. A tin is included, which is a bit more durable than the paper envelopes. The tin slides open, matchbox style. I would recommend using the tin as it will withstand being transported in a pocket, purse or bag better than the paper envelopes. If you anticipate being exposed to rain, I would suggest to place the tin and/or envelopes into a plastic bag. Using water and friction is superior to using hand sanitizer, and with the soap sheets you will be able to maintain much cleaner hands while out and about.<br /><br />If you are looking for a portable soap for bathing, I would still suggest to use bar soap wrapped in wax paper inside a plastic bag. If you are in situations where you need to wash hands without soap provided, these are ideal for that need. I would recommend the soap sheets as they are easy to transport and cost effective for hand washing.

It works well and is easy to use with the USB cord. I often use this with a battery pack. The accessories have served well and after several months of use are still in good shape. It does great for my nails, but I also use this on my feet. It makes my self-mani and pedis quick and easy. The handle is easy to grip. Speed is quick, but not so much that it's difficult to control. I find that this is a good nail drill for personal use, but I wouldn't recommend it for multiple users as it does start to get warm in my hand when I am finishing on myself. I find it's a very fair value. I hope my experience is helpful and you kindly will click the button below.\nGreat Value!\nGERSHION Pastel Gel Nail Polish Set, 6 Colors Gel Polish Set, Soak Off UV Lamp Gel Polish Kit, Nude Pink Yellow Green Color Nail Polish Kit, 7.5ml Gel Polish Kit H-10\nGERSHION\n{'Brand': 'GERSHION', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Color': 'Blue,Green,Pastel,Pink,Purple', 'Type': 'gel', 'Finish Type': 'Glossy', 'Special Feature': 'Long-lasting', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '1.5 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '6', 'Package Dimensions': '4.53 x 3.27 x 3.15 inches; 9.74 Ounces'}\nI am very happy with my order of the Gershion Pastel Gel Nail Polish Set. These are great to use as it's a nice and even texture. The colors are great for me to use under different stamps, stencils and with stencils for nail art. They also look great as plain colors under a glossy or matte topcoat. I find that it dries easily under my 36 watt lamp. I find this set to be a good value. I hope you find my experience helpful as you kindly click the button below.\nBeautiful Colors\nResin Decorative Accessories Set, Resin Jewelery Making, Nail Art, Including Dried Flowers, Resin Flash Sequins, Gold Foil, Seashell,for Resin Crafts Beginners, Nail Art, DIY Making\nMinaluoze\n{'Color': 'Gold,White', 'Material': 'Resin', 'Brand': 'Minaluoze', 'Product Dimensions': '5.9 x 5.9 x 4.9 inches; 1.82 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'SNH-001'}\nI am happy with my order of the Resin Decorative Accessories Set. This was packaged well and arrived in great condition. What I really like is that this set of tools and inclusions comes in a multi-level box that is transparent. It is easy to see what inclusions are inside, which is very easy to use while working on a project. Pipettes are really great to remove bubbles and also to apply very small amounts of resin into detailed areas. The silicone mat is essential to protect a working surface and the tweezers are very useful to add small items into a poured resin piece. There are also extra 30ml mixing cups, tiny spoons and wooden sticks.<br /><br />These inclusions are great to use with other materials besides resin like nail art, decoupage glues, acrylic paint and polymer clay. This makes the set versatile for working with different mediums and for different projects. There are full round hole-less beads and also half beads. I really like the tiny seashells, my set also includes a tiny starfish. I am putting these into a resin painting with some sand I saved from a recent beach vacation. The only thing included with this set that is not useful to me are the finger cots, as I prefer to wear gloves when working with resin. The only negative aspect is very small, but some glitter was loose. I did not find this to be bothersome, but did want to mention that. There is a lot of supplies in this kit and I consider it to be a really great value for all that is included.
