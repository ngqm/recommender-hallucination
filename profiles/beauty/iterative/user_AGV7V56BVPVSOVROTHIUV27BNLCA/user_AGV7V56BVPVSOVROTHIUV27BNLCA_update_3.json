  "reference_summary": "TAKIYA 72pcs Mixed Assorted Style Full Cover Acrylic False Artificial Nail Tips (3 Boxes\uff0cNot Includes Glue)\n{'Size': 'Large', 'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Style': 'French', 'Coverage': 'Full Well Tips', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '9.06 x 6.65 x 1.06 inches; 2.54 Ounces'}\nThese are very thin and cheap. Even the designs rub off within a day or two. When I wore the first pair pair I thought it might just be a fluke that they kept breaking off and the design came off. So, I tried a second set. The same thing happened. Just tossed the 3rd set.\nDon't waste you money!\nKiss Gel Fantasy Ready-to-Wear Gel 24 Nails KGN53 Olivia (2 Pack)\nKISS\n{'Size': '2 Pack', 'Material': 'Gel', 'Brand': 'KISS', 'Style': 'Art Deco', 'Pattern': 'Solid', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.63 x 4.53 x 1.89 inches; 2.36 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Ivy Enterprises, Inc.'}\nGreat nails. The best brand I have found. I wear them all of the time. If taken care of they will last about a week. I have found that if you put a top coat or clear polish on top the color doesn't wear off the tips as much adding to the lasting color. I used to do my own nails but got tired of having to wait for the polish to dry especially when in a hurry. These you can put a drop or so of glue and they stay on without damaging your nails. I wear gloves when I do the dishes and clean so they last long. I get compliments all of the time.\nGreat nails!\nYVVO Fake Nails Nail Art Manicure - Full Cover Short Pattern Violet False Nails with Rotating Solution pressure Pink Diamond Clover Decor - Complete Nail Beauty Trimmer/File/Glue/Cleaner Cotton Pads S\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.8 x 3.31 x 0.83 inches; 2.57 Ounces', 'UPC': '634923438611'}\nThese are beautiful!
