Even the designs rub off within a day or two. When I wore the first pair pair I thought it might just be a fluke that they kept breaking off and the design came off. So, I tried a second set. The same thing happened. Just tossed the 3rd set.\nReview Title: Don't waste you money!\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
