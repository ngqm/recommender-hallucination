First of all the handle is a heavy duty handle with some weight to it . I like that. It also has a magnetic feature to change the blades . I was worried it would fall off when shaving but it stood firm. The magnetic feature makes it super easy to change heads. Unfortunately I didn\u2019t  see any replacement heads to order on Amazon. I would have liked the kit to come with more heads,  it comes with two, one to use and one replacement . I really like the aloe strip that surrounds the 5 blades , most of my other razors it\u2019s just on one side. The razor cuts close and is comfortable to use. It also comes with a ceramic base to hold it . It looks great and simple while being stored.\nReview Title: No replacement heads?\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Embryolisse Eau de Beaute Rosamelis Face Toner, 6.76 Fl Oz\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.85 x 2.76 x 7.44 inches; 8.11 Ounces', 'Item model number': '501000', 'Manufacturer': 'Embryolisse'}\nI love that the toner is in a spray bottle. I wish the instructions were in A bit more clear.  I do not know if you are supposed to spray it on your face and go or use a cotton pad. I do not feel a tightening on my skin like most toners. It leaves my skin soft and it smells wonderful!  I have just been spraying it on my face after washing and I like that it\u2019s easier, quicker and less waste when you don\u2019t need a cotton pad.\nQuick, easy to apply -wonderful smelling toner!\nSENGOLOGY Water Flosser Professional Countertop Flosser Dental Oral Irrigator -Rechargeable 12 Modes Water Flossing with Cleanable Water Tank for Home, Braces & Bridges Care\nSENSOLOGY\n{'Brand': 'SENSOLOGY', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Special Feature': 'Portable, Multiple Operation Modes', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Tank Volume': '700 Milliliters', 'Package Dimensions': '8.74 x 6.57 x 5.08 inches; 1.96 Pounds', 'UPC': '850004585177', 'Manufacturer': 'SENSOLOGY'}\nThis is a good water flosser . I\u2019m comparing it to others I have owned. The last one I had did not last long- this appears to be better made and it just looks nicer overall. The water well holds a fair amount of water however I would like it to hold a bit more. It has many levels of power for the water to spray out. The low is very weak and the high is pretty darn strong and could be painful if you aren\u2019t careful. There are plenty of adjustments in between so you will find one that suits your mouth just right. It also has a \u201cmassage \u201c button which basically cuts down the strength of the jet and makes it pulse to massage your gums. I find it a bit too soft of my gums , even on the highest level.  This product does a great job in cleaning between your teeth and below gum line. I hate to floss so this is a great option to keep my teeth clean and well cared for. If your house is Not new and only has one plug in your bathroom, you will appreciate the long cords- both the electrical and the water hose. One thing I like about this water flosser  is that it does NOT leak like my other one did. This keeps my counter neat. This is a good product to add to your daily dental hygiene regimen . It is easy and does a great job cleaning .<br />* If you found this review helpful please click the button below to let Amazon know. Thanks !\nBetter than flossing or brushing alone!\nJDO Eyelash Curler and 4D Silk Fiber Lash Mascara Value Set-Lash Curler with Refill Pads for No Pinching or Pulling, Mascara Natural Thickening- Long Lasting Waterproof & Smudge-Proof\nJDO\n{'Package Dimensions': '6 x 4 x 1 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nI was not impressed with this when I first received it. The package looked old and faded. However when I opened it and used the eyelash curler I was very impressed. The curler worked quickly and easily , it was comfortable and easy to use- my lashes curled well with one squeeze. It comes with two extra pads for the curler.  The mascara wand is small and is able to get every lash. I was told the mascara makes my lashes look very natural-  of clumpy. The mascara really lengthened my lashes.\nLong, curled lashes- very natural.\nFace Lift Tapes for Instant Face, Neck and Eye Lift Kit Tape\nC CRYSTAL LEMON\n{'Brand': 'C CRYSTAL LEMON', 'Unit Count': '40.00 Count', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '5.67 x 3.35 x 0.87 inches; 0.6 Ounces', 'UPC': '725330346603'}\nI tried these strips and they did not stick well, they popped off so I REALLY my face and put toner on and they still popped off. Not a big fan of this product.\nNot great\nPretty Frank Natural Deodorant - No Aluminum Deodorant for Women, Men, Teens, & Kids \u2013 Paraben Sulfate Free Solid Deodorant Featuring Shea Butter, Coconut Oil, Vitamin E & Baking Soda (Lavender)\nPRETTY FRANK\n{'Brand': 'PRETTY FRANK', 'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Scent': 'Lavender, Coconut', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '5.87 x 5.12 x 1.14 inches; 4.23 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'DSF-BS-LAV'}\nThis deodorant goes on smooth. It has a full lavender scent. It's deodorant qualities are good.  the product controls odors all day. I find it non irritating and happy it doesn't have aluminum in it.\nPleasant scent\n36 Pack 2oz Clear Plastic Empty Bottles Travel Containers with Flip Cap for Hand Sanitizer, Cosmetic, Shampoo, Lotion, Liquid Body Soap, Cream, Toner, BPA-free\nJIUZHU\n{'Package Dimensions': '12.09 x 10.28 x 3.07 inches; 13.12 Ounces', 'UPC': '667322945817'}\nThis set of fillable bottles is good quality.

Nice that it has a flip top for ease of use. This dries fairly quickly on your hands it\u2019s a nice gel consistency however I\u2019m not so  fond of the smell it\u2019s not bad it\u2019s just not a pretty smell. But men would probably be happy it doesn\u2019t have a feminine smell. It\u2019s hard to describe it kind of smells like a plant or something. Not bad just different . Does not leave my hands sticky - I actually like how my hands feel after using it .\nGreat for travel. Leaves hand feeling soft .\nNail Clipper Set, GIDIBII Luxury 18 in 1 Stainless Steel Nail Clipper Kit, Manicure Pedicure Care Tools with Portable Travel Case\nGIDIBII\n{'Brand': 'GIDIBII', 'Blade Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '5.8 x 3.8 x 0.8 inches', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '5.8 x 3.8 x 0.8 inches; 11.99 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'Manicure Set', 'UPC': '799445199218', 'Manufacturer': 'GIDIBII'}\nThis is a complete set for doing manicures or pedicures and even a couple for extra things like maybe for your face. All the tools are strong amd sturdy. The case unfortunately is not as strong. The straps that hold the implements in the case  are weak and thin and one broke right away. Overall a good set they definitely thought of everything to include in the kit.\nGreat selection of implements.\nFog-free Dental Mirror and 4 Pieces of Stainless Steel Dental Pick Professional Oral Care Kit for Family including Dogs Oral Care\nSunrise glow\n{'Package Dimensions': '8.15 x 2.4 x 1.3 inches; 4.23 Ounces'}\nHigh quality tools, just like your dentist uses.

It is lightweight and goes on easily. I don\u2019t feel it is incredibly moisturizing  . It also doesn\u2019t last very long . I had to keep reapplying it throughout the day. With all the long wearing lip colors out there now this wouldn\u2019t be high on my list of preferred lipstick. The shape is weird and uncomfortable to hold. It looks cool but practicality is more important to me .\nWeird shape lipstick\nWomen Ultra Smooth Razor Womens Razors for Shaving Comfortable handle 5-blade Razor + 2 Refill Blades for a Smooth and safety Shave Reusable Razors for Girls Women\nRONGCHUANG\n{'Package Dimensions': '8 x 5 x 1 inches; 7.41 Ounces', 'UPC': '607816401771'}\nI got this razor for my daughter but ended up keeping it because I liked it so much.
