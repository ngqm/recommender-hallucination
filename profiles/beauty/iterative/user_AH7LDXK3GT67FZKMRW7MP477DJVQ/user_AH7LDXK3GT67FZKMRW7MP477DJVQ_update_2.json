I\u2019m comparing it to others I have owned. The last one I had did not last long- this appears to be better made and it just looks nicer overall. The water well holds a fair amount of water however I would like it to hold a bit more. It has many levels of power for the water to spray out. The low is very weak and the high is pretty darn strong and could be painful if you aren\u2019t careful. There are plenty of adjustments in between so you will find one that suits your mouth just right. It also has a \u201cmassage \u201c button which basically cuts down the strength of the jet and makes it pulse to massage your gums. I find it a bit too soft of my gums , even on the highest level.  This product does a great job in cleaning between your teeth and below gum line. I hate to floss so this is a great option to keep my teeth clean and well cared for. If your house is Not new and only has one plug in your bathroom, you will appreciate the long cords- both the electrical and the water hose. One thing I like about this water flosser  is that it does NOT leak like my other one did. This keeps my counter neat. This is a good product to add to your daily dental hygiene regimen . It is easy and does a great job cleaning .<br />* If you found this review helpful please click the button below to let Amazon know.

I wish the instructions were in A bit more clear.  I do not know if you are supposed to spray it on your face and go or use a cotton pad. I do not feel a tightening on my skin like most toners. It leaves my skin soft and it smells wonderful!  I have just been spraying it on my face after washing and I like that it\u2019s easier, quicker and less waste when you don\u2019t need a cotton pad.\nQuick, easy to apply -wonderful smelling toner!\nSENGOLOGY Water Flosser Professional Countertop Flosser Dental Oral Irrigator -Rechargeable 12 Modes Water Flossing with Cleanable Water Tank for Home, Braces & Bridges Care\nSENSOLOGY\n{'Brand': 'SENSOLOGY', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Special Feature': 'Portable, Multiple Operation Modes', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Tank Volume': '700 Milliliters', 'Package Dimensions': '8.74 x 6.57 x 5.08 inches; 1.96 Pounds', 'UPC': '850004585177', 'Manufacturer': 'SENSOLOGY'}\nThis is a good water flosser .
