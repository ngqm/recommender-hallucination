(white& golden) Gift (white)\nReview Date: 2021/10/16\nStore: MELUN\nAverage Rating: 3.1\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'MELUN', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Included Components': 'Charger', 'Head Type': 'Foil', 'Number of Blades': '2', 'Package Dimensions': '8.6 x 7.5 x 3.1 inches; 1.45 Pounds', 'UPC': '653846877987'}\nReview Text: It arrived as described with two shielding glasses and a razor. The product itself is easy to use and the buttons on it are easy to figure out and operate. I got this product a few weeks ago so it's still too early to tell about its efficacy (which is why I gave it 4 stars but will update a few months from now when results can be actually measured). There are a few things I've already noticed however, on the sections where I've been using it the hair seems to be growing a bit thinner and taking also a bit longer to grow back. I'm comparing results by leaving a patch next to the area I'm treating alone and seeing how fast they both grow, the treated area seems to be lagging behind by a couple of days. We'll see what happens in a few months after which I will update.\nReview Title: Works well - have to be consistent.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Keratin treatments rebound the keratin in your hair so that they are all put back into place. There are a lot of steps but don\u2019t get discouraged because they\u2019re quiet simple. To start of give 2 good shampoos with a clarifying shampoo (specifically the keratin complex one, then towel dry and blow dry the unconditioned hair. Once fully dry, make small sections and apply the treatment from roots to ends and comb through with a fine tooth comb to make sure hair is fully saturated. Let that sit for 30 minutes then blow dry again without washing out the product. Once fully dry the final step will be to straighten the hair with a flatiron so the keratin will set in your hair. After you\u2019re completely done you won\u2019t be able to wash your hair for up to 3 days depending on the strength in the solution.\nSmooth long curls\nMagnetic Eyelashes With Eyeliner Kit,10 Pairs Eyelashes Magnetic 2021 Upgraded 3D Fluffy Natural Waterproof Reusable Fox Eyes Kit False Eyelashes And Eyeliner.\nAlyxxndra\n{'Color': 'Black', 'Brand': 'Alyxxndra', 'Material': 'Faux Mink', 'Material Feature': 'Disposable', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Package Dimensions': '9.21 x 6.1 x 0.71 inches; 2.89 Ounces', 'UPC': '788402874992', 'Manufacturer': 'Alyxxndra'}\nI like this pen I wish it worked a little better though.
