Keratin treatments rebound the keratin in your hair so that they are all put back into place. There are a lot of steps but don\u2019t get discouraged because they\u2019re quiet simple. To start of give 2 good shampoos with a clarifying shampoo (specifically the keratin complex one, then towel dry and blow dry the unconditioned hair. Once fully dry, make small sections and apply the treatment from roots to ends and comb through with a fine tooth comb to make sure hair is fully saturated. Let that sit for 30 minutes then blow dry again without washing out the product. Once fully dry the final step will be to straighten the hair with a flatiron so the keratin will set in your hair. After you\u2019re completely done you won\u2019t be able to wash your hair for up to 3 days depending on the strength in the solution.\nReview Title: Smooth long curls\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
