Keratin treatments rebound the keratin in your hair so that they are all put back into place. There are a lot of steps but don\u2019t get discouraged because they\u2019re quiet simple. To start of give 2 good shampoos with a clarifying shampoo (specifically the keratin complex one, then towel dry and blow dry the unconditioned hair. Once fully dry, make small sections and apply the treatment from roots to ends and comb through with a fine tooth comb to make sure hair is fully saturated. Let that sit for 30 minutes then blow dry again without washing out the product. Once fully dry the final step will be to straighten the hair with a flatiron so the keratin will set in your hair. After you\u2019re completely done you won\u2019t be able to wash your hair for up to 3 days depending on the strength in the solution.\nSmooth long curls\nMagnetic Eyelashes With Eyeliner Kit,10 Pairs Eyelashes Magnetic 2021 Upgraded 3D Fluffy Natural Waterproof Reusable Fox Eyes Kit False Eyelashes And Eyeliner.\nAlyxxndra\n{'Color': 'Black', 'Brand': 'Alyxxndra', 'Material': 'Faux Mink', 'Material Feature': 'Disposable', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Package Dimensions': '9.21 x 6.1 x 0.71 inches; 2.89 Ounces', 'UPC': '788402874992', 'Manufacturer': 'Alyxxndra'}\nI like this pen I wish it worked a little better though. I have the liquid one as well and I feel that that one holds the mascara a little more but it is stickier so I really wanted the pen to work especially for the wing. But overall, I love the liner and the lashes so much easier than trying to mess with glue. Thank you for your products they arRead more about the review stating Liner and lashes a total game-changer.\nLove it\nIPL Hair Removal | Laser Hair Removal For Women - Upgraded 999,999 Flashes with 2 Flash Windows, Permanent Hair Removal For Legs, Arms, Underarm, Face,Bikini Line,Chest. (white& golden) Gift (white)\nMELUN\n{'Brand': 'MELUN', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Included Components': 'Charger', 'Head Type': 'Foil', 'Number of Blades': '2', 'Package Dimensions': '8.6 x 7.5 x 3.1 inches; 1.45 Pounds', 'UPC': '653846877987'}\nIt arrived as described with two shielding glasses and a razor. The product itself is easy to use and the buttons on it are easy to figure out and operate. I got this product a few weeks ago so it's still too early to tell about its efficacy (which is why I gave it 4 stars but will update a few months from now when results can be actually measured). There are a few things I've already noticed however, on the sections where I've been using it the hair seems to be growing a bit thinner and taking also a bit longer to grow back. I'm comparing results by leaving a patch next to the area I'm treating alone and seeing how fast they both grow, the treated area seems to be lagging behind by a couple of days. We'll see what happens in a few months after which I will update.\nWorks well - have to be consistent.\nHair Removal for Women and Men - IPL Permanent Hair Remover Technology - 999,999 Flashes Automatic Hair Remover for Face, Arms, Legs, Bikini Area and Whole Body\nUNIWA\n{'Product Dimensions': '7.8 x 2.5 x 1.57 inches; 1.32 Pounds', 'Manufacturer': 'cwell'}\nI\u2019ve been using this for a little over three months. I use it maybe every two to three days on my face, underarms and bikini area. The hair on my bikini area grows in slower so I figured in a few more months it should be nonexistent. Underarm hair still grows in the same amount and texture. It might require longer use. I had stray hairs on my jawline that would cause ingrown hairs and then hyperpigmentation from the scar. The main ones are gone!! The thicker ones I should say. Definitely have noticed a difference on my face. It\u2019s worth a shot- it\u2019s cheaper than going to a salon and it\u2019s a quick process to treat the areas. Just don\u2019t use the razor that comes in the box. It\u2019s very rough and won\u2019t remove the hair.\nAfter 3 months of use can slightly see results\nShakira Perfumes - Dance for Women - Long Lasting - Femenine, Charming and Modern Perfume - Fruity Floral Notes - Ideal for Day Wear - 1.7 Fl Oz\nShakira\n{'Brand': 'Shakira', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Item Volume': '50 Milliliters', 'Scent': 'Dance', 'Special Feature': 'Long Lasting', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Language': 'English', 'Product Dimensions': '2.64 x 2.05 x 5.63 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'Item model number': '8411061823033'}\nI love the bottle and the scent lasts all day. It is a sweet smell, but not floral. It has a clean smell and is very Feminine. The price is good. I like the scent, but it's not the exact scent I desire.
