These are dual ended pencils so one end has a brow brush while the other end has the eyebrow product. The pencils have a beautiful gold casing that is slim and comfortable to grasp. I think the formula is a little dry so I had to apply some pressure for the desired color payout. The fine tip allows you to draw in precise brow hairs. The staying power is great and held up well throughout my 8+ hour work day. I wanted to test out the waterproof claim so I did shower without washing my face and the color didn't really budge if left untouched. It came off easily using a makeup wipe.\nReview Title: Requires some effort for application but stays on pretty well.....\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

These bottles are made of glass so they are much sturdier than the typical plastic bottles. The blue glass also looks more \"elegant\" on a countertop if you plan to display it.

Felt nice and moisturizing on my lips. Leaves you unable to talk for at least 20 min<br /><br />Feet mask - smells like eucalyptus\u2026 nice and cooling on my feet\u2026 there are tabs on the side to hold them in place.
