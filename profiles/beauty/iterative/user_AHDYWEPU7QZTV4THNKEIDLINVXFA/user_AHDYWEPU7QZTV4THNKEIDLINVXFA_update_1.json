These bottles are made of glass so they are much sturdier than the typical plastic bottles. The blue glass also looks more \"elegant\" on a countertop if you plan to display it. There are 2 spray settings (fine mist and stream). I didn't have any issues with leaking. It comes with 2 16 oz bottles, 4 labels, 2 caps, and a funnel (not pictured because I somehow misplaced it already).\nReview Title: Looks nice on the counter\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
