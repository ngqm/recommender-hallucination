I have heard about the benefits of Vitamin C skincare products and decided to jump onboard giving it a try. Vitamin C can stimulate and boost collagen which improves skin tone and texture. In fact, Vitamin C is a well known powerful anti-aging formulation which is proven to reduce appearance of wrinkles and fine lines while helping boost collagen, fade sun or age spots and improve skin firming, brightening, and tone for a smoother and more revitalized youthful complexion. Because of the sensitivity of my skin, I sought out a natural product without the added chemicals which could trigger a skin reaction. Based on the product description, this serum seemed perfect. I respect at all the ingredients easily accessible on the side of the bottle. I also like the professional design of bottle which I can control the perfect amount of serum with the dropper and the amber glass container also preserves the product from oxidation. The serum does feel a little sticky at first, but it quickly absorbs and sits well under my sunscreen and foundation. There is a fresh light scent to it and it disappears fairly quickly once applied.<br /><br />I have been using it every morning and I have already seen a difference in my skin. I really like the serum soaks right into the skin and it does not feel heavy when I put a moisturizer over the top. This serum has been great at keeping my face hydrated and making my moisturizer work better. I am surprised that I have not experienced any kind of allergic reaction while using this product for the first time due to the fact that I do have quite sensitive skin. By using this product, I have got a better skin texture, radiant and softer skin with improved elasticity. Several fine lines and sun spots on my face have even seemed a little less noticeable. This facial serum helps plump up the fine lines on my face and gives it a nice glow as well. It feels light on my skin and is non-irritating which leaves my skin soft and supple. I do not have perfect skin or even great skin for that matter, but I could tell my skin was feeling softer and looking more dewy. My skin does plump up and my makeup looks flawless which I love and it does not peel on me when applying moisturizer. I honestly feel this is a top quality serum and I am glad I have added this to my daily skin care routine.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a complimentary bottle for my honest and unbiased review.\nReview Title: Silky and smooth skin with a healthy glow\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Jericho Cosmetics - Eye Cream Gel for Dark Circles, Puffy Eyes and Under Eye Wrinkles - Contains Anti Aging Agents: Minerals from the Dead Sea, Olive Oil & plant extracts\nJericho\n{'Brand': 'Jericho', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Use for': 'Eyes', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.28 x 1.28 x 1.28 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'SG_B01BT0WULG_US'}\nThis is my first time trying a skincare product from Jericho Cosmetics. According to the product descriptions, this special blend of eye cream is formulated with minerals from the Dead Sea, Olive Oil, and plant extracts. This new improved eye cream not only smooths the delicate tissue around the eyes and protects the skin from dryness, it also helps maintain the skin's elasticity and youthful appearance. I was intrigued but skeptical of the claims. Regardless, I have decided to give it a try and I am glad that I did. The first thing that caught my eyes was this beautiful and elegant glass container carefully and securely packaged inside of a professionally designed box with a thoughtful scooper. From the way it presents itself, it tells me that this company is dedicated to their products and I feel assured I am making the right decision. Nevertheless, one dab is enough for both eyes, so I am very happy with the size of this 1.7 ounces jar because it will last for quite a while and it also makes this product valuable and affordable. It also has a light scent which goes away immediately after it dries. The smells is pleasant in my opinion.<br /><br />This eye cream is deliciously creamy and luxurious, but it absorbs completely and leaves no trace of oily or sticky residue. The skin under my eyes feels silky soft and my makeup goes on perfectly. It spreads on smoothly and immediately softens my skin. The effect is very different from my other regular eye creams. It has actually left me impressed after only one week. I have noticed my dark circles have gotten lighter, they have not disappeared entirely, yet they are much lighter and the skin around my eyes does not seem as tired as it was a few weeks ago. My skin under the eyes appears smoother and hydrated. I also feel like my whole eye area has tightened up a bit and I look much more awake now. The difference is subtle, but I am hoping it will improve the results with longer term of usage. My eyes are not as puffy and that is a much more noticeable difference. This cream comes in a gorgeous jar making it look much more expensive than what it actually is, yet it works much better than many other expensive brands I have purchased in the past. I am very pleased with the results and will highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good eye cream to help with puffiness and dark circles.<br /><br />Disclosure: I purchased this eye cream at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.\nMy under eye skin appears smoother and hydrated than ever\nHair Straightener Brush - Professional Electric Iron Comb - Simply Straight Hairstyling - Best Ceramic Straightening brush, Detangling Curls, Instant Magic Results, Free Bonus - Carenoble (Pink)\nCarenoble\n['An Innovative Brush that Upgrades Your Life!', 'WOMEN, we are BUSY, always in HURRY, its all up to us, around us, about us.

I straighten my hair just about every day and I have long, thick and naturally wavy hair. I am always on the hunt for easier and quicker way to do my hair. Ultimately, I am hoping to save some time off my busy morning routine because every minute counts. This brush heats up quickly and it is safer than flat irons simply because there is a lower chance of burning myself. However, I find this tool a little too heavy for me to handle and it is quite impossible for me not to touch those three buttons on the side of the device switching the temperature up and down while working on my hair. It leaves my hair fluffy and does not do a great job straightening the roots because there is only so close I can get to my head. I have to section my hair piece by piece just like I do with a flat iron and it does not get all the frizz out as well as a flat iron. It turns out that I spend more time than my regular straightener trying to get the job done. Sadly, this brush works fine but not as well as my flat iron and not like I have imagined.<br /><br />I admit that this device is not only well made and very sturdy, it is also of high quality and attention to details. I really want to love this product, but I don't think it lives up to the claim that it straightens my hair fully. I will say that it does straighten to certain degree and does a decent job of taming some frizz, but nowhere near in comparison to what I would get from a straightening iron. On top of that, it does not do a good job at straightening my bangs. In fact, it is too large to reach the roots. Every time I stroke my hair to straighten I hit the button and it turns it off. It will take some serious practices to get used to. Regardless, this is a good product for second day straight hair where I just need a touch up or if my hair is already partially straight. I think this straightener would be great for someone who does not have very thick hair like I do. My hair certainly looks less wavy and perhaps slightly less frizzy, but this tool does not straighten hair for the silky effect that I hope it will achieve. Since everyone has different texture of hair, I strongly believe this will work great for those who have thinner, tamer hair or simply using this brush as a touch-up tool.<br /><br />Please see the attached before (left) and after (right) photos<br /><br />Disclosure: I purchased this hair straightener brush at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.\nNot suitable for thick and wavy hair\nSkederm Vitamin C X30 Power Serum. Hyaluronic Acid with Aquaxyl. 1 fl. oz.\n{'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Unit Count': '1.0 Fl Oz', 'Package Dimensions': '4 x 2 x 2 inches; 0.8 Ounces'}\nI am not a stranger to Vitamin C skincare products, but this power serum by Skederm is very different from all the Vitamin C serums that I have tried before. I always have ongoing problems of uneven skin tone and under eye dark circles. This special blend of serum is formulated to target signs of aging including dark spots, skin dehydration and dull skin tones. Unfortunately, it is exactly what I need at this point of my life. It may not be fast and effective against deep wrinkles though, but nothing really is other than cosmetic surgeries. The serum is quickly absorbed into the skin and does not feel greasy or gel-like silicone texture that a lot of serums have. It does have a pleasant light scent which quickly dissipates after applied and the consistency of the serum is somewhat creamy. It spreads very easily and one pump is enough to cover my face so the bottle should last quite awhile. When I apply this serum after cleansing and toning, I immediately feel as if my skin has been infused with moisture. It soaks right in and makes my skin feel more hydrated. It feels smooth and luxurious when I spread it over my face and neck. I have not experienced any irritation or negative reaction to this serum. Nevertheless, it is gentle enough to apply even under my eyes without any burning or itching sensation which has happened with a lot of beauty products I tried over the years.<br /><br />I really adore the elegant packaging, it comes in a beautiful airtight pump style bottle which protects the ingredients and keeps them fresh. It's sanitary and dispenses just the right amount for each application. I instantly love the way it makes my face feel soft and supple on first use and the results over the past week alone have continued to smooth my skin significantly. My face looks and feels more smooth, firm, and has this radiant glow that makes me look so much energetic. It has also helped balance my overall complexion. Even though I have exclusively been using this serum for about a week. I do not expect it to work miracles, but if it can hold moisture to the surface of my skin to give it the appearance of being smoother, then it is doing exactly what I need it to do. I do notice after using it that my skin feels tighter. I have not noticed any change in my fine lines yet, but the texture of my skin is starting to look better already. I am pleased with what I have seen so far and I am fully aware that I should give it at least a month to see results just like with any skincare product on the market. I will continue using this serum to document what my results are over time.<br /><br />Disclosure: I purchased this serum at a discount for my honest opinion.\nSmoother and firmer appearance\nIRIS Nature+Science 20% Vitamin C Anti Aging Serum for Skin\nIRIS\n{'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'IRIS: Nature+Science', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Provides Vitamins', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Fl Oz', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.8 x 1.8 x 1.7 inches; 5.6 Ounces', 'UPC': '758576257044'}\nI have recently recognized the importance of taking care of my skin, especially my face since I am not getting any younger.
