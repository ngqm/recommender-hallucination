According to the product descriptions, this special blend of eye cream is formulated with minerals from the Dead Sea, Olive Oil, and plant extracts. This new improved eye cream not only smooths the delicate tissue around the eyes and protects the skin from dryness, it also helps maintain the skin's elasticity and youthful appearance. I was intrigued but skeptical of the claims. Regardless, I have decided to give it a try and I am glad that I did. The first thing that caught my eyes was this beautiful and elegant glass container carefully and securely packaged inside of a professionally designed box with a thoughtful scooper. From the way it presents itself, it tells me that this company is dedicated to their products and I feel assured I am making the right decision. Nevertheless, one dab is enough for both eyes, so I am very happy with the size of this 1.7 ounces jar because it will last for quite a while and it also makes this product valuable and affordable. It also has a light scent which goes away immediately after it dries. The smells is pleasant in my opinion.<br /><br />This eye cream is deliciously creamy and luxurious, but it absorbs completely and leaves no trace of oily or sticky residue. The skin under my eyes feels silky soft and my makeup goes on perfectly. It spreads on smoothly and immediately softens my skin. The effect is very different from my other regular eye creams. It has actually left me impressed after only one week. I have noticed my dark circles have gotten lighter, they have not disappeared entirely, yet they are much lighter and the skin around my eyes does not seem as tired as it was a few weeks ago. My skin under the eyes appears smoother and hydrated. I also feel like my whole eye area has tightened up a bit and I look much more awake now. The difference is subtle, but I am hoping it will improve the results with longer term of usage. My eyes are not as puffy and that is a much more noticeable difference. This cream comes in a gorgeous jar making it look much more expensive than what it actually is, yet it works much better than many other expensive brands I have purchased in the past. I am very pleased with the results and will highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good eye cream to help with puffiness and dark circles.<br /><br />Disclosure: I purchased this eye cream at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.\nReview Title: My under eye skin appears smoother and hydrated than ever\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
