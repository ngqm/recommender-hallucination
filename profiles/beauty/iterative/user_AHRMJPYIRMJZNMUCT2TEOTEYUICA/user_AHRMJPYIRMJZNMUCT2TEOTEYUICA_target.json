I was very excited to get this one. Not only does it help with color-treated hair, but it is in a travel size. The scent is amazing, and it leaves my hair feeling nice and soft.\nReview Title: Coco\u2019s Conclusion: Moroccan Oil Conditioner for my Carry-On\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "AISI BEAUTY Long Blonde Wig with Bangs Straight Blonde Wigs for Women 24 Inch Synthetic Heat Resistant Cosplay Wigs for Girls Costume Party Wear\nAISI BEAUTY\n{'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Special Feature': 'Heat Resistant', 'Brand': 'AISI BEAUTY', 'Package Dimensions': '10.59 x 9.29 x 3.27 inches; 12.31 Ounces'}\nThis is a high-quality wig. My daughter does princess parties, and she can use this for multiple characters. The inside has pins and straps to help it fits better. It also comes with a free set of lashes. The only complaint is that the bangs are long but easy to trim. You could not find a better quality wig for the price.\nCoco's Conclusion: High Quality Wig, Includes a Set of Lashes\nFoxgirl Gel Nail Polish Set - 6 Colors Classic Klenin Blue Collection Gel nail polish kit Soak Off LED Nail Art Manicure Kit DIY at Home Gifts for Women\nFoxgirl\n{'Brand': 'Foxgirl', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Color': 'Blue,Burgundy,Red', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Liquid Volume': '0.27 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '6.81 x 6.38 x 1.38 inches; 6.88 Ounces', 'UPC': '768076972538'}\nI ordered the blue kit but received a red/pink kit instead. It ended up working well since it's almost Valentine's Day. There was some spillage inside the kit, making it sticky, but every polish is inside a foam cushion, so I don't think it had to do with poor packaging. It goes on fairly smoothly and lasts quite a while. It just wasn't quite as great as expected.\nCoco's Conclusion: Bright Colors, Leaky Bottles\nLeotruny Headbands for Women Twist Knotted Elastic Head Wrap Turban for Girls Yoga Workout Hair Accessories (C02-Headbands 6)\nLeotruny\n{'Color': 'Assorted Colors', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material': 'Elastic', 'Fabric Type': 'Ribbed', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '10.83 x 5.43 x 2.24 inches; 6.38 Ounces'}\nI\u2019ve been using these for my workouts because they stay in place really well. they are too cute to not wear for every day things. The colors are great and modern. They wash easily in the washing machine.\nCoco\u2019s Conclusion: Cute for Workouts or Everyday Wear\nUnaone 2 Pcs Retainer Case, Perfect Retainer Box Retainer Container Partial Mouth Guard Case Denture Box Orthodontic Denture Storage Boxes for Travel and Household, Blue\nUnaone\n{'Product Dimensions': '3 x 2 x 1 inches; 2.08 Ounces'}\nThese cases are just a little too small for my night guard, and there are no air vents. I am using this for my guard when my other cases are being washed. It suits that purpose just fine. For the price, you do get two cases, soI have backup cases as well.\nCoco\u2019s Conclusion: Small but Usable\nCell Fusion C Low pH pHarrier Mask*10sheets | Intensive weak acid care for all skin types, Korean Face Mask\nCell Fusion C\n{'Item Weight': '200 Grams', 'Unit Count': '10.00 Count', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '2.36 x 2.36 x 3.94 inches', 'Brand': 'Cell Fusion C', 'Item Volume': '250 Milliliters', 'Product Dimensions': '2.36 x 2.36 x 3.94 inches; 7.05 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'RLE22305'}\nThis mask is very soothing. It smells wonderful and leaves my face feeling moisturized and smooth.\nCoco\u2019s Conclusion: Moisturizing & Cooling\nEveryday Beauty Strawberry Exfoliator, Nourishing, Hydrating, and Rich Antioxidant Exfoliating Scrub with Ginseng, Strawberry Seeds, and Black Currant for Dry Dehydrated, and Aging Skin, 1.7 oz. Jar\nEveryday Beauty\n{'Brand': 'Everyday Beauty', 'Material Feature': 'Gluten Free, Cruelty Free', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Information': 'Jar', 'Item Weight': '1.7 Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '3.03 x 2.99 x 2.13 inches; 1.7 Ounces', 'UPC': '700463002374', 'Manufacturer': 'Cosmetic Solutions, LLC'}\n[[VIDEOID:d207b869a6c6780ce894c1c32f8179ae]] This creamy strawberry seed exfoliant is very lotion-like, which left my skin feeling super soft after. It has a great strawberry scent that is mild and not overwhelming.\nCoco\u2019s Conclusions: Creamy, Like Lotion with a Nice \ud83c\udf53 Scent, Great Exfoliant\nHair Removal Device\nUlike\n{'Package Dimensions': '11.1 x 8.46 x 3.82 inches; 3.31 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'UI04', 'UPC': '768461548188'}\n[[VIDEOID:b35db5602af2156947967b6b6850e6d3]] I have used a few different IPL machines over the years. This one is the first painless one I have had.<br />Everything is packaged well and comes in a nice case. The machine itself is very easy to use. Once you turn it on, it automatically turns on a cooling mechanism that makes it more pleasant on the skin and less likely to overheat, I would imagine. I would recommend that you read the directions or watch a video on how to operate it. It has different settings that you can change by clicking the right button. There is also a long or short area function on this which is very nice, making it so you can drag the device down a longer area, like a leg, while pressing the button.<br />The directions say to use the device want to eat for 12 weeks and after that, as needed. I will update the review if sufficient hair removal has not happened at this point in time, but I\u2019m already noticing that I have to shave less.\nCoco\u2019s Conclusion: Truly Painless, High Quality\nLa Maxime chemical free, natural, organic vegan best brightening hydrating facial exfoliating scrub & mask (2 in 1) pack for wrinkle repair & glowing skin for women men (2.47 ounce)\nLA MAXIME\n{'Brand': 'LA MAXIME', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Skin Care,Exfoliating', 'Scent': 'Hydrating', 'Material Type Free': 'Chemical Free', 'Unit Count': '2.47 Ounce', 'Product Dimensions': '3.35 x 3.35 x 1.97 inches; 6.7 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'DG70', 'UPC': '611138337403'}\nThis product comes in a paste. It has dual qualities as it is an exfoliating scrub and facemask. You can use it for any skin, whether that be oily, combo or normal. It has natural active ingredients, which is my favorite part. It goes on like a paste and has a great scent. I felt like my skin was very hydrated and glowed after use. There are only about 2 1/2 ounces of product in the container, which makes this fairly pricey, but sometimes that is the case with skincare products that work.\nCoco\u2019s Conclusion: Natural Ingredients, Vegan, No Animal Testing\nMoroccanoil Color Care Conditioner\n{'Brand': 'Moroccanoil', 'Hair Type': 'Color Treated', 'Product Benefits': 'Shine', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Conditioner,Lock', 'Unit Count': '8.5 Fl Oz', 'Language': 'English', 'Product Dimensions': '2 x 2 x 6.5 inches; 9.63 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Moroccanoil'}\n[[VIDEOID:70c7a3a26a8fd9cb6fae4f5d12f45fa5]] I love Moroccan Oil products.
