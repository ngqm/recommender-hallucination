My daughter does princess parties, and she can use this for multiple characters. The inside has pins and straps to help it fits better. It also comes with a free set of lashes. The only complaint is that the bangs are long but easy to trim. You could not find a better quality wig for the price.\nCoco's Conclusion: High Quality Wig, Includes a Set of Lashes\nFoxgirl Gel Nail Polish Set - 6 Colors Classic Klenin Blue Collection Gel nail polish kit Soak Off LED Nail Art Manicure Kit DIY at Home Gifts for Women\nFoxgirl\n{'Brand': 'Foxgirl', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Color': 'Blue,Burgundy,Red', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Liquid Volume': '0.27 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '6.81 x 6.38 x 1.38 inches; 6.88 Ounces', 'UPC': '768076972538'}\nI ordered the blue kit but received a red/pink kit instead. It ended up working well since it's almost Valentine's Day. There was some spillage inside the kit, making it sticky, but every polish is inside a foam cushion, so I don't think it had to do with poor packaging. It goes on fairly smoothly and lasts quite a while. It just wasn't quite as great as expected.\nCoco's Conclusion: Bright Colors, Leaky Bottles\nLeotruny Headbands for Women Twist Knotted Elastic Head Wrap Turban for Girls Yoga Workout Hair Accessories (C02-Headbands 6)\nLeotruny\n{'Color': 'Assorted Colors', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material': 'Elastic', 'Fabric Type': 'Ribbed', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '10.83 x 5.43 x 2.24 inches; 6.38 Ounces'}\nI\u2019ve been using these for my workouts because they stay in place really well. they are too cute to not wear for every day things.
