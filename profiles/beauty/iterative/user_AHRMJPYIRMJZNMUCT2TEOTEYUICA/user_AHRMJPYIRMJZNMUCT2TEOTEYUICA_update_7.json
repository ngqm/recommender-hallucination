This one is the first painless one I have had.<br />Everything is packaged well and comes in a nice case. The machine itself is very easy to use. Once you turn it on, it automatically turns on a cooling mechanism that makes it more pleasant on the skin and less likely to overheat, I would imagine. I would recommend that you read the directions or watch a video on how to operate it. It has different settings that you can change by clicking the right button. There is also a long or short area function on this which is very nice, making it so you can drag the device down a longer area, like a leg, while pressing the button.<br />The directions say to use the device want to eat for 12 weeks and after that, as needed. I will update the review if sufficient hair removal has not happened at this point in time, but I\u2019m already noticing that I have to shave less.\nReview Title: Coco\u2019s Conclusion: Truly Painless, High Quality\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "AISI BEAUTY Long Blonde Wig with Bangs Straight Blonde Wigs for Women 24 Inch Synthetic Heat Resistant Cosplay Wigs for Girls Costume Party Wear\nAISI BEAUTY\n{'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Special Feature': 'Heat Resistant', 'Brand': 'AISI BEAUTY', 'Package Dimensions': '10.59 x 9.29 x 3.27 inches; 12.31 Ounces'}\nThis is a high-quality wig. My daughter does princess parties, and she can use this for multiple characters. The inside has pins and straps to help it fits better. It also comes with a free set of lashes. The only complaint is that the bangs are long but easy to trim. You could not find a better quality wig for the price.\nCoco's Conclusion: High Quality Wig, Includes a Set of Lashes\nFoxgirl Gel Nail Polish Set - 6 Colors Classic Klenin Blue Collection Gel nail polish kit Soak Off LED Nail Art Manicure Kit DIY at Home Gifts for Women\nFoxgirl\n{'Brand': 'Foxgirl', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Color': 'Blue,Burgundy,Red', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Liquid Volume': '0.27 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '6.81 x 6.38 x 1.38 inches; 6.88 Ounces', 'UPC': '768076972538'}\nI ordered the blue kit but received a red/pink kit instead. It ended up working well since it's almost Valentine's Day. There was some spillage inside the kit, making it sticky, but every polish is inside a foam cushion, so I don't think it had to do with poor packaging. It goes on fairly smoothly and lasts quite a while. It just wasn't quite as great as expected.\nCoco's Conclusion: Bright Colors, Leaky Bottles\nLeotruny Headbands for Women Twist Knotted Elastic Head Wrap Turban for Girls Yoga Workout Hair Accessories (C02-Headbands 6)\nLeotruny\n{'Color': 'Assorted Colors', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material': 'Elastic', 'Fabric Type': 'Ribbed', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '10.83 x 5.43 x 2.24 inches; 6.38 Ounces'}\nI\u2019ve been using these for my workouts because they stay in place really well. they are too cute to not wear for every day things. The colors are great and modern. They wash easily in the washing machine.\nCoco\u2019s Conclusion: Cute for Workouts or Everyday Wear\nUnaone 2 Pcs Retainer Case, Perfect Retainer Box Retainer Container Partial Mouth Guard Case Denture Box Orthodontic Denture Storage Boxes for Travel and Household, Blue\nUnaone\n{'Product Dimensions': '3 x 2 x 1 inches; 2.08 Ounces'}\nThese cases are just a little too small for my night guard, and there are no air vents. I am using this for my guard when my other cases are being washed. It suits that purpose just fine. For the price, you do get two cases, soI have backup cases as well.\nCoco\u2019s Conclusion: Small but Usable\nCell Fusion C Low pH pHarrier Mask*10sheets | Intensive weak acid care for all skin types, Korean Face Mask\nCell Fusion C\n{'Item Weight': '200 Grams', 'Unit Count': '10.00 Count', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '2.36 x 2.36 x 3.94 inches', 'Brand': 'Cell Fusion C', 'Item Volume': '250 Milliliters', 'Product Dimensions': '2.36 x 2.36 x 3.94 inches; 7.05 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'RLE22305'}\nThis mask is very soothing.
