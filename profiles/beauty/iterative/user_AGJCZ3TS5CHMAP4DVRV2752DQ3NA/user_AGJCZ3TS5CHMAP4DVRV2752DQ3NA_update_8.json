It looks great and seems to be well made with no stitching or material build mistakes. The only problem with this headband is that it is HIGH and thick. So, when you wear it, it looks kinda funny or off on top of your head. It reminds me of the puffy towel headbands my wife uses when washing her face. This is definitely one of those accessories that looks great until you try it on.\nReview Title: More beautiful OFF your head than ON\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

This is much lighter, smaller, and faster. I have not used this long enough to determine if it will completely stop hair growth, but it has so far slowed down hair regeneration by 3x - which accurately reflects their predicted timeline for hair regrowth.\nLooks a little different than listing image but still works the same\n[Upgrade] FUGACAL Hair Straightener Brush, 30s Fast Heating, 3 Temp Settings, Anti-Scald Design and 30mins Auto-Off, Bring You Ultra Straight Hair with Natural Shiny Look in Minutes\nFugacal\n{'Brand': 'Fugacal', 'Material': 'Ceramic', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Hair Type': 'Thick', 'Product Dimensions': '12.2 x 1.8 x 1.7 inches; 1.79 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'FG-HS01', 'Manufacturer': 'Fugacal'}\nMy wife has long, medium thick hair and this worked awesome for her. Left her hair super soft and straight.\nWorks great, looks great\nArisson Men hs Razors Set \u2013 ludes 1 Ergonomic Design Razor Handle, 4 Blade Refills, Travel Blade Cover, Shave Gel (Black) 60 Count (Pack of 3)\nArisson\n{'Brand': 'Arisson', 'Number of Blades': '5', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Handle Material': 'Rubber'}\nThis razor has a refreshing redesign to the traditional razor handle. However, the futuristic look does have some drawbacks. For example, the wider handle might make it more ergonomic, but it now no longer fits in any of my shower razor holders (caddy or wall mounted) since it won't fit in between the two prongs. I like that it comes with a protective blade case that has vent cut outs to allow aeration to the blades. When it comes to shaving, the blades are sub par and don't cut everything in the first pass. Hopefully they can address this and change the blades to something more efficacious.\nLooks cool, but lacking in a few areas\nL\u2019ANGE HAIR Wide Tooth Comb Tortoiseshell Acetate | Lightweight, Smooth, Compact Design | Easy Glide Wide Tooth Comb\nL'ANGE HAIR\n{'Product Dimensions': '0.25 x 7 x 3.13 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'Item model number': '2427', 'UPC': '810108190974'}\nTortoise shell design looks awesome. Wife loves this detangling comb, especially after her hair gets a little tangled after swimming in the pool.\nQuality made comb\nBAR;SOO - Natural boar bristle paddle cushion hair brush for Thick Curly Thin Long Short hair, Detangle all types of hair, Hair loss prevention, Naturally glossy Hair (Purple/violet)\nBAR;SOO\n{'Brand': 'BAR;SOO', 'Color': 'Purple,Violet', 'Shape': 'Oblong', 'Handle Material': 'Nylon', 'Special Feature': 'Detangling', 'Package Dimensions': '10.83 x 5.59 x 2.01 inches; 6.38 Ounces', 'Country of Origin': 'Korea, Republic of'}\nThis brush is great for detangling hair. The two bristles system seems to make a difference. I also love the weight and feel of the brush.\nGreat detangled\nMEIQIER Eye Massager with Natural Quartz Jade, Facial Massage Tool with Heat & Vibration for Eliminate Eye Bags, Dark Circle Remover Eye Lip Fine Lines, Promote Essence Absorption\nMEIQIER\n{'Brand': 'MEIQIER', 'Scent': 'Rose', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Material Feature': 'Natural'}\nThis has a fun design, masquerading as lipstick. However, it when it comes to efficacy, it falls short for me. The vibration and heat are weak compared to other facial devices. It is mostly made of lightweight plastic, so I'm not sure the quality is there or the lifespan.\nMore novelty than productive\nHair Removal Device\nUlike\n{'Package Dimensions': '11.1 x 8.46 x 3.82 inches; 3.31 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'UI04', 'UPC': '768461548188'}\nOne significant issue that this listing did not address is compatibility. IPL's are not effective for all skin and hair color types. Please research online as there are several infographics on how effective laser therapy is on each color type. This is the main reason why some reviews rave about the results and some are so disappointed.<br />That being said...<br />This is the most compact IPL device that I've tried, but it packs all the new features you are looking for. I personally have not reached the intensity where I need the cooling function, but it's nice knowing it's there when I reach that point. I do like the compact size, but wish there was more grip to the exterior. Everything is smooth and I came close to dropping the thing the first time I used it. So be careful handling it. One of the newer trends on these devices is to have the invisible screen, instead of a visible LCD screen. When you turn it on, the data lights are under the gold rectangle and illuminate to show the functions etc.<br />I personally have had great success with IPL devices, since I fit the designated hair and skin color. Hair hardly, if at all, grows back in the targeted areas... but it does take some time to see results. You will notice reduced grow back rates after 2 weeks, then more significant results after 4-6 months.\nCOMPATIBILITY (must read)\nSUNTU HAIR Headbands for Women White Bling Faux Pearl\nSUNTU\n{'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Brand': 'SUNTU', 'Size': 'One Size', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '10.83 x 6.34 x 1.38 inches; 2.08 Ounces', 'UPC': '787365980412'}\nThis is a really nice looking headband that we got for our toddler.
