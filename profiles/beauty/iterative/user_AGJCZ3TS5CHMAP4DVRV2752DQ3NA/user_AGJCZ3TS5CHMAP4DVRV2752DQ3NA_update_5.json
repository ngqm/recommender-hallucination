This is much lighter, smaller, and faster. I have not used this long enough to determine if it will completely stop hair growth, but it has so far slowed down hair regeneration by 3x - which accurately reflects their predicted timeline for hair regrowth.\nLooks a little different than listing image but still works the same\n[Upgrade] FUGACAL Hair Straightener Brush, 30s Fast Heating, 3 Temp Settings, Anti-Scald Design and 30mins Auto-Off, Bring You Ultra Straight Hair with Natural Shiny Look in Minutes\nFugacal\n{'Brand': 'Fugacal', 'Material': 'Ceramic', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Hair Type': 'Thick', 'Product Dimensions': '12.2 x 1.8 x 1.7 inches; 1.79 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'FG-HS01', 'Manufacturer': 'Fugacal'}\nMy wife has long, medium thick hair and this worked awesome for her. Left her hair super soft and straight.\nWorks great, looks great\nArisson Men hs Razors Set \u2013 ludes 1 Ergonomic Design Razor Handle, 4 Blade Refills, Travel Blade Cover, Shave Gel (Black) 60 Count (Pack of 3)\nArisson\n{'Brand': 'Arisson', 'Number of Blades': '5', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Handle Material': 'Rubber'}\nThis razor has a refreshing redesign to the traditional razor handle. However, the futuristic look does have some drawbacks. For example, the wider handle might make it more ergonomic, but it now no longer fits in any of my shower razor holders (caddy or wall mounted) since it won't fit in between the two prongs. I like that it comes with a protective blade case that has vent cut outs to allow aeration to the blades. When it comes to shaving, the blades are sub par and don't cut everything in the first pass. Hopefully they can address this and change the blades to something more efficacious.\nLooks cool, but lacking in a few areas\nL\u2019ANGE HAIR Wide Tooth Comb Tortoiseshell Acetate | Lightweight, Smooth, Compact Design | Easy Glide Wide Tooth Comb\nL'ANGE HAIR\n{'Product Dimensions': '0.25 x 7 x 3.13 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'Item model number': '2427', 'UPC': '810108190974'}\nTortoise shell design looks awesome.
