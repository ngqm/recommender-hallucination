However, the futuristic look does have some drawbacks. For example, the wider handle might make it more ergonomic, but it now no longer fits in any of my shower razor holders (caddy or wall mounted) since it won't fit in between the two prongs. I like that it comes with a protective blade case that has vent cut outs to allow aeration to the blades. When it comes to shaving, the blades are sub par and don't cut everything in the first pass. Hopefully they can address this and change the blades to something more efficacious.\nReview Title: Looks cool, but lacking in a few areas\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

This is much lighter, smaller, and faster.
