A nice pleasant fresh smell of cucumbers that doesn't linger on the skin for hours.<br /><br />Very convenient to use, whether at home or in the car on very hot days.<br /><br />if you break down the price, it will cost you about $1 a wipe. That can be pricey for a typical wipe, but it is invaluable for a piece of mind when it comes to assisting an elderly relative.<br /><br />Highly recommend these wipes!\nGreat for seniors\nOSRSR Cryo Sticks,Unbreakable Stainless Steel Beauty Ice Facial Massage Tools for Woman,Skin Case Ice Globes Cryo Spoons,Cooling Globes Cold Globes for Face,Eyes & Neck\nOSRSR\n{'Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Brand': 'OSRSR', 'Water Resistance Level': 'Not Water Resistant', 'Package Dimensions': '7.91 x 5.63 x 2.24 inches; 11.68 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'OSRSR021', 'UPC': '726324604273', 'Manufacturer': 'OSRSR'}\nWho woulda thought that something ice-cold and under six inches would put a smile on your face?<br />Just put these tools in the freezer for AT LEAST two hours before you are planning on using them and you will be very happy with the results.<br />They do not stick to your skin and they do not give you the 'shock' of someone putting a cold can of soda on the back of your neck.<br />The worst part about these massage tools is that the silicon tips (handles) should be longer so that not only can you hold them easier but also so that your hands don't freeze while using the massager.<br />A convenient carry case/freezer case is included.<br />Highly recommend!\nSurprisingly good!\nBAWYU | All is Made of Bamboo Sustainable Gifts | Toothbrush, Body Brush, Bamboo Fiber Towel, Comb, Storage bag | Guest Room Essentials Bathroom, Home Preparation Products | Shower Wash Kit \uff086 Pack\uff09\nBAWYU\n{'Package Dimensions': '8.03 x 5.24 x 2.2 inches; 10.05 Ounces', 'UPC': '723890958878'}\nEverything is very lightweight, which is nice, but the toothbrushes are so light that they tip over VERY easily. Also, unlike other typical toothbrushes, there is no flexibility to them. After repeated use (and rinsing), the handle just doesn't feel as clean and comfortable to me.<br /><br />No tray was included (as the product picture shows), but that's fine. I wouldn't be keeping my toothbrush with an exfoliating pad anyway. Would have enjoyed the exfoliating brush more if the handle loop had just a little more space to allow me to fit my hand through it to hold the brush properly.<br /><br />The comb has very wide teeth, which is good for long, thick hair just after washing. But if you don't have long, thick hair... it's pretty much useless. Would've been nice if the handle of the comb had a notch or a groove to allow for a better grip.<br /><br />If you're thinking of buying this as a gift for someone... don't. Unless it's for a child/teen. There are too many other better sets out there.\nIt's ok...\nPet Supplies Self Cleaning Slicker Brush, Dog Brush for Shedding [Upgraded Pain-free Bristles] Cat Deshedding Brush, Reduces Shedding and Tangling for Hair, with Stainless Steel Pet Comb (Purple)\nFIOVIEL\n{'Brand': 'FIOVIEL', 'Special Feature': 'Self Cleaning', 'Unit Count': '100000.00 Count', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Material': 'Wool', 'Product Dimensions': '7 x 5 x 2.8 inches; 9.91 Ounces', 'UPC': '705116975999'}\nIncredibly easy to use and to clean.<br />Brush your dog or cat as you normally would, and after a couple of strokes, take a look at the bristles. You'll be amazed at how much hair this brush has accumulated (we have medium to short hair cats).<br /><br />I would not recommend this brush for pets that have long hair, unless you're looking to groom just the top layer of fur. otherwise, you can not reach through all of the fur to get to the base to fully smooth and groom your pet.<br /><br />Instead of using your hands to try to grasp all of the hair to clean the brush, you simply press the button on the back, which pushes the brush pad forward and gives you a 'pillow' of pet hair that is EASILY removeable!<br /><br />Highly recommend this pet brush!\nWide head\nAuban Sleep Hair Wrap Bonnet Eye Cover Black Satin Cap Large for Sleeping Silk Cap Double Layer for Long Hair Curl Women Sleeping Protection Hair Beanie Block Light\nAuban\n{'Package Dimensions': '9.49 x 8.74 x 0.67 inches; 2.36 Ounces', 'Department': 'Womens', 'UPC': '700306967723'}\nIt's nice that this bonnet is larger than most others to accommodate longer hair, but there is not elastic in the head band, so it can fit pretty loose on your head.<br /><br />If you have short to medium hair, this will more than likely not work for you because it will easily slide off while you are sleeping... or slide down and cover your eyes while you're sitting up, reading your phone.<br /><br />The material is nice and smooth, but that's about it.\nOne size does not fit all",
