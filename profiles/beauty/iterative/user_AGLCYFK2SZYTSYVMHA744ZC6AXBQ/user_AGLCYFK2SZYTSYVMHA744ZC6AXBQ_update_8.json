  "reference_summary": "LaClaire Acne Wash with Salicylic Acid & Tea Tree Oil - Face Cleanser for Acne-Prone Skin (50 ml/1.65 oz)\nLaClaire\n{'Item Form': 'Oil, Foam', 'Skin Type': 'Oily, Combination, Dry, Normal', 'Brand': 'LaClaire', 'Scent': 'Tea Tree', 'Material Feature': 'Antibacterial', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '5.5 x 2.75 x 1.63 inches; 9.14 Ounces', 'UPC': '891040000705', 'Manufacturer': 'LaClaire'}\nThis has terrific ingredients but personally I found it harsh and irritating; not the best option for older adults prone to the sporadic flair-up of acne. Fragrance, consistency and overall ingredient list are fine but the irritation lingers long after use.\nNot the best for mature acne prone skin\nLaClaire Skin Revitalization Clarifying Formula - Exfoliating Face Wash - Anti Wrinkle Face Wash \u2013 1.9 % Salicylic Acid Exfoliating Cleanser - Smooth, Young & Radiant Skin \u2013 For Daily Use - 50mL / 1.7 oz, Made in the USA\nLaClaire\n['Formulated for blemish control in acne-prone skin, this extra strength foaming cleanser combines the natural antibacterial, tea tree oil, with the synergistic exfoliating power of two Alpha Hydroxy Acids, Glycolic Acid and Lactic Acid, as well as Beta Hydroxy Acid, Salicylic Acid, to decrease clogged pores, clear up stubborn body acne and problematic facial acne.']\n{'Item Form': 'Foam', 'Skin Type': 'Oily, Combination, Dry, Normal', 'Brand': 'LaClaire', 'Scent': 'Tea Tree', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '5.5 x 2.75 x 1.63 inches; 10.41 Ounces', 'UPC': '891040000712', 'Manufacturer': 'LaClaire'}\nTypically I like this brand and I like the ingredient list in the product line up but the overall quality isn't quite effective enough. Not sure if it's due to age or strength but better used as a wash versus full treatment.\nNice ingredients but not strong enough\nBololo Baby Hair Clippers - Quiet Kids Hair Trimmer, Cordless & Waterproof Chargeable, Children with Autism, ABS Ceramic Blade, Haircut Kit for Kids Infants Men and Women,Green,\nMOM&HOME\n{'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Trimming', 'Color': 'White', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'MOM&HOME', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.38 x 3.66 x 2.32 inches; 8.47 Ounces', 'Batteries': '1 Lithium Ion batteries required. (included)', 'UPC': '691608094128', 'Manufacturer': 'Mom&Home'}\nVery gentle - which is good - but the usb charger is plain annoying. I'm unlikely to continue using this due to the charger. Very quiet, very gentle and very annoying to recharge. Also, despite the fact this is to be used on children, the person doing the trim is probably an adult so why make this so small? It's hard to handle.\nGentle but don't like the charger\nNatural Jade Roller Massager & Rose Quartz Facial Roller 2pcs Gift Set\nTGS Gems\n{}\nThis is a pretty little set - soothing, cool and all natural stone. Makes a great gift idea when combined with essential oils or just save for self when you want a little pampering.\nPretty\n2 in 1 Hair Straightener and Curler Travel Curling Flat Iron Wand Crimper, Dual Voltage 110V-240V Ceramic Tourmaline 1 1/4 inch Portable\nMadenia\n{'Brand': 'Madenia', 'Material': 'Ceramic', 'Size': '14 Inch (Pack of 1)', 'Item Weight': '0.9 Pounds', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '15.7 x 3.3 x 2.4 inches; 14.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '781573208030'}\nThis gets and A for travel. It's portable, versatile and comes with dual voltage but isn't the easiest to use. It would not be my first choice at home or when having other options but for stuffing in the luggage and hoping it doesn't get lost during transit to the destination, it's just fine.\nGood for travel\n&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&\nYRMJK\n{'Brand': 'YRMJK', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Item Firmness Description': 'Soft', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '9.1 x 3.1 x 2.7 inches; 13.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '738426030676', 'Manufacturer': 'MUTTUS'}\nI'll admit it, what initially attracted me to this is the pink...it's pretty! It also just happens to be a decent toothbrush. It comes with ample extras but can be packed away in a small space making it perfect for travel! Overall there isn't anything super fancy about this one - it works fine, looks great!\nGets extra points for pretty!\nPARWIN Infrared Flat Iron 1 1/4 Inch Digital Hair Straightener Iron with Ceramic Tourmaline Plate Temperature Control Hair Iron Christmas Gift Black\nPARWIN\n{'Brand': 'PARWIN', 'Hair Type': 'Coarse, Wavy, Frizzy, Curly, Thick, Thin', 'Material': 'Ceramic', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Max Temperature Setting': '232.2 Degrees Celsius', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '13.94 x 3.82 x 1.93 inches; 1.3 Pounds', 'UPC': '605826620649', 'Manufacturer': 'Parwin'}\nNothing fancy here - it works fine and performs as expected but there was nothing to get excited about either. Zero problems but if you hide the brand name, no real benefit above lesser models either. This essentially boils down to the price since performance is pretty much standard on this one.\nPretty basic but good\nWet Dry Body Bath Foot Brush - 2 Pack With Massage Nodes & Long Handle - Removes Dead Skin And Toxins - Improve Your Circulation - Natural Bristle Back Scrubber for Exfoliating Skin & Foot Scrub Leg\nKitchen Krush\n{'Material': 'Nylon', 'Brand': 'Kitchen Krush', 'Power Source': 'hand_powered', 'Product Benefits': 'Softening,Massage,Relaxation,Smoothening,Clean,Exfoliating,Relaxing,Cleanse,Blood Circulation', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Package Dimensions': '13.94 x 4.88 x 1.57 inches; 11.22 Ounces', 'UPC': '744790296037', 'Manufacturer': 'Kitchen Krush'}\nGreat design with sustainable bamboo \"wood\" that can be used on a stick as a back brush or on the hand for a body brush.
