  "reference_summary": "LaClaire Acne Wash with Salicylic Acid & Tea Tree Oil - Face Cleanser for Acne-Prone Skin (50 ml/1.65 oz)\nLaClaire\n{'Item Form': 'Oil, Foam', 'Skin Type': 'Oily, Combination, Dry, Normal', 'Brand': 'LaClaire', 'Scent': 'Tea Tree', 'Material Feature': 'Antibacterial', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '5.5 x 2.75 x 1.63 inches; 9.14 Ounces', 'UPC': '891040000705', 'Manufacturer': 'LaClaire'}\nThis has terrific ingredients but personally I found it harsh and irritating; not the best option for older adults prone to the sporadic flair-up of acne. Fragrance, consistency and overall ingredient list are fine but the irritation lingers long after use.\nNot the best for mature acne prone skin\nLaClaire Skin Revitalization Clarifying Formula - Exfoliating Face Wash - Anti Wrinkle Face Wash \u2013 1.9 % Salicylic Acid Exfoliating Cleanser - Smooth, Young & Radiant Skin \u2013 For Daily Use - 50mL / 1.7 oz, Made in the USA\nLaClaire\n['Formulated for blemish control in acne-prone skin, this extra strength foaming cleanser combines the natural antibacterial, tea tree oil, with the synergistic exfoliating power of two Alpha Hydroxy Acids, Glycolic Acid and Lactic Acid, as well as Beta Hydroxy Acid, Salicylic Acid, to decrease clogged pores, clear up stubborn body acne and problematic facial acne.']\n{'Item Form': 'Foam', 'Skin Type': 'Oily, Combination, Dry, Normal', 'Brand': 'LaClaire', 'Scent': 'Tea Tree', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '5.5 x 2.75 x 1.63 inches; 10.41 Ounces', 'UPC': '891040000712', 'Manufacturer': 'LaClaire'}\nTypically I like this brand and I like the ingredient list in the product line up but the overall quality isn't quite effective enough. Not sure if it's due to age or strength but better used as a wash versus full treatment.\nNice ingredients but not strong enough\nBololo Baby Hair Clippers - Quiet Kids Hair Trimmer, Cordless & Waterproof Chargeable, Children with Autism, ABS Ceramic Blade, Haircut Kit for Kids Infants Men and Women,Green,\nMOM&HOME\n{'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Trimming', 'Color': 'White', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'MOM&HOME', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.38 x 3.66 x 2.32 inches; 8.47 Ounces', 'Batteries': '1 Lithium Ion batteries required. (included)', 'UPC': '691608094128', 'Manufacturer': 'Mom&Home'}\nVery gentle - which is good - but the usb charger is plain annoying. I'm unlikely to continue using this due to the charger. Very quiet, very gentle and very annoying to recharge. Also, despite the fact this is to be used on children, the person doing the trim is probably an adult so why make this so small? It's hard to handle.\nGentle but don't like the charger\nNatural Jade Roller Massager & Rose Quartz Facial Roller 2pcs Gift Set\nTGS Gems\n{}\nThis is a pretty little set - soothing, cool and all natural stone.
