I'm unlikely to continue using this due to the charger. Very quiet, very gentle and very annoying to recharge. Also, despite the fact this is to be used on children, the person doing the trim is probably an adult so why make this so small? It's hard to handle.\nReview Title: Gentle but don't like the charger\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
