The sprayer version is easy to hold and spray.  The sprayer is top notch even better than I was expecting . I filled one with my zero odor and I get a great fine mist . No drips or wet floor. I took the sticker off the plastic bottle and put it on my glass bottle. It came with a chalkboard type label, but I wanted my lable on this one.\nReview Title: Fine mist out of pretty bottle\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
