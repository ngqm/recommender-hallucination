So when I received this I was sceptical.  So I put my mascara on put this at the base of my lash and turned it on while pushing my eyelash up gently.  Warm air gently dried them curled up.

Good color and blends right into my hair. It even colors my greys ,it rubs color into them that was a surprise to me . Ive had an inch of grey and when Ive been hiding a bald spot or thinning spots it just deposits color right into my hair. Woohoo . these products are a little itchy when they get on your scalp.\nCovers and  colors thinning and greying hair\nGlass spray bottle-16 ounce empty bottle ounce refillable container 2 packs, suitable for essential oils, cleaning products, aromatherapy, water mist plants with mist and air flow settings\nDS DOODLE SABBATH\n{'Brand': 'DS DOODLE SABBATH', 'Capacity': '16 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '2.76 x 2.76 x 8.27 inches', 'Special Feature': 'Adjustable Nozzle', 'Product Dimensions': '2.76 x 2.76 x 8.27 inches; 1.4 Pounds', 'UPC': '619011520959'}\nI'm replacing all my pump and spray bottles with these beautiful cobalt blue<br />glass bottles. The sprayer version is easy to hold and spray.  The sprayer is top notch even better than I was expecting . I filled one with my zero odor and I get a great fine mist . No drips or wet floor. I took the sticker off the plastic bottle and put it on my glass bottle. It came with a chalkboard type label, but I wanted my lable on this one.\nFine mist out of pretty bottle\nEmpty Brown Glass Spray Bottles2-Pack, Refillable 16 oz Containers for Essential Oils, Cleaning Products, Aromatherapy, Misting Plants, or Cooking - Reliable Sprayer with Mist and Stream Settings\nCherry\n{'Brand': 'Cherry', 'Material': 'Glass', 'Capacity': '16 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Product Care Instructions': 'Hand Wash Only', 'Package Dimensions': '9.09 x 6.46 x 3.35 inches; 4.94 Ounces', 'UPC': '791523234187'}\nIve been ordering glass bottles and moving my products into them. I get refill size and transfer.  These 2 spray bottles were a little thinne not bad, but still sturdy enough and the spray top where the sprayer is spins loosely 360 degrees.  ?? I just filled it with my gallon of orange cleaner and I had to take off the sprayer and toss it in the garbage!  The flaw is the spinning sprayer that allowed my expensive orange cleaner to pour out of the top all around the nozzle.  cheaply made  but all in all a good glass bottle with a terrible srayer . If you just need a bottle with a screw top your good. If you have a different sprayer you can take off a plastic bottle great. Thats what I did. I took the label off my orange cleaner and stuck it on this bottle and it looks so nice. So my sprayer and label made a great usable bottle.\nNeeds a different sprayer that works\n[Marshique] Patented Eyelash Dryer - Extension & Lift/Perm Care Mascara Dry No Damage Curl USB Rechargeable\nMarshique\n{'Brand': 'Marshique', 'Handle Type': 'Massage Handle', 'Operation Mode': 'Automatic'}\nI love that this handy dandy eyelash dryer is rechargeable.
