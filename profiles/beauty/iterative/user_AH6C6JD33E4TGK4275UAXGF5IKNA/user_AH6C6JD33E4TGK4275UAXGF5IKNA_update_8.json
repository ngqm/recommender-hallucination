It's not a great fit for me though. While it seems very well tolerated and doesn't sting, burn or make my eyes water, it doesn't do anything else. Its texture is a bit too thick, which isn't usually the issue with rich/thick eye creams (think Estee Lauder Re-Nutritiv, Sisleya, Shiseido Benefiance), but ZO intense eye cream does tend to ball up on me; to me, it seems like a thick layer that looks almost waxy under the eyes.<br /><br />In general, with cosmetics there are two kinds of results, one comes from a handful of ingredients that actually do something for skin and improve it (usually over weeks/months, like retinol or glycolic acid) and the other type is when a product just makes skin look nicer (with some pigments, polymers and all the other chemical witchery - the stuff that washes off at the end of a day) - this eye product manages neither for me. ZO Intense eye cream claims it helps with the appearance of dark circles and eye puffiness - and I say, nope, the thicker formula does even enhance the appearance of eye bags and every line and wrinkle.\nReview Title: its not a ride or die -\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I usually use it for a professional everyday look for work. However , it is versatile enough that I can intensify it for evening or dressy occasions or tone it down for subtly enhancing a \"no makeup\" look. Because it is neutral and universally flattering on almost all skin tones (may not show up well if you have a deep toned complexion), I can wear it with any color in my wardrobe. I also like that it has a fantastic cool toned set of colors that do not end up showing up blue or purple on the skin. The undertones are very subtle, just like real skin! So hard to find - there seems to be a profusion of warm toned makeup out there, but very little cool or neutral toned makeup that produces a smooth, natural looking and flattering gradient of color on the skin. Nice job, Too Faced! I hope you regard this as your flagship palette and never discontinue this. Don't change the formula either!\nTOO FACED DEVOTEE\nCharlotte's Genius Magic Powder For Under Eye and Face 13 Grams/.45 Ounce Shade 1 Fair\nCHARLOTTE TILBURY\n{'Brand': 'CHARLOTTE TILBURY', 'Color': 'Beige', 'Finish Type': 'Matte', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Tone': 'Fair', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.38 x 3.11 x 3.31 inches; 3.52 Ounces'}\nThey call it BAKING, I call it MY BABY!! it's a crease-less must have.

So smooth and pigmented, plus they last. I love all the shades and it is the perfect warm yellow toned gold, yet it also is very skin-toned, if that makes sense (really blends into your overall look and makes you glow). I use this shade as a wash across my lids and use bronzer in the crease (the perfect everyday look). This eyeshadow also goes perfectly with my light/medium complexion.  One thing to watch for, these shadows are designed to pop out from the case (from the bottom), so you can place them in a palette. They also don\u2019t take drops well (will shatter) so be carful and gentle with them.\nI LOVE THESE!\nZO Skin Health Intense Eye Creme 8ml 0.3 Fl Oz (Travel Size)\nZO SKIN HEALTH\n{'Brand': 'ZO SKIN HEALTH', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Type': 'Mature', 'Item Volume': '0.3 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '10.12 x 7.87 x 3.03 inches; 3.53 Ounces', 'UPC': '860001752878'}\nOn the paper, the ZO intense eye cream looks perfect, and it apparently has a host of fans who love it.
