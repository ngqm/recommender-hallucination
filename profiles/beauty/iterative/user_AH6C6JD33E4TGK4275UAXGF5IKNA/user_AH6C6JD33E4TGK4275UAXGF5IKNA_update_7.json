So smooth and pigmented, plus they last. I love all the shades and it is the perfect warm yellow toned gold, yet it also is very skin-toned, if that makes sense (really blends into your overall look and makes you glow). I use this shade as a wash across my lids and use bronzer in the crease (the perfect everyday look). This eyeshadow also goes perfectly with my light/medium complexion.  One thing to watch for, these shadows are designed to pop out from the case (from the bottom), so you can place them in a palette. They also don\u2019t take drops well (will shatter) so be carful and gentle with them.\nReview Title: I LOVE THESE!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I usually use it for a professional everyday look for work. However , it is versatile enough that I can intensify it for evening or dressy occasions or tone it down for subtly enhancing a \"no makeup\" look. Because it is neutral and universally flattering on almost all skin tones (may not show up well if you have a deep toned complexion), I can wear it with any color in my wardrobe. I also like that it has a fantastic cool toned set of colors that do not end up showing up blue or purple on the skin. The undertones are very subtle, just like real skin! So hard to find - there seems to be a profusion of warm toned makeup out there, but very little cool or neutral toned makeup that produces a smooth, natural looking and flattering gradient of color on the skin. Nice job, Too Faced! I hope you regard this as your flagship palette and never discontinue this.
