It comes with everything for you to do your own nails. The polygel tubes are pretty small. However, a little bit goes a long way if you\u2019re just doing an overlay. If you\u2019re doing a fullset, they are not going to last long . It was packaged really well. This is definitely something you would gift to someone.\nReview Title: So cute\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
