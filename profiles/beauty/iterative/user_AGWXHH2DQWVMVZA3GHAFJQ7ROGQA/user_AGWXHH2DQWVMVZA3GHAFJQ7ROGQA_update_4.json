However it just did not give me that real authentic locs look. They were easy to use and install. It comes with the hook to use and the little stylish hair accessories. The locs looked uniformed. But if you want the more natural look all you have to do is stretch it and slightly brush it\nReview Title: Cute locs\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
