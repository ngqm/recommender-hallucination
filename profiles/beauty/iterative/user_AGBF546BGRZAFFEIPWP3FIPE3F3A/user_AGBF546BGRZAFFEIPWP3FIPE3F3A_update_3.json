  "reference_summary": "Gio Naturals Organic Moroccan Argan Oil, 4 oz - 100% Pure and USDA Certified for Face, Hair, Skin and Nails\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6 x 2.2 x 2.1 inches; 8.16 Ounces', 'UPC': '820103119702'}\nThis is 100% pure organic argan oil.  Nothing added. Excellent quality and effective on our hair and nails.  Most of the other brands that claim to be 100% pure argan oil actually add fragrance and preservatives.  If you're using this on your face or hair,  those extras can cause irritation and clogged pores. My wife and I especially like this pump top dispenser. You can precisely control how much you use.  The greatest part,though, has to be the rock bottom price.  We've seen this stuff top $20 per ounce. Here you get 4 ounces of cold pressed organic argan oil for 16 bucks.

My eyelashes are slightly darker and healthier after only a few applications.  I use it at night and, while they aren't longer or thicker, they do look younger.  Hopefully the results will last.  No irritation or redness so far.
