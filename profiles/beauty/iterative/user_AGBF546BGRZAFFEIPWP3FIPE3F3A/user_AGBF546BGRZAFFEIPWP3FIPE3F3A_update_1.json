Nothing added. Excellent quality and effective on our hair and nails.  Most of the other brands that claim to be 100% pure argan oil actually add fragrance and preservatives.  If you're using this on your face or hair,  those extras can cause irritation and clogged pores. My wife and I especially like this pump top dispenser. You can precisely control how much you use.  The greatest part,though, has to be the rock bottom price.  We've seen this stuff top $20 per ounce. Here you get 4 ounces of cold pressed organic argan oil for 16 bucks.
