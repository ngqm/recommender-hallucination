  "reference_summary": "Gio Naturals Organic Moroccan Argan Oil, 4 oz - 100% Pure and USDA Certified for Face, Hair, Skin and Nails\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6 x 2.2 x 2.1 inches; 8.16 Ounces', 'UPC': '820103119702'}\nThis is 100% pure organic argan oil.  Nothing added. Excellent quality and effective on our hair and nails.  Most of the other brands that claim to be 100% pure argan oil actually add fragrance and preservatives.  If you're using this on your face or hair,  those extras can cause irritation and clogged pores. My wife and I especially like this pump top dispenser. You can precisely control how much you use.  The greatest part,though, has to be the rock bottom price.  We've seen this stuff top $20 per ounce. Here you get 4 ounces of cold pressed organic argan oil for 16 bucks.

My eyelashes are slightly darker and healthier after only a few applications.  I use it at night and, while they aren't longer or thicker, they do look younger.  Hopefully the results will last.  No irritation or redness so far.

I tried running it under hot water and still couldn't get it to work. I understand that problems happen from time to time and contacted the seller to kindly inform them of my problem with this item.  No response. I contacted the seller twice more over the next four days to arrange for an exchange and still have never heard one single reply.<br />&#60; Discount provided for evaluation and review\nDefective product\nGenesea Perfecting Serum for Face for a Tightening, Optimally Hydrating Sensation - Innovative Anti Aging Beauty Facial Serum - Promotes Youthful, Glowing Looking, Lifted Skin Appearance - 1.1 Ounce\n{'Package Dimensions': '6.5 x 1.6 x 1.6 inches; 1.6 Ounces'}\nPros:<br />+ Natural ingredients sourced and imported from the Dead Sea<br />+ One of the few serums that contains Dunaliella salina<br />+ Botanical squalane, jojoba, wheat derived amino acids<br />+ Highly effective formula softens and smooths dry patches immediately<br />+ No chemicals, toxins, or pore clogging fillers<br />+ No palm oil<br />+ Efficient 1.1 ounce pump top container<br />+ Trusted brand / Family friendly ingredients<br />Cons:<br /> - None<br />This is the best age fighting serum on the market.  You only need a dime sized application  for full coverage so the 1.1 ounce container should last.  It's nearly impossible to find moisturizers or serums like Genesea's that include Dunaliella salina... a micro algae that survives in salt by producing massive amounts of carotenoids.  Dunaliella salina is a natural anti ageing powerhouse and a weapon against oxidation and free radical formation.

It comes in a high quality pump top bottle that can be reused, smells beautiful and most importantly doesn't aggravate my adult acne.  Plus it thoroughly cleans my face and doesn't take an eternity to rinse off in the shower. Two pumps is sufficient for full face and neck coverage so I'm expecting this giant bottle to last several months. I also have the Isabel Fay toner and hyaluronic acid cream and they're just as wonderful as the rosehip cleanser.  Wish they had a retinol serum and a night cream.

Much thicker acrylic than expected.  Although you can separate the top and bottom and put it in the dishwasher, we spot clean ours with rubbing alcohol and a soft cloth.  The drawers are easy to open and close, the liners are removable  and the price is much cheaper than the competition.  It matches perfectly with our acrylic cotton swab and cotton round holders.

Hyaluronic Acid with Aquaxyl. 1 fl. oz.\n{'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Unit Count': '1.0 Fl Oz', 'Package Dimensions': '4 x 2 x 2 inches; 0.8 Ounces'}\nI've tried several serums and like many of them... But Skederm's is one of my favorites.  The spots on the side of my mouth are noticeably lighter.  It has a thin texture and absorbs quickly without any sticky residue.  But it's not primarily water.  Nothing against water, but I prefer my serums to have some thickness to them to allow the ingredients time to penetrate my skin.  This one has the feel of a light cream and a soft citrus scent.  Also the ingredients are superior.  It has the sodium hyaluronate version of HA, biotin, squalane and most importantly 3-O Ethyl Abscorbic acid.  Also the unique pump top bottle gives me full control and delays oxidation.
