There are only about 2-3 regular colors. The rest are glitters and I did notice there were a few that looked like duplicates but will have to see how they apply once in the nail. I love the variety of the set and you don\u2019t need to do multiple coats. I also like that the bottles have a little clear circle to preview the color!\nReview Title: Beautiful set!!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
