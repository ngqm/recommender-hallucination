It is more of a lotion, rather than a thick cream. It definitely is a good moisturizer and seems to help protect sensitive skin. However, I'm not sure that it will completely get rid of a rash once it has completely formed. This is also a smaller tube than I was anticipating.\nReview Title: Works ok but somewhat thin\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Shiny Leaf Vitamin C Serum For Face, Hyaluronic Acid Serum And Retinol Serum Facial Skin Care Products Set, Anti Aging Skin Care Sets For Women And Men, 2 Fl. Oz x 3 - Big Bottles Of Skincare Serums\nShiny Leaf\n{'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Anti-aging', 'Use for': 'Face', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'Shiny Leaf', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Product Dimensions': '4.9 x 1.6 x 5 inches; 14.89 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'SL-TRIO'}\nThis serum set is a great product and has made my skin smooth, younger looking and overall, much healthier. I will note though, that if you're not used to using retinol, do your research and use it sparingly. It definitely can cause your skin to be dry and flaky at first. I only use it every 3 days or so with this regime and make sure to use moisturizer after I finish applying the serums. I use these serums at night and wash my face gently in the morning and I also use sunscreen if I go out after using retinol as it can cause sunburn. Overall, the benefits of retinol and all of these serums are extremely positive.\nGreat set\nEyebrow Stamp Stencil Kit- Easy Way To Get Perfect Eyebrows In Minutes,Waterproof, Middle Brown\nETEDES\n{'Brand': 'ETEDES', 'Finish Type': 'Natural', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '6.61 x 3.62 x 1.02 inches; 1.45 Ounces'}\nThis stencil kit is a complete joke. First of all, there are very few directions, and the first step is in Spanish while the rest are in English. Secondly, None of these stencils are normal size. Instead, they're about 1 1/4 the length of normal eyebrows. The powder is also much darker than it should be. I ended up looking like a clown when I used it, so I guess the fact that it's not waterproof as advertised is a good thing in this case because I was able to wash it off easily.\nNot waterproof at all\nSO'BiO \u00e9tic | Baby Soothing Diaper Cream | Organic and Gentle for Newborn, Infant, Toddler | 3.38 fl oz\nSo'Bio \u00c9tic\n{'Brand': \"So'Bio \u00c9tic\", 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Item Volume': '3.38 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '5.31 x 1.93 x 1.42 inches; 4.02 Ounces'}\nThis diaper cream is somewhat thin as far as diaper creams go.
