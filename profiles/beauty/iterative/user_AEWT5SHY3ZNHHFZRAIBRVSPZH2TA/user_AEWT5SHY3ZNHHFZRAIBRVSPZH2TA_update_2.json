The manufacturer didn't tell consumers in the instruction leaflet that the charging cord is a phone cord, needing to be hooked up via an adapter! 2. It works extremely quietly, in fact, were it not for the indicator lights, you'd think it wasn't working! 3. The \"charge\" feels very prickly..almost like a mild stinging sensation. It takes getting used to. I'll keep it up maybe once/day for a few...see what happens! My review may change...we'll see.\nReview Title: We'll see!\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
