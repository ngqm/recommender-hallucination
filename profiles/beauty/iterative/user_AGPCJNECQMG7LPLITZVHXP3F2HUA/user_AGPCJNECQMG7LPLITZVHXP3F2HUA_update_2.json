These are much nicer than I expected. They came individually wrapped with a convenient velvety pink carrying case.  The larger brushes have a mesh cover over them to keep the bristles straight in the packaging which is a thoughtful detail. The handles are a metal material and feel very sturdy. The brushes are light pink and very soft. The characters on them are cute and silly. These are a great gift for any make-up lover.\nReview Title: Can't wait for my daughter to see these!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Not just for make up. These pads are so soft everybody wants to use them to wash their faces. I love that it comes with 18 pads! Then we use the convenient laundry bag and wash them with a load of laundry. The ones I did use to wash my make up off had black from the mascara but after washing them they were clean again. They also have a little loop that allows you to hang them up in the shower. The only downfall for me was they are a little small, but over all the whole family loves these.\nEverybody in the family uses one\nCute Cartoon Makeup Brushes Set - 8pcs Fairy Makeup Brushes with Soft Pink Fiber and Metallic Handle for Eyebrow, Eyeshadow, Foundation, Blending and Lips, Great Gift for Sister Girlfriend (Style B)\nrongji jewelry\n{'Brand': 'rongji jewelry', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Face Makeup', 'Color': 'Pink', 'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Item Form': 'Wand', 'Number of Pieces': '8', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult,Teen', 'Ferrule Material': 'Aluminum', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '8.2 x 3.8 x 1.3 inches; 5.75 Ounces', 'UPC': '745695122377'}\nStyle B - I ordered these Cute Cartoon Makeup Brushes for a gift for my daughter and can't wait for her to see them.
