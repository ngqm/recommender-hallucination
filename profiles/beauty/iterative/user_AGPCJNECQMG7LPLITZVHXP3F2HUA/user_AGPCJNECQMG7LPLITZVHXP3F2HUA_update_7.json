The gel nail polishes also smell great, like I\u2019ve been working on a Christmas tree.  The colors in this set are some of our favorites.  The dark green and the dark glittery blue are our favorites.  We find it best to apply more than one coat, although Pine is not incorrect in advertising that one coat is essentially equal to two of those from other companies.  The chameleon set\u2019s colors look amazing and although not exactly like the stickers on the top of the polishes, they still are good enough to tell which is which.  The different colors are a great combination and allow for salon quality finishes.  I have found the Pine gel nail polishes last a very long time when you properly prepare your nails before application, and when you allow the polish to have sufficient cure times.  I have also found that my nail beds are less beat up when using the Pine products.  The color options and long lasting finish of Pine is hard to beat, and I strongly recommend this product and brand.\nReview Title: Dark and glittery finish that provides top notch nails!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Natwag Makeup Remover Pads,18 Pack 3.74 Inch Reusable Microfiber Cleansing Pad with Laundry Bag Suitable for All Skin Types,3 Color Facial Cleansing Pad Set.\nNatwag\n{'Brand': 'Natwag', 'Skin Type': 'All Skin,Dry', 'Material Feature': 'Reusable', 'Unit Count': '18.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '18', 'Package Dimensions': '4.4 x 4.37 x 2.59 inches; 3.84 Ounces', 'UPC': '745103569701'}\nNatwag Makeup Remover Pads are great for the whole family. Not just for make up. These pads are so soft everybody wants to use them to wash their faces. I love that it comes with 18 pads! Then we use the convenient laundry bag and wash them with a load of laundry. The ones I did use to wash my make up off had black from the mascara but after washing them they were clean again. They also have a little loop that allows you to hang them up in the shower. The only downfall for me was they are a little small, but over all the whole family loves these.\nEverybody in the family uses one\nCute Cartoon Makeup Brushes Set - 8pcs Fairy Makeup Brushes with Soft Pink Fiber and Metallic Handle for Eyebrow, Eyeshadow, Foundation, Blending and Lips, Great Gift for Sister Girlfriend (Style B)\nrongji jewelry\n{'Brand': 'rongji jewelry', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Face Makeup', 'Color': 'Pink', 'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Item Form': 'Wand', 'Number of Pieces': '8', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult,Teen', 'Ferrule Material': 'Aluminum', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '8.2 x 3.8 x 1.3 inches; 5.75 Ounces', 'UPC': '745695122377'}\nStyle B - I ordered these Cute Cartoon Makeup Brushes for a gift for my daughter and can't wait for her to see them. These are much nicer than I expected. They came individually wrapped with a convenient velvety pink carrying case.  The larger brushes have a mesh cover over them to keep the bristles straight in the packaging which is a thoughtful detail. The handles are a metal material and feel very sturdy. The brushes are light pink and very soft. The characters on them are cute and silly. These are a great gift for any make-up lover.\nCan't wait for my daughter to see these!\nGlass spray bottle-16 ounce empty bottle ounce refillable container 2 packs, suitable for essential oils, cleaning products, aromatherapy, water mist plants with mist and air flow settings\nDS DOODLE SABBATH\n{'Brand': 'DS DOODLE SABBATH', 'Capacity': '16 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '2.76 x 2.76 x 8.27 inches', 'Special Feature': 'Adjustable Nozzle', 'Product Dimensions': '2.76 x 2.76 x 8.27 inches; 1.4 Pounds', 'UPC': '619011520959'}\nWe are always looking for a plain water bottle for use on clothes or hair, and these blue glass bottles are the perfect solution!  The two-pack of spray bottles both provide a consistent spray mist, and also a targeted spray, based upon which setting the tip is turned to.Tight seal on caps, until you try and turn the spray nozzle.  When you turn it, it loosens the cap, and occurs on both bottles. The black labels stay secured through washing and the black color doesn\u2019t detract from the deep blue color of the bottle.  We have been using both for water, but we are going to make one be an air freshener bottle using our essential oils.  After a quick test run with the oils, made extra convenient using one of the plastic filters that comes with each bottle, as long as they were diluted, the spray nozzle was able to provide an even and broad mist.  With two sprays in the playroom, it smelled like a citrus orchard, but didn\u2019t leave the carpet feeling saturated.  We are happy with the bottles, except that the lid comes undone when adjusting the spray nozzle.  Just be careful to re-secure so you don\u2019t spill water or whatever else you may put in the bottles.\nBeautiful blue bottles but nozzle cap turns loose\nGel Nail Polish Set, Holiday Red Black 6 Colors Gel Polish Kit Popular Nail Art Design Soak Off LED Lamp Nail Polish Gel Manicure Kit Gifts Set for Girls Women Professional DIY Home Use\nAnzuo\n{'Brand': 'Anzuo', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'gel', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Special Feature': 'Long Lasting', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '6.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '6', 'Package Dimensions': '5.4 x 3.7 x 3.3 inches; 8.78 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'FZ', 'UPC': '738626208554'}\nManicures and pedicures are a routine event in our home, especially with restrictions on public outings.  With younger children, picking nail polish is a given, so despite the gel\u2019s potential to last for up to two weeks, they manage to remove it in just a few days.  For them, though, it means another nail session and new colors, so no big deal.  The gel nail polish was hopefully our answer to increase the duration and longevity of their finished nails.<br /><br />Anzuo Gel Nail Polish offers attractive color kits.  We received the Kit 3 set, which contains black, red, white, and three shades of tan to brown.  Like others have commented, the lids only contain numbers, and the kit includes stickers where the user has to create the swatches.  This is an inconvenience, but not the end of the world.  We found it to be a good test to see how the gel polish would actually apply and then finish.<br /><br />The gel was rather thick, even after keeping it at room temperature, and rolling it to ensure sufficient mixing.  With thinner and increased coats, the polish results in deep, beautiful colors that we really enjoy.  The white looks like white-out, even with a top clear coat, though.  The black and red are the favorites in our home.<br /><br />The main problem we experienced and shared with others is the inconsistency and deficiencies in the product\u2019s marketing.  There are typos, poor translation and grammar, and worse yet, is the inconsistency in the cure times advertised by the company on the Amazon site and the actual shipping box.  The box says cure time is 10-30 seconds by LED/UV lamp, but the website says time frames up to 120 seconds.  That is a huge difference that seriously impacts the quality and life of the nail finish.  We cure using time frames of 60-120 seconds, depending upon the wattage used by our lamp.  With these longer cure times, we have been able to keep the polish looking well and intact for over a week now, even on our children\u2019s nails.<br /><br />If you can overlook the need to label the bottles, disregard the spelling and grammatical errors, and then utilize your own cure times, the Anzuo gel polish is worth using.\nColor Kit 3- Beautiful colors, long-lasting finish, but poor marketing job\nAibilye Shower Cap, 3Pcs Shower Cap For Women,Shower Cap For Kids, Double Waterproof,Hair Care Cap,Salon Shower Cap,Reusable, Medium Size(STYLE-3)\nAibilye\n{'Brand': 'Aibilye', 'Material': 'Polyester', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Kid', 'Pattern': 'Floral', 'Size': 'Medium', 'Package Dimensions': '11.1 x 8.1 x 0.2 inches; 3.99 Ounces'}\nI got these for myself and my daughters. The unicorns on them are fun and whimsical and the colors are nice. They work well in the shower and cover my hair when I don't want it wet. However they are a little big on my head so they are even bigger on my daughters head. If you have extra thick hair these would be great coverage though. They do what we need them to do but wish they fit just a little better.\nwaterproof but a little big\nGlazed Apricot - South of France Natural Body Care Moisturizing Sugar Polish 8oz Tube (1)\nSouth of France Natural Body Care\n{'Brand': 'South of France Natural Body Care', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Product Benefits': 'Moisturizing', 'Active Ingredients': 'shea butter', 'Material Feature': 'Gluten Free, Natural', 'Product Dimensions': '8 x 2.8 x 2 inches; 8 Ounces', 'UPC': '856885005179'}\nThis is the first sugar scrub I have used. I had a hard time with how greasy it was. I would never use this all over my body. Just on my heels and knees or hands when they are dry.  The glazed apricot scent is really nice though.\nVery greasy, smells great\nPine Gel Nail Polish Set Chameleon Shimmering Color and Black 7.5 ml LED UV Cured Soak Off Nail Gel for Nail Art Manicure\npine\n{'Brand': 'Pine', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Liquid Volume': '0.25 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '4.96 x 3.7 x 2.91 inches; 9.14 Ounces', 'UPC': '738628890993'}\nPine produces great gel polishes that last and that look amazing.
