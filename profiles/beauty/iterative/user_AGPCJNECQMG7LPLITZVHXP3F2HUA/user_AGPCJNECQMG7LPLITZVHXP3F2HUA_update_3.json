The two-pack of spray bottles both provide a consistent spray mist, and also a targeted spray, based upon which setting the tip is turned to.Tight seal on caps, until you try and turn the spray nozzle.  When you turn it, it loosens the cap, and occurs on both bottles. The black labels stay secured through washing and the black color doesn\u2019t detract from the deep blue color of the bottle.  We have been using both for water, but we are going to make one be an air freshener bottle using our essential oils.  After a quick test run with the oils, made extra convenient using one of the plastic filters that comes with each bottle, as long as they were diluted, the spray nozzle was able to provide an even and broad mist.  With two sprays in the playroom, it smelled like a citrus orchard, but didn\u2019t leave the carpet feeling saturated.  We are happy with the bottles, except that the lid comes undone when adjusting the spray nozzle.  Just be careful to re-secure so you don\u2019t spill water or whatever else you may put in the bottles.\nReview Title: Beautiful blue bottles but nozzle cap turns loose\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Not just for make up. These pads are so soft everybody wants to use them to wash their faces. I love that it comes with 18 pads! Then we use the convenient laundry bag and wash them with a load of laundry. The ones I did use to wash my make up off had black from the mascara but after washing them they were clean again. They also have a little loop that allows you to hang them up in the shower. The only downfall for me was they are a little small, but over all the whole family loves these.\nEverybody in the family uses one\nCute Cartoon Makeup Brushes Set - 8pcs Fairy Makeup Brushes with Soft Pink Fiber and Metallic Handle for Eyebrow, Eyeshadow, Foundation, Blending and Lips, Great Gift for Sister Girlfriend (Style B)\nrongji jewelry\n{'Brand': 'rongji jewelry', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Face Makeup', 'Color': 'Pink', 'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Item Form': 'Wand', 'Number of Pieces': '8', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult,Teen', 'Ferrule Material': 'Aluminum', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '8.2 x 3.8 x 1.3 inches; 5.75 Ounces', 'UPC': '745695122377'}\nStyle B - I ordered these Cute Cartoon Makeup Brushes for a gift for my daughter and can't wait for her to see them.
