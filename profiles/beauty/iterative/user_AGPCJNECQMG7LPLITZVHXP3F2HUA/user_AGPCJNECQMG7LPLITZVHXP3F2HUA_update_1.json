Not just for make up. These pads are so soft everybody wants to use them to wash their faces. I love that it comes with 18 pads! Then we use the convenient laundry bag and wash them with a load of laundry. The ones I did use to wash my make up off had black from the mascara but after washing them they were clean again. They also have a little loop that allows you to hang them up in the shower. The only downfall for me was they are a little small, but over all the whole family loves these.\nReview Title: Everybody in the family uses one\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
