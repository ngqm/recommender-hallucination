The results were quite decent. You first wash your hair with the pre-treatment shampoo to clarify the hair and remove dirt and oils. At this point, make sure to detangle the hair well and section it into smaller parts so that you can apply the keratin treatment. The hair should be 80% towel dried. You then comb in the keratin treatment to each section of hair. I recommend wearing gloves. Allow it time to process and then blow dry and finish with a flat iron. The hair came out quite silky and smooth, but it began to revert into fluffiness as the day went on. Adding a bit of hair oil helped to restrain the humidity. For an at home kit, it is decent, but it is not as strong as salon treatments.\nReview Title: OK\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

It probably works better for people with straight hair and not course curly hair types. My hair didn't feel hard or crunchy when it dried.\nOK\nHair Straightener Flat Iron for Straightening and Curling, Milantia 3/4 Inch Straightener for Bangs and Short Hair, Dual Voltage Ionic Mini Straightening Iron with Travelling Pouch and EU Adapter\nMilantia\n{'Shape': 'Flat', 'Brand': 'Milantia', 'Hair Type': 'Frizzy', 'Material': 'Ceramic', 'Size': '1 Count (Pack of 1)', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '7.09 x 0.79 x 1.57 inches; 7.1 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'LM-161', 'Manufacturer': 'Milantia'}\nThis tiny iron gets hot!

It broke apart while I was using it. I felt like I was better off just using a regular wash cloth and soap.\nUnecessary\nCOSYMAY 20 inch Human Hair Wig for Women Long Black Wig with Bangs 4x4 Lace Closure Straight Wig Brazilian Virgin Hair Full Wig Average Size 1B\nCOSYMAY\n{'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Brand': 'COSYMAY', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '9.96 x 6.73 x 2.72 inches; 11.99 Ounces', 'UPC': '738627428647'}\nThe wig I received is exactly as pictured. It only needed a bit of flat ironing and mousse to flatten and smooth out the hair. The density of the hair makes the wig look realistic. It doesn't look like one of those super thick, fake looking cosplay wigs.\nBetter than expected\nGel UV Nail Lamp, AsperX 150W LED Nail Dryer Gel Nail Polish Light Curing Lamp Kit Smart Auto-sensing with 10/30/60/99s Timer\nAsperX\n{'Brand': 'AsperX', 'Material': 'Gel', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '8.9 x 8.03 x 4.33 inches', 'Product Dimensions': '8.9\"D x 8.03\"W x 4.33\"H'}\nIt dried my nails much faster than my previous lamp. Since the wattage is much higher, I did notice my skin get a little tanner, so I covered my hand with a towel.\nDries nails fast\nMagnetic Eyeliner and Eyelashes Kit Self Adhesive Eyeliner Pen - 3D Natural Look Eyelash Without Magnet - Reusable Eye Lash with Waterproof Liner, Black, Applicator(5 Sets Lashes + 1 Pen Liners)\nLampelc\n{'Brand': 'Lampelc', 'Material': 'Mink Fur', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Item Form': 'Individual', 'Mounting Type': 'Eyelash Glue', 'Package Dimensions': '6.14 x 5.59 x 0.59 inches; 11.29 Ounces'}\nI liked the varied styles from natural to dramatic. The lashes stuck quite nicely with the mascara. Very easy to apply and remove.\nNice\nBeauhair Lace Front Wigs Human Hair Pre Plucked Brazilian Deep Wave 13x4 Lace Frontal Wig with Baby Hair 9A Natural Hair Wigs for Black Women(16, Deep Wigs)\nBeauhair\n{'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Brand': 'Beauhair', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '9.61 x 6.18 x 2.52 inches; 8.78 Ounces'}\nWas I given the wrong product? This wig looks awful. The lace is terrible and highly visible because for some reason they sewed two different types of lace together at the front of the wig. This is the worst wig I have ever seen. It is completely unwearable. The hair quality is good and I will be taking this wig apart to save the hair. This wig was constructed wrong and is overpriced. I do not recommend this product.\nWorst Wig Ever\nJohn Frieda Detox and Repair Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Nourishing Avocado Oil and Green Tea, 8.45 Fl Oz (Pack of 2)\nJohn Frieda\n['John Frieda Detox and Repair Shampoo and Conditioner set removes product build up and revitalizes dry and stressed hair.

It cleansed my hair hair very well and got rid of any residue. The smell is also nice. The shampoo and conditioner was a great combo and left my hair feeling clean and soft.\nGreat\nKeratin Secrets Do It Yourself Home Keratin System\nKeratin Secrets\n{'Package Dimensions': '8.27 x 4.21 x 3.9 inches; 2.87 Pounds'}\nI tried this on thick curly 3c hair.
