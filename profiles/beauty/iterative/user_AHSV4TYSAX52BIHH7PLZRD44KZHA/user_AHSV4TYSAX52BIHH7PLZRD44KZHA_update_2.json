But, I'm here for the shimmers, and I'm not disappointed! The tops of the bottles are labeled with a colored sticker for convenience, and the shimmers only require one coat over the black. It's hard to capture the color shifting on camera, but it's absolutely stunning! I couldn't recommend it more. It looks different at different angles, and over different colors. All polishes in this set cured in 60 seconds for me; they are pictured without a top coat since this set didn't provide one.\nReview Title: Chameleon shimmers!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Facial Skincare,Cucumber Essence Hydrating Moisturizing Revitalizing Hydration Fruit Extract Deep Cleaning Facial Skincare Sheet for All Skin Type Care, 35ml/1.18oz, Pack of 5\nPalNour\n{}\nWhen I pulled the first of these masks out of the package, I didn't think that it would fit on my face at all. Mainly, because the eye holes were only about a centimeter wide, and the mouth hole was literally just a slit in the plastic. However, once I pulled off the plastic sheet that helps the mask keep its shape in the package, I found that these holes stretched, so it ended up working out okay, though I would still like for the eye holes to be a little bit longer as they barely fit around my eyes. Overall, because of the material / stretchiness of the mask, this fit my face better than a lot of other sheet masks do.<br />The main reason I'm giving only three stars is the feel of the mask itself. When I first touched it, my immediate thought was that it felt like a donut that sat in a pool of water for several hours and ended up being soggier than anyone should have to even imagine (trust me, I worked at a donut shop for years and this accidentally happened sometimes). My husband's reaction was that it felt like boogers. After taking it off and inspecting it a little more closely, we both thought it pretty much looked and felt like soggy toilet paper. Whichever answer you got with, it's not at all pleasant to touch, and not a pleasant texture moving around on your face either. Once you get it on, as long as you basically hold still and don't talk or anything, then it actually has a nice cooling, refreshing feeling. And it smells wonderfully like cucumber, which is what I was really hoping for!<br />The other reason I'm giving three stars is because it left my face feeling sticky for a long time after I removed the mask. Some masks leave a sticky feeling for a few minutes, but this one took almost two hours to absorb into my skin because it left so much. With other masks I don't normally help this along, so I didn't with this one either. When it finally did absorb, I was happy with how my face felt... I'm not against getting this mask again especially for the price because I did really like the cooling sensation in particular, it's just not one I'd get / use too often because of the gross, soggy feeling of the mask itself.\nRefreshing cucumber face mask, unpleasant texture\nPine Gel Nail Polish Set Chameleon Shimmering Color and Black 7.5 ml LED UV Cured Soak Off Nail Gel for Nail Art Manicure\npine\n{'Brand': 'Pine', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Liquid Volume': '0.25 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '4.96 x 3.7 x 2.91 inches; 9.14 Ounces', 'UPC': '738628890993'}\nThe black in this set is not even close to the best - it 100% requires two coats, and even then still isn't the best (pictured is two coats).
