I love the holo paired with the multichrome magnetic polishes! That being said, the pigment is fairly thin on these polishes, while the formula is pretty thick. They\u2019re still easy enough to work with, but I would likely recommend wearing them over a black polish.<br />I show them in one coat with no magnet (obviously very sheer), and with a magnetic coat on top of that (still pretty sheer, but better). I feel they\u2019re slightly pricy for how sheer the formula is, but I would still recommend them because they\u2019re so pretty, and I\u2019ve found Homost to be a pretty reliable brand in the couple of sets I\u2019ve ordered from them. They all cure within 60 seconds. Just know, their bottles feel super tiny, and their brush is definitely very short and small.\nReview Title: Wear over black to help with sheer formula\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Facial Skincare,Cucumber Essence Hydrating Moisturizing Revitalizing Hydration Fruit Extract Deep Cleaning Facial Skincare Sheet for All Skin Type Care, 35ml/1.18oz, Pack of 5\nPalNour\n{}\nWhen I pulled the first of these masks out of the package, I didn't think that it would fit on my face at all. Mainly, because the eye holes were only about a centimeter wide, and the mouth hole was literally just a slit in the plastic. However, once I pulled off the plastic sheet that helps the mask keep its shape in the package, I found that these holes stretched, so it ended up working out okay, though I would still like for the eye holes to be a little bit longer as they barely fit around my eyes. Overall, because of the material / stretchiness of the mask, this fit my face better than a lot of other sheet masks do.<br />The main reason I'm giving only three stars is the feel of the mask itself. When I first touched it, my immediate thought was that it felt like a donut that sat in a pool of water for several hours and ended up being soggier than anyone should have to even imagine (trust me, I worked at a donut shop for years and this accidentally happened sometimes). My husband's reaction was that it felt like boogers. After taking it off and inspecting it a little more closely, we both thought it pretty much looked and felt like soggy toilet paper. Whichever answer you got with, it's not at all pleasant to touch, and not a pleasant texture moving around on your face either. Once you get it on, as long as you basically hold still and don't talk or anything, then it actually has a nice cooling, refreshing feeling. And it smells wonderfully like cucumber, which is what I was really hoping for!<br />The other reason I'm giving three stars is because it left my face feeling sticky for a long time after I removed the mask. Some masks leave a sticky feeling for a few minutes, but this one took almost two hours to absorb into my skin because it left so much. With other masks I don't normally help this along, so I didn't with this one either. When it finally did absorb, I was happy with how my face felt... I'm not against getting this mask again especially for the price because I did really like the cooling sensation in particular, it's just not one I'd get / use too often because of the gross, soggy feeling of the mask itself.\nRefreshing cucumber face mask, unpleasant texture\nPine Gel Nail Polish Set Chameleon Shimmering Color and Black 7.5 ml LED UV Cured Soak Off Nail Gel for Nail Art Manicure\npine\n{'Brand': 'Pine', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Liquid Volume': '0.25 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '4.96 x 3.7 x 2.91 inches; 9.14 Ounces', 'UPC': '738628890993'}\nThe black in this set is not even close to the best - it 100% requires two coats, and even then still isn't the best (pictured is two coats). But, I'm here for the shimmers, and I'm not disappointed! The tops of the bottles are labeled with a colored sticker for convenience, and the shimmers only require one coat over the black. It's hard to capture the color shifting on camera, but it's absolutely stunning! I couldn't recommend it more. It looks different at different angles, and over different colors. All polishes in this set cured in 60 seconds for me; they are pictured without a top coat since this set didn't provide one.\nChameleon shimmers!\nPine Gel Nail Polish Set 6 Colors Purple Blue Cat Eye Glitter Gel Polish 7.5 ml Soak Off UV LED Cure Home Salon Manicure\npine\n{'Brand': 'Pine', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '9.524 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '6', 'Liquid Volume': '0.25 Fluid Ounces', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '4.84 x 2.87 x 3.58 inches', 'Product Dimensions': '4.84 x 2.87 x 3.58 inches; 9.77 Ounces', 'UPC': '738628890955'}\nWith the exception of the glitter in this set, they're pretty much one coaters! All cured in 60 seconds; the creme colors are nice, but I got this set for the magnetic ones and I'm not disappointed! Even without the magnetic effect, those two polishes are shimmery and beautiful. With the magnetic affect, they're very different, but still stunning. I actually feel that even with the magnetic affect, one coat was just fine. I added a second just to see what that looked like, and it made the edges darker, and the magnetic effect less profound, in my opinion. Still, this set is absolutely worth it! The tops of the bottles are labeled with a colored sticker for convenience, which is great.\nNearly one coaters\nGel Nail Polish Set, Glitter 6 Colors Gel Polish Kit Popular Nail Art Design Soak Off LED Lamp Nail Polish Gel Manicure Kit Gifts Set for Girls Women Professional DIY Home Use\nAnzuo\n{'Brand': 'Anzuo', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'gel', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Special Feature': 'Long Lasting', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '6.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '6', 'Number of Pieces': '6', 'Product Dimensions': '5.12 x 3.15 x 3.54 inches; 10.23 Ounces'}\nI'm really happy with these colors - most of my gels are just plain solid colors, so I definitely need more holo and glitters in general. All of these except for the silver are holo, so it's so hard to pick just one favorite, especially when the silver is a metallic foil!<br />All of the polishes are pictured in two coats just to show how that looks, but if you're going for full opacity you might want to do a third especially if you have long nails. Alternatively, you could wear them over a similar base color. They cured just fine under my lamp in 60 seconds; they are wipe colors though, so you either need to wipe them or put a top coat on. They're pictured without a top coat, because this kit didn't come with one. They're still wonderfully shiny without a top coat!<br />The bottles of this set come with numbered dots to label them, but not colored dots; however, it comes with a sheet of stickers that you can swatch them on your own. If you're like me and have other gels which also don't have colored dots, you might be happy to know this comes with a few extra stickers so you can do a couple of others too.

So I got this to use on her, and I'm very happy with it! It feels solid, and is comfortable to use even for long periods of time. I used it to remove my mom's dip nails yesterday, and she said that it vibrated and bothered her less than her nail tech's drill does. It also did a really good job removing the dip powder; you can control how much it removes by changing the speed and direction of the drill, or the amount of pressure you apply. For different tasks, it also comes with different drill bits. Plus, you get a nice feeling storage bag, and a brush to brush off the mess you make filing. And, I love the purple color! This drill is definitely a win, especially for the price point. Definitely recommend!\nSolid e-file with everything you need!\nCIMIY Gel Nail Polish Set 8 bottles - Manicure Colors Infinity with Top Base Coat for Forest Nail Art Natural Daily All Seasons for Nail Profession Salon and Starter at Home Soak Off UV LED 0.32oz\nCIMIY\n{'Brand': 'CIMIY', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Glossy', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Liquid Volume': '0.3 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '11.54 x 3.58 x 1.22 inches; 11.64 Ounces'}\nI wanted this set for the greens in it and wasn't sure how I'd like the other ones, but once I started swatching them they gave me a happy, wintery feeling so I liked them a lot better than expected! The lightest one is the only one I likely won't use often, but I love all of the others. They cover really well in 2 coats, and cure in 60 seconds. Plus, the shade names are really cute; the labels themselves are the color of the shade inside the bottle which is helpful, though it doesn't seem like the stickers are stuck on the bottle very well. And perhaps most exciting is these bottles are almost full size! They're 9 mL and full size is normally between 10 and 15 mL. Pictured are all colors in two coats, with the top coat they came with over the top - the holder in the picture is NOT the box they came in.\nThese colors have winter-y vibes!\nBiutee Nail Stamping Plates 5pcs Templates With Stamper Scraper Set Nail Art Plates set animal flower Christmas halloween design\nBiutee\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.42 x 5.75 x 1.18 inches; 5.47 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'TOOL-AT-755', 'Manufacturer': 'Biutee'}\nI definitely think that Bituee is one of the better cheap stamping plate brands on Amazon... the plates don't have a plastic backing, but they're thick enough not to hurt or cut your hands (please note they are still thin enough you can bend them with your hands pretty easily if you want to). I'm not sure what the logic on putting St. Patrick's Day plates together with winter ones is, but all of the plates have really great designs and pick up well. Personally, I'm not a fan of the stamper and the scraping card this set come with, but they do definitely work. Definitely get these if you like the designs on them! They're well worth it.\n$9 is a steal for these plates!\nFrench Girl Hibernation Essentials\nFRENCH GIRL\n{'Brand': 'FRENCH GIRL', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Product Benefits': 'Cleansing,Hydrating', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Package Dimensions': '7.52 x 5.59 x 3.58 inches; 14.46 Ounces', 'UPC': '850000595255'}\nI was a little hesitant about getting this set, since it is a little bit pricey and is a rose scented lotion (I can be sensitive to floral smells in particular). I figured I'd like the cuticle oil, and the lotion less so. But it actually turned out to be the other way around - I like the lotion better than the cuticle oil.<br />The lotion itself is very, very thin, almost the consistency of water, but it does work well for me. Before I used it, my knuckles were cracked to the point of bleeding. I applied a generous amount before bed, and that first night it healed my hands enough that they were no longer bleeding, just cracking a little bit. Even with my handwashing and having my hands frequently wet at work, this lotion brought them back to life. The second use resulted in no more cracks. The third brought my hands back to feeling normal. Since then, I've been using a more moderate amount only a couple of times a week (note the bottle DID come completely full - the pictures are after about three weeks of use, with the first week of that using a lot more than I normally would, due to how bad my hands were cracking). The lotion does have a definite floral scent, but it's actually a lot lighter than I expected it to be. My skin absorbs it pretty fast, within about 5-10 minutes even using a ton, and the scent fades pretty much completely even before this. So it doesn't bother me at all.<br />The cuticle oil, on the other hand, has a much stronger scent. It's more \"planty\" and less pleasant to me. Definitely not something I can use when I already have even a hint of a headache. Also, it lingers a lot more than the lotion's scent does. I do like the roller applicator as it makes it much easier to control my application onto my dominant hand, but I don't feel that this cuticle oil is anything better than any other one I've used. Combine that with the smell of it, and I definitely like the lotion in this set better. It is pricey, but to help my hands as much as it has, I think it's worth it.\nThin lotion, but works well for me\nGel Nail Polish Set - TOEDO Fall Winter Nail Gel 6 Colors Tan Brown Colors Soak Off LED Nail Lamp Gel Polish Kit for Home DIY Manicure Nail Designs\nTOEDO\n{'Brand': 'TOEDO', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'gel', 'Finish Type': 'Matte,Glossy', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '1.56 FL Oz', 'Liquid Volume': '0.27 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '11.1 x 3.31 x 3.23 inches; 9.14 Ounces'}\nEspecially for the price, these colors are very nice! They're difficult to photograph, but in the light in person, they're quite pretty. Several of the colors are jellies, but I still think you could get full coverage from them (the dark red particularly would be a beautiful, deep red). Pictured are all of the colors in two coats, but on the nails you might need three, as when holding the swatch dots up you could still see through them. They do all cure within 60 seconds. I do also like that the bottles look different than my other gel polishes do, but are still the same size / shape so they still easily fit in with the others in my storage boxes.\nVery nice colors\nJIADEL Gel Nail Polish Colors Set,Confetti Glitter Gel Nail Polish With No Wipe Base and Top Coat,Soak Off UV LED Nail Art Salon Starter Manicure Kit\nJIADEL\n{'Brand': 'JIADEL', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Number of Items': '16', 'Liquid Volume': '0.17 Fluid Ounces', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '11 x 9 x 1 inches', 'Product Dimensions': '11 x 9 x 1 inches; 1.34 Pounds', 'UPC': '642940399488'}\nThis is by far the most unique set of gel polishes I've ever seen... I only wish the bottles were bigger! They're only 5 mL, but you do get a lot of options so I think the price is still fair. Depending on your preference, you'll probably want 2-3 coats of each color; they're all pictured in 2, and do cure in 60 seconds. There are colored stickers already on the top of each bottle, but I don't feel they accurately show the colors inside, so I still added swatch dots.<br />The black velvet box does rub off on the white top / base coat bottles, but that's okay. One of these white bottles also had some color on it making me wonder if I possibly got a set that was returned, but I honestly like the color selection far too much to take off a star even for this.\nAwesome unique colors\nKYM NOVA Real Scrunchies for Hair, No Damage Hair Ties, Ponytail Holder Scrunchies, Assorted Scrunches Thick Hair\u00a0Bands Red 5 pack\nKYM NOVA\n{'Material': 'Cotton', 'Item Form': 'Scrunchie', 'Brand': 'KYM NOVA', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Item Weight': '50 Grams', 'Package Dimensions': '7.87 x 5.51 x 0.79 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '691206829757', 'Manufacturer': 'KYM NOVA'}\nPart of the fun of using scrunchies is finding different patterns, and different colors. This set has a theme of red, but I'm in love with the patterns! I also particularly love that not only does this set have a variety of patterns that I like, but they're all different materials so they actually feel different as well. For my hair, they don't do the absolute best job in the world at keeping it up in a bun using just one of these scrunchies, but with my hair being four feet long, few hair ties do. They don't do terrible on their own, but I just put my hair up in a ponytail first and then wrap it up in a bun using one of these, and it stays all day with no issues. I'd happily pay the $3.32 price for these pretty scrunchies!\nRed set is so pretty!\nPlant Therapy Natural Acetone Free Nail Polish Remover 6 fl oz One Touch Dispensing Bottle with Flip Top Cap Tropical Flower Scent\nPlant Therapy\n{'Brand': 'Plant Therapy', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Item Weight': '6.24 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Unit Count': '6 Fl Oz', 'Package Dimensions': '5.1 x 2.2 x 2.2 inches; 6.24 Ounces', 'UPC': '680912056168'}\nBottom line - this nail polish does what it\u2019s supposed to do, I just don\u2019t love it as much as I was hoping I would.<br />The first reason for this is that it\u2019s oily - it leaked during shipping, so about a quarter of the shipping box was soaked in oil. Of course, since it leaked it\u2019s all over the bottle, and since it\u2019s oil, it\u2019s not terribly fun to clean up. Even if it didn\u2019t leak, I don\u2019t love the oiliness. It definitely sticks around on your hands when you use it.<br />The second reason is the smell - as soon as I opened the shipping box, I could smell it and at first I thought it smelled wonderful, like a rainbow cherry flavored candy cane, although the smell was incredibly strong. Riding in my car with it for a few minutes, my husband and I both could smell it for the rest of the day, and leaving it in the car while we shopped for maybe an hour, the smell was overpowering when we came back out to the car. So, I let it sit in the box for a few days hoping the smell would eventually die down; it did, but when actually using the polish, it doesn\u2019t have this same nice smell. It smells a bit like vinegar, or something similar - definitely not like acetone, and not like flowers which is like I was worried about, but still not great. Personally, I\u2019d prefer the smell of acetone.<br />Finally, the bottle - it has a convenient flip cap and a pump you press down to dispense it which is supposed to be convenient, but in reality, it makes a mess. I think this is possibly because you have to push fairly hard on it to get any out. But, as I said, this nail polish remover does work pretty well. I used it on a polish with tiny holo glitter in it, and had no problems, and my husband had no problems getting it to remove foil or plain creme polish. Essentially, the thing both of us really don\u2019t like about it is the oiliness. The other things we could deal with, but because of the oiliness we won\u2019t be buying this product again after this bottle. However, if that wouldn\u2019t bother you, we think this is a great option if you\u2019re looking for an alternative to acetone.<br />I have provided a picture of my bottle - you can see the oiliness around the edges of the label, and you can somewhat see the oil still all over the bottle. Note that I did clean the bottle off before I used it, and have kept it upright and in a plastic bag since then - it\u2019s just a messy product.\nVery oily\nKRISNICE Gel Nail Polish Kit- 6 Colors Blue Olive Turquoise Lavender Purple Gel Polish Set Glitter Nail Polish Soak Off LED Gel Nail Kit Nail Art Manicure Salon DIY at Home Gifts for Women (KCS6-010)\nKRISNICE\n{'Brand': 'KRISNICE', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Color': 'Blue,Olive,Turquoise,Purple', 'Type': 'gel', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Special Feature': 'Long Lasting', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '6.00 Count', 'Liquid Volume': '7.3 Milliliters', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '5.51 x 3.94 x 0.59 inches', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '5.51 x 3.94 x 0.59 inches; 1.41 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'KCS6-010', 'UPC': '613635849250'}\nThese polishes were exactly what I was hoping for when I ordered Krisnice creme colors! One of them is actually more of a jelly polish, but it\u2019s a stunning color, which you can definitely build up some opacity and depth with. The others are, as I said, exactly what I was hoping for. I\u2019ve used this brand\u2019s magnetic polishes before, but these cremes apply just as dreamily, and have absolutely excellent coverage! A couple of them were almost one coaters, but they\u2019re all definitely perfect within two. And, they all cure within 60 seconds, so I couldn\u2019t be happier with them!\nBeautiful, well-behaved polishes\nScrunchie Holder Stands with 8 Pack Large Size Scrunchies - Acrylic Hair Ties Organizer for Teenage Girls and VSCO Girls Gift Stuff\nBeeager\n{'Color': 'Yellow,Gray,White', 'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Item Form': 'Scrunchie', 'Brand': 'Beeager', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Package Dimensions': '10.55 x 3.98 x 3.7 inches; 10.86 Ounces'}\nThis is definitely one of those products that I absolutely don\u2019t need and didn\u2019t know it existed, but now that I have one and know it exists, I love it and don\u2019t want to let it go.<br />Honestly, this product is incredibly simple - it\u2019s just a tube with a base, and even the base probably isn\u2019t completely necessary.This particular holder comes with the tube and base connected and the open end of the tube facing down, so you\u2019re unable to store anything inside of it unless you use it upside down, but then you couldn\u2019t grab scrunchies off of it as easily. The strange thing about it is that the bottom of the base has some kind of brown paper on it - it looks like it should be removable, but it\u2019s not. Honestly, since I\u2019ll be keeping scrunchies on this pretty much all the time this will likely remain covered, but I still don\u2019t like it. I would also like it better if the diameter of the tube was slightly smaller so some of my ties that are slightly smaller don\u2019t get stretched out, but I can work with this. I\u2019m very happy it fits perfectly on my bookcase where I wanted it to go, and I also really love that even though it\u2019s only $10, it comes with eight scrunchies to get you started. I\u2019ve been using one of these scrunchies all week and so far it\u2019s holding up well - while I thought I wouldn\u2019t like the material, it actually feels way nicer than it looks. I\u2019m very happy with this product and am considering getting more as gifts for others later this year, if it holds up. I did get mine to use for scrunchies as the listing suggests, but you could also definitely use it for other things such as bracelets - it\u2019s quite simple, but convenient.\nComes with 8 scrunchies!\nMaestee 9 Pcs Gel Nail Polish Kit, 6 Colors (8ml) with Base and Top Coat and Matte Top Gel (8ml) Nail Polish Hot Modern Muse Collection Soak Off Nail Gel Polish Starter Professional Kit Best Mothers Day Gift\nmaestee\n{'Brand': 'maestee', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Matte,Glossy', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '9', 'Number of Pieces': '9', 'Liquid Volume': '0.27 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '11.69 x 3.66 x 1.42 inches; 14.07 Ounces'}\nThis is a great little set! It\u2019s more of a neutral color palette, without being boring, and without being the standard reds and pinks. One thing to note though - the first picture in the listing made me hope that the colors would have some shimmer in them, but they definitely don\u2019t. Looking at the other pictures, this matches up, but that shimmer was the most noticeable thing to me in the first picture so I just thought I\u2019d mention it.<br />These polishes do cure within 60 seconds, and actually give great coverage. Most of them gave full coverage in pretty much one coat, but they all gave full coverage within two coats for sure. Overall, I\u2019m happy with them! At 8 mL, they\u2019re also a decent sized bottle for gel polishes.\nAlmost 1 coat coverage\nMaestee 9 Pcs Gel Nail Polish Kit, 6 Colors (8ml) with Base and Top Coat and Matte Top Gel (8ml) Neon Nail Polish Hot Neon City Collection Soak Off Nail Gel Polish Starter Professional Kit Best Mothers Day Gift\nmaestee\n{'Brand': 'maestee', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Matte,Glossy', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '9', 'Number of Pieces': '9', 'Liquid Volume': '0.27 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '11.69 x 3.66 x 1.42 inches; 14.07 Ounces'}\nThis is a great little set! It\u2019s a neon set, and the colors are for sure neon. One thing to note though - the first picture in the listing made me hope that the colors would have some shimmer in them, but they definitely don\u2019t. Looking at the other pictures, this matches up, but that shimmer was the most noticeable thing to me in the first picture so I just thought I\u2019d mention it.<br />These polishes do cure within 60 seconds, and give decent coverage. Most of them gave full coverage in two coats, but a couple (mainly the yellow), I\u2019d consider a third coat for. Since the polishes are quite neon, are gel (meaning fast and easy to work with), and this is standard especially for yellow neons, I\u2019m not upset about it. Honestly, when I added a top coat over just two coats, it ended up looking pretty good, but I\u2019d still probably add that third coat just to be sure, because\u2026 It\u2019s neon yellow. But, overall, I\u2019m happy with the polishes! At 8 mL, they\u2019re also a decent sized bottle for gel polishes.\n2-3 coats\nGel Nail Polish Kit With U V LED Light Nail Kit With 150W Nail Lamp 10 Colors Soak Off Gel Polish Nail Art Salon & Starter Kit With Rhinestones Glitters Manicure Tool Kit\nJEWHITENY\n{'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'JEWHITENY', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Product Dimensions': '9.69 x 6.46 x 8.54 inches; 2.64 Pounds'}\nThis is a decent set, but not really anything special to me - the polishes perform fine and cure within 60 seconds, but they don\u2019t stand out to me. I\u2019d say I recommend this kit, but that you can find other similar priced kits that are more interesting.\nDecent stuff\nHOMOST Starry Magnetic Cat Eye Gel Nail Polish Set, 6PCS Galactic Auroras Chameleon Gel Nail Polish Kit With Magnet\nHomost\n{'Brand': 'Homost', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Color': 'Black', 'Type': 'gel', 'Finish Type': 'Glossy', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Natural', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Number of Items': '6', 'Package Dimensions': '7.48 x 3.23 x 1.18 inches; 6.7 Ounces'}\nSo pretty! I love the holo paired with the multichrome magnetic polishes! That being said, the pigment is fairly thin on these polishes, while the formula is pretty thick. They\u2019re still easy enough to work with, but I would likely recommend wearing them over a black polish.<br />I show them in one coat with no magnet (obviously very sheer), and with a magnetic coat on top of that (still pretty sheer, but better). I feel they\u2019re slightly pricy for how sheer the formula is, but I would still recommend them because they\u2019re so pretty, and I\u2019ve found Homost to be a pretty reliable brand in the couple of sets I\u2019ve ordered from them. They all cure within 60 seconds. Just know, their bottles feel super tiny, and their brush is definitely very short and small.\nWear over black to help with sheer formula",
