They're difficult to photograph, but in the light in person, they're quite pretty. Several of the colors are jellies, but I still think you could get full coverage from them (the dark red particularly would be a beautiful, deep red). Pictured are all of the colors in two coats, but on the nails you might need three, as when holding the swatch dots up you could still see through them. They do all cure within 60 seconds. I do also like that the bottles look different than my other gel polishes do, but are still the same size / shape so they still easily fit in with the others in my storage boxes.\nReview Title: Very nice colors\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Facial Skincare,Cucumber Essence Hydrating Moisturizing Revitalizing Hydration Fruit Extract Deep Cleaning Facial Skincare Sheet for All Skin Type Care, 35ml/1.18oz, Pack of 5\nPalNour\n{}\nWhen I pulled the first of these masks out of the package, I didn't think that it would fit on my face at all. Mainly, because the eye holes were only about a centimeter wide, and the mouth hole was literally just a slit in the plastic. However, once I pulled off the plastic sheet that helps the mask keep its shape in the package, I found that these holes stretched, so it ended up working out okay, though I would still like for the eye holes to be a little bit longer as they barely fit around my eyes. Overall, because of the material / stretchiness of the mask, this fit my face better than a lot of other sheet masks do.<br />The main reason I'm giving only three stars is the feel of the mask itself. When I first touched it, my immediate thought was that it felt like a donut that sat in a pool of water for several hours and ended up being soggier than anyone should have to even imagine (trust me, I worked at a donut shop for years and this accidentally happened sometimes). My husband's reaction was that it felt like boogers. After taking it off and inspecting it a little more closely, we both thought it pretty much looked and felt like soggy toilet paper. Whichever answer you got with, it's not at all pleasant to touch, and not a pleasant texture moving around on your face either. Once you get it on, as long as you basically hold still and don't talk or anything, then it actually has a nice cooling, refreshing feeling. And it smells wonderfully like cucumber, which is what I was really hoping for!<br />The other reason I'm giving three stars is because it left my face feeling sticky for a long time after I removed the mask. Some masks leave a sticky feeling for a few minutes, but this one took almost two hours to absorb into my skin because it left so much. With other masks I don't normally help this along, so I didn't with this one either. When it finally did absorb, I was happy with how my face felt... I'm not against getting this mask again especially for the price because I did really like the cooling sensation in particular, it's just not one I'd get / use too often because of the gross, soggy feeling of the mask itself.\nRefreshing cucumber face mask, unpleasant texture\nPine Gel Nail Polish Set Chameleon Shimmering Color and Black 7.5 ml LED UV Cured Soak Off Nail Gel for Nail Art Manicure\npine\n{'Brand': 'Pine', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Liquid Volume': '0.25 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '4.96 x 3.7 x 2.91 inches; 9.14 Ounces', 'UPC': '738628890993'}\nThe black in this set is not even close to the best - it 100% requires two coats, and even then still isn't the best (pictured is two coats). But, I'm here for the shimmers, and I'm not disappointed! The tops of the bottles are labeled with a colored sticker for convenience, and the shimmers only require one coat over the black. It's hard to capture the color shifting on camera, but it's absolutely stunning! I couldn't recommend it more. It looks different at different angles, and over different colors. All polishes in this set cured in 60 seconds for me; they are pictured without a top coat since this set didn't provide one.\nChameleon shimmers!\nPine Gel Nail Polish Set 6 Colors Purple Blue Cat Eye Glitter Gel Polish 7.5 ml Soak Off UV LED Cure Home Salon Manicure\npine\n{'Brand': 'Pine', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '9.524 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '6', 'Liquid Volume': '0.25 Fluid Ounces', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '4.84 x 2.87 x 3.58 inches', 'Product Dimensions': '4.84 x 2.87 x 3.58 inches; 9.77 Ounces', 'UPC': '738628890955'}\nWith the exception of the glitter in this set, they're pretty much one coaters! All cured in 60 seconds; the creme colors are nice, but I got this set for the magnetic ones and I'm not disappointed! Even without the magnetic effect, those two polishes are shimmery and beautiful. With the magnetic affect, they're very different, but still stunning. I actually feel that even with the magnetic affect, one coat was just fine. I added a second just to see what that looked like, and it made the edges darker, and the magnetic effect less profound, in my opinion. Still, this set is absolutely worth it! The tops of the bottles are labeled with a colored sticker for convenience, which is great.\nNearly one coaters\nGel Nail Polish Set, Glitter 6 Colors Gel Polish Kit Popular Nail Art Design Soak Off LED Lamp Nail Polish Gel Manicure Kit Gifts Set for Girls Women Professional DIY Home Use\nAnzuo\n{'Brand': 'Anzuo', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'gel', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Special Feature': 'Long Lasting', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '6.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '6', 'Number of Pieces': '6', 'Product Dimensions': '5.12 x 3.15 x 3.54 inches; 10.23 Ounces'}\nI'm really happy with these colors - most of my gels are just plain solid colors, so I definitely need more holo and glitters in general. All of these except for the silver are holo, so it's so hard to pick just one favorite, especially when the silver is a metallic foil!<br />All of the polishes are pictured in two coats just to show how that looks, but if you're going for full opacity you might want to do a third especially if you have long nails. Alternatively, you could wear them over a similar base color. They cured just fine under my lamp in 60 seconds; they are wipe colors though, so you either need to wipe them or put a top coat on. They're pictured without a top coat, because this kit didn't come with one. They're still wonderfully shiny without a top coat!<br />The bottles of this set come with numbered dots to label them, but not colored dots; however, it comes with a sheet of stickers that you can swatch them on your own. If you're like me and have other gels which also don't have colored dots, you might be happy to know this comes with a few extra stickers so you can do a couple of others too. Definitely recommend!\n5 holo colors and 1 foil color!\nPortable Electric Nail Drill,Professional Nail Drill Kit for Acrylic Gel Nails,Efile Nail Drill Manicure Polishing Shape Tools for Beginners Home Salon Use,Purple\nRomanda\n{'Brand': 'Romanda', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '7.17 x 3.15 x 1.77 inches', 'Item Weight': '310 Grams', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Product Dimensions': '7.17 x 3.15 x 1.77 inches; 10.93 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'C99', 'Manufacturer': 'Romanda'}\nHonestly, an e-file is not something I really need to use for my own nails, but it is something my mom constantly talks about getting to use to remove when she occasionally gets gel or dip or some other kind of manicure which she doesn't have the patience to remove without severely damaging her nails, even when I try to help... So I got this to use on her, and I'm very happy with it! It feels solid, and is comfortable to use even for long periods of time. I used it to remove my mom's dip nails yesterday, and she said that it vibrated and bothered her less than her nail tech's drill does. It also did a really good job removing the dip powder; you can control how much it removes by changing the speed and direction of the drill, or the amount of pressure you apply. For different tasks, it also comes with different drill bits. Plus, you get a nice feeling storage bag, and a brush to brush off the mess you make filing. And, I love the purple color! This drill is definitely a win, especially for the price point. Definitely recommend!\nSolid e-file with everything you need!\nCIMIY Gel Nail Polish Set 8 bottles - Manicure Colors Infinity with Top Base Coat for Forest Nail Art Natural Daily All Seasons for Nail Profession Salon and Starter at Home Soak Off UV LED 0.32oz\nCIMIY\n{'Brand': 'CIMIY', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Glossy', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Liquid Volume': '0.3 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '11.54 x 3.58 x 1.22 inches; 11.64 Ounces'}\nI wanted this set for the greens in it and wasn't sure how I'd like the other ones, but once I started swatching them they gave me a happy, wintery feeling so I liked them a lot better than expected! The lightest one is the only one I likely won't use often, but I love all of the others. They cover really well in 2 coats, and cure in 60 seconds. Plus, the shade names are really cute; the labels themselves are the color of the shade inside the bottle which is helpful, though it doesn't seem like the stickers are stuck on the bottle very well. And perhaps most exciting is these bottles are almost full size! They're 9 mL and full size is normally between 10 and 15 mL. Pictured are all colors in two coats, with the top coat they came with over the top - the holder in the picture is NOT the box they came in.\nThese colors have winter-y vibes!\nBiutee Nail Stamping Plates 5pcs Templates With Stamper Scraper Set Nail Art Plates set animal flower Christmas halloween design\nBiutee\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.42 x 5.75 x 1.18 inches; 5.47 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'TOOL-AT-755', 'Manufacturer': 'Biutee'}\nI definitely think that Bituee is one of the better cheap stamping plate brands on Amazon... the plates don't have a plastic backing, but they're thick enough not to hurt or cut your hands (please note they are still thin enough you can bend them with your hands pretty easily if you want to). I'm not sure what the logic on putting St. Patrick's Day plates together with winter ones is, but all of the plates have really great designs and pick up well. Personally, I'm not a fan of the stamper and the scraping card this set come with, but they do definitely work. Definitely get these if you like the designs on them! They're well worth it.\n$9 is a steal for these plates!\nFrench Girl Hibernation Essentials\nFRENCH GIRL\n{'Brand': 'FRENCH GIRL', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Product Benefits': 'Cleansing,Hydrating', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Package Dimensions': '7.52 x 5.59 x 3.58 inches; 14.46 Ounces', 'UPC': '850000595255'}\nI was a little hesitant about getting this set, since it is a little bit pricey and is a rose scented lotion (I can be sensitive to floral smells in particular). I figured I'd like the cuticle oil, and the lotion less so. But it actually turned out to be the other way around - I like the lotion better than the cuticle oil.<br />The lotion itself is very, very thin, almost the consistency of water, but it does work well for me. Before I used it, my knuckles were cracked to the point of bleeding. I applied a generous amount before bed, and that first night it healed my hands enough that they were no longer bleeding, just cracking a little bit. Even with my handwashing and having my hands frequently wet at work, this lotion brought them back to life. The second use resulted in no more cracks. The third brought my hands back to feeling normal. Since then, I've been using a more moderate amount only a couple of times a week (note the bottle DID come completely full - the pictures are after about three weeks of use, with the first week of that using a lot more than I normally would, due to how bad my hands were cracking). The lotion does have a definite floral scent, but it's actually a lot lighter than I expected it to be. My skin absorbs it pretty fast, within about 5-10 minutes even using a ton, and the scent fades pretty much completely even before this. So it doesn't bother me at all.<br />The cuticle oil, on the other hand, has a much stronger scent. It's more \"planty\" and less pleasant to me. Definitely not something I can use when I already have even a hint of a headache. Also, it lingers a lot more than the lotion's scent does. I do like the roller applicator as it makes it much easier to control my application onto my dominant hand, but I don't feel that this cuticle oil is anything better than any other one I've used. Combine that with the smell of it, and I definitely like the lotion in this set better. It is pricey, but to help my hands as much as it has, I think it's worth it.\nThin lotion, but works well for me\nGel Nail Polish Set - TOEDO Fall Winter Nail Gel 6 Colors Tan Brown Colors Soak Off LED Nail Lamp Gel Polish Kit for Home DIY Manicure Nail Designs\nTOEDO\n{'Brand': 'TOEDO', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'gel', 'Finish Type': 'Matte,Glossy', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '1.56 FL Oz', 'Liquid Volume': '0.27 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '11.1 x 3.31 x 3.23 inches; 9.14 Ounces'}\nEspecially for the price, these colors are very nice!
