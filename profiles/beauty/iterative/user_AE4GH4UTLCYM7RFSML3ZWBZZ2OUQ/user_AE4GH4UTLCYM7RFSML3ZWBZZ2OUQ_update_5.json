  "profile": "**User Summary:**\n\n- **Product Type Preference**: The user continues to prefer tape-in hair extensions for their temporary installation but is increasingly frustrated with adhesive performance. This dissatisfaction is compounded by their recent experience with a weave product that did not meet expectations.\n- **Material Preference**: They consistently favor human hair to ensure a natural appearance, though recent interactions indicate a willingness to explore other textures, given their challenges with quality.\n- **Quality Focus**: Recent purchases have resulted in significant dissatisfaction, especially regarding the thickness and adherence of extensions. The user\u2019s experiences with shedding and poor performance underscore their need for reliable, high-quality products.\n- **Length Specification**: While they generally favor longer extensions, recent experimentation with shorter lengths indicates they are open to options if quality and thickness improve.\n- **Installation Method**: The preference remains for the simplicity of tape-in extensions; however, their frustration with adhesive effectiveness has grown.\n- **Dissatisfaction with Thickness**: Emphasis on thickness and volume continues, especially after negative experiences with thinning and shedding, which detracts from their hair's natural look and blend.\n\nOverall, the user remains focused on finding high-quality extensions that meet their needs for volume and durability, actively reassessing product choices in light of disappointing experiences, thus reflecting a commitment to achieving a premium result.",
