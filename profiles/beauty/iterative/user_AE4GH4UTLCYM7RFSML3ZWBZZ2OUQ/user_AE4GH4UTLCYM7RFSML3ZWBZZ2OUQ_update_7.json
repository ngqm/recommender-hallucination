  "profile": "**User Summary:**\n\n- **Product Type Preference**: The user continues to prefer tape-in hair extensions for their temporary installation benefits but has grown increasingly frustrated with adhesive performance, particularly highlighted by their recent experience with a product that failed to hold securely.\n\n- **Material Preference**: The user remains committed to human hair for a natural appearance but has adopted a more cautious stance towards wavy textures due to recent purchases that did not meet their quality expectations.\n\n- **Quality Focus**: Recent interactions have underscored the user\u2019s disappointment with excessive shedding, insufficient thickness, and poor adherence, reinforcing their need for consistently high-quality extensions that offer both durability and volume.\n\n- **Length Specification**: Although the user typically favors longer extensions, their recent negative experiences prompted a willingness to consider shorter lengths; emphasis on quality and thickness continues to guide their choices.\n\n- **Installation Method**: While the simplicity of tape-in extensions is appreciated, the user\u2019s growing frustration with adhesive effectiveness is leading them to reassess potential alternatives.\n\n- **Dissatisfaction with Thickness**: Volume concerns remain prominent, as ongoing issues with thinning products have diminished the natural blend with their hair, further driving the pursuit of premium-quality extensions that provide both density and longevity.\n\nOverall, the user is focused on finding reliable extensions that meet their elevated quality standards, especially following recent unsatisfactory experiences with wavy tape-in products.",
