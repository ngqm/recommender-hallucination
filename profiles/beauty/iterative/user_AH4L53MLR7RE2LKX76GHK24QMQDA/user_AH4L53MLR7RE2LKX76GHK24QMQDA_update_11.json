It was not the same color as the pitcher it smells amazing. However  the other disappointed thing was the product was strange in texture. It was like part of it was hard as a rock while the other part was runny ? I couldn't figure out  why and my Husband brought me this 12$ for this ? I think this is a rip off and suggest to please be careful when purchasing I highly will not be  buying this again\nSmells great but product doesn't match picture\n4 Pack Hair Clips, Checkered Claw Clips for Thin Hair, Y2k Accessories Hair Claw Clips for Thick Hair, Medium Cute Hair Clips for Women Girls, 2\"\nRuizaua\n{'Brand': 'Ruizaua', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Color': 'Orange,Green', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '5.63 x 2.13 x 2.01 inches; 2.08 Ounces'}\nThese work amazing on thick hair and are super cute and strong not cheap feeling at all they won't slip and stays put\nAMAZING GREAT CHECKERED CLIPS WORKS WELL WITH THICK HAIR",
