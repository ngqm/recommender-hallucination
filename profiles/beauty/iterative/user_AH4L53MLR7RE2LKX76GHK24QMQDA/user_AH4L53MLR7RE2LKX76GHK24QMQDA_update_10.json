But when I open it up I was disappointed .  It was goopy all over the lid and container I had washed it off as it was sealed.  But then I noticed under light it was purple ? It was not the same color as the pitcher it smells amazing. However  the other disappointed thing was the product was strange in texture. It was like part of it was hard as a rock while the other part was runny ? I couldn't figure out  why and my Husband brought me this 12$ for this ? I think this is a rip off and suggest to please be careful when purchasing I highly will not be  buying this again\nReview Title: Smells great but product doesn't match picture\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
