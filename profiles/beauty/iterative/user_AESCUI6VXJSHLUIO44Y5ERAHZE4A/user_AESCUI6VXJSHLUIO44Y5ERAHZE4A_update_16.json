  "reference_summary": "Growom Garden Hose Nozzle 4 Adjustable Spray Patterns Garden Sprayer Heavy Duty Metal Hose Nozzle with 3 Washers for Gardening, Car Washing, Pet Bathing and General Cleaning\nGrowom\n{'Brand': 'Growom', 'Finish Type': 'Polished', 'Material': 'Heavy,Metal', 'Handle Type': 'Lever', 'Package Dimensions': '8.3 x 4.6 x 1.7 inches; 1.15 Pounds'}\nThis nozzle is super built to last. It\u2019s rather heavy but I know it will withstand the much abuse. My only worry is we have hard water and sometimes that eats away at our nozzles over time. Great product that will last though!\nSuper heavy duty\nThe Beachwaver Co. Dual Voltage, S1, White\n{'Product Benefits': 'This ceramic, rotating curling iron provides easy, quality waves in minutes!', 'Shape': 'Barrel', 'Brand': 'The Beachwaver Co.', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Material': 'Ceramic', 'Product Dimensions': '15.75 x 1.75 x 2 inches; 14.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': '1', 'UPC': '817741020613', 'Manufacturer': 'AmazonUs/SB10T', 'Country of Origin': 'China'}\nFirst off, I know it pricey for a curling iron but it actually does the trick and is pretty cool. You clip your hair in the bottom little clipper and I prefer the low speed and it winds your hair for you up the wand! It gets nice and hot and curls did stay well after hrs or wear in semi humid weather. Definitely takes a little getting use to but it\u2019s pretty cool. You do need to take slightly smaller sections of hair to curl so the clipper can hold it but I really enjoyed using this!\nI was skeptical but this is super amazing\nJPNK 4PCS Anti-Static Detangling Fine & Wide Tooth Shower Comb Set\nJPNK\n{'Material': 'Plastic', 'Brand': 'JPNK', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy,Straight', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '12 x 3.1 x 0.7 inches; 5.61 Ounces'}\nI love these combs not only for myself but for my daughters hair. They are perfect for any hair length or texture as you have a set of 4 from wide tooth to fine tooth. They feel nice on the scalp and glide through hair easily. These are a great deal for 4 of these!\nGreat detangler combs\nMagnesium Serum For Kids - All Natural Rub for Kids and Babies, Toxic Free + Free Magnesium Chart PDF\nRaise Them Well\n{'Brand': 'Raise Them Well', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Unit Count': '2 Fl. Oz', 'Flavor': 'Unflavored', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.41 x 1.5 x 1.5 inches; 3.2 Ounces', 'UPC': '853647007044', 'Manufacturer': 'Raise Them Well'}\nUnfortunately I didn't notice much different with this spray. I think it smells nice and it a great idea to calm kiddos but I fine essential oil rollers on the bottom of the feet to have more contact with the skin making them more effective.\nDidn't notice any difference\nPick & Pick (Gentle/metal allergy free material)\nMIND UP\n{'Package Dimensions': '7 x 1.2 x 0.5 inches; 0.63 Ounces'}\nI was hopeful for this pick but disappointed. First off, it's a super flimsy and you can't use much pressure when pressing against teeth. Also, the pointed end that is supposed to clear put any food from between the teeth isn't pointed enough so you can't really get in there all the way. Last, because you cannot put enough pressure to scrape off gunk, it becomes useless.\nWay to flimsy\n6 Pack Soft Headband BEoffer Coral Fleece Women Makeup Spa Head Bands Turban Fashion Bow Bowknot Hairlace Headwear Wash Face Hair Holder Elastic Top Knot Bandage Girl Baby Hair Accessories 6 Colors\nBEoffer\n{'Age Range (Description)': 'Baby', 'Material': 'Elastic', 'Fabric Type': 'Fleece', 'Number of Items': '6', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Face Makeup', 'Product Dimensions': '7.28 x 1.97 x 0.67 inches; 1.16 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'BH-002', 'UPC': '799899729252'}\nThese super cute headbands are perfect for washing you face at the end of the night, making sure all the hair stays out for your face, and when I am applying my sunscreen in the morning so it doesn't get in my hair. They are super soft and come in a variety of colors!!!\nPerfect for washing face\nHairdresser Scissors Set Hair Thinning Scissors Hairdressing Shears Set with Wipe Cloth,Grinding card, Hair Razor Comb, Clips, Upgraded Professional Haircut Set black\nLyeiaa\n['All-in-One Hair Cutting Kit :1 x Hair Scissor,1 x Grinding card,1 x Hair Razor Comb, 1 x Cleaning Cloth, 1 x Comb, 2 x Hairpin clips , 1 x Neck Duster. The hair cutting kit meets all your hair cutting and styling needs.']\n{'Brand': 'Lyeiaa', 'Included Components': 'Scissors', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '8.94 x 4.09 x 1.54 inches; 12.73 Ounces', 'UPC': '303276761980', 'Manufacturer': 'Lyeiaa'}\nThis kit is my favorite one I've purchased. I cut my kids and husband's hair and this is everything you will need! Comes in a nifty little case that holds it all together. The cape is perfect for minimizing hairs everywhere. The scissors and thinning sheers are super sharp and use with minimal effort. So far this is the best kit I am using and would recommend to anyone.\nAll in one kit\nWinky Lux Double Matte Whip 24-Hour Waterproof Lipstick, Liquid Wet Lipstick for Long-Lasting Matte Lip Color, Hydrating Makeup with Vanilla and Avocado Oil to Lock in Moisture, 0.14 Oz, Cookie\nWinky Lux\n{'Brand': 'Winky Lux', 'Color': 'Cookie', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Finish Type': 'Matte', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '0.65 x 0.65 x 4.28 inches; 0.14 Ounces', 'UPC': '859346006968'}\nThis pretty color goes on wet and dries down to a very pretty medium brown. I have light olive skin and found it very complementary to my skintone. Not too dark that it's a nighttime look but dark enough that it looks like I'm wearing something. Stays on pretty well and I will definitely be buying more\nPretty neutral shade\nMagnetic Eyelashes and Magnetic Eyeliner Kit, Magnetic Eyelashes with Eyeliner, 5 Pairs Reusable Magnetic Eyelashes with Tweezer, False Lashes\nEyenjoy\n{'Brand': 'Eyenjoy', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '5.71 x 5.39 x 0.71 inches', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Mounting Type': 'Magnet', 'Product Dimensions': '5.71 x 5.39 x 0.71 inches; 2.12 Ounces', 'UPC': '736067423758'}\nI had to keep reapplying the magnetic eyeliner especially in the corners of my eyes where it maybe got wet from blinking. I didn't feel like I could go out without the eyeliner in my purse to reapply everything I had a mirror. To me that just too much work then and you might as well use regular lashes.\nDon't stay well\nAloe Vera Gel 100% Natural Moisturisers - Pure Organic Fresh Soothing Aloe-Vera Moisturizing Gel Skin Hair, Aloe Leaf Wash-free Clean After Sun Face Body (8.8 oz)\nCIMIY\n{'Brand': 'CIMIY', 'Scent': 'Aloe Vera', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Unit Count': '8.8 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Product Dimensions': '5.91 x 1.57 x 1.57 inches; 11.22 Ounces'}\nWe use aloe a lot in our house as my daughter is constantly scraping her knees. This aloe has a nice push too for easy use and it a pretty decent value size. No strong smell and dries fast. Great buy.\nNice bottle for easy use\nBloomy Essentials Organic Tea Tree Essential Oil 10 mL - USDA Certified Organic - Hair, Skin, Toenail Fungus, and Acne - 100% Pure\nBloomy Essentials\n{'Brand': 'Bloomy Essentials', 'Scent': 'Tea Tree', 'Special Feature': 'Pure', 'Seasons': 'All Seasons', 'Item Volume': '10 Milliliters', 'Package Dimensions': '5 x 3 x 0.75 inches; 1.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '680912084581', 'Manufacturer': 'Bloomy Essentials'}\nFairly good sized bottle and price. Oil consistency was pretty good snd I found the scent to be right on. Smells great!\nSmells great\nSdara Aloe Vera Gel For Face and Body - Organic & Natural, Soothing & Cooling For Sunburn Relief, Restorative For Dry Skin - Made In USA\nSdara Skincare\n{'Brand': 'Sdara Skincare', 'Scent': 'Aloe Vera', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '4.9 x 2.3 x 1.3 inches; 9.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '707486993085'}\nI like this aloe because it speaks easily and absorbs into the skin quickly. Its so hard to keep still letting it fully dry but this one doesn't take long at all. I like the lack for a strong scent and natural ingredients.\nSpreads easily\n2oz / 60ml Glass Spray Bottles for DIY Refill, Essential Oils, Pillow Mists,Fine Mist Spray -3Packs Amber Color\nEagleKing\n{'Brand': 'EagleKing', 'Material': 'Glass', 'Capacity': '2 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '3', 'Special Feature': 'Mist Spray', 'Package Dimensions': '6.3 x 6.1 x 1.7 inches; 8.78 Ounces'}\nI used these bottles to make my own essential oil room sprays for the bathroom.
