Dual Voltage, S1, White\nReview Date: 2019/09/15\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Product Benefits': 'This ceramic, rotating curling iron provides easy, quality waves in minutes!', 'Shape': 'Barrel', 'Brand': 'The Beachwaver Co.', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Material': 'Ceramic', 'Product Dimensions': '15.75 x 1.75 x 2 inches; 14.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': '1', 'UPC': '817741020613', 'Manufacturer': 'AmazonUs/SB10T', 'Country of Origin': 'China'}\nReview Text: First off, I know it pricey for a curling iron but it actually does the trick and is pretty cool. You clip your hair in the bottom little clipper and I prefer the low speed and it winds your hair for you up the wand! It gets nice and hot and curls did stay well after hrs or wear in semi humid weather. Definitely takes a little getting use to but it\u2019s pretty cool. You do need to take slightly smaller sections of hair to curl so the clipper can hold it but I really enjoyed using this!\nReview Title: I was skeptical but this is super amazing\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

It\u2019s rather heavy but I know it will withstand the much abuse. My only worry is we have hard water and sometimes that eats away at our nozzles over time.
