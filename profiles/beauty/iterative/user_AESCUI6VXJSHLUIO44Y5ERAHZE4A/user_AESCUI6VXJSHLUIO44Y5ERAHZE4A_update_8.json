I have light olive skin and found it very complementary to my skintone. Not too dark that it's a nighttime look but dark enough that it looks like I'm wearing something. Stays on pretty well and I will definitely be buying more\nReview Title: Pretty neutral shade\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Growom Garden Hose Nozzle 4 Adjustable Spray Patterns Garden Sprayer Heavy Duty Metal Hose Nozzle with 3 Washers for Gardening, Car Washing, Pet Bathing and General Cleaning\nGrowom\n{'Brand': 'Growom', 'Finish Type': 'Polished', 'Material': 'Heavy,Metal', 'Handle Type': 'Lever', 'Package Dimensions': '8.3 x 4.6 x 1.7 inches; 1.15 Pounds'}\nThis nozzle is super built to last. It\u2019s rather heavy but I know it will withstand the much abuse. My only worry is we have hard water and sometimes that eats away at our nozzles over time. Great product that will last though!\nSuper heavy duty\nThe Beachwaver Co. Dual Voltage, S1, White\n{'Product Benefits': 'This ceramic, rotating curling iron provides easy, quality waves in minutes!', 'Shape': 'Barrel', 'Brand': 'The Beachwaver Co.', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Material': 'Ceramic', 'Product Dimensions': '15.75 x 1.75 x 2 inches; 14.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': '1', 'UPC': '817741020613', 'Manufacturer': 'AmazonUs/SB10T', 'Country of Origin': 'China'}\nFirst off, I know it pricey for a curling iron but it actually does the trick and is pretty cool. You clip your hair in the bottom little clipper and I prefer the low speed and it winds your hair for you up the wand! It gets nice and hot and curls did stay well after hrs or wear in semi humid weather. Definitely takes a little getting use to but it\u2019s pretty cool. You do need to take slightly smaller sections of hair to curl so the clipper can hold it but I really enjoyed using this!\nI was skeptical but this is super amazing\nJPNK 4PCS Anti-Static Detangling Fine & Wide Tooth Shower Comb Set\nJPNK\n{'Material': 'Plastic', 'Brand': 'JPNK', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy,Straight', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '12 x 3.1 x 0.7 inches; 5.61 Ounces'}\nI love these combs not only for myself but for my daughters hair. They are perfect for any hair length or texture as you have a set of 4 from wide tooth to fine tooth. They feel nice on the scalp and glide through hair easily. These are a great deal for 4 of these!\nGreat detangler combs\nMagnesium Serum For Kids - All Natural Rub for Kids and Babies, Toxic Free + Free Magnesium Chart PDF\nRaise Them Well\n{'Brand': 'Raise Them Well', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Unit Count': '2 Fl. Oz', 'Flavor': 'Unflavored', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.41 x 1.5 x 1.5 inches; 3.2 Ounces', 'UPC': '853647007044', 'Manufacturer': 'Raise Them Well'}\nUnfortunately I didn't notice much different with this spray. I think it smells nice and it a great idea to calm kiddos but I fine essential oil rollers on the bottom of the feet to have more contact with the skin making them more effective.\nDidn't notice any difference\nPick & Pick (Gentle/metal allergy free material)\nMIND UP\n{'Package Dimensions': '7 x 1.2 x 0.5 inches; 0.63 Ounces'}\nI was hopeful for this pick but disappointed. First off, it's a super flimsy and you can't use much pressure when pressing against teeth. Also, the pointed end that is supposed to clear put any food from between the teeth isn't pointed enough so you can't really get in there all the way. Last, because you cannot put enough pressure to scrape off gunk, it becomes useless.\nWay to flimsy\n6 Pack Soft Headband BEoffer Coral Fleece Women Makeup Spa Head Bands Turban Fashion Bow Bowknot Hairlace Headwear Wash Face Hair Holder Elastic Top Knot Bandage Girl Baby Hair Accessories 6 Colors\nBEoffer\n{'Age Range (Description)': 'Baby', 'Material': 'Elastic', 'Fabric Type': 'Fleece', 'Number of Items': '6', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Face Makeup', 'Product Dimensions': '7.28 x 1.97 x 0.67 inches; 1.16 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'BH-002', 'UPC': '799899729252'}\nThese super cute headbands are perfect for washing you face at the end of the night, making sure all the hair stays out for your face, and when I am applying my sunscreen in the morning so it doesn't get in my hair. They are super soft and come in a variety of colors!!!\nPerfect for washing face\nHairdresser Scissors Set Hair Thinning Scissors Hairdressing Shears Set with Wipe Cloth,Grinding card, Hair Razor Comb, Clips, Upgraded Professional Haircut Set black\nLyeiaa\n['All-in-One Hair Cutting Kit :1 x Hair Scissor,1 x Grinding card,1 x Hair Razor Comb, 1 x Cleaning Cloth, 1 x Comb, 2 x Hairpin clips , 1 x Neck Duster.

I cut my kids and husband's hair and this is everything you will need! Comes in a nifty little case that holds it all together. The cape is perfect for minimizing hairs everywhere. The scissors and thinning sheers are super sharp and use with minimal effort. So far this is the best kit I am using and would recommend to anyone.\nAll in one kit\nWinky Lux Double Matte Whip 24-Hour Waterproof Lipstick, Liquid Wet Lipstick for Long-Lasting Matte Lip Color, Hydrating Makeup with Vanilla and Avocado Oil to Lock in Moisture, 0.14 Oz, Cookie\nWinky Lux\n{'Brand': 'Winky Lux', 'Color': 'Cookie', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Finish Type': 'Matte', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '0.65 x 0.65 x 4.28 inches; 0.14 Ounces', 'UPC': '859346006968'}\nThis pretty color goes on wet and dries down to a very pretty medium brown.
