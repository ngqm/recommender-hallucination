  "reference_summary": "Growom Garden Hose Nozzle 4 Adjustable Spray Patterns Garden Sprayer Heavy Duty Metal Hose Nozzle with 3 Washers for Gardening, Car Washing, Pet Bathing and General Cleaning\nGrowom\n{'Brand': 'Growom', 'Finish Type': 'Polished', 'Material': 'Heavy,Metal', 'Handle Type': 'Lever', 'Package Dimensions': '8.3 x 4.6 x 1.7 inches; 1.15 Pounds'}\nThis nozzle is super built to last. It\u2019s rather heavy but I know it will withstand the much abuse. My only worry is we have hard water and sometimes that eats away at our nozzles over time. Great product that will last though!\nSuper heavy duty\nThe Beachwaver Co. Dual Voltage, S1, White\n{'Product Benefits': 'This ceramic, rotating curling iron provides easy, quality waves in minutes!', 'Shape': 'Barrel', 'Brand': 'The Beachwaver Co.', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Material': 'Ceramic', 'Product Dimensions': '15.75 x 1.75 x 2 inches; 14.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': '1', 'UPC': '817741020613', 'Manufacturer': 'AmazonUs/SB10T', 'Country of Origin': 'China'}\nFirst off, I know it pricey for a curling iron but it actually does the trick and is pretty cool. You clip your hair in the bottom little clipper and I prefer the low speed and it winds your hair for you up the wand! It gets nice and hot and curls did stay well after hrs or wear in semi humid weather. Definitely takes a little getting use to but it\u2019s pretty cool. You do need to take slightly smaller sections of hair to curl so the clipper can hold it but I really enjoyed using this!\nI was skeptical but this is super amazing\nJPNK 4PCS Anti-Static Detangling Fine & Wide Tooth Shower Comb Set\nJPNK\n{'Material': 'Plastic', 'Brand': 'JPNK', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy,Straight', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '12 x 3.1 x 0.7 inches; 5.61 Ounces'}\nI love these combs not only for myself but for my daughters hair. They are perfect for any hair length or texture as you have a set of 4 from wide tooth to fine tooth. They feel nice on the scalp and glide through hair easily. These are a great deal for 4 of these!\nGreat detangler combs\nMagnesium Serum For Kids - All Natural Rub for Kids and Babies, Toxic Free + Free Magnesium Chart PDF\nRaise Them Well\n{'Brand': 'Raise Them Well', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Unit Count': '2 Fl.
