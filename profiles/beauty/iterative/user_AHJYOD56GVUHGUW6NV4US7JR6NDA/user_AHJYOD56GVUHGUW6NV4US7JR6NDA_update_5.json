He has to wear a lot of pancake makeup that is kind of hard to remove.  These are so much better than regular makeup wipes because of the texture and strength.  He can use a dry one first off to wipe away a lot of it then another one with make up remover to clean off the rest.  Afterwards,  he can throw them out instead of trying to wash a dirty washcloth every time.\nReview Title: Good for makeup removal\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Because of his sensory issues,  he hates the ear loops on his mask that he wears to school.  These are super comfortable and the mask loops can be moved to the side buttons.  I was a little concerned that he would get hot wearing a hat all day, but they are very lightweight and breathable.\nVery comfortable\nImplantClean Dental Implant Toothbrush - for implants, bridges, fixed dentures, and gums - SOFT Bristles\nIMPLANT & PERIO CARE\n{'Brand': 'IMPLANT & PERIO CARE', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Item Firmness Description': 'Soft', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count'}\nIt fell apart after a few uses\nPoor quality\nHair Scrunchies for Girls Hair Ties 7PCS Candy Color Hair Accessories Luminous Hair Scrunchies Bands Soft Elastic Scrunchies Satin Soft Hair Scruchy Natural Glow Only in the Dark Night Hair Accessories for Women and Girls\nDOTKV\n{'Color': 'Yellow,Orange,Blue,Green,White,Purple', 'Material': 'Satin', 'Item Form': 'Scrunchie', 'Brand': 'DOTKV', 'Hair Type': 'All, normal', 'Package Dimensions': '6.1 x 4.33 x 1.97 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '194852280144'}\nI bought these for my daughter who loves cosmic bowling.

They look nice in regular light, but really shine under a black light.\nGlows under a blacklight\n3 Pieces Detangling Hairbrush Unicorn Plastic Massage Comb Paddle Hair Brush Unicorn Hair Detangler Brush for Women Girls Curly Straight Long Thin Soft Natural or Short Hair (Vivid Pattern)\nPatelai\n{'Brand': 'Patelai', 'Shape': 'Oblong', 'Handle Material': 'Plastic', 'Special Feature': 'Detangling, Long lasting', 'Product Benefits': 'Detangle', 'Package Dimensions': '10.4 x 4.7 x 1.8 inches; 9.59 Ounces'}\nI bought these for my daughter who loves unicorns.  She is also on the autism spectrum so she has a lot of sensory problems.  Brushing her hair can be a challenge because she hates when it pulls her hair.  These are a great idea because they are so comfortable.  The plastic bristles massage her scalp and the paddle shape smooths her hair without snagging.  Plus she loves the cool unicorn designs.\nSuper cute\nWeiwey Extra Thick Dry Wipe, 100% Cotton, Unscented Cotton Tissues for Sensitive Skin (1 PACK-80PCS)\nweiwey\n{'Brand': 'weiwey', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Sheet Count': '80', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Cleansing', 'Material': 'Cotton', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '7.08 x 4.41 x 2.36 inches; 4.8 Ounces', 'UPC': '763347936332'}\nI bought these for a friend who does theater.
