First of all, it smells amazing. It smells very natural, like greenery and botanicals. This mask has ever so slightly some grit to it. It isn't the scrubbiest of exfoliating masks. The clay doesn't over dry your skin. I do not feel like my skin is tight feeling after washing my face. Overall, it feels very luxurious and relaxing. Great weekly skin treat to unwind at home. Highly recommended.\nReview Title: Great clay facial mask\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

They work very well, and lasts through multiple uses. I have natural nails, and I I find that the two different grits work well with smoothing edges and removing sharp corners of nails after trimming.

Overall, it's a very high quality product and I would highly recommend it, especially for professional use.\nGreat nail files\nCONBOLA Make Up Organizer 5 in 1 Dresser Organizer,Portable for Lipstick and Jewlry ,Makeup Organizer and Temporary Makeup Brush Holder,Multi-purpose for Girl Women.36.6cm18cm.(Blue)\nCONBOLA\n{'Material': 'Silicone', 'Special Feature': 'Portable', 'Color': 'Blue', 'Brand': 'CONBOLA', 'Mounting Type': 'Tabletop Mount', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Package Type': 'Standard Packaging', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '15.08 x 7.44 x 1.5 inches; 1.65 Pounds', 'UPC': '750226660013'}\nThis is great for minimalists or teenagers.
