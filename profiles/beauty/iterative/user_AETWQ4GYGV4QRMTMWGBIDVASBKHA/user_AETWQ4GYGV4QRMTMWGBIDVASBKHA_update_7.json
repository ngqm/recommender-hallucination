Looks professional, and comfortable for all day wear. The band itself is kinda fragile so you have to be careful not to bend it too far apart or it might snap. Overall, it's a good product.\nEasy hair styling accessory\nPINROSE Perfumes Bold Soul - Eau de Parfum Petals (Fragrance Towelettes) - Vegan, Cruelty-free, and Hypoallergenic Scent with Essential Oils - Notes of Crushed Blackberry, Tuberose, Vanilla, Cinnamon and Patchouli\nPINROSE\n{'Brand': 'PINROSE', 'Item Form': 'Spray', 'Scent': 'Bold Soul', 'Special Feature': 'Portable', 'Fragrance Concentration': 'eau_de_parfum', 'Package Dimensions': '3 x 3 x 0.05 inches; 0.49 Ounces', 'UPC': '850016075529'}\nThese are perfect for on the go and travel.

It smells wonderfully first if all. The texture is very thin and lightweight. It sinks into skin quickly. I do recommend wearing sunscreen during the day time as it can make your newer skin photosensitive.

They work very well, and lasts through multiple uses. I have natural nails, and I I find that the two different grits work well with smoothing edges and removing sharp corners of nails after trimming. I was replacing my old files after every use and the sand was flaking off and getting all over my floors. I did not have any problems with these doing that. Overall, it's a very high quality product and I would highly recommend it, especially for professional use.\nGreat nail files\nCONBOLA Make Up Organizer 5 in 1 Dresser Organizer,Portable for Lipstick and Jewlry ,Makeup Organizer and Temporary Makeup Brush Holder,Multi-purpose for Girl Women.36.6cm18cm.(Blue)\nCONBOLA\n{'Material': 'Silicone', 'Special Feature': 'Portable', 'Color': 'Blue', 'Brand': 'CONBOLA', 'Mounting Type': 'Tabletop Mount', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Package Type': 'Standard Packaging', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '15.08 x 7.44 x 1.5 inches; 1.65 Pounds', 'UPC': '750226660013'}\nThis is great for minimalists or teenagers.
