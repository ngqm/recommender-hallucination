It smells wonderfully first if all. The texture is very thin and lightweight. It sinks into skin quickly. I do recommend wearing sunscreen during the day time as it can make your newer skin photosensitive. Overall, it's a very easy way to apply vitamin C to brighten skin and even skin tone.\nReview Title: Great for brightening the skin\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
