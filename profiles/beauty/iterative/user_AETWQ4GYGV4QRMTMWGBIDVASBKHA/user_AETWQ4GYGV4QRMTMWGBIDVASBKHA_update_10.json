It does absorb immediately and does not smell strong like many vitamin C serums. It smells very light and fresh with the slightest citrus scent to it. Great to use for both day and night. Does not contain a sunscreen, so make sure to use one during the day. Overall, highly recommended.\nReview Title: More of an oil\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

It smells wonderfully first if all. The texture is very thin and lightweight. It sinks into skin quickly. I do recommend wearing sunscreen during the day time as it can make your newer skin photosensitive. Overall, it's a very easy way to apply vitamin C to brighten skin and even skin tone.\nGreat for brightening the skin\nNail Files 16 Pcs, Double Sided Emery Board Manicure Tools for Filing Natural Gel and Acrylic Nails for Home and Salon Use\nKeiby Citom\n{'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'Keiby Citom', 'Grit Number': '100', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '7.8 x 5.08 x 0.59 inches; 5.29 Ounces', 'UPC': '742025065137', 'Manufacturer': 'YHIT'}\nThese are very good nail files. They work very well, and lasts through multiple uses. I have natural nails, and I I find that the two different grits work well with smoothing edges and removing sharp corners of nails after trimming. I was replacing my old files after every use and the sand was flaking off and getting all over my floors. I did not have any problems with these doing that. Overall, it's a very high quality product and I would highly recommend it, especially for professional use.\nGreat nail files\nCONBOLA Make Up Organizer 5 in 1 Dresser Organizer,Portable for Lipstick and Jewlry ,Makeup Organizer and Temporary Makeup Brush Holder,Multi-purpose for Girl Women.36.6cm18cm.(Blue)\nCONBOLA\n{'Material': 'Silicone', 'Special Feature': 'Portable', 'Color': 'Blue', 'Brand': 'CONBOLA', 'Mounting Type': 'Tabletop Mount', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Package Type': 'Standard Packaging', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '15.08 x 7.44 x 1.5 inches; 1.65 Pounds', 'UPC': '750226660013'}\nThis is great for minimalists or teenagers.

First of all, it smells amazing. It smells very natural, like greenery and botanicals. This mask has ever so slightly some grit to it. It isn't the scrubbiest of exfoliating masks. The clay doesn't over dry your skin. I do not feel like my skin is tight feeling after washing my face. Overall, it feels very luxurious and relaxing. Great weekly skin treat to unwind at home. Highly recommended.\nGreat clay facial mask\nGLOW BOOSTER SERUM\nCatrice\n{'Skin Type': 'All', 'Product Benefits': 'Glow', 'Scent': 'Pineapple', 'Brand': 'Catrice', 'Item Form': 'Serum'}\nThis is more of an oil than a serum in my opinion.
