I love it so much that I may have replaced my Avon Anew. This one costs quite a bit, but the tiny travel sized tube will last a while. This is a VERY watery product, but that's great for 2 reasons: 1) a little bit goes a long way, and 2) it absorbs really well into the skin. The best way that I have found to apply this is to tap the lotion onto my fingertips, then just sort of dab it onto my face before rubbing it in. This saves on product and keeps me from spilling any from the tube. Like I said, this has a very &#34;wet&#34; texture, so you won't have to use much. The price is way up there but, compared to using a lot of a cheaper product (that doesn't work as well), or a same-priced product (but using more of it), this is the best value overall. I'm going to see how long the travel-sized tube lasts while I save up for a larger size. Since this is something I have to save for, I really wish there were more size/price choices. Still, I love this and I think my skin is getting addicted to it!\nReview Title: Pretty Pricey But Worth It!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
