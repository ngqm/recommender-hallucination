It's also thicker than I expected - almost like a whipped lotion. Before I used it on my hair, I rubbed some into the back of my hand to see if I'd have any kind of skin reaction. I did not. What I noticed is that once this absorbed, there was absolutely zero residue. I don't know what that means, but I was just curious. When I rub in other types of hair masks & treatments, I always get a sense of something left that I need to wash off. When I used this on my hair in the shower, I left it on for about<br />2 to 3 minutes after I had massaged it in according to the directions. (I have to stop and mention that I was also using the Daelong shampoo and conditioner set beforehand. That might be why I got my results.) This rinses out extremely well. My hair felt conditioned but with a lot less of the residual slip from other conditioners. That kind of worried me. I like to know that a treatment is doing something & the only way to tell until you've used it for a while is by the way your hair feels. Where I became so happy with this is an hour after rinsing it out. I have coarse and &#34;nappy&#34; natural African American hair. My hair tends to be extremely dry - especially after washing. A good conditioner keeps things in check until I can apply my leave-in products (oils, butters, sprays, etc.), but this time, my hair stayed soft and easy to comb through for at least 2 hours. It might have been longer, but I went ahead and applied my usual leave-ins. Still, I know that this did soften my hair (the day after, my hair is retaining softness without any more leave-in applications) without making it feel fragile. With they type of hair I have, I have to worry about breakage. I realize that I have probably been clogging up my scalp by over-doing it with the oils and butters. I like that I haven't had to use more of them for my hair to feel manageable. As a test, I'm going to try easing up on using so much leave-in stuff while I continue to use this.I think these guys are on to something here. I will have to come back and update this review as I use this for a while but, for now, I love the way this makes my hair feel, even after just one treatment. Normally, I only fully wash my hair once every four weeks or so. I will do a co-wash about every other week to keep it clean without stripping it. While I am testing this out, I plan to use it at least once a week as my co-wash. Like I said, I am also using the shampoo & conditioner of this brand. That might be a big part of why this worked so well for me, but I think that this would work just as good on its own. By the way, I'm going to alter my washing regimen for a while to use the shampoo and conditioner at least every other week. I almost forgot to mention the other thing I was concerned about: the label says that this makes the hair &#34;straight and silky&#34; - which is exactly what I, personally, DO NOT want. I love my texture and want to keep it. My texture is the kind that is prone to slow growth (because of breakage) so... I'm not worried about losing my naps. I'm thinking that this aids in stopping breakage more than anything.<br />I got this at a very steep discount.\nReview Title: Like the way it makes my natural & nappy hair feel\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I love it so much that I may have replaced my Avon Anew. This one costs quite a bit, but the tiny travel sized tube will last a while. This is a VERY watery product, but that's great for 2 reasons: 1) a little bit goes a long way, and 2) it absorbs really well into the skin. The best way that I have found to apply this is to tap the lotion onto my fingertips, then just sort of dab it onto my face before rubbing it in. This saves on product and keeps me from spilling any from the tube. Like I said, this has a very &#34;wet&#34; texture, so you won't have to use much. The price is way up there but, compared to using a lot of a cheaper product (that doesn't work as well), or a same-priced product (but using more of it), this is the best value overall. I'm going to see how long the travel-sized tube lasts while I save up for a larger size. Since this is something I have to save for, I really wish there were more size/price choices. Still, I love this and I think my skin is getting addicted to it!\nPretty Pricey But Worth It!\nEvery Beauty All in One Foot Smoother, 2 different smoothing surfaces\nEvery Beauty\n['Dermabrasion coatings removes rough dry cracked skin and calluses from feet.

The reason I can't give it a full  5-star review is because of the price. There is a very similar product that is way cheaper and works as well or better than this one. I found Sole Magic online for about a dollar cheaper than this one. In superstores and drug stores, I found it for a couple of bucks. This one does work and I can't say one negative thing about it - other than the price. When a pedicure is around $20 (even here in Alaska where prices are high), and I can do upkeep with a similar foot smoothing pad for about $2, I just can't see paying almost $9 for this one. If other customers do want this one, I can tell you that it works, the shape is nice and makes it easy to grip and use with either hand. It's also nice that their is a coarse side and a finer side. One thing that I disagree with is that you could use this anywhere but on your feet. I don't know what would have to be going on with anyone's elbows or knees for them to use this on! All in all, a great product, but a bit overpriced when there are cheaper alternative items that are just as effective.\nGreat item, but there are more affordable alternatives\nHair Growth Treatment Cream - Revitalizes Dry, Damaged Hair - Fast & Promotes Hair Long Healthy - Anti-Hair Loss\u2013Moisturizing, Detangling & Lightweight Synthesis with Vitamin B5, Hydrolyzed Protein\n{'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Hair Type': 'Dry', 'Package Dimensions': '4.3 x 4.2 x 3.6 inches; 1.25 Pounds'}\nThis has the very, very *very* faintest plant-like scent (which is clean and pleasing).
