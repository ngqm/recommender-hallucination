I buy it cause my lips, but it works great in skin too. But if you use it before makeup, your skin going to look oily, so I recomend to use a opaque powder or just use it at night before sleep. If your skin is oily maybe is not good for you neither cause this product made my skin too oily after use it and my skin is dry.  Plus, I used it to repare my old mascara, I had to use a little more product that I expected, but it works.\nI recomend to use it if you have a dry skin only.\nMetallic Henna Tattoos - Over 120 Mandala Mehndi Designs Gold Silver Henna Tattoo 10 Sheets\n{'Package Dimensions': '8.27 x 5.87 x 0.24 inches; 2.5 Ounces'}\nBeautiful variety of tattoes, juat last longer two days for me.
