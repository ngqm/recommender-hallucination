They are sturdy and come in multiple colors. They are pointed uniformly and seem to hold my hair well. Only issue I had was that they seem to grab my hair more than the drugstore brand ones that I am used to. Overall I think that more hair will get pulled out with these pins than my old ones.\nReview Title: Mixed feelings\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
