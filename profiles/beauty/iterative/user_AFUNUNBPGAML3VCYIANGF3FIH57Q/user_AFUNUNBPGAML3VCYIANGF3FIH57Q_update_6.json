HIGHLY MOISTURIZING - Glycerin is a humectant, attracting moisture and draws it deep into your skin to keep it hydrated. With over 25% glycerin in our soap, our soap moisturizes the skin with a rich lather that rinses cleanly away leaving the skin silky smooth. GREAT FOR FACE & BODY \u2013 When used as a face wash, glycerin soap will remove the excess oil from the skin to unclog pores. Unlike regular soaps, which dry out the skin and make it feel tight and flaky, our glycerin soaps keep the skin hydrated after use. HIGH QUALITY INGREDIENTS \u2013 Paraben Free, Cruelty Free and Vegan. Made in California, USA. GREAT FOR GIFTS - Each 5.8 oz. bar is shrink-wrapped and great for gift giving.\"]\nAverage Rating: 5.0\nProduct Details: {'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Brand': 'Primal Elements', 'Scent': 'Coffee', 'Material Feature': 'Cruelty Free, Vegan', 'Package Dimensions': '5.59 x 2.99 x 0.51 inches; 3.53 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'SWCAFE', 'UPC': '640986102925'}\nReview Text: Had bad experiences with glycerin soap in the past so was wary when trying this brand.
