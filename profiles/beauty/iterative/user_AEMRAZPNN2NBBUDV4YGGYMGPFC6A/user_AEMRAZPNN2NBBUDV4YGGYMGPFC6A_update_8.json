  "reference_summary": "UV Light for Nails,LKE Curing Lamp for Gel Nail Polish 54W UV Led Light Gel Nail Starter Kit Nail Dryer Accessories\nLKE\n{'Brand': 'LKE', 'Light Source Type': 'LED', 'Number of Light Sources': '2', 'Wattage': '54 watts', 'Control Method': 'App', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '9.45 x 8.7 x 5.08 inches; 2 Pounds', 'Batteries': '1 Lithium Ion batteries required.'}\nThis lamp is super easy to use. After installing the batteries you just turn it on the length of time that you need and you are ready to go. I do dip powder nails, not gel... but everytime I have been to the salon, they have always used a lamp to help cure the top layer faster. This worked exactly the same. Anything that saves me time is a great thing! I would recommend this. the price is great and the product is even better!\nEasy to use\nUMICKOO Hair Straightener,Upgraded Flat Iron for Hair With Real-Time Temperature Display And Adjustable Temperature,1 Inch (Rose Gold)\nUMIKOO\n{'Package Dimensions': '14.48 x 4.61 x 2.32 inches; 1.79 Pounds', 'UPC': '692232543075'}\nI really like this straightener for the most part. I'm not sure how... but my hair (and my daughters) seems to come from the wand so much shinier. It has an adjustable temperature setting, it does lock closed. It even comes with a bag to keep it in and a glove to wear while you are using it... which is where I have my problem. The way it opens leaves my hand too close to the heat which results in easily getting burned. Which isn't a problem if you wear the glove... but being honest, I'm not going to use a heat shield glove every day to do my hair. I only use one of these **sometimes** when I am using a curling wand. So for me that is a huge con. It also comes with two hair clips to help separate the sections of your hair. For the price... Its a great wand. You will get used to where you need to hold your hand.\npros and cons\nMountain Falls 100% Acetone Nail Polish Remover for Natural Nails, Maximum Strength, 8 Fluid Ounce\nMountain Falls\n[\"Don't wait for your next spa day to treat yourself. Mountain Falls 100% Acetone Nail Polish Remover has been carefully formulated to quickly and gently care for your nails. The 100% acetone formula helps remove even the toughest polish, glitter, tips and artificial nails.

This did not disappoint. Great product and a great price. I will use this again!\nVery strong\n6 Pcs Pink Baby Girl Hair Bow Clips Set, Alligator Clip Hair Accessories with Gift Box, Back to School Dress\nAmacle\n{'Brand': 'Amacle', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Child', 'Unit Count': '6.00 Count', 'Number of Pieces': '6', 'Package Dimensions': '6 x 6 x 2 inches; 4.8 Ounces', 'UPC': '743811744526'}\nMy daughter is 4 and FINALLY has hair long enough to wear big bows. We have always used the Wee one bows and they are great but they always slip out of her fine hair. The quality of the bow material isn't as good as the wee ones but they are still great. BUT the clip is what makes all of the difference in these bows. They are little teeth so they stay in her hair like the others do not. plus the price. I'm used to paying $13 for one bow... so I am obviously thrilled with these bows!\nLOVE\nNail Files and Buffers, Teenitor 16PCS Professional Nail Manicure Tool for Acrylic Nails, 100/180 and 120/240 Grits Emery Boards 120 Grits Nail Buffer Block for Shaping and Buffing Nails\nTeenitor\n{'Package Dimensions': '7 x 6 x 1 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nMy experience with these buffer files is only for using them with dip powder nails. I always do my own and have been buying buffer blocks from the local beauty supply store for years for .99 cents. When I saw these, I thought that it would be perfect for me. I was wrong. These blocks do absolutely nothing. I tried to use them all. There is very little grit on the blocks at all so it was a task trying to smooth the surface of my nail. If you are needing them for something else they may work for you. But I wouldn't advice them if you are getting them to do your own nails.\nTerrible for buffing dip powder\nKOMOREBI Snap Hair Clips 36Pcs with Hair Ties 50Pcs Beauty Candy Color Metal Hair Clips for Women girls Kids Toddlers\nKOMOREBI\n{'Brand': 'KOMOREBI', 'Hair Type': 'Chemically-treated-hair', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Child', 'Material': 'Metal', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '6.3 x 3.8 x 1.3 inches; 3.2 Ounces', 'UPC': '783214149214'}\nI ordered these mostly for the \"clippers!\" My daughter has thin/fine hair that is hard to stay back at times... and she uses the clippers at school to keep her hair out of her eyes. These work great and for the amount, you can alot more than going to your local store and buying them. The ponys are soft and also hold her hair up great. I would recommend them!\n5 stars\nCancun Collection Cacao Body Bronzer \u2013 Superfood Infused Sunless Tanning Lotion with Cacao 5.1 fl.oz, For Instant Tan in 1 minute.\nCancun Collection\n{'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'Cancun Collection', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Material Feature': 'Antioxidant', 'Package Dimensions': '5.1 x 4.6 x 1 inches; 14.39 Ounces', 'UPC': '659436986640'}\nThis lotion is amazing... However the biggest thing to remember when using this product is that a little goes a LONG way. I at first got alot to apply to my leg and I don't think that I could have rubbed that much into my entire body. However, this is a really great product and it smells AMAZING! Just like what you would want to smell at the beach! It really does give you an instant tan.\n5 stars\n100pcs Premium Quality Hair Clips, 20 Glossy Colors Snap Hair Clips, 2 Inch Hair Barrettes with Perfect Grip, Durable Colorful Hair Clips with Smooth Edges for Kids, Girls, Women\nFagaci\n{'Brand': 'Fagaci', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Color': 'Assorted', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material': 'Alloy Steel', 'Package Dimensions': '4.7 x 3.1 x 1 inches; 4.8 Ounces'}\nThese clippers are amazing.
