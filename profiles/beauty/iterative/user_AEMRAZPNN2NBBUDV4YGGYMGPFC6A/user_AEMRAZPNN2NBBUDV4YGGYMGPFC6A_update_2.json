I'm not sure how... but my hair (and my daughters) seems to come from the wand so much shinier. It has an adjustable temperature setting, it does lock closed. It even comes with a bag to keep it in and a glove to wear while you are using it... which is where I have my problem. The way it opens leaves my hand too close to the heat which results in easily getting burned. Which isn't a problem if you wear the glove... but being honest, I'm not going to use a heat shield glove every day to do my hair. I only use one of these **sometimes** when I am using a curling wand. So for me that is a huge con. It also comes with two hair clips to help separate the sections of your hair. For the price... Its a great wand. You will get used to where you need to hold your hand.\nReview Title: pros and cons\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "UV Light for Nails,LKE Curing Lamp for Gel Nail Polish 54W UV Led Light Gel Nail Starter Kit Nail Dryer Accessories\nLKE\n{'Brand': 'LKE', 'Light Source Type': 'LED', 'Number of Light Sources': '2', 'Wattage': '54 watts', 'Control Method': 'App', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '9.45 x 8.7 x 5.08 inches; 2 Pounds', 'Batteries': '1 Lithium Ion batteries required.'}\nThis lamp is super easy to use. After installing the batteries you just turn it on the length of time that you need and you are ready to go. I do dip powder nails, not gel... but everytime I have been to the salon, they have always used a lamp to help cure the top layer faster. This worked exactly the same. Anything that saves me time is a great thing! I would recommend this. the price is great and the product is even better!\nEasy to use\nUMICKOO Hair Straightener,Upgraded Flat Iron for Hair With Real-Time Temperature Display And Adjustable Temperature,1 Inch (Rose Gold)\nUMIKOO\n{'Package Dimensions': '14.48 x 4.61 x 2.32 inches; 1.79 Pounds', 'UPC': '692232543075'}\nI really like this straightener for the most part.
