It has everything you need to get started, except for colors. Be sure to purchase a color or colors as well so you have everything you need. The lamp works great and all products arrived in mint condition and worked as described. Color usually stays on for 2 weeks, if you don't pick at your nails.<br /><br />I previously purchased a larger kit that I liked more than this kit (here): Red Carpet Manicure Pro 45 LED Gel Nail Polish Kit Soak Off Starter Package https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00662Z24A/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_tai_MsVmFbXQFB0CA<br /><br />The reason I liked it more is because that kit came with more products and the lamp feels sturdier: 1 color, nail files and \u201cerase\u201d tube (what you use to remove the gel nail polish).<br /><br />However, if you\u2019re on a budget - this kit is probably the way to go. AND you can pick which color or colors you\u2019d like (separately).<br /><br />Even though at first glance this lamp seemed less nice, it works just as well.  My nails were fully cured within 45 seconds. After using it a few times and getting the hang of it, I\u2019m usually able to do all my nails within 20-30 minutes. Easy to do while watching TV or listening to the radio. :)\nReview Title: Cost-Effective Starter Kit for At-Home Gel Nails\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
