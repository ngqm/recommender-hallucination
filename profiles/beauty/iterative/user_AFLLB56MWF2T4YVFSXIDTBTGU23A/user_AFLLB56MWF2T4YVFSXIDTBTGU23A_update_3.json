My biggest issue was with the glue. I had the hardest time trying to get my lashes to actually stick to the pad. It took a long time, and even then I had some that just refused to stay. All in all it probably took me an hour to do one eye (I\u2019d strongly recommend doing each eye individually if you\u2019re doing them yourself). The other recommendation I\u2019d give is to watch some YouTube tutorials before starting. The instructions are bad, but they aren\u2019t great and there are a lot of videos out there to help ensure you\u2019re doing things correctly. Overall, my lashes were lifted and I\u2019m fairly happy with the result. It wasn\u2019t as dramatic as I hoped (you can see that with mascara my lifted lashes look the same as my curled lashes) but I do think it looks nice. If you\u2019re looking for a cheap diy alternative to the salon I\u2019d say try it out. But if you have the time and money, I\u2019d opt for a professional service instead.\nReview Title: Not Perfect, But It Works\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Red Carpet Manicure Starter Kits\n{'Color': 'RCM Essentials Starter Kit', 'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'RC Red Carpet Manicure', 'Finish Type': 'Glossy', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'UPC': '817248203854', 'Manufacturer': 'RC Red Carpet Manicure/ Zupishi'}\nThis kit is the most basic starter kit for the Red Carpet gel nails. It has everything you need to get started, except for colors. Be sure to purchase a color or colors as well so you have everything you need. The lamp works great and all products arrived in mint condition and worked as described. Color usually stays on for 2 weeks, if you don't pick at your nails.<br /><br />I previously purchased a larger kit that I liked more than this kit (here): Red Carpet Manicure Pro 45 LED Gel Nail Polish Kit Soak Off Starter Package https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00662Z24A/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_tai_MsVmFbXQFB0CA<br /><br />The reason I liked it more is because that kit came with more products and the lamp feels sturdier: 1 color, nail files and \u201cerase\u201d tube (what you use to remove the gel nail polish).<br /><br />However, if you\u2019re on a budget - this kit is probably the way to go. AND you can pick which color or colors you\u2019d like (separately).<br /><br />Even though at first glance this lamp seemed less nice, it works just as well.  My nails were fully cured within 45 seconds. After using it a few times and getting the hang of it, I\u2019m usually able to do all my nails within 20-30 minutes. Easy to do while watching TV or listening to the radio. :)\nCost-Effective Starter Kit for At-Home Gel Nails\nEmpty Brown Glass Spray Bottles2-Pack, Refillable 16 oz Containers for Essential Oils, Cleaning Products, Aromatherapy, Misting Plants, or Cooking - Reliable Sprayer with Mist and Stream Settings\nCherry\n{'Brand': 'Cherry', 'Material': 'Glass', 'Capacity': '16 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Product Care Instructions': 'Hand Wash Only', 'Package Dimensions': '9.09 x 6.46 x 3.35 inches; 4.94 Ounces', 'UPC': '791523234187'}\nI saw some reviews commenting that the nozzle moves even when the cap is screwed on. This is true, but I personally don\u2019t think that\u2019s a reason not to get this set. I do think it\u2019s worth noting that you\u2019re getting a REALLY nice quality glass bottle in a 2-pack for under $15. Personally, the nozzle moving didn\u2019t bother me at all and I am really pleased with the quality. Love the amber glass, because as the description mentions - this makes it safe to mix up your own concoctions with essential oils and it doesn\u2019t ruin the oils. I make my own cleaning solutions and these have worked like a charm.\nSolid Value for the Price\nLash Lift Kit -Buqikma Eyelash Perm Kit Lash Curling Set Semi-Permanent Lifting Perming Wave for Salon and Personal Use (Glue Upgraded Version)\nBuqikma\n{'Brand': 'Buqikma', 'Included Components': 'Eyelash Perm Kit', 'Operation Mode': 'Manual', 'Package Dimensions': '6.5 x 4.7 x 0.9 inches; 3.99 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Buqikma'}\nThis product is not without its flaws, but if you are patient enough it will work.
