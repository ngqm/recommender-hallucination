I've been using these after I workout and don't have time to do a full shower before running to the next task. I find these are effective at removing any B.O. and \"freshen up\" after a sweaty workout. The scent is light. I LOVE that it is light and not overpowering. I tried the Dove wipes before these ones (https://www.amazon.com/Fresh-Deodorant-Wipes-Cucumber-Green/dp/B07V399T26/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=cucumber+body+wipes&qid=1606102057&sr=8-3) and YUCK the smell was so overpowering, fake, and gross. I'm happy I found these. The Dove wipes were also SOAKED in liquid, whereas these are lightly moistened. Much better!! The size is right...I am able to do my full body from neck to feet with 1 wipe.<br /><br />The individual packaging makes these really easy to toss into a bag or a pocket and go. I keep a couple in my car for if I need one and forgot to pack one with me. Extra bonus points that this wipe is biodegradable!<br /><br />Overall, really nice, high-quality wipe!\nReview Title: Effective Wipe, Scent is Clean & Lightweight, & BIODEGRADABLE!!!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Red Carpet Manicure Starter Kits\n{'Color': 'RCM Essentials Starter Kit', 'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'RC Red Carpet Manicure', 'Finish Type': 'Glossy', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'UPC': '817248203854', 'Manufacturer': 'RC Red Carpet Manicure/ Zupishi'}\nThis kit is the most basic starter kit for the Red Carpet gel nails. It has everything you need to get started, except for colors. Be sure to purchase a color or colors as well so you have everything you need. The lamp works great and all products arrived in mint condition and worked as described. Color usually stays on for 2 weeks, if you don't pick at your nails.<br /><br />I previously purchased a larger kit that I liked more than this kit (here): Red Carpet Manicure Pro 45 LED Gel Nail Polish Kit Soak Off Starter Package https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00662Z24A/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_tai_MsVmFbXQFB0CA<br /><br />The reason I liked it more is because that kit came with more products and the lamp feels sturdier: 1 color, nail files and \u201cerase\u201d tube (what you use to remove the gel nail polish).<br /><br />However, if you\u2019re on a budget - this kit is probably the way to go. AND you can pick which color or colors you\u2019d like (separately).<br /><br />Even though at first glance this lamp seemed less nice, it works just as well.  My nails were fully cured within 45 seconds. After using it a few times and getting the hang of it, I\u2019m usually able to do all my nails within 20-30 minutes. Easy to do while watching TV or listening to the radio. :)\nCost-Effective Starter Kit for At-Home Gel Nails\nEmpty Brown Glass Spray Bottles2-Pack, Refillable 16 oz Containers for Essential Oils, Cleaning Products, Aromatherapy, Misting Plants, or Cooking - Reliable Sprayer with Mist and Stream Settings\nCherry\n{'Brand': 'Cherry', 'Material': 'Glass', 'Capacity': '16 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Product Care Instructions': 'Hand Wash Only', 'Package Dimensions': '9.09 x 6.46 x 3.35 inches; 4.94 Ounces', 'UPC': '791523234187'}\nI saw some reviews commenting that the nozzle moves even when the cap is screwed on. This is true, but I personally don\u2019t think that\u2019s a reason not to get this set. I do think it\u2019s worth noting that you\u2019re getting a REALLY nice quality glass bottle in a 2-pack for under $15. Personally, the nozzle moving didn\u2019t bother me at all and I am really pleased with the quality. Love the amber glass, because as the description mentions - this makes it safe to mix up your own concoctions with essential oils and it doesn\u2019t ruin the oils. I make my own cleaning solutions and these have worked like a charm.\nSolid Value for the Price\nLash Lift Kit -Buqikma Eyelash Perm Kit Lash Curling Set Semi-Permanent Lifting Perming Wave for Salon and Personal Use (Glue Upgraded Version)\nBuqikma\n{'Brand': 'Buqikma', 'Included Components': 'Eyelash Perm Kit', 'Operation Mode': 'Manual', 'Package Dimensions': '6.5 x 4.7 x 0.9 inches; 3.99 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Buqikma'}\nThis product is not without its flaws, but if you are patient enough it will work. My biggest issue was with the glue. I had the hardest time trying to get my lashes to actually stick to the pad. It took a long time, and even then I had some that just refused to stay. All in all it probably took me an hour to do one eye (I\u2019d strongly recommend doing each eye individually if you\u2019re doing them yourself). The other recommendation I\u2019d give is to watch some YouTube tutorials before starting. The instructions are bad, but they aren\u2019t great and there are a lot of videos out there to help ensure you\u2019re doing things correctly. Overall, my lashes were lifted and I\u2019m fairly happy with the result. It wasn\u2019t as dramatic as I hoped (you can see that with mascara my lifted lashes look the same as my curled lashes) but I do think it looks nice. If you\u2019re looking for a cheap diy alternative to the salon I\u2019d say try it out. But if you have the time and money, I\u2019d opt for a professional service instead.\nNot Perfect, But It Works\nZeitun Natural Anti Cellulite Body Scrub - Organic Coffee Body Scrub Exfoliator With Robusta & Dead Sea Salt - Cinnamon, Ginger And Moisturizing Oils, 7 oz\nZeitun\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.57 x 5.91 x 8.27 inches; 7 Ounces'}\nI have a bit of a love/hate relationship with this scrub. What I LOVE about it is the delicious, robust coffee scent. It is STRONG and packs a powerful punch in the morning, which helps to wake me up. I also love the serious grit it has to it. The texture varies from fine grounds to courser grounds, with a higher ratio of course grounds. Each scrub feels like it's getting deep into my skin. I feel like I'm scrubbing off layers of dead skin, dirt, grime, etc. when I'm using this. My skin feels smoother and softer after I use this scrub. I apply lotion straight out of the shower and my body is soft as a cloud!<br /><br />What I sort of hate about this product is how messy it is. It just falls apart and gets everywhere. I included photos of what a hot mess my sink and shower look like after using it. Other scrubs I've used in the past have some agent that keeps them together to prevent it from going everywhere, but this doesn't. One I tried recently that I loved was JOON X MOON (https://www.amazon.com/Watermelon-Exfoliating-Moisturizing-Nourish-Essential/dp/B0876GX6MQ/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=moon+cube+body+scrub&qid=1600826357&sr=8-2), and that is in cube form to start, then breaks down to scrub as you rub it and use water.  It does an incredible job of exfoliating without making a mess of my small shower. If you're not into the cube thing, I also like stuff that B&BW makes and they sell it on Amazon. It's has a paste-like consistency and does a good job at making your skin feel soft like a baby! Here is a Bath & Body Works aromatherapy scrub - I loooove this one: https://www.amazon.com/Bath-Body-Works-AROMATHERAPY-Eucalyptus/dp/B005LZUP36/ref=sr_1_14?dchild=1&keywords=sugar+scrub&qid=1600826921&sr=8-14<br /><br />The other thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the packaging. I have a tiny shower, so it is impossible to take anything in there without getting wet. Every time I take this into the shower, I'm nervous the bag will get soaked and ruin it. There is a waxy coat applied to the bag, which helps protect it, but it still doesn't give me as much confidence as something like a glass jar or tin would. Ideally, the scrub wouldn't get soaked until I'm ready to use it. It has held up through 3 uses so far but I may transfer it into a mason jar and store it that way.<br /><br />The other thing that really bummed me out was that is stained my clothes!!! I towel dried after shower, put on moisturizer, then light gray leggings. There must have been a tiny amount of residule coffee scrub because it stained my leggings!!<br /><br />Overall, a decent scrub to try. Not my favorite scrub, since it stained my clothes and made my shower a mess.\nLove and Hate this Scrub\nMUSE & Co Gel Strip 30 (MC-015)\nMUSENCO\n{'Size': 'Large', 'Brand': 'MUSENCO', 'Style': 'French', 'Pattern': 'MC-015', 'Coverage': 'Full Well Tips', 'Product Dimensions': '1.57 x 0.39 x 4.33 inches; 0.32 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'MUSENCO'}\nLoving these nail stickers! They are surprisingly durable and have strong adhesion to the nail that stays put. The package comes with 2 alcohol wipes and a nail file to help prep the nail prior to application. I did my ring finger as an accent nail, then painted the rest of my nails. I love how the final look came out! When I went to apply, I started at the bottom of my nail then carefully pressed the sticker down. I filed off the rest of the sticker to get it a clean finish. The nail stickers are really big and I have short nails so I was actually able to do BOTH of my ring fingers with just 1 sticker -- awesome!! I had enough left after I filed the first one off that I flipped it and put it on my other ring finger. I'm pretty active and hard on my hands and these have surprised me with how well they stay on. They have stayed on through a full weekend of house chores -- multiple hand dish-washings, laundry, cleaning, etc and have gone strong through the week.\nDurable, Strong Adhesive.
