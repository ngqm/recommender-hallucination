We do have an Aloe plant in our home.  The bonus is the vitamin E and Hyaluronic Acid (improves skin elasticity). This works great on sunburn!!!<br /><br />In a pinch you can use this and mix with isopropyl alcohol (30/70 mix) and make hand sanitizer.<br /><br />This really well packaged to prevent leakage in transit and you can reuse it to keep little fingers from depressing the product.\nNot just organic\nIryasa Night Indulge Cream - Natural Face Cream for Dry Skin - Vegan Anti Aging Night Cream for Women - Firming Cream for Face and Neck - Organic Vitamin C Moisturizer for Face - 1.7oz\nIRYASA\n{'Brand': 'IRYASA', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '1.7 Ounce', 'Use for': 'Face', 'Skin Type': 'Mature', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2.76 x 2.76 x 2.2 inches; 1.76 Ounces'}\nI smell like furniture polish, it was piercingly unpleasant.\nDid not like the scent at all\nSdara Aloe Vera Gel For Face and Body - Organic & Natural, Soothing & Cooling For Sunburn Relief, Restorative For Dry Skin - Made In USA\nSdara Skincare\n{'Brand': 'Sdara Skincare', 'Scent': 'Aloe Vera', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '4.9 x 2.3 x 1.3 inches; 9.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '707486993085'}\nbut it isn't certified organic, so is it? I have Aloe plants, but when traveling having Aloe Vera in a bottle is terrific.

I could feel immediately on application that this product contained Retinol as advertised and not a watered down 'serum' variation. Remember to moisturize after. This is a terrific product to use as your Retinol go to.<br /><br />I got a lot of info from Marie Claire article by Katie Thomas 'Retinol - the only ingredient that will reduce wrinkles'<br /><br />Your skin\u2019s collagen level starts to deplete at age 25.<br />Retinol helps with skin elasticity, wrinkles/laugh lines and pigmentation aka age spots.<br />Retinol is a derivative of vitamin A.<br />Start low ( 0.3%)  increase to 0.5%. 1% is best but only available with a prescription.<br />When you first try your skin may get dry, red & flaky.<br />Only use twice a week, gradually increase to daily as desired.<br />Apply a pea-sized amount at first and increase amount and % as negative side effects decrease.<br />Use anytime day or night, just use sunscreen after if going outdoors.<br />Anywhere you see signs of aging is a good place to apply, face, arms, hands, legs, neck.<br />Avoid the skin around your eyes as it is too delicate.<br /><br />Aqua/Water/Eau,<br />Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (emollient/natural moisturizing factor/replenishment/texture),<br />Glycerin (hydration/natural moisturizing factor/replenishment),<br />Dimethicone (conditioner/silicone),<br />Glyceryl Stearate (emollient/emulsifier),<br />PEG-100 Stearate (emulsifier),<br />Polysorbate 20 (emulsifier),<br />***Retinol (age delay/brightener),<br />Phenoxyethanol (preservative),<br />Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer (hydration/replenishment/restoration),<br />Carbomer (thickener),<br />Cetearyl Alcohol (thickener),<br />Caprylyl Glycol (conditioner/emollient/preservative),<br />Ceteareth-20 (emollient/emulsifier),<br />Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative),<br />BHT (preservative), Allantoin (sooth),<br />Disodium EDTA (pH buffer/preservative),<br />Hexylene Glycol (preservative),<br />Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster),<br />Pentylene Glycol (solvent),<br />BHA (preservative),<br />1,2-Hexanediol (preservative),<br />Beta-Glucan (antioxidant/sooth),<br />Myristoyl Pentapeptide-8 (age delay)\nWorth every penny\nOrganic Bamboo Cotton Ear Swabs by Bali Boo - 200 - Natural Wooden Qtips Cotton Swabs for Cleaning Ears, Baby or Makeup and Nails - Sustainable & Vegan Buds Sticks - Eco Friendly & Biodegradable\nBali Boo\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '3.8 x 3.3 x 2.1 inches; 2.4 Ounces'}\nI can get 750 J&J Qtips for a $4.64. So this all comes down to the environment.<br /><br />The J&J swabs come in plastic container and these come in a box which is kinder to the planet.<br /><br />These have a bamboo stem and the J&J are plastic! (I always thought they were paper!). And I am LOVING how sturdy the stems are: they don't bend, not that I use force when using, it just makes for a sure grip.<br /><br />I did a side by side and the tips are the same thickness.\nTerrific and makes a great baby shower gift.\nHAISWET 4 Pcs Boho Elastic Cross Headbands with Button for Strap to Protect Ear Wrap Hair Bands\nHAISWET\n{'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material': 'Cotton', 'Fabric Type': 'Cotton', 'Number of Items': '4', 'Brand': 'HAISWET', 'Package Dimensions': '11 x 6.3 x 1 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'L-HB-006'}\nI LOVE the colors! I have very thick hair so hairbands are almost always snug and this is the same width as most hairbands. Vibrant color. The buttons are placed EXACTLY where you need them. The seller includes extra buttons. The buttons are not removable but when you take the mask off you can flip the hairband so the buttons face inward so you don't see them.  I like the big white buttons, they give me a retro 1940's look.\nLooks FABULOUS!\nWonder4 Electric Callus Remover - Rechargeable Electric Foot File Callus Shaver Hard Skin Remover Pedicure Tools with 3 in 1 Roller Heads, for Cracked Heels Calluses and Dead Skin\nWonder4\n{'Brand': 'Wonder4', 'Is Electric': 'Yes', 'Item Form': 'Roller', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Unit Count': '11.4 Ounce'}\nComes fully charged. 100% waterproof. There is only ONE 3 headed grinder. The packing list on the product page  lists \"3 x 3 in 1 Grinding Heads\", so I believed it came with 2 replacement heads, The marketing materials show you how to replace the head, however I am unable to find where to obtain them. Hopefully by the time these wear out in a year they will be available.\nGiftworthy\nBouquet Garni Body Shower White Musk - Unique Fragrance Decanting Engineering Method gives Long Lasting Rich Fragrance - Gentle and Mild Cleansing Scented Body Wash with Natural Surfactant 17.85 Fl Oz\nBouquet Garni\n{'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Skin Type': 'All, Dry', 'Brand': 'Bouquet Garni', 'Scent': 'Garni', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '8.23 x 6.34 x 3.66 inches; 1.34 Pounds'}\nYou could use this as a hand soap as well as a wash to use in the shower.
