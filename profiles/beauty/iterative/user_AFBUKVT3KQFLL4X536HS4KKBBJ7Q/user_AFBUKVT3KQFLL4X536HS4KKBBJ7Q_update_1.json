I have heard women LOVE them.  I am not ever going to spend $300 - $400 on a hair dryer.  No way!  This one looks a lot like a Dyson.  I can't imagine how a Dyson would be better than this one.  This one is great!  I LOVE it.  I have curly hair and it works wonderful for me.  I dry my hair upside down with the diffuser on cool.  That really helps to cut down on the frizz.  It takes awhile but it's worth it.  I change out the nozzle and use one of the other tools to dry and lift at my scalp.  It gives me a lot more volume.  The dryer is a little heavier than some of my other dryers.  Yes, I have several.  I also like that you don't get all hot and sweaty when drying your hair.  My husband loves that I don't heat up the bathroom!  I really can't say enough good about this dryer.  It is well worth the price.  If you want hot air, this probably isn't the best dryer for that.  It doesn't get really hot.  The cord is long.  I cut a piece of velcro to wrap around it and it works great to keep it untangled.  Highly recommend!!\nReview Title: I would think it's comparable to the $400 dryers.\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
