I like the tousled look but this is a little much.  There's lots of really light colored strands sticking out.  The ends seem to be lighter than the rest of the hair.  I just took my scissors and cut those off.  Now I like it!  The hair texture is not shiny.  It looks like real hair.  At least it looks like my hair!  I got this in a lighter shade because you can never tell how dark they will be.  I have medium brown hair.  This was lighter than my hair.  I just spray it with root touchup spray and I can get it to match.  I put my medium length hair in a ponytail, wrap it around into a tiny bun and then put this over it.  I secure it with a few bobby pins.  Such a great look with little effort.\nReview Title: If you don't mind cutting it a little, you'll like it.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Ionic Hair Dryers for Women 1800W Blow Dryer with Diffuser Hot and Cool Settings Speed Adjustable Negative Ion Hair Dryer with 2 Concentrators,1 Hair Scalp Massager Brush for Curly Hair(LTD Edition)\nLassie\n{'Brand': 'Lassie', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Number of Speeds': '2', 'Product Dimensions': '11.4 x 9.4 x 3.7 inches; 2.43 Pounds', 'Manufacturer': 'Lassie'}\nI have never used one of the Dyson hair dryers.  I have heard women LOVE them.  I am not ever going to spend $300 - $400 on a hair dryer.  No way!  This one looks a lot like a Dyson.  I can't imagine how a Dyson would be better than this one.  This one is great!  I LOVE it.  I have curly hair and it works wonderful for me.  I dry my hair upside down with the diffuser on cool.  That really helps to cut down on the frizz.  It takes awhile but it's worth it.  I change out the nozzle and use one of the other tools to dry and lift at my scalp.  It gives me a lot more volume.  The dryer is a little heavier than some of my other dryers.  Yes, I have several.  I also like that you don't get all hot and sweaty when drying your hair.  My husband loves that I don't heat up the bathroom!  I really can't say enough good about this dryer.  It is well worth the price.  If you want hot air, this probably isn't the best dryer for that.  It doesn't get really hot.  The cord is long.  I cut a piece of velcro to wrap around it and it works great to keep it untangled.  Highly recommend!!\nI would think it's comparable to the $400 dryers.\nCreamily Women Short Bob Wig with Air Bangs Dark Brown Synthetic Chin Length Straight Hair Daily Wear Heat Resistant Full Replacement Wig\nCreamily\n{'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '12 x 4 x 1 inches', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Brand': 'Creamily', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '12 x 4 x 1 inches; 6.46 Ounces'}\nThis wig is a lot shorter than it looks in the picture.  I know it says it's a bob and that it is.  It comes down to just above my chin.  It would make a nice wig for a flapper costume.  It isn't realistic.  It's very shiny!  The part is white and really stands out.  You could tone down the shine with dry shampoo.  But the overall look is fake.  I got the dark brown and it's almost black.  It does come with a wig cap to wear underneath.\nNice for a costume.\n2020 UPGRADED Exfoliating Loofah Sponge Pads, Natural Luffa Material Loofah Pads Shower Body Scruber for Men/Women Bath Spa and Shower (3 Pack)\nMarsheepy\n{'Material': 'Loofah', 'Brand': 'Marsheepy', 'Style': 'Pad', 'Item Form': 'Pad', 'Number of Pieces': '3', 'Package Dimensions': '8 x 6 x 2 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'UPC': '780317215334', 'Manufacturer': 'Anthone Amo'}\nI really wanted to use these on my face.  But they are too big for that!  Check the measurements. They are great for all over body exfoliating though.  They have elastic on the back side to slide your hand under.  It's definitely rough enough to get rid of dead skin cells.  They are a little stiff.  I had to bend it back and forth several times to loosen them up.  They seem to be made well.\nThey are big!\n3D Mask Bracket - Internal Support Holder Frame Nose Breathing Smoothly- Lipstick Protection Cool Mask Bracket - DIY Face Mask Accessories - 5Pcs (L-Adult)\nVedory\n['\u2764-Outfits Set Include: 1 pack of 5 3D mask bracket (not including mask or cloth, etc.). \u2764-Size: about 10*9*4.2cm / 3.9*3.51*1.64 inches, enough space for various masks. \u2764-Unique design: designed to fit the face of the nose bridge, breathing more smoothly, breathable and not stuffy. \u2764-Ideal Saver for Makeup - It makes the mask not to stick lipstick, protecting your perfect makeup from being messed up.If you wear glasses, 3D Inner Bracket can also prevent the lens from fogging because of more breathing space. \u2764 3D Inner Bracket also suitable for various ma-sks.Using double sided tape or thread to fasten the silicone frame onto the mask can make it work better.']\n{'Package Dimensions': '6.3 x 4.72 x 2.36 inches; 1.41 Ounces', 'UPC': '800914455053', 'Manufacturer': 'Vedory'}\nMasks are hot.  We all know that.  They are hard to breathe in.  You end up sucking the fabric up in your mouth and can't get it out.  These are simple to use.  I just place it in my mask and put the mask on my face.  It stays put.  It holds the mask away from your mouth and nose.  They do make you sweat under the plastic.  But at least you can breathe easier.  You can easily wash these with soap and water.  I just lay them out to dry.  They fit kids as well.\nIf you're wondering if they work, they do!\nSelf Grip Volumizing Hair Root Clip for Women 9 Pcs, DIY Natural Fluffy Clamps Hair Curlers Rollers Clips Styling Tool\nPROIMB\n{'Item Form': 'Clip', 'Brand': 'PROIMB', 'Unit Count': '9.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '8.8 x 4.1 x 1.2 inches; 7.2 Ounces'}\nI desperately need height on the top of my head.  These clips actually do provide lift.  I don't know how well they would work on straight hair.  I always end up with an indention near the root where I clip these.  That doesn't matter that much on my hair because it's curly and the waves it creates works with curls.  I use my blow dryer with these in to speed up the drying process.  The air does flow through somewhat.  But these things are painful!  I haven't figured out how to use them without them pulling.  If I put them close to my scalp, they pull.  If I put them down a little, they pull.  I usually just dry them as quickly as possible and take them out.  They do work.\nThey actually work!\nAltaba Messy Bun Hair Piece Tousled Updo Messy Bun Hair Piece with Elastic Rubber Band Tousled Updo Extensions for Women\nAltaba\n{'Material': 'Rubber', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Brand': 'Altaba', 'Package Dimensions': '9.37 x 6.57 x 0.87 inches; 2.19 Ounces', 'UPC': '738631999959'}\nThis is an extremely messy bun!
