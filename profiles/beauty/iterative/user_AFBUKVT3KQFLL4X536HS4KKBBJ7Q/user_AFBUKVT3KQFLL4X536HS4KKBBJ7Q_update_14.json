Every time we travel, I leave it at home.  There was just no way of carrying it to keep it sanitary.  I have put it in an ziploc bag but it gets nasty after using several times.  I have a Soni Care rechargeable toothbrush.  It fits in this perfectly.  This is a plastic case and can easily be cleaned with soap and water.  The handle of the tooth brush fits snugly in the plastic grips.  It has other grips for the brush head.  I can easily fit in a travel size toothpaste as well.  This all closes up tightly with an outside latch.  Great case!\nReview Title: Great for traveling.\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Ionic Hair Dryers for Women 1800W Blow Dryer with Diffuser Hot and Cool Settings Speed Adjustable Negative Ion Hair Dryer with 2 Concentrators,1 Hair Scalp Massager Brush for Curly Hair(LTD Edition)\nLassie\n{'Brand': 'Lassie', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Number of Speeds': '2', 'Product Dimensions': '11.4 x 9.4 x 3.7 inches; 2.43 Pounds', 'Manufacturer': 'Lassie'}\nI have never used one of the Dyson hair dryers.  I have heard women LOVE them.  I am not ever going to spend $300 - $400 on a hair dryer.  No way!  This one looks a lot like a Dyson.  I can't imagine how a Dyson would be better than this one.  This one is great!  I LOVE it.  I have curly hair and it works wonderful for me.  I dry my hair upside down with the diffuser on cool.  That really helps to cut down on the frizz.  It takes awhile but it's worth it.  I change out the nozzle and use one of the other tools to dry and lift at my scalp.  It gives me a lot more volume.  The dryer is a little heavier than some of my other dryers.  Yes, I have several.  I also like that you don't get all hot and sweaty when drying your hair.  My husband loves that I don't heat up the bathroom!  I really can't say enough good about this dryer.  It is well worth the price.  If you want hot air, this probably isn't the best dryer for that.  It doesn't get really hot.  The cord is long.  I cut a piece of velcro to wrap around it and it works great to keep it untangled.  Highly recommend!!\nI would think it's comparable to the $400 dryers.\nCreamily Women Short Bob Wig with Air Bangs Dark Brown Synthetic Chin Length Straight Hair Daily Wear Heat Resistant Full Replacement Wig\nCreamily\n{'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '12 x 4 x 1 inches', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Brand': 'Creamily', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '12 x 4 x 1 inches; 6.46 Ounces'}\nThis wig is a lot shorter than it looks in the picture.  I know it says it's a bob and that it is.  It comes down to just above my chin.  It would make a nice wig for a flapper costume.  It isn't realistic.  It's very shiny!  The part is white and really stands out.  You could tone down the shine with dry shampoo.  But the overall look is fake.  I got the dark brown and it's almost black.  It does come with a wig cap to wear underneath.\nNice for a costume.\n2020 UPGRADED Exfoliating Loofah Sponge Pads, Natural Luffa Material Loofah Pads Shower Body Scruber for Men/Women Bath Spa and Shower (3 Pack)\nMarsheepy\n{'Material': 'Loofah', 'Brand': 'Marsheepy', 'Style': 'Pad', 'Item Form': 'Pad', 'Number of Pieces': '3', 'Package Dimensions': '8 x 6 x 2 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'UPC': '780317215334', 'Manufacturer': 'Anthone Amo'}\nI really wanted to use these on my face.  But they are too big for that!  Check the measurements. They are great for all over body exfoliating though.  They have elastic on the back side to slide your hand under.  It's definitely rough enough to get rid of dead skin cells.  They are a little stiff.  I had to bend it back and forth several times to loosen them up.  They seem to be made well.\nThey are big!\n3D Mask Bracket - Internal Support Holder Frame Nose Breathing Smoothly- Lipstick Protection Cool Mask Bracket - DIY Face Mask Accessories - 5Pcs (L-Adult)\nVedory\n['\u2764-Outfits Set Include: 1 pack of 5 3D mask bracket (not including mask or cloth, etc.). \u2764-Size: about 10*9*4.2cm / 3.9*3.51*1.64 inches, enough space for various masks. \u2764-Unique design: designed to fit the face of the nose bridge, breathing more smoothly, breathable and not stuffy. \u2764-Ideal Saver for Makeup - It makes the mask not to stick lipstick, protecting your perfect makeup from being messed up.If you wear glasses, 3D Inner Bracket can also prevent the lens from fogging because of more breathing space. \u2764 3D Inner Bracket also suitable for various ma-sks.Using double sided tape or thread to fasten the silicone frame onto the mask can make it work better.']\n{'Package Dimensions': '6.3 x 4.72 x 2.36 inches; 1.41 Ounces', 'UPC': '800914455053', 'Manufacturer': 'Vedory'}\nMasks are hot.  We all know that.  They are hard to breathe in.  You end up sucking the fabric up in your mouth and can't get it out.  These are simple to use.  I just place it in my mask and put the mask on my face.  It stays put.  It holds the mask away from your mouth and nose.  They do make you sweat under the plastic.  But at least you can breathe easier.  You can easily wash these with soap and water.  I just lay them out to dry.  They fit kids as well.\nIf you're wondering if they work, they do!\nSelf Grip Volumizing Hair Root Clip for Women 9 Pcs, DIY Natural Fluffy Clamps Hair Curlers Rollers Clips Styling Tool\nPROIMB\n{'Item Form': 'Clip', 'Brand': 'PROIMB', 'Unit Count': '9.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '8.8 x 4.1 x 1.2 inches; 7.2 Ounces'}\nI desperately need height on the top of my head.  These clips actually do provide lift.  I don't know how well they would work on straight hair.  I always end up with an indention near the root where I clip these.  That doesn't matter that much on my hair because it's curly and the waves it creates works with curls.  I use my blow dryer with these in to speed up the drying process.  The air does flow through somewhat.  But these things are painful!  I haven't figured out how to use them without them pulling.  If I put them close to my scalp, they pull.  If I put them down a little, they pull.  I usually just dry them as quickly as possible and take them out.  They do work.\nThey actually work!\nAltaba Messy Bun Hair Piece Tousled Updo Messy Bun Hair Piece with Elastic Rubber Band Tousled Updo Extensions for Women\nAltaba\n{'Material': 'Rubber', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Brand': 'Altaba', 'Package Dimensions': '9.37 x 6.57 x 0.87 inches; 2.19 Ounces', 'UPC': '738631999959'}\nThis is an extremely messy bun!  I like the tousled look but this is a little much.  There's lots of really light colored strands sticking out.  The ends seem to be lighter than the rest of the hair.  I just took my scissors and cut those off.  Now I like it!  The hair texture is not shiny.  It looks like real hair.  At least it looks like my hair!  I got this in a lighter shade because you can never tell how dark they will be.  I have medium brown hair.  This was lighter than my hair.  I just spray it with root touchup spray and I can get it to match.  I put my medium length hair in a ponytail, wrap it around into a tiny bun and then put this over it.  I secure it with a few bobby pins.  Such a great look with little effort.\nIf you don't mind cutting it a little, you'll like it.\nCONBOLA Make Up Organizer 5 in 1 Dresser Organizer,Portable for Lipstick and Jewlry ,Makeup Organizer and Temporary Makeup Brush Holder,Multi-purpose for Girl Women.36.6cm18cm.(Blue)\nCONBOLA\n{'Material': 'Silicone', 'Special Feature': 'Portable', 'Color': 'Blue', 'Brand': 'CONBOLA', 'Mounting Type': 'Tabletop Mount', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Package Type': 'Standard Packaging', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '15.08 x 7.44 x 1.5 inches; 1.65 Pounds', 'UPC': '750226660013'}\nThis makeup organizer has a spot for everything.  You can easily lay the mirror flat and put it in your suitcase.  The mirror acts as a cover to hold your makeup in the compartments.  You can take it all out and use it on your counter at home.  The whole thing is about 14 1/4\" long and 1\" deep.  It has foam inserts for your makeup brushes and eyeliners, lipstick or concealer tubes and a wavy type insert for laying your brushes flat as you use them.  The mirror has slots to make it stand up or you can hold it in your hand to use.  It's 6 1/4\" x 7\".  It is not magnifying.  The bottom has tiny foam pads to keep it from moving around.  It can easily be cleaned with soap and water.\nFor traveling or at home.\nRose Quartz Roller with Derma Roller Kit, Microneedling Face Roller 0.25mm and Body Microneedle Roller 0.3mm\nLOLYSENTA\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.95 x 6.54 x 1.81 inches; 12.63 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'LS10', 'UPC': '019213737276', 'Manufacturer': 'Lolysenta'}\nYou get two different size rollers in this set.  One is a facial roller with different size ends.  One end is 1 1/2\" and the other is 1\".  The larger one is great for all over your face - forehead, cheeks and neck. The smaller end is good for around the eyes and chin area.  Put this in the refrigerator and it's heaven to use!  Feels wonderful.  And at the same time it's helping to firm your face and neck.  The other box comes with dermarollers.  Two different sizes - one has a 1 1/2\" head and the other is a 3/4\" head.  I use the bigger one all over my face and then apply moisturizer.  It really helps it to absorb better.  The smaller one I use gently around my eyes.  But I mostly use it on my eyebrows with growth serum.  I roll the area first, apply the serum and roll again.  It helps to open up the hair follicles and allow the serum to absorb better. It's slightly painful and leaves your face red.  But it clears up in about an hour for me.  The handles are comfortable to hold while using.  They come in nice clear plastic cases.\nLove these!\nHAIRCUBE Natural Looking Short Blonde Wigs Pixie Cut Dark Root Ombre Blonde Wigs with Bangs Wigs for Women\nHAIRCUBE\n{'Material': 'Memory Fiber', 'Hair Type': 'Pixie Cut', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Brand': 'HAIRCUBE', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '10.4 x 7.8 x 3.2 inches; 3.99 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'aswig61-wm3045'}\nThis wig is beautiful!  It does not look like a wig.  The roots are dark and the rest is blonde.  The crown is very layered and you can't see any part.  There are not fake wig areas that show.  It's got wig combs in the front and the back.  There's lots of volume on the top.  It's a short tapered cut around the ears and back of the neck.  It's very easy to style.  I just fluffed it up with a comb.  I have medium brown hair.  This is a lot lighter than my natural color.  So, I can't pass it off as my own hair.  But other than that I would totally be able to fool people.  I loved the cut so much I decided to cut my hair the same way on the crown.  It gives me so much more volume.  You really can't do wrong with this wig.  It's excellent quality at a very low price.  I wish I could get it in medium brown.\nOne of the most natural looking wigs I've seen.\nM-BOX Straight Short Bob Wig Women\u2019s Bob Wig With Bangs Heat Resistant Fiber Hair Synthetic Wig None Lace Cosplay Wigs Natural Looking\uff08#30 14inch\uff09\nM-BOX\n{'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Brand': 'M-BOX', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '10.63 x 8.46 x 2.52 inches; 10.55 Ounces', 'UPC': '717373470629'}\nFirst off, the top part looks very realistic.  It's not a flat part.  It's staggered.  You can work with it and it looks very realistic.  There are virtually no bangs on this.  The front hairline looks fake.  I am going to try to cut some bangs and see if that helps the look.  But the hair color is not to my liking.  It has orange highlights.  But mostly around the front!  There's large clumps in the front and the back is mixed in better.  I tried spraying it with root touch up spray to tone them down some.  The hair is shiny.  You will have to use dry shampoo on it to get rid of some of that.  It does not come with any wig clips inside.  It does have the adjustable strap.  I wish there weren't so many issues with this wig.  I love the realistic part!!  The best I've seen in any wig.\nI got #30 - dark brown.\nAesfee Makeup Mirror Vanity Mirror with Lights, 1x/2x/3x Magnification LED Lighted Trifold Cosmetic Mirrors, 3 Color Lighting Modes Touch Control Dimmable Countertop Illuminated Mirrors - White\nAesfee\n{'Brand': 'Aesfee', 'Shape': 'Rectangular', 'Product Dimensions': '2.6 x 6.5 x 0.01 inches; 2.85 Pounds', 'Mounting Type': 'Tabletop Mount', 'Special Feature': 'Dimmable, Trifold, Lighted, Adjustable, Touch_sensor', 'Item model number': 'AF-805', 'UPC': '608912294366'}\nI can't say anything bad about the light this mirror provides.  It has three light levels.  I usually just use the same one.  The daylight one can be a little too much.  You can definitely see every flaw in your face!  I like that you can use this with batteries or USB charged.  I have so many other things plugged into my outlets.  This is just one less.  There are two fold out mirrors - one on top on the left side and one on the bottom on the right side.  They have different levels of magnification.  Those would be a little better if they were a little larger.  The middle mirror is the perfect size though.  This stands up on a base.  I just wish the mirror tilted back a bit farther.  It's kind of difficult to do my eyebrows without lowering my head down.  I may make a stand for it to lift it up about 2 -3\".  But it's a nice light and magnification.\nIt is bright!\nRose Quartz Roller with Derma Roller 0.25mm, Facial Kit with Microneedle and Pink Jade Rollers\nLOLYSENTA\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.1 x 5.1 x 1.6 inches; 8.78 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'LS17', 'UPC': '850002524062', 'Manufacturer': 'LOLYSENTA, LLC'}\nI love the combination of these two rollers.  The microneedle roller is great for rolling your face before applying moisturizer.  It helps your skin absorb it better.  I also use it on my eyebrows.  I have very sparse eyebrows.  I am applying hair growth serum on them.  I roll my eyebrows, apply the serum and then roll it again to help it get better absorbed.  It really seems to be helping!  I have fine hairs growing back in.  I also like the derma roller.  I put it in the refrigerator.  It feels so good to roll over your forehead and across your eyes.  Helps to relieve headaches too.  This is a nice duo to add to your daily facial routine.\nHelps your skin absorb moisturizer.\nHOOJIH Hair Topper, 12\" Wavy Wiglet Hairpieces Clips in Hair Extensions for Women with Thinning Hair Add Volume and Coverage - Brown with Highlight\nHOOJIH\n{'Brand': 'HOOJIH', 'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Extension Length': '12 Inches', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy', 'Installation Type': 'Clip-In', 'Package Dimensions': '6.93 x 5.71 x 2.17 inches; 5.08 Ounces', 'UPC': '767065779448'}\nWell, I finally got a hair topper that actually matches my hair.  That is so hard to get.  The hair on this is a little shiny but not bad.  I can spray it with dry shampoo and it dulls it some.  So, that's not a problem.  It has (3) clips - one on each side and in the back.  I would like a clip in front also.  I have some small clips I can sew in to help the front stay in place.  The part on this is very fake looking.  But most of them are.  I sprayed it with root touch up spray.  That helps a lot!  But I haven't been able to figure out how to use this without it being totally flat on top of my head.  It just screams fake!  The hair is very thick also.  I will have to thin it out and cut the length off some.  There's a lot you have to do to make this presentable.  I will keep working with it.\nToo flat!\n2PCS Portable Electric Toothbrush Travel Case, Plastic Travel Toothbrush Container Holder Suitable for Oral-B, Philips Sonicare and Other Electric Toothbrush Set (Black and White)\nHovesty\n{'Package Dimensions': '9.84 x 5.59 x 1.73 inches; 6.38 Ounces', 'UPC': '664935369078'}\nI use an electric tooth brush at home.
