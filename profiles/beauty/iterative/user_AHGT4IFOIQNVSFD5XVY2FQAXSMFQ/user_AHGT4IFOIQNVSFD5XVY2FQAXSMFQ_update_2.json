I am confident in using these with any liquids; the last thing you want is leakage, and I do not expect to have any with this set.<br /><br />You get nine vessels to hold liquids with the set: 1 spary bottle, 3 squeeze bottles, and 5 small twist cap bottles.<br /><br />For an inexpensive set, this one really covers all of the bases.
