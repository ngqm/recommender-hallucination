To me, the color is a pink cinnamon. It provides me with a hint of color but not being overpowering and looking like an \u201cover make up\u201d look. It\u2019s a go to every day lip color and a good color if you were going to have some heavy eye make m-up out for an evening. I found it very moisturizing and just a good color to have in my arsenal of lipsticks.\nReview Title: Very nice lipstick\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I am confident in using these with any liquids; the last thing you want is leakage, and I do not expect to have any with this set.<br /><br />You get nine vessels to hold liquids with the set: 1 spary bottle, 3 squeeze bottles, and 5 small twist cap bottles.<br /><br />For an inexpensive set, this one really covers all of the bases. Highly recommended!\nExcellent travel set for the money!\nYinMer Lavish Lash \u2013 Eyelash Growth Enhancer & Brow Serum with Biotin & Natural Growth Peptides for Long, Thick Lashes and Eyebrows\nOUZIFISH\n{'Package Dimensions': '6.61 x 2.8 x 1.26 inches; 3.53 Ounces'}\nReview provided by spouse:<br /><br />I\u2019m excited to see the results from this growth serum.

They come in really handy in the summer with items that are a challenge to wear even with a strapless bra. This pack comes with tons of the covers...some are pedal shaped and some are round, so will last multiple seasons.\u00a0\u00a0I tend to reuse mine until they lose their stickiness they don\u2019t smell or anything.\nWorks great and can even reuse\nOrganic Self Tanner for Face and Body - Streak Free Sunless Tanner - Self Tanning Lotion with Manuka Honey and Aloe Vera - Fake Tan for Fair to Medium Skin - Indoor Tanning Lotion with Bronzer (8oz)\nDermaChange\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '8 x 3 x 2 inches; 8 Ounces', 'UPC': '860004819929'}\nReview by spouse:<br /><br />I really like this self tanner. I have been using jergens for years, but this seems to pack a better punch and works quickly and seems to be cumulative. I didn\u2019t find it to be orangey, but was conscious to not put too much around my knees, elbows and ankles since these types of products tend to get a little darker in those areas and can kind of go orangey quickly.\nLove the tanner!\nFoot Peel Mask Coconut - For Cracked Heels, Dead Skin Calluses - Removes & Repairs Rough Heels, Dry Feet, Make Your Feet Baby Soft - Natural Exfoliating Peeling Foot Mask 3 Pairs\nHUALIJIA\n{'Brand': 'HUALIJIA', 'Scent': 'Coconut', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Unit Count': '3.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '6', 'Package Dimensions': '6.69 x 4.92 x 1.22 inches; 6.38 Ounces'}\nReviewed by spouse:<br /><br />I have used these peels before so I\u2019m familiar with the peeling process. I was very surprised when I had used a similar one of these for the first time and my feet peeled for weeks. Since I had done in the last 6 mo., and I have regular pedicures, my feet did not peel too bad and this actually had a much better scent than the other one I ordered so I highly recommend this one.\nGreat mask product\nLICHEE SU Creamy Lipstick,Matte Finish, Lip Makeup,Modern Creamy Soft Moisturizing Lip Color,Lightweight and Rich Velvet Texture,Nude, Pink, Red,Long-lasting High Impact Lipcolor,0.14 Oz\nLICHEE SU\n{'Brand': 'LICHEE SU', 'Color': '06#Rose Purple', 'Skin Type': 'Normal', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Finish Type': 'Matte', 'Product Dimensions': '0.98 x 0.98 x 3.22 inches; 1.26 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'LICHEE SU', 'Country of Origin': 'China'}\nReviewed by spouse:<br /><br />This is the prettiest color lipstick for my skin tone.
