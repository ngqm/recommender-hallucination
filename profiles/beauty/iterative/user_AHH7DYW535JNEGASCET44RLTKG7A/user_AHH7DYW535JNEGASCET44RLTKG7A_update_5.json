It has Nail Clippers that I\u2019ve never seen before but, I think they work really well to get in at angles that I just can\u2019t do with regular ones.

I\u2019ve never heard of this company but, I don\u2019t know much about current fashion names anyway so, that\u2019s not saying much.\ud83d\ude01<br />  I can easily say that I think the scents are really nice, not too strong for my senses and it\u2019s definitely something I would appreciate as a gift with Class.<br />  Stay Healthy Everyone!\ud83d\ude01\nVery Nice!\nPurple Hair Mask for Blonde with Keratin & Jojoba Oil - Platinum & Silver Hair - Instantly Eliminate Brassiness & Yellows - Made in USA - Hair Toner - Bleached & Highlighted Hair - Sulfate Free - 8 oz\nWELLUTION\n{'Brand': 'WELLUTION', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Hair Type': 'Damaged,Dry,Color-treated', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating Treatment', 'Package Dimensions': '3.07 x 2.9 x 2.8 inches; 8 Ounces', 'UPC': '749715278440'}\nThis really helps to keep the blonde alive. Just massage it in an leave it for about 10 minutes and rinse. It also leaves my hair and scalp feeling nice and soft.
