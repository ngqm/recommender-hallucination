The white cream feels silky, unlike most serums and really helps brighten skins appearance. My skin is sensitive and this doesn\u2019t irritate or hurt my skin at all, instead it makes my skin feel soft and moist. This serum is a great investment and worth the price if you want healthy, moisturized, soft, clear skin.\nReview Title: Great Retinol Serum For Sensitive Skin\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

However, I was not impressed with the container and/or applicator. It\u2019s a small tube similar to a thin mascara bottle and it has a black button on top to release the serum. The tip is like a thick wax that gets covered with the serum but it\u2019s difficult to use on the subtle lash line or eyes in general. I prefer the wand versions to apply the serum because they are simple and fast and easier to apply. This lash and brow pen does work though and only takes about two weeks to see a difference.\nWorks With Time And Patience\nMBA Renewing Retinol Serum, 1.7 fl. oz, 0.5% Retinol Hydrates & Brightens Skin's Appearance by Diminishing the Look of Breakouts, Hyperpigmentation, and Signs of Aging by Higher Education Skincare\nHigher Education\n{'Skin Type': 'All', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'Higher Education', 'Item Form': 'Serum', 'Unit Count': '1.7 Fl Oz', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.5 x 3.4 x 1.5 inches; 3.99 Ounces', 'UPC': '811381034009'}\nThe Serum by Higher Education is very moisturizing and delicate on the skin.
