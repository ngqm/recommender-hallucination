The smell is light, like the lightweight feeling of the moisturizer. I have sensitive skin and my face drinks this moisturizer in. It makes my very dry areas feel just soft and fresh. Gold Digger makes a nice set of skin line products and this is also a well packaged/bottled item. I love the natural products in it and think it\u2019s a great investment to your skin line items.\nReview Title: Cucumber Smelling That Really Moisturizes\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Veta \u2013 Lash and Eyebrow Serum \u2013 2-in-1 Lash & Brow Pen \u2013 Produces Longer, Healthier, Denser Lashes and Thicker Brows \u2013 Eyelash Serum \u2013 Boosts Skin Collagen \u2013 Drug-Free Formula - 1 fl oz.\nVeta\n{'Color': 'Silver, Black', 'Brand': 'Veta', 'Item Form': 'lotion', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Package Information': 'Tube', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.2 x 1.61 x 1.57 inches; 1.13 Ounces', 'UPC': '861121002645'}\nFirst off, all these new lash growth serums seem to work if you use them consistently, as does this one by Veta. However, I was not impressed with the container and/or applicator. It\u2019s a small tube similar to a thin mascara bottle and it has a black button on top to release the serum. The tip is like a thick wax that gets covered with the serum but it\u2019s difficult to use on the subtle lash line or eyes in general. I prefer the wand versions to apply the serum because they are simple and fast and easier to apply. This lash and brow pen does work though and only takes about two weeks to see a difference.\nWorks With Time And Patience\nMBA Renewing Retinol Serum, 1.7 fl. oz, 0.5% Retinol Hydrates & Brightens Skin's Appearance by Diminishing the Look of Breakouts, Hyperpigmentation, and Signs of Aging by Higher Education Skincare\nHigher Education\n{'Skin Type': 'All', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'Higher Education', 'Item Form': 'Serum', 'Unit Count': '1.7 Fl Oz', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.5 x 3.4 x 1.5 inches; 3.99 Ounces', 'UPC': '811381034009'}\nThe Serum by Higher Education is very moisturizing and delicate on the skin. The white cream feels silky, unlike most serums and really helps brighten skins appearance. My skin is sensitive and this doesn\u2019t irritate or hurt my skin at all, instead it makes my skin feel soft and moist. This serum is a great investment and worth the price if you want healthy, moisturized, soft, clear skin.\nGreat Retinol Serum For Sensitive Skin\nHigher Education Skincare: Goal Digger - Silky Moisturizing Cucumber Creme; formulated for dry and sensitive skin; cucumber extract; natural extract: melon, kale, cabbage, ginger, turmeric - 1.7 fl oz\nHigher Education\n{'Brand': 'Higher Education', 'Scent': 'Cucumber', 'Item Form': 'Creme', 'Unit Count': '1.7 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2.88 x 2.88 x 2.13 inches; 7.2 Ounces', 'UPC': '811381032050'}\nThis cream reminds me of cucumber water at the spa.
