It heats up quickly and stays hot for a long time making it easy to section hair and run through the plates. It's not heavy and it's simple to use. I like the way it works on my hair and mostly, that is doesn't dry out or over heat my hair but still straightens it nicely. This cute pink, easy to use hair straightener by Bellezza is worth the investment, especially if you don't want to spend a fortune just to get your hair smooth and straight.\nReview Title: Nice Hair Straightener\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Veta \u2013 Lash and Eyebrow Serum \u2013 2-in-1 Lash & Brow Pen \u2013 Produces Longer, Healthier, Denser Lashes and Thicker Brows \u2013 Eyelash Serum \u2013 Boosts Skin Collagen \u2013 Drug-Free Formula - 1 fl oz.\nVeta\n{'Color': 'Silver, Black', 'Brand': 'Veta', 'Item Form': 'lotion', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Package Information': 'Tube', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.2 x 1.61 x 1.57 inches; 1.13 Ounces', 'UPC': '861121002645'}\nFirst off, all these new lash growth serums seem to work if you use them consistently, as does this one by Veta. However, I was not impressed with the container and/or applicator. It\u2019s a small tube similar to a thin mascara bottle and it has a black button on top to release the serum. The tip is like a thick wax that gets covered with the serum but it\u2019s difficult to use on the subtle lash line or eyes in general. I prefer the wand versions to apply the serum because they are simple and fast and easier to apply. This lash and brow pen does work though and only takes about two weeks to see a difference.\nWorks With Time And Patience\nMBA Renewing Retinol Serum, 1.7 fl. oz, 0.5% Retinol Hydrates & Brightens Skin's Appearance by Diminishing the Look of Breakouts, Hyperpigmentation, and Signs of Aging by Higher Education Skincare\nHigher Education\n{'Skin Type': 'All', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'Higher Education', 'Item Form': 'Serum', 'Unit Count': '1.7 Fl Oz', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.5 x 3.4 x 1.5 inches; 3.99 Ounces', 'UPC': '811381034009'}\nThe Serum by Higher Education is very moisturizing and delicate on the skin. The white cream feels silky, unlike most serums and really helps brighten skins appearance. My skin is sensitive and this doesn\u2019t irritate or hurt my skin at all, instead it makes my skin feel soft and moist. This serum is a great investment and worth the price if you want healthy, moisturized, soft, clear skin.\nGreat Retinol Serum For Sensitive Skin\nHigher Education Skincare: Goal Digger - Silky Moisturizing Cucumber Creme; formulated for dry and sensitive skin; cucumber extract; natural extract: melon, kale, cabbage, ginger, turmeric - 1.7 fl oz\nHigher Education\n{'Brand': 'Higher Education', 'Scent': 'Cucumber', 'Item Form': 'Creme', 'Unit Count': '1.7 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2.88 x 2.88 x 2.13 inches; 7.2 Ounces', 'UPC': '811381032050'}\nThis cream reminds me of cucumber water at the spa. The smell is light, like the lightweight feeling of the moisturizer. I have sensitive skin and my face drinks this moisturizer in. It makes my very dry areas feel just soft and fresh. Gold Digger makes a nice set of skin line products and this is also a well packaged/bottled item. I love the natural products in it and think it\u2019s a great investment to your skin line items.\nCucumber Smelling That Really Moisturizes\n[Marshique] Eyelash & Eyebrow Growth Serum 0.25 Fl Oz - Oil Free Formula Essence Conditioner for Extension & Perm Treatment Care\nMarshique\n{'Brand': 'Marshique', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Package Information': 'Tube', 'Package Type': 'Box', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.59 x 1.54 x 0.75 inches; 0.63 Ounces', 'Item model number': '0000'}\nI\u2019ve used a few of these lash growth boosters and this one is my new favorite. It\u2019s not because my lashes grew into fake lash length, but the applicator is the best I\u2019ve seen. I love you can coat your lashes using the mascara wand and use the white fluff tip to apply it to corners and the lash line easier. Having said all that, my lashes are a bit longer since I started using it and they feel strong and well conditioned. The packaging is nice and the wand is great and the product works well, so I highly recommend it.\nLove The Applicator\nNatural Waterproof Lash Mascara Black, 4D Silk Fiber Eyelash Mascara Makeup, Lengthening and Thick, No Clumping, Smudge-proof, Long-Lasting Voluminous Eyelashes Dramatic Extension Makeup Kit Eye Lash\nSIKEMAY\n{'Color': 'black', 'Brand': 'SIKEMAY', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '7.2 x 4 x 1.2 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '764690676845', 'Manufacturer': 'SIKEMAY'}\nI really like this mascara. It lengthens my lashes and doesn\u2019t clump like the cheaper brands. The wand and bottle are smooth and sleek and are simple to use. It\u2019s somewhat easy to remove at night and looks good all day. At times it can feel thick on my eyes but overall I still really like this product as I believe that is just because of the silk fiber. This mascara is worth the investment.\nGreat Mascara\nBellezza Versa Styler 1 Inch Titanium Plates Flat Iron Twisted Hair Straighteners (Blush Pink)\nBellezza\n['Bellezza Versa Styler 1 Inch Titanium Plates Flat Iron Twisted Hair Straighteners (Blush Pink)']\n{'Shape': 'Flat', 'Brand': 'Bellezza', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Material': 'Titanium', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '12.64 x 3.66 x 3.46 inches; 1.52 Pounds', 'Manufacturer': 'Cortex USA INC.'}\nI've had many hair straighteners in the past having always had wavy or curly hair and this is a very good straightener.
