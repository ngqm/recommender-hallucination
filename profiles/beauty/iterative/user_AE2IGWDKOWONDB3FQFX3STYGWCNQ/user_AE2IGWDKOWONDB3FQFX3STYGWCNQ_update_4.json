  "reference_summary": "Women's Pleated Scarves Pashmina Shawl Wraps for Wedding Bride Bridesmaid Gifts (Black)\nHOMELEX\n{'Package Dimensions': '12 x 10.7 x 0.8 inches; 7.2 Ounces', 'Department': 'Womens', 'UPC': '782903598692'}\nSo happy I added this to my headscarf collection. I got the black one but am definitely eyeing up the champagne, brown, and yellow! The fabric is so soft and I love the pleated design. It's pretty long, which allows so many styles to be worn! It could even work as a scarf around your neck! Very versatile.\nBeautiful & Versatile\nLaloirelle Age Defy Face Oil - Virgin Marula Oil, Rosehip Oil Infused with Organic Reishi Mushroom, Ginseng, Cordyceps Mushroom - Organic Facial Oil for Anti Aging, Wrinkles, Acne Scars, Dry Skin (1oz)\nLaloirelle\n{'Brand': 'Laloirelle', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Use for': 'Face', 'Package Dimensions': '5.67 x 2.4 x 2.32 inches; 4.52 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'AD30'}\nI'm a fan of this face oil. I find that I can only really use it as part of my nighttime skincare routine, as the finish is...well...oily. I have another face oil that I use in the morning that has more of a matte finish so I'm not shining all throughout the day. That being said, this oil is not bad. It just leaves you very shiny!<br /><br />It has a great floral smell and just 2-3 drops is enough to cover your face/neck.\nDewy Moisturizing Finish\nLaloirelle Luminous Face Oil - Organic Pomegranate Oil, Cacao Oil Infused W/Brightening White Peony Root, Marigold Flower, Lotus Leaf - Glowing Skin That Feels Hydrated, Plump and Firm - 1.0 fl oz\nLaloirelle\n{'Brand': 'Laloirelle', 'Scent': 'Pomegranate', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Fl Oz', 'Use for': 'Face', 'Package Dimensions': '5.67 x 2.36 x 2.32 inches; 4.55 Ounces'}\nOof! I just can't get over the smell of this one. It could be a scent that others may find pleasurable, but not me. I can't find a specific smell it reminds me of...but think a deep nutty smell mixed with the smell of old leather? The scent dissipates a bit after you rub it into your skin, but it lingers just enough to bother me. But if you are a fan of those deep, woodsy, older scents, this might be for you.<br /><br />I will say, it soaks extremely well into the skin, leaving you with a really nice matte finish that most other oils aren't capable of.\nScent Is Not For Me\nLaloirelle Age Renewal Serum - Phyto-Biotics Stem Cells, Botanical Hyaluronic Acid, Retinol, Multi-Vitamin, Herbal Infusion - Organic serum for anti-aging, hydration, wrinkles, all skin types (1oz)\nLaloirelle\n{'Skin Type': 'All', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'Laloirelle', 'Item Form': 'Serum', 'Material Feature': 'Organic', 'Package Dimensions': '5.79 x 2.36 x 2.32 inches; 4.73 Ounces'}\nI'm so impressed by this natural serum.
