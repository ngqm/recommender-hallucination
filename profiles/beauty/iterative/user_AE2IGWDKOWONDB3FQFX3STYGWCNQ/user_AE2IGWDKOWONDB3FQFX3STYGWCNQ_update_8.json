Natural ingredients like Allantoin and Bisabolol nourish beyond surface level, and penetrate into the lower levels of the skin for the deepest hydration possible, while active ingredient tea tree oil works to fight body acne and skin issues teens are commonly prone to. Unlike shower bars and other soaps, our products are designed to soothe problematic and compromised skin. With 100% Natural ingredients that are paraben, sulfate, fragrance, and gluten free, the Kidskin Foaming Body Wash with Tea Tree Oil is gentle enough for every day use. Our mission is to provide teens (like our own!) with a body wash that leaves them feeling fresh and confident so they can focus on what really matters- every day. Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Musa Sapientum (Banana) Extract, Polysorbate-20, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, ^ Glycerin, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Sea Salt (Sodium Chloride), Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Allantoin, Bisabolol']\nAverage Rating: 4.0\nProduct Details: {'Item Form': 'Bar, Foam', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Brand': 'Kidskin', 'Scent': 'Tea Tree', 'Material Feature': 'Cruelty Free', 'Package Dimensions': '7.83 x 2.83 x 2.24 inches; 8 Ounces', 'Item model number': '4012', 'UPC': '880628401263', 'Manufacturer': 'Kidskin'}\nReview Text: I just wish this had more of a Tea Tree scent! I use Tea Tree Oil on my face and hair & love the benefits of it while equally loving the scent. I find that this particular body wash doesn't have the scent I love. My very first thought upon using it was that it smelled like a dog shampoo. And I don't mean that to be negative, as I still use it and continue to. It just smells more chemical than herbal, for my particular sense of smell. But I do like that it squeezes out as a lather and is super convenient to use in the shower. I wouldn't order it again but can see why someone else would! I say, give it a shot and see what you think.\nReview Title: Wish it smelled more like tea tree oil\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Women's Pleated Scarves Pashmina Shawl Wraps for Wedding Bride Bridesmaid Gifts (Black)\nHOMELEX\n{'Package Dimensions': '12 x 10.7 x 0.8 inches; 7.2 Ounces', 'Department': 'Womens', 'UPC': '782903598692'}\nSo happy I added this to my headscarf collection. I got the black one but am definitely eyeing up the champagne, brown, and yellow! The fabric is so soft and I love the pleated design. It's pretty long, which allows so many styles to be worn! It could even work as a scarf around your neck! Very versatile.\nBeautiful & Versatile\nLaloirelle Age Defy Face Oil - Virgin Marula Oil, Rosehip Oil Infused with Organic Reishi Mushroom, Ginseng, Cordyceps Mushroom - Organic Facial Oil for Anti Aging, Wrinkles, Acne Scars, Dry Skin (1oz)\nLaloirelle\n{'Brand': 'Laloirelle', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Use for': 'Face', 'Package Dimensions': '5.67 x 2.4 x 2.32 inches; 4.52 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'AD30'}\nI'm a fan of this face oil. I find that I can only really use it as part of my nighttime skincare routine, as the finish is...well...oily. I have another face oil that I use in the morning that has more of a matte finish so I'm not shining all throughout the day. That being said, this oil is not bad. It just leaves you very shiny!<br /><br />It has a great floral smell and just 2-3 drops is enough to cover your face/neck.\nDewy Moisturizing Finish\nLaloirelle Luminous Face Oil - Organic Pomegranate Oil, Cacao Oil Infused W/Brightening White Peony Root, Marigold Flower, Lotus Leaf - Glowing Skin That Feels Hydrated, Plump and Firm - 1.0 fl oz\nLaloirelle\n{'Brand': 'Laloirelle', 'Scent': 'Pomegranate', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Fl Oz', 'Use for': 'Face', 'Package Dimensions': '5.67 x 2.36 x 2.32 inches; 4.55 Ounces'}\nOof! I just can't get over the smell of this one. It could be a scent that others may find pleasurable, but not me. I can't find a specific smell it reminds me of...but think a deep nutty smell mixed with the smell of old leather? The scent dissipates a bit after you rub it into your skin, but it lingers just enough to bother me. But if you are a fan of those deep, woodsy, older scents, this might be for you.<br /><br />I will say, it soaks extremely well into the skin, leaving you with a really nice matte finish that most other oils aren't capable of.\nScent Is Not For Me\nLaloirelle Age Renewal Serum - Phyto-Biotics Stem Cells, Botanical Hyaluronic Acid, Retinol, Multi-Vitamin, Herbal Infusion - Organic serum for anti-aging, hydration, wrinkles, all skin types (1oz)\nLaloirelle\n{'Skin Type': 'All', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'Laloirelle', 'Item Form': 'Serum', 'Material Feature': 'Organic', 'Package Dimensions': '5.79 x 2.36 x 2.32 inches; 4.73 Ounces'}\nI'm so impressed by this natural serum. From the ingredients ... to the consistency & coverage. My skin soaks this right up in my nighttime skincare routine. The scent is amazing with bright floral notes. It's a win for me.\nSmells Amazing / Great Ingredients\nMAD | Cosmetic's Makeup Remover Cleansing Towelettes, Daily cleansing face wipes to remove waterproof mascara, alcohol free , with Vitamin E 25 count\nJUST FOR TOTS BY MAD\n{'Brand': 'JUST FOR TOTS BY MAD', 'Skin Type': 'Oily', 'Unit Count': '25.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '6.3 x 7.87 x 1.97 inches; 7.16 Ounces', 'UPC': '685757511926'}\nThese are okay. They are definitely not heavy duty enough if you wear a lot of makeup. I occasionally throw on a little concealer or foundation before remote meetings on ZOOM, so these wipes work for me. However it still takes me about 4 wipes to get that small amount of makeup off.<br /><br />I don't mind the scent, but I don't love it either.<br />Overall, I wouldn't brag about these wipes or go out of my way to recommend them, they're just okay.\nNot The Worst...Not The Best\nShort Afro Kinky Curly Headband Wig Ombre Wigs Headband Wig Head Wrap Wigs 2 in 1 Headband Wigs Mix Orange Turban Afro High Puff Wigs Synthetic Scarf Wigs\nINSTASTYLE\n{'Material': 'High Temperature Fiber', 'Hair Type': 'Curly, Kinky', 'Style': 'Chic', 'Brand': 'INSTASTYLE', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult'}\nThis is cute. To me it gives the look of \"threw my hair up to run to the store\". Or just a quick updo. I guess you could dress it up with the hoop earrings it came with...But it's cute! The hair does have a slightly synthetic look to it...but it is synthetic, so what do you expect?\nCute\nIce Roller Massager Gel Eye Mask, Cooler Skin Roller for Face & Eye Cold Freezer Therapy Instant Pain Relief Reduce Puffy Dark Circles Migraines Stress Relief\nCONSGIJI\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.83 x 3.54 x 2.36 inches; 11.11 Ounces', 'UPC': '046432534331'}\nI really love this eye mask. I keep mine in the freezer and have used it before virtual meetings or just before going out for the day to reduce the puffiness under my eyes. While the puffiness isn't 100% just magically gone, the mask definitely helps. It's also great for just putting you at ease for a bit. The roller, however, I am not the biggest fan of. For some reason when I cool it in the freezer, the roller literally freezes and no longer rolls unless I'm *really* applying pressure. I guess the roller is meant to be used on your back or legs, not your face. But overall, pretty satisfied!\nNot Bad!
