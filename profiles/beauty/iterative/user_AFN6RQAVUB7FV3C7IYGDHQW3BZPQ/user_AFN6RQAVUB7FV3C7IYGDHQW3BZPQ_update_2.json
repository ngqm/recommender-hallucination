I love this product line and tried this as an alternative to the night serum. I love both.  This seems to absorb quicker into my skin. Leaves no greasy residue,  not sticky. Super soft. I highly recommend this and all of their products.  I'm 54 and am enjoying more glowing, youthful looking skin.\nAfter 2 weeks I can see a nice decrease in fine lines\nGOMAY Hydrating Amino Acid Foaming Facial Cleanser, Daily Face Wash for Makeup Remover with Face Cleansing Brush\nGO MAY\n{'Brand': 'GO MAY', 'Scent': 'Unscented', 'Material Type Free': 'Oil-free,Soap-free', 'Unit Count': '5.00 Fl Oz', 'Item Package Quantity': '1', 'Product Dimensions': '2 x 2 x 6 inches; 8.96 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'GM-FC03', 'UPC': '633183294814'}\nGreat on sensitive skin.
