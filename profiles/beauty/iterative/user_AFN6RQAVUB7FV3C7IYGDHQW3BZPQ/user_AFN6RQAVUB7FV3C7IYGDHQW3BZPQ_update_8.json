While I'm brushing my teeth and getting ready for my day. It cane with no instructions but its fairly easy to figure out. Too, just come back to the product description online and read how to use it.

I love this product line and tried this as an alternative to the night serum. I love both.  This seems to absorb quicker into my skin. Leaves no greasy residue,  not sticky. Super soft. I highly recommend this and all of their products.  I'm 54 and am enjoying more glowing, youthful looking skin.\nAfter 2 weeks I can see a nice decrease in fine lines\nGOMAY Hydrating Amino Acid Foaming Facial Cleanser, Daily Face Wash for Makeup Remover with Face Cleansing Brush\nGO MAY\n{'Brand': 'GO MAY', 'Scent': 'Unscented', 'Material Type Free': 'Oil-free,Soap-free', 'Unit Count': '5.00 Fl Oz', 'Item Package Quantity': '1', 'Product Dimensions': '2 x 2 x 6 inches; 8.96 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'GM-FC03', 'UPC': '633183294814'}\nGreat on sensitive skin. I love the scrubber. Soft silicone like fingers that massage your skin as you wash. All in one,  I love it.  Easy to dispense and fits well in hand. Cap to keep it sterile.  Great product. Great value for the money. Not harsh but deep cleaning.\nEasy to use, no fragrance,  deep clean\nVOFEL Jelly Masks for Facials Mask Powder for Moisturizing Anti Aging Jelly Face Mask Peel Off 9 Pcs\nVOFEL\n{'Brand': 'VOFEL', 'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Scent': 'Vanilla,Lemon', 'Skin Type': 'All, Oily, Sensitive', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '6.5 x 3.46 x 1.46 inches; 5.86 Ounces', 'UPC': '770456407264'}\nDries to powder, like clay. Re-wet it then after a minute, it loosened up and could be torn off. Didnt hydrate, just dried out my skin. Didn't notice any lightening of my skin.\nDries hard. Re-wet then tears off. Faux fragrances\nVitamasques Cica Green Tea Jelly Facial Cleanser Gentle pH Cleanser is Refreshing, Cleansing & Exfoliating for Smooth, Clean & Radiant Skin - Vegan, Free from Parabens & Gluten\nVitamasques\n{'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'Vitamasques', 'Scent': 'Tea Tree', 'Material Feature': 'Vegan', 'Package Dimensions': '5.24 x 1.81 x 1.38 inches; 2.89 Ounces', 'UPC': '750258969917'}\nWhile yes, it deep cleaned my skin it also dried it out terribly.  Great lather but I couldn't wash it off fast enough. I nearly vomited. Its truely awful. Wet dog and day old beach seaweed aroma. I won't use anymore of this product and I had to use another cleanser just to remove the smell.\nFragrance please. This smells like wet dog\nOrganic Patchouli Beard Wash by American Shaving Co, Rich, Foaming Cleanser that Softens, cleanse & Strengthens the beard hair, Clean and Refresh your beard with Patchouli Fragrance - 8 oz\nAmerican Shaving Co.\n{'Brand': 'American Shaving Co.', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Unit Count': '8.0 Ounce', 'Package Dimensions': '7.84 x 1.85 x 1.81 inches; 8.64 Ounces', 'UPC': '685167904479'}\nThe fragrance is not over powering,  just enough. It deeply cleaned my hair of buildup from styling products. Literally squeaky clean. This is not a shampoo for daily use but its fantastic for WOMEN with dull, lifeless hair to remove buildup. I love it. I will happily buy this again.

Avocado is so good for your hair and I'm overall, pretty happy with this product. I left it in longer than suggested bc my hair is so dry. When I rinsed it out and towel dried my hair, I could see the curls coming back. The longer I use it, the more it nourishes my hair. I will absolutely get this again and again. Would be nice to have a yummy fragrance but I'm still loving my hair after using this.\nModerately hydrating after first use, easy to use\nMRTREUP Neon Face Paint UV Glow Body Paint Water Activated Eyeliner , 6 Colors Cake Eyelier Fluorescent Hydra Graphic Pink Green Glow in the Dark Body Paint for Club Halloween Party Makeup Art Paint\nMRTREUP\n{'Brand': 'MRTREUP', 'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Package Information': 'Palette', 'Package Type': 'Palette', 'Specialty': 'Hypoallergenic', 'Package Dimensions': '4.6 x 1.6 x 1.5 inches; 3.99 Ounces'}\nCould not be easier to use.
