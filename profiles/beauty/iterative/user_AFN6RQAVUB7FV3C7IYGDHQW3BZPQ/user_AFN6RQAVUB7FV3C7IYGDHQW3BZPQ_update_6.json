Avocado is so good for your hair and I'm overall, pretty happy with this product. I left it in longer than suggested bc my hair is so dry. When I rinsed it out and towel dried my hair, I could see the curls coming back. The longer I use it, the more it nourishes my hair. I will absolutely get this again and again. Would be nice to have a yummy fragrance but I'm still loving my hair after using this.\nReview Title: Moderately hydrating after first use, easy to use\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I love this product line and tried this as an alternative to the night serum. I love both.  This seems to absorb quicker into my skin. Leaves no greasy residue,  not sticky. Super soft. I highly recommend this and all of their products.  I'm 54 and am enjoying more glowing, youthful looking skin.\nAfter 2 weeks I can see a nice decrease in fine lines\nGOMAY Hydrating Amino Acid Foaming Facial Cleanser, Daily Face Wash for Makeup Remover with Face Cleansing Brush\nGO MAY\n{'Brand': 'GO MAY', 'Scent': 'Unscented', 'Material Type Free': 'Oil-free,Soap-free', 'Unit Count': '5.00 Fl Oz', 'Item Package Quantity': '1', 'Product Dimensions': '2 x 2 x 6 inches; 8.96 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'GM-FC03', 'UPC': '633183294814'}\nGreat on sensitive skin. I love the scrubber. Soft silicone like fingers that massage your skin as you wash. All in one,  I love it.  Easy to dispense and fits well in hand. Cap to keep it sterile.  Great product. Great value for the money. Not harsh but deep cleaning.\nEasy to use, no fragrance,  deep clean\nVOFEL Jelly Masks for Facials Mask Powder for Moisturizing Anti Aging Jelly Face Mask Peel Off 9 Pcs\nVOFEL\n{'Brand': 'VOFEL', 'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Scent': 'Vanilla,Lemon', 'Skin Type': 'All, Oily, Sensitive', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '6.5 x 3.46 x 1.46 inches; 5.86 Ounces', 'UPC': '770456407264'}\nDries to powder, like clay. Re-wet it then after a minute, it loosened up and could be torn off. Didnt hydrate, just dried out my skin. Didn't notice any lightening of my skin.\nDries hard. Re-wet then tears off.

Great lather but I couldn't wash it off fast enough. I nearly vomited. Its truely awful. Wet dog and day old beach seaweed aroma. I won't use anymore of this product and I had to use another cleanser just to remove the smell.\nFragrance please.

It deeply cleaned my hair of buildup from styling products. Literally squeaky clean. This is not a shampoo for daily use but its fantastic for WOMEN with dull, lifeless hair to remove buildup. I love it. I will happily buy this again.
