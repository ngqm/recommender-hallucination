Their recent interactions suggest an increasingly discerning evaluation of product performance, particularly when items fail to meet high standards in effectiveness and longevity.

They continue to seek beauty products that strike a balance between aesthetics and practicality, with a focus on durability and ease of use. \n\nHowever, the recent negative experience with the under eye patches highlights a willingness to reassess products that miss the mark in functionality.
