I started using this day and night for the past couple of days and find this has a very nice texture and makes your skin very soft and smooth.  I feel it's a great buy as I believe this is a quality product.  This comes in a nice pump bottle and was surprised of the amount it contained.  I do think over time that there will be cumulative effect which will be more visible.  At this point, it's really a nice product.  I have ultra sensitive skin and found I got no allergic reaction from this as well\nReview Title: A Great Product!
