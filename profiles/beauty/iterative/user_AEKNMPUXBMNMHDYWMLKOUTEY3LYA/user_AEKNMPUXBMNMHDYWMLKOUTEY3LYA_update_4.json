I really like how they give you an idea to use each mask.  Not the best for my sensitive skin though...  I totally missed that 3 out of the 4 masks have a warning \"Not suitable for Sensitive Skin\" on the packaging so pay attention!.  You get: Clarifying+ Face Mask, Brightening+ Face Mask, Exfoliating+ Face Mask and Hydrating.  Even the hydrating was a bit much for my sensitive skin.  The Exfoliating... well I really enjoyed the hydrating!\nReview Title: Variety pack with great packaging!\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Replacement Toothbrush Heads Compatible With Oral B Braun Electric Toothbrush, 4 Count\nHDY\n{'Brand': 'HDY', 'Size': '4 Count (Pack of 1)', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Item Firmness Description': 'Extra Soft', 'Number of Pieces': '4', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '0.43 x 0.39 x 2.76 inches; 0.81 Ounces', 'UPC': '632088377561', 'Manufacturer': 'HDY'}\nThese are a solid generic replacement for our Oral-B brush heads.  They fit every toothbrush in the house without issue and work well.  They are a bit more angular than the name brand and I can tell, but my wife and kids didn't notice.  My kids love the smiley face on the back of the brush head.  A solid generic replacement.\nGood generic brush heads\nN3 No Name Necessary Pore Minimizing Moisturizing Scented Long-Lasting Anti-aging and Hydrating Face Primer Spray \u2013 (200ml)\nNo Name Necessary\n{'Brand': 'No Name Necessary', 'Skin Type': 'Normal', 'Package Information': 'Bottle', 'Specialty': 'Moisturizing, Cruelty Free, Vegan', 'Unit Count': '1.0 Ounce', 'Package Dimensions': '7.6 x 1.8 x 1.5 inches; 11.99 Ounces'}\nIt's a good product, not a great one for a primer.  Nothing overly wrong but I've used better.  This one's major flaw is that the spray is hard to keep out of my hair which causes issues on that side of the beauty regime.\nGood but application needs work\nCaudalie Vinosource SOS Intense Hydration Set: Hydrating Trio for Sensitive Skin including a Daily Foam Cleanser, Hydrating Serum, Facial Moisturizer\n{'Package Dimensions': '6.93 x 5.35 x 2.64 inches; 14.5 Ounces'}\nYou get a full size serum, mini face wash, and mini moisturizer for the price of the serum.  Beautiful presentation makes an excellent gift. Love this set!  I started using these products when my skin was breaking out and upset.  These have completely calmed and fully moisturized my skin.  My skin is now glowing!\nExcellent hydration and fantastic deal!\nKaruna 7 Days of Glow - Face & Eye Mask Variety Pack (7 Sheets), Hydrate, Brighten and Glow\nKaruna\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.05 x 5.04 x 1.57 inches; 8.75 Ounces', 'UPC': '857950007333'}\nGreat packaging.
