  "reference_summary": "3D Mink Eyelashes Natural Long Lashes 2 in 1 Self-adhesive Eyeliner Instead of Adhesive 5 Different Styles Pairs Kits Sets with Tweezers , NO NEED GLUE\nPURELEOR\n{'Brand': 'PURELEOR', 'Material': 'Mink Fur', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Mounting Type': 'Eyelash Glue', 'Unit Count': '5.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '9 x 6 x 1 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '750810450143'}\nPros: it came with everything pictured, a lash applicator, the tube of \u201ceyeliner glue\u201d and 5 pairs of lashes in varying thickness. The box itself was nicely packaged. For reference, I used the thinnest/most natural pair at the top for my review.<br /><br />Cons: the tube of eyeliner was either sitting so long it completely dried up, or the glue caused the eyeliner to adhere to the inside of the tube, but it was almost impossible to get ANY of the liner on my lid.<br /><br />When I finally got a line to go on, it was akin to what attempting to using a dried up Expo on whiteboard looks like- I had to scrub the pen on my eyelid in an attempt to lay down any product at all, resulting in a very pitiful looking eyeliner application.<br /><br /> I fixed the lashes to the appropriate area, and within 5 minutes they were coming off at the corners. I tried to remedy the overall result somewhat by adding my own liner, and that example is on the second photo, bottom right corner (photo with eyeshadow applied).<br /><br />The lashes themselves were the quality you\u2019d expect from a multi pack at this price. Some of the individual lashes had fallen out as I opened the package as well.<br /><br />Final thoughts: just use eyelash glue and get quality lashes. It doesn\u2019t take any more time to apply and at least you can apply eyeliner to suit your taste.\nGlue + Eyeliner probably shouldn\u2019t mix\n7JHH WIGS Long Wavy Curly Wig With Bangs Natural Hair Dye Wig for Women (25inch, Red)\n7JHH WIGS\n{'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '13.78 x 8.66 x 1.57 inches', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy, Curly', 'Brand': '7JHH WIGS', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '13.78 x 8.66 x 1.57 inches; 12.7 Ounces', 'UPC': '682601933330'}\nThis wig is nice but a little thin, the value for money is great though.
