If you have really dark hair one side of the powder may work well for you but it applies almost like a marker (I did pat it on as you\u2019re supposed to), and I prefer a more natural look.\nReview Title: Okay but powders are too dark\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "3D Mink Eyelashes Natural Long Lashes 2 in 1 Self-adhesive Eyeliner Instead of Adhesive 5 Different Styles Pairs Kits Sets with Tweezers , NO NEED GLUE\nPURELEOR\n{'Brand': 'PURELEOR', 'Material': 'Mink Fur', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Mounting Type': 'Eyelash Glue', 'Unit Count': '5.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '9 x 6 x 1 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '750810450143'}\nPros: it came with everything pictured, a lash applicator, the tube of \u201ceyeliner glue\u201d and 5 pairs of lashes in varying thickness. The box itself was nicely packaged. For reference, I used the thinnest/most natural pair at the top for my review.<br /><br />Cons: the tube of eyeliner was either sitting so long it completely dried up, or the glue caused the eyeliner to adhere to the inside of the tube, but it was almost impossible to get ANY of the liner on my lid.<br /><br />When I finally got a line to go on, it was akin to what attempting to using a dried up Expo on whiteboard looks like- I had to scrub the pen on my eyelid in an attempt to lay down any product at all, resulting in a very pitiful looking eyeliner application.<br /><br /> I fixed the lashes to the appropriate area, and within 5 minutes they were coming off at the corners. I tried to remedy the overall result somewhat by adding my own liner, and that example is on the second photo, bottom right corner (photo with eyeshadow applied).<br /><br />The lashes themselves were the quality you\u2019d expect from a multi pack at this price. Some of the individual lashes had fallen out as I opened the package as well.<br /><br />Final thoughts: just use eyelash glue and get quality lashes. It doesn\u2019t take any more time to apply and at least you can apply eyeliner to suit your taste.\nGlue + Eyeliner probably shouldn\u2019t mix\n7JHH WIGS Long Wavy Curly Wig With Bangs Natural Hair Dye Wig for Women (25inch, Red)\n7JHH WIGS\n{'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '13.78 x 8.66 x 1.57 inches', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy, Curly', 'Brand': '7JHH WIGS', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '13.78 x 8.66 x 1.57 inches; 12.7 Ounces', 'UPC': '682601933330'}\nThis wig is nice but a little thin, the value for money is great though. The bangs especially are really cute if you get them positioned correctly.\nNice wig, a little thin\nOULAC Shine to Shine Velvet Matte Lipstick, Long Lasting Creamy Formula, Opaque Finish, Vegan Friendly, 3.6 grams / 0.12 ounces, Cranberries (Y09)\nOulac\n{'Brand': 'Oulac', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Finish Type': 'Matte,Velvet', 'Product Benefits': 'Long Lasting,Shine', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '3.9 x 0.68 x 0.68 inches; 1.23 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'velvet-matte-Y09'}\nThis lipstick is gorgeous! Applies very easily and comes in a steel lipstick container that seems very durable. Super cute packaging and the product goes on without issue. It does smudge some but as it\u2019s not a matte product that\u2019s to be expected, it\u2019s also not drying and feels great on the lips for all day wear.\nBeautiful, vibrant colors with nice smell\nOULAC Blush Mono 4.8g/0.16oz (One More time)\nOUL'AC\n['Smooth Glide', ': A silky, superfine blush delivers a burst of buildable colors that are designed for every skin tone.

It\u2019s a soft pink color that goes on easily and is smooth and creamy when applying.

This would be a great wig for daily wear or cosplay, if you\u2019re doing daily wear I\u2019d suggest thinning it a little unless you like the fuller appearance. On me it looks like too much volume so i used thinning scissors and corrected that and then was able to apply the wig and wear it without issue! It looks great and realistic.\nCute wig for a great price, easy to wear\nEyebrow Stamp Stencil Kit 2 Colors Waterproof and Long Lasting One Step Easy Color Brow Stamp with 24 Eyebrow Stencils, 1 Brush and 1 Razor, Dark Brown and Light Brown\nMarine Forest\n{'Brand': 'Marine Forest', 'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Finish Type': 'Natural', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Product Benefits': 'Long Lasting', 'Product Dimensions': '4.65 x 0.67 x 0.67 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'ES7010-2brown', 'UPC': '762403888318'}\nIt works fine and the stencils are made well, but the powders themselves are weirdly colored- one is too dark and the other is almost orange.
