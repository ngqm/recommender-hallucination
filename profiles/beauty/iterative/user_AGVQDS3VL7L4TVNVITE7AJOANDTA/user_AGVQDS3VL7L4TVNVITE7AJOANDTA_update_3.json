It doesn\u2019t contain aluminum. As it states, a little goes a long way. I work in Nursing so my workload is very heavy and I sweat a lot. I\u2019m still smelling fresh when using this. It\u2019s easy to apply. Just grab a pinch, rub it between two fingers and apply. You don\u2019t need to use a lot. It has a nice consistency. Not sticky. Not too think or too thick. Doesn\u2019t stain hands or clothing. I wish the scent was a bit stronger but I still love it overall.\nReview Title: Pretty Frank Natural Deodorant Jar- No Aluminum Deodorant\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
