The problem is the liner its, not the greatest, it's tacky and doesn't hold the lashes as well as other sets I have tried. I use the lashes with other liners and they work.\nReview Title: Great Lashes, poor liner\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

She loves using this dryer, it's easy to operate and cuts down on drying time. It was harmless, and it works with all kinds of nail polish, not just Gel. It is really fast and would be great if you are in a hurry. My daughter approves\nNail salon quality at home\n75 Pcs Hair Scrunchies Velvet Elastic Hair Bands Scrunchie Soft Hair Ties Ropes Scrunchy Ponytail Holder Hair Accessories,Great Gift for halloween Thanksgiving day and Christmas\nCehomi\n{'Material': 'Silk', 'Item Form': 'Scrunchie', 'Brand': 'Cehomi', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '7.94 x 6.74 x 2.74 inches', 'Hair Type': 'Thick, Thin', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '7.94 x 6.74 x 2.74 inches; 4.16 Ounces', 'UPC': '742186023960'}\nThese are cute in the picture and they look adorable in my kid's hair, but they are inconsistent, only two have the really long material and they are not the best colors to match any of our clothes. The others have the short little ties and they just feel really cheap. They come pretied and all of the shorter Scrunchies are dull in color. My older kids like to wear them on their wrist but they don't like these they felt itchy, We will still wear them but mostly around the house.\nMixed Lot\nWbfwbb 5 Pcs Cheetah Scrunchie Hair Scrunchies Velvet Elastic Hair Bands Scrunchy Bobbles Soft Hair Ties Ropes Scrunchie for Women or Girls Hair Accessories - 5 Leopard Assorted Color Scrunchies\nWbfwbb\n{'Material': 'Plastic, Rubber', 'Item Form': 'Scrunchie', 'Brand': 'Wbfwbb', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Number of Pieces': '5', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.8 x 4.96 x 1.54 inches; 1.98 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Wbfwbb'}\nReally cute set of functional scrunchies.

These are very comfortable and we really like the turban style more than the pearl, it just looks really fancy. We wear the turban headbands for everyday wear, they wear them to school, which I like it keeps their hair out of there eyes.  These are all sturdy and comfortable, with no irritation to my head or behind my ears. I wear them and my kids all wear these so they fit everyone. I like that the fabric covers the entire band so nothing is sticking or poking your head. This set has 9 headbands my daughter has one on and not pictured.\nCute for my kids hair\nMagnetic Eyelashes and Magnetic Eyeliner Kit, Magnetic Eyelashes with Eyeliner, 5 Pairs Reusable Magnetic Eyelashes with Tweezer, False Lashes\nEyenjoy\n{'Brand': 'Eyenjoy', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '5.71 x 5.39 x 0.71 inches', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Mounting Type': 'Magnet', 'Product Dimensions': '5.71 x 5.39 x 0.71 inches; 2.12 Ounces', 'UPC': '736067423758'}\nI am in love with this Magnetic Eyelashes kit. I have tried other brands before and really hated the eyeliner. This set has a precision eyeliner. It goes on so smooth and straight really love it and it makes the eyelashes to stick easily. I will say that you have to really apply a good amount of eyeliner all the way across the lid for the magnetic strips to work. It does take time and practice to really get the hang of these, but I find them so much easier than glue.\nMagnetic Eyelashes\nSam&Helen Magnetic Eyelashes With Eyeliner Kit, 5Pairs Magnetic Eyelashes And 2 Tubes Magnetic Eyeliners With Eyelash Applicator-No Glue Needed\nSam&Helen\n{'Brand': 'Sam&Helen', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '5.51 x 5.71 x 0.63 inches', 'Material Feature': 'Gluten Free', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Mounting Type': 'Eyelash Glue', 'Product Dimensions': '5.51 x 5.71 x 0.63 inches; 2.4 Ounces'}\nWhat I love about these magnetic lashes set is the lashes, you get 5 full sets of lashes that are all voluminous and look great on.
