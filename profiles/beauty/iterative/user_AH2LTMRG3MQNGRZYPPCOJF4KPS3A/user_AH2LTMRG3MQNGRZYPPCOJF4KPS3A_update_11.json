  "reference_summary": "UV Light for Nails,LKE Curing Lamp for Gel Nail Polish 54W UV Led Light Gel Nail Starter Kit Nail Dryer Accessories\nLKE\n{'Brand': 'LKE', 'Light Source Type': 'LED', 'Number of Light Sources': '2', 'Wattage': '54 watts', 'Control Method': 'App', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '9.45 x 8.7 x 5.08 inches; 2 Pounds', 'Batteries': '1 Lithium Ion batteries required.'}\nMy teenager is a nail fanatic, she changes her nail color at least twice a week. She loves using this dryer, it's easy to operate and cuts down on drying time. It was harmless, and it works with all kinds of nail polish, not just Gel. It is really fast and would be great if you are in a hurry. My daughter approves\nNail salon quality at home\n75 Pcs Hair Scrunchies Velvet Elastic Hair Bands Scrunchie Soft Hair Ties Ropes Scrunchy Ponytail Holder Hair Accessories,Great Gift for halloween Thanksgiving day and Christmas\nCehomi\n{'Material': 'Silk', 'Item Form': 'Scrunchie', 'Brand': 'Cehomi', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '7.94 x 6.74 x 2.74 inches', 'Hair Type': 'Thick, Thin', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '7.94 x 6.74 x 2.74 inches; 4.16 Ounces', 'UPC': '742186023960'}\nThese are cute in the picture and they look adorable in my kid's hair, but they are inconsistent, only two have the really long material and they are not the best colors to match any of our clothes. The others have the short little ties and they just feel really cheap. They come pretied and all of the shorter Scrunchies are dull in color. My older kids like to wear them on their wrist but they don't like these they felt itchy, We will still wear them but mostly around the house.\nMixed Lot\nWbfwbb 5 Pcs Cheetah Scrunchie Hair Scrunchies Velvet Elastic Hair Bands Scrunchy Bobbles Soft Hair Ties Ropes Scrunchie for Women or Girls Hair Accessories - 5 Leopard Assorted Color Scrunchies\nWbfwbb\n{'Material': 'Plastic, Rubber', 'Item Form': 'Scrunchie', 'Brand': 'Wbfwbb', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Number of Pieces': '5', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.8 x 4.96 x 1.54 inches; 1.98 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Wbfwbb'}\nReally cute set of functional scrunchies. These are really well made and hold up hair all day. I like that each one is different, they are each super soft made with a velvet feeling material. These are great for putting up your hair in a quick minute.\nVelvety Scrunchies\n9 Pack Headbands Set -Messen Fashion Velvet Wide Hairband with Pearl Knitted Floral Fabric Cute Elegant Vintage Cross Knot Turban Elastic Hair Hoop Headwrap for Women Girls Hair Accessories\nMessen\n{'Package Dimensions': '10.8 x 6.6 x 2.1 inches; 14.07 Ounces'}\nI have 4 daughters and we all wear these headbands. These are very comfortable and we really like the turban style more than the pearl, it just looks really fancy. We wear the turban headbands for everyday wear, they wear them to school, which I like it keeps their hair out of there eyes.  These are all sturdy and comfortable, with no irritation to my head or behind my ears. I wear them and my kids all wear these so they fit everyone. I like that the fabric covers the entire band so nothing is sticking or poking your head. This set has 9 headbands my daughter has one on and not pictured.\nCute for my kids hair\nMagnetic Eyelashes and Magnetic Eyeliner Kit, Magnetic Eyelashes with Eyeliner, 5 Pairs Reusable Magnetic Eyelashes with Tweezer, False Lashes\nEyenjoy\n{'Brand': 'Eyenjoy', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '5.71 x 5.39 x 0.71 inches', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Mounting Type': 'Magnet', 'Product Dimensions': '5.71 x 5.39 x 0.71 inches; 2.12 Ounces', 'UPC': '736067423758'}\nI am in love with this Magnetic Eyelashes kit. I have tried other brands before and really hated the eyeliner. This set has a precision eyeliner. It goes on so smooth and straight really love it and it makes the eyelashes to stick easily. I will say that you have to really apply a good amount of eyeliner all the way across the lid for the magnetic strips to work. It does take time and practice to really get the hang of these, but I find them so much easier than glue.\nMagnetic Eyelashes\nSam&Helen Magnetic Eyelashes With Eyeliner Kit, 5Pairs Magnetic Eyelashes And 2 Tubes Magnetic Eyeliners With Eyelash Applicator-No Glue Needed\nSam&Helen\n{'Brand': 'Sam&Helen', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '5.51 x 5.71 x 0.63 inches', 'Material Feature': 'Gluten Free', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Mounting Type': 'Eyelash Glue', 'Product Dimensions': '5.51 x 5.71 x 0.63 inches; 2.4 Ounces'}\nWhat I love about these magnetic lashes set is the lashes, you get 5 full sets of lashes that are all voluminous and look great on. The problem is the liner its, not the greatest, it's tacky and doesn't hold the lashes as well as other sets I have tried. I use the lashes with other liners and they work.\nGreat Lashes, poor liner\nEye Shadow Switching Pan and Removable Sponge for Makeup Supplies\nGlamlily\n{'Brand': 'Glamlily', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'For Eyeshadow', 'Material': 'Silver', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Ferrule Material': 'Aluminum', 'Package Dimensions': '3.62 x 3.62 x 1.65 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '194425305670'}\nThis Eye Shadow Switching Pan is great to help clean your brushes in between colors and uses. I do see the color on the sponge but I haven't seen any kick back on in the tin. So I guess it is working. It is easy to switch and clean.\nEye Shadow Switching Pan\nAvajar Blue LED Hydrating Cream Mask 5 Pack - Hydrating Face Masks for Women | Moisturizing Face Mask for Girls | Collagen Face Sheet Masks Set | Korean Face Mask Sheets Pack | Sheet Mask For Face\na DAILY SELF-CARE COSMETICS avajar\n{'Brand': 'a DAILY SELF-CARE COSMETICS avajar', 'Item Form': 'Cream, Sheet', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Moisture', 'Scent': 'Hydrating', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Product Dimensions': '5.67 x 0.98 x 7.28 inches; 6.38 Ounces'}\nI really like using these masks.

The jade roller and Gua Sha are pretty pink. I do use them regularly to massage my face especially at my jaw line, not sure if you can really tell a difference. Still a nice set.\nJade Face Roller\nYUHFERA Press on Nails Kit 30Pcs Fake Nails Short Coffin Nail Tips with Designs Solid Color Full Cover False Nails Set Artificial Acrylic Nails for DIY Nail Art Salon Women Girls Gift(Cyber)\nYUHFERA\n{'Size': 'Medium', 'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'YUHFERA', 'Style': 'French', 'Coverage': 'Full Well Tips', 'Package Dimensions': '2.8 x 2.8 x 1 inches; 1.6 Ounces', 'UPC': '785382442203'}\nThese were not great nails, they wear very short and ill-fitting and the designs had china written all over them.\nPress on Nails\nLordHighting 240 Pieces Halloween Party/ Ball Press on False Nails with Design, 12 Sizes Medium and Long Full Cover Gloss Fake Nails for Woman and Girls\nLordHighting\n{'Size': 'Medium', 'Material': 'Plastic', 'Brand': 'LordHighting', 'Style': 'French', 'Coverage': 'Full Well Tips', 'Product Dimensions': '7.68 x 3.35 x 1.06 inches; 3.84 Ounces'}\n240 Pieces Halloween Party/ Ball Press on False Nails.
