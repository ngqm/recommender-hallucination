These are very comfortable and we really like the turban style more than the pearl, it just looks really fancy. We wear the turban headbands for everyday wear, they wear them to school, which I like it keeps their hair out of there eyes.  These are all sturdy and comfortable, with no irritation to my head or behind my ears. I wear them and my kids all wear these so they fit everyone. I like that the fabric covers the entire band so nothing is sticking or poking your head. This set has 9 headbands my daughter has one on and not pictured.\nReview Title: Cute for my kids hair\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

She loves using this dryer, it's easy to operate and cuts down on drying time. It was harmless, and it works with all kinds of nail polish, not just Gel. It is really fast and would be great if you are in a hurry.

The others have the short little ties and they just feel really cheap. They come pretied and all of the shorter Scrunchies are dull in color. My older kids like to wear them on their wrist but they don't like these they felt itchy, We will still wear them but mostly around the house.\nMixed Lot\nWbfwbb 5 Pcs Cheetah Scrunchie Hair Scrunchies Velvet Elastic Hair Bands Scrunchy Bobbles Soft Hair Ties Ropes Scrunchie for Women or Girls Hair Accessories - 5 Leopard Assorted Color Scrunchies\nWbfwbb\n{'Material': 'Plastic, Rubber', 'Item Form': 'Scrunchie', 'Brand': 'Wbfwbb', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Number of Pieces': '5', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.8 x 4.96 x 1.54 inches; 1.98 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Wbfwbb'}\nReally cute set of functional scrunchies.
