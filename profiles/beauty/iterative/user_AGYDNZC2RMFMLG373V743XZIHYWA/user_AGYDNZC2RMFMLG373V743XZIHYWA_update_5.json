I only bought one pack to try them, but will get more. They are super comfortable, don't bother me when sleeping, haven't fallen out or anything, and blend into my hair which is dyed pink and purple fairly well. I have bought blue, pink, and purple so far.<br /><br />However, even though my hair is thin, I will need more than one pack. I'm happy to buy more though, now that I've tried them. I have a looped extensions brush and mostly use dry shampoo so my real hair won't fade too much, but no issues with washing or brushing the extensions.  too. Good value and I like them.\nI was impressed for the price\nUnny Club Black Square Lipstick (Magenta) | matte lipstick\nUNNY CLUB\n{'Brand': 'UNNY CLUB', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Item Form': 'Stick', 'Finish Type': 'Matte', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '2.8 x 0.91 x 0.87 inches; 1.13 Ounces'}\nI liked the very creamy texture, seemed to also be nicely pigmented. However, the magenta had more orangish tones than I would have liked. Still, I liked the lipstick and the tube is pretty cool; it is magnetic and the top snaps back on. I'm sure I would like some of the other colors better though.\nNice texture\nTOUCH IN SOL Best of No Pore Blem Travel Kit - Face Makeup Primer, Big Pores Perfect Cover, Inner-Glowing Skin with Moisture, Long Lasting Makeup's Staying Kit\nTouch in Sol\n{'Brand': 'Touch in Sol', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Package Information': 'Tube', 'Item Volume': '0.5 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '6.46 x 5.39 x 1.14 inches; 5.12 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'no pore blem kit'}\nI had tried another pore reducing creme from this brand before and liked it, and I felt the same way about these products. They smell nice, and come in attractive packaging. They make your skin look and feel great, and they smell nice. They reduce the appearance of large pores and work well at night or before putting on makeup.
