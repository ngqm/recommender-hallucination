  "reference_summary": "Blue Hair Extensions Tape in Human Hair 16\" Soft Straight Tape-in Brazilian Hair Extensions 30grams 20pcs Glue Remy Hair\nLicoville\n{'Brand': 'Licoville', 'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Extension Length': '16 Inches', 'Style': 'Straight', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '9.3 x 4 x 0.7 inches; 1.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '746860435735'}\nMy hair is thin and tends to break off around my shoulders, so I got these for length. I only bought one pack to try them, but will get more. They are super comfortable, don't bother me when sleeping, haven't fallen out or anything, and blend into my hair which is dyed pink and purple fairly well. I have bought blue, pink, and purple so far.<br /><br />However, even though my hair is thin, I will need more than one pack. I'm happy to buy more though, now that I've tried them. I have a looped extensions brush and mostly use dry shampoo so my real hair won't fade too much, but no issues with washing or brushing the extensions.  too. Good value and I like them.\nI was impressed for the price\nUnny Club Black Square Lipstick (Magenta) | matte lipstick\nUNNY CLUB\n{'Brand': 'UNNY CLUB', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Item Form': 'Stick', 'Finish Type': 'Matte', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '2.8 x 0.91 x 0.87 inches; 1.13 Ounces'}\nI liked the very creamy texture, seemed to also be nicely pigmented. However, the magenta had more orangish tones than I would have liked. Still, I liked the lipstick and the tube is pretty cool; it is magnetic and the top snaps back on. I'm sure I would like some of the other colors better though.\nNice texture\nTOUCH IN SOL Best of No Pore Blem Travel Kit - Face Makeup Primer, Big Pores Perfect Cover, Inner-Glowing Skin with Moisture, Long Lasting Makeup's Staying Kit\nTouch in Sol\n{'Brand': 'Touch in Sol', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Package Information': 'Tube', 'Item Volume': '0.5 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '6.46 x 5.39 x 1.14 inches; 5.12 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'no pore blem kit'}\nI had tried another pore reducing creme from this brand before and liked it, and I felt the same way about these products. They smell nice, and come in attractive packaging. They make your skin look and feel great, and they smell nice. They reduce the appearance of large pores and work well at night or before putting on makeup. These are also handy travel size containers.\nGood set of skincare items\nLip Liner Set 12 Colors Natural Lip Liner Makeup Pencil Long Lasting Matte Velvet Lip Liner\nMarine Forest\n{'Brand': 'Marine Forest', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Item Form': 'Pencil', 'Finish Type': 'Matte,Velvet', 'Product Benefits': 'Smoothening', 'Package Dimensions': '6.5 x 2.28 x 0.94 inches; 2.24 Ounces', 'UPC': '729843711958'}\nThese have a nice selection of lipliner colors. They are pre-sharpened, creamy, and don't seem to smudge. The set I got have a nice range of red/purples and also greenish and black colors. They go on well and the larger pack has some good variety so you only have to buy one set for all your needs.\nGood selection\nMAEPEOR Black Glossy Lipgloss Black Nourishing Plumping Lip Gloss Luscious-colors Non-Sticky Shine Glossy Lipgloss\nMAEPEOR\n{'Brand': 'MAEPEOR', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Finish Type': 'Glossy', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Softening,Smoothening,Shine,Cold,Nourishing,Moisturizing,Gentle,Makeup', 'Specialty': 'Natural', 'Product Dimensions': '1.18 x 0.39 x 0.39 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nI got this mainly for the black, but I'm sure I will wear the other colors as well. There is also a dark purple/red and a more chocolately brown color. The texture is smooth and not sticky, and moisturizing. Could be worn by itself or over another color of matte lipstick, etc. for different looks.\nGood texture and very shiny\nLoose Face Powder Long Lasting and Waterproof Oil Control Moisturizing Setting Powder Makeup 1.76 Oz\nMarine Forest\n{'Package Dimensions': '2.76 x 2.76 x 1.57 inches; 3.17 Ounces', 'UPC': '762403926959'}\nThis setting powder worked well for various types of makeup, everyday makeup as well as for some YouTube videos in which I wore greasepaint/Halloween makeup. The container is also pretty cool, it is square shaped, which makes it seem to fit better in makeup cases. I have a lot of the round makeup setting powder containers which aren't very stackable and don't make the best use of space, in my opinion, so that's also kind of cool.\nGood setting powder\nOULAC Shine to Shine Moisture Shine Lipstick, Glossy Finish, Vegan Friendly, 2.2 grams / 0.07 ounces, She Pop (06)\nOulac\n{'Brand': 'Oulac', 'Item Form': 'Stick', 'Finish Type': 'Glossy', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Product Benefits': 'Moisturizing,Nourishing', 'Product Dimensions': '3.84 x 0.59 x 0.59 inches; 0.08 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'moistureshine-lipstick-06'}\nThis made my lips look pinkish, which is my favorite lipstick color. I don't like red on myself, I feel like it looks too severe on me. This is noteworthy for the feel of it, it's glossy and very moisturizing. I have dry skin overall and that also applies to my lips, so even if I wear a matte lipstick with a nice color i have to put something more moist on top, usually. The tube is nice also, seems good quality and won't come open in your bag like some lipsticks can, so that's appreciated. Even if my lips are dry this feels very nice.\nGreat feel and moisturizing\nZUK Black Matte Lipstick 2Pcs Suede Cream Liquid Lipstick Set for Women, Vegan and Cruelty Free, 0.34 Fl Oz\nZUK\n{'Brand': 'ZUK', 'Item Form': 'Cream,Liquid', 'Product Benefits': 'Softening,Smoothening,Long-lasting,Makeup', 'Coverage': 'Full', 'Specialty': 'Cruelty,Cruelty Free,Natural', 'Product Dimensions': '4.72 x 0.87 x 0.87 inches; 2.12 Ounces'}\nThis is two tubes of black lip gloss which is nicely pigmented and very creamy.
