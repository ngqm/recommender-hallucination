And boy am I sorry I had given so many settings away to charities over the years as I've moved, thinking I'd just get some nicer plates.  Well, I do have &#34;nicer&#34; (aka at least more expensive, anyways) plates, and had gone through that whole phase w the bridal registry picks, fancy parties and such. Lately tho, I am back to ease of use, and simple living is far more important to me. I've been purchasing Corelle plates and bowls again, which I like to use the most, because nothing beats their lightweight and thin design, and I love their bright designs, like this newer South Beach pattern, which is just very Happy.  Some things just are good, and stay good, no matter how many years pass.\nReview Title: Awesome Corelle. What's Not to Love?\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
