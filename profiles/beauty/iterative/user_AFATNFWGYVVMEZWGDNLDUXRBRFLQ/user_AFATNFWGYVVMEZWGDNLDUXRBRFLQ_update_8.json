The texture is also smooth and heavy, but it's slippery or shiny. This fits my head very comfortably and looked great out of the box with very little plucking or adjusting. This is one of my more worn wigs. I'd definitely recommend.\nReview Title: Realistic and Fits So Well\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Imstyle Drag Queens Wig Wavy Ash Brown Heat Resistant Synthetic Lace Wig\nIMSTYLE\n{'Hair Type': 'Wavy', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Special Feature': 'Heat Resistant', 'Brand': 'IMSTYLE', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '9.21 x 6.5 x 2.4 inches; 13.05 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'CWN5#16/8', 'UPC': '795400523081'}\nAmazing quality and realistic looking product. Imstyle's Ash Brown. I hope they bring this back. After trying out so many wigs for fun and costuming, this is IT. I would buy this again in a heartbeat.\nAmazing. This Looks So Real. Color is Fantastic\nCORELLE Livingware South Beach 8.5\" Plate (Set of 4), 8.5 Inch (Pack of 4)\nCorelle\n['Corelle Livingware South Beach 8.5\" Plate (Set of 4)']\n{'Material': 'Glass', 'Brand': 'Corelle', 'Color': 'Nipple-471', 'Special Feature': 'Alcohol-Free', 'Occasion': 'Beach', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '10 x 10 x 1 inches; 8.64 Ounces', 'Item model number': '1113999', 'Department': 'Womens', 'UPC': '071160081611 793842466546 735343339578', 'Manufacturer': 'CORELLE'}\nWhen I was a kid, we'd always had these around our home- different patterns of course, but the same Corelle glass plate sets that I still love today. And boy am I sorry I had given so many settings away to charities over the years as I've moved, thinking I'd just get some nicer plates.  Well, I do have &#34;nicer&#34; (aka at least more expensive, anyways) plates, and had gone through that whole phase w the bridal registry picks, fancy parties and such. Lately tho, I am back to ease of use, and simple living is far more important to me. I've been purchasing Corelle plates and bowls again, which I like to use the most, because nothing beats their lightweight and thin design, and I love their bright designs, like this newer South Beach pattern, which is just very Happy.  Some things just are good, and stay good, no matter how many years pass.\nAwesome Corelle. What's Not to Love?\n1 Ounce Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Skin \u2013 Hydrating Facial Moisturizer with Anti-Aging Skin Care Properties. Beauty and Skin Care\nTemer\n{'Brand': 'Temer', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Active Ingredients': 'Hyaluronic_acid', 'Unit Count': '1 Fl. Oz', 'Number of Items': '1'}\nThis Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Skin \u2013 Hydrating Facial Moisturizer is a very good moisturizing acid, with the benefit of stimulating skin sloughing and renewal over time. The texture is like a lightweight syrup (but not sticky), and it has very little fragrance. This goes on the face smoothly and provides a protective, lightly moisturizing feel that does not sting at all. I like how my face feels very soft and dewy when I wake up, as I use this before bedtime. I think my skin has definitely improved in texture over the few weeks I've used this.\nLightly Moisturizing and Non-Stinging\nSegbeauty empty bottle 290\nTruuMe\n{'Brand': 'Segbeauty', 'Color': 'Clear', 'Material Type Free': 'Dairy Free', 'Item Weight': '3.4 Ounces', 'Bottle Nipple Type': 'Vented', 'Package Dimensions': '7.99 x 3.19 x 2.24 inches; 3.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'AM-160083-03', 'UPC': '701822757553 701822760621'}\nThis Fine Mist Clear Bottles, Segbeauty 5.4oz/160ml Continuous Plastic Spray Squirt Bottle is a unique style spray bottle that mists fairly well, without the typical pump action you need with regular manual spray bottles. This has a pressurized lever that provides a longer spray with one squeeze. The mist is fine, but not quite as fine as I was hoping- it's more granular than a steamer or vibration dispenser (like cool mist vaporizers), but this is manual, so I guess I'm complaining for no reason. For a hand pump spray, this is a very good (fine) spray overall.  They recommend that you not put anything but water in the device, and I'm guessing that may be due to it being easy to clog. So, if you do add some other products in the bottle, just be aware that it's not recommended.\nUnique, Manual Squeeze-type Water Spray\nNail Files and Buffers, Teenitor 16PCS Professional Nail Manicure Tool for Acrylic Nails, 100/180 and 120/240 Grits Emery Boards 120 Grits Nail Buffer Block for Shaping and Buffing Nails\nTeenitor\n{'Package Dimensions': '7 x 6 x 1 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nThis Teenitor Nail File And Buffer gives you quite a bit of product at a good price. This includes the 10 large 2 sided nail files as well as the 6 soft sponge smoothing finishers. These work well for either smoothing out the ridges on your natural nails, or doing doing a final once over for a clean finish. I wouldn't be using these for the first pass on acrylics though, as the grit is too fine. This is a good value set.\nGood Value For A Finishing Smoother Set\nSliver Grey Hair Color Wax Temporary Hairstyle Cream 4.23 oz Hair Pomades Natural White Hairstyle Wax for Party Cosplay Halloween Date (Grey)\u2026\nSOVONCARE\n{'Hair Type': 'All', 'Item Form': 'Wax', 'Brand': 'SOVONCARE', 'Unit Count': '4.23 Fl Oz', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2.94 x 2.94 x 2.11 inches; 6.38 Ounces', 'UPC': '725732252984'}\nI have about 5 different colors of this Mofajang Hair Color Wax Temporary Hairstyle Cream, and I purchased them before I got this gray sample to try. what I like about these products is that they add a temporary color to my already light grey hair- such as a pink or purple tinge or even a darker gray or darker blue gray...you get the picture. This easily adds a pastel color to my lighter hair with a smallish amount of product.  I could see that to change up dark hair or to get a strong/intense color tone, you'd need to pile this stuff on, and I think that's where this gets a bad rap. Yes, you can glob this on to higher opacity and change your dark colored hair to the color shown in the jar. BUT, you need a lot to do this, and you may not like the sticky, waxy result -it is wax, after all. If you are using a little bit (about a quarter sized blob) and adding this through your washed and wet hair and then blow dry, your hair will still move naturally and have the lighter tone of the product, provided your hair was fairly light to begin with-- just my two cents.\nVery Good For Some Purposes, Difficult For Others\n360 Pieces French False Nails Artificial Fingernails Pink White French Fake Nail Tips Kit 12 Sizes Full Cover with Nail Files and Stick for Salon DIY Decoration\nMudder\n{'Size': '370 Piece Set', 'Material': 'Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS)', 'Brand': 'Mudder', 'Style': 'French', 'Coverage': 'Full Well Tips', 'Product Dimensions': '7.09 x 1.97 x 0.79 inches; 1.76 Ounces'}\nHaving tried many fake nail tops, I know they fit differently for everyone. I feel very lucky that this particular set fits my nail bed very well- so much so that I barely have to file them to fit, and they conform to the curvature of my nail as well. These are on the slightly thinner side, which I prefer, because they feel and look a lot more natural on top. The length is perfect too- not too long.<br /><br />I lightly buffed the top of these and painted them w regular nail polish. If I polish without buffing, they can crinkle a bit - I have not tried gel yet tho, and that probably will work out w a clear top if I want to keep the white tip look. Even without polish, the buffed look just looks like a beautiful pink matte polish, as if I had painted them that way on purpose. Some commenters have said the white part scratches off somewhat easily. This is true. But, I love these for the natural look and great fit, and am buying another set now, so I never run out.\nBest Nails I've Tried- Very Good Fit For Me\nStraight 13x4 Lace Front Wigs Burgundy Lace Front Wigs Long Bob Synthetic Ombre Wine Red Wig Pre-plucked with Baby Hair Free Part Heat Resistant Synthetic Lace Wigs for Women 20 Inch\nNOBLE\n{'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Special Feature': 'Heat Resistant', 'Brand': 'NOBLE', 'Package Dimensions': '13.74 x 7.87 x 2.2 inches; 12.63 Ounces'}\nI really love this NOBLE Natural Straight Lace Front Wigs Burgundy Color- it's only slightly burgundy- and more auburn imo, but it looks very natural and not artificially colored.
