It does not have the best taste, so if you are someone who licks your lips you might not like the taste.  Otherwise, very effective lip balm.\nReview Title: Incredibly moisturizing\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Higher Education Skincare: Goal Digger - Silky Moisturizing Cucumber Creme; formulated for dry and sensitive skin; cucumber extract; natural extract: melon, kale, cabbage, ginger, turmeric - 1.7 fl oz\nHigher Education\n{'Brand': 'Higher Education', 'Scent': 'Cucumber', 'Item Form': 'Creme', 'Unit Count': '1.7 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2.88 x 2.88 x 2.13 inches; 7.2 Ounces', 'UPC': '811381032050'}\nThis is one of the most refreshing moisturizers I have tried, and I really like this one a lot!  It is very creamy and pale green in color, goes on smooth, and has a wonderful cucumber smell, but is much more subtle and not overpowering.  I have very dry skin, so am very happy that this moisturizer applies easily and absorbs into the skin very well.  It definitely makes dry skin look more alive.  Definitely a 5 star moisturizer!\nWonderful cucumber scent\nBlue Sage De-Puffing Caffeine Eye Serum | Natural Anti-Aging Eye Treatment with Probiotics, Green Tea + Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Face to Tighten and Hydrate under Eye Skin, and Brighten Dark Circles\nBlue Sage\n{'Package Dimensions': '6.06 x 1.65 x 1.42 inches; 4.69 Ounces', 'UPC': '860004070450', 'Manufacturer': 'Blue Sage Skin Co'}\nThe product itself works okay around my eyes as the listing stated it would and helps my under eye area look noticeably better.  It blends easily into the skin, and I did not need to use very much.  I like that you can also use it on your entire face if needed.  I tried that also, and found that while it brightens my face a bit, I do still need to apply a moisturizer over it to get proper hydration for my dry skin.  This serum has a very subtle, barely noticeable scent which is pleasant.<br /><br />Sadly, the pump dispenser on the bottle I received does not work at all. It does turn to lock and unlock, but no matter what I did the pump did not work.  So in order for me to use it I have to unscrew the cap every time, pull the pump tube out, and wipe some product from the pump tube.  This serum is very thick and more like a gel, so it is way too thick to tilt the bottle and expect a drop to come out.  The defective dispenser pump was a disappointment.\nSerum works but pump doesn\u2019t\nBH DERMCENTER Glycolic Acid Resurfacing Serum - Brightens and Clarifies Skin 1 oz\nBH DERMCENTER\n{'Skin Type': 'All Skin,All Skin Types', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'BH DERMCENTER', 'Item Form': 'Serum', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2 x 2 x 5 inches; 1 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'BHDGLYSER', 'UPC': '850004068144'}\nThis is an interesting product as I have not tried a glycolic serum before this.  This product has a very slight scent that is barely noticeable. It comes in an amber glass bottle with a dropper.  This serum has kind of a toning effect on my skin.  I am applying a thin layer followed by a moisturizer and can\u2019t believe how after just one week my skin feels noticeably smoother, much more than if I had just used the moisturizer alone.  And my face definitely looks brighter.  Last but not least, I didn\u2019t have to use very much because it spreads well, and a little goes a long way.\nTones and smooths\nKISSIO Color Changing Lipstick,Discoloration and Moisture retention,Temperature Sense Changing Color,Long Lasting Color,Fresh Colors(03#Orange)\nKISSIO\n{'Brand': 'KISSIO', 'Item Form': 'Stick', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Information': 'Tube', 'Package Type': 'Tube', 'Package Dimensions': '3.3 x 0.9 x 0.9 inches; 0.81 Ounces'}\nI honestly do not know if I've ever had lipstick or any cosmetics with snail slime extract as one of the main ingredients, but it is supposed to be very hydrating in that it contains hyaluronic acid and also is supposed to help skin heal.  This lipstick is definitely hydrating and my lips feel better when I am wearing it.  I also like that the coloring is softer and more subtle than most other lipsticks I have used and looks more natural.  Testing it on my cheeks and it added a soft pinkish glow.  This lipstick has an elegant looking casing that snaps shut.  I do like this product and it seems to stay on longer than my other lipsticks and longer than chapstick as well.\nReally hydrates my lips\nSHIONLE - Semi Matte Air Lipstick: Creamy semi matte lipstick | Long Lasting | Great Coverage | Creamy Texture | 03 FLAMINGO PINK | 3.3g\nSHIONLE\n{'Brand': 'SHIONLE', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Finish Type': 'Matte', 'Product Benefits': 'Long Lasting,Moisturizing', 'Product Dimensions': '1 x 3 x 1 inches; 0.12 Ounces'}\nI ordered the Flamingo Pink color lipstick.  It's a really pretty color but I think it looks more like a dark apricot than pink.  Still, it looks really nice on, it applies well, and for me the color lasted pretty well.  It's kind of like a satin as opposed to matte.  It's not quite as moisturizing as I had hoped, but I am still happy with it.\nPretty color\nGLY MIRACLE Moisturizing Lip Balm Bundle of Three (3) SPF 30 Natural Elixir of Aloe Vera, Bees Wax, Coconut Oil, Lanolin, Shea Butter to help repair, protect, nourish and soften lips\nGLY MIRACLE\n{'Brand': 'GLY MIRACLE', 'Item Form': 'Balm', 'Finish Type': 'Natural', 'Sun Protection': '30 SPF', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '3.07 x 2.87 x 0.75 inches; 1.13 Ounces'}\nWhat I like most about this is the degree to which this balm moisturizes and softens my lip, and it stays on for a long time.  It does not have the best taste, so if you are someone who licks your lips you might not like the taste.  Otherwise, very effective lip balm.\nIncredibly moisturizing",
