It blends easily into the skin, and I did not need to use very much.  I like that you can also use it on your entire face if needed.  I tried that also, and found that while it brightens my face a bit, I do still need to apply a moisturizer over it to get proper hydration for my dry skin.  This serum has a very subtle, barely noticeable scent which is pleasant.<br /><br />Sadly, the pump dispenser on the bottle I received does not work at all. It does turn to lock and unlock, but no matter what I did the pump did not work.  So in order for me to use it I have to unscrew the cap every time, pull the pump tube out, and wipe some product from the pump tube.  This serum is very thick and more like a gel, so it is way too thick to tilt the bottle and expect a drop to come out.  The defective dispenser pump was a disappointment.\nReview Title: Serum works but pump doesn\u2019t\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

It is very creamy and pale green in color, goes on smooth, and has a wonderful cucumber smell, but is much more subtle and not overpowering.  I have very dry skin, so am very happy that this moisturizer applies easily and absorbs into the skin very well.  It definitely makes dry skin look more alive.  Definitely a 5 star moisturizer!\nWonderful cucumber scent\nBlue Sage De-Puffing Caffeine Eye Serum | Natural Anti-Aging Eye Treatment with Probiotics, Green Tea + Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Face to Tighten and Hydrate under Eye Skin, and Brighten Dark Circles\nBlue Sage\n{'Package Dimensions': '6.06 x 1.65 x 1.42 inches; 4.69 Ounces', 'UPC': '860004070450', 'Manufacturer': 'Blue Sage Skin Co'}\nThe product itself works okay around my eyes as the listing stated it would and helps my under eye area look noticeably better.
