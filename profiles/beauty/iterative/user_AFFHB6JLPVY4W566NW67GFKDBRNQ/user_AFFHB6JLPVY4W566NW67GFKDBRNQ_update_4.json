You get two of each color.  The only thing I did not like is that these hair ties have a paint smell to them so wash them before wearing them.\nGood\nSTYLEAGAL Portable Electric Nail Drill, Manicure Pedicure Drill Kit Professional nail starter kit for beginners acrylic with drill\uff082020 Upgraded\uff09\nstyleagal\n{'Brand': 'styleagal', 'Voltage': '5 Volts', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.8 x 4.5 x 2 inches; 8.01 Ounces', 'UPC': '782913461771', 'Manufacturer': 'STYLEAGAL'}\n[[VIDEOID:c1d81e3cfad618ed65e971a49ab65264]] This is a nice drill great for beginners.  Just take some practice to get good at using it on your self and others hand.  The power cord is not long enough and the drill bits is hard to push them in and to pull out.  If you have never used a drill start working with the lower speed first.\nWorks very well\nPretty Frank Natural Deodorant Jar- No Aluminum Deodorant for Women, Men, Teens, & Kids \u2013 Paraben Sulfate Free Cream Deodorant with Shea Butter, Coconut Oil, Vitamin E & Baking Soda (Jasmine)\nPRETTY FRANK\n{'Brand': 'PRETTY FRANK', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Scent': 'Jasmine, Coconut', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '3.42 x 2.79 x 2.59 inches; 5.61 Ounces'}\nI like the fact that its organic and made in the US. However, this is not a deodorant for someone who is on the move. I do have sweaty underarms and I had to clean my armpits and apply this several times a day to be dry.  I don't like that I have to put this on with my fingers.  I was dry long as I wasn't moving around to much and in a cool place.  The jasmine scent is wonderful.  It is a small jar but you get a lot.\nNot for me\nYsesoAi 28 Pcs Hair Curlers Spiral Curls No Heat Wave Hair Curlers Styling Kit Spiral Hair Curlers Magic Hair Rollers with 2 Pieces Styling Hooks for Most Kinds of Hairstyles (20 cm/ 7.8 inches)\nYsesoAi\n{'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Brand': 'YsesoAi', 'Color': 'Pink, Blue, Ivory, Yellow, Green', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '1.5 x 1.7 x 1.1 inches', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Product Dimensions': '1.5 x 1.7 x 1.1 inches; 6.38 Ounces', 'UPC': '745895771436'}\nMy hair is naturally curly so , I wanted to see how it would do on a blowout.
