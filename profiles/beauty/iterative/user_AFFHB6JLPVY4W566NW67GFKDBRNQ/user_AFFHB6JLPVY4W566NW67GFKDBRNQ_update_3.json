However, this is not a deodorant for someone who is on the move. I do have sweaty underarms and I had to clean my armpits and apply this several times a day to be dry.  I don't like that I have to put this on with my fingers.  I was dry long as I wasn't moving around to much and in a cool place.  The jasmine scent is wonderful.  It is a small jar but you get a lot.\nReview Title: Not for me\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Just take some practice to get good at using it on your self and others hand.  The power cord is not long enough and the drill bits is hard to push them in and to pull out.  If you have never used a drill start working with the lower speed first.\nWorks very well\nPretty Frank Natural Deodorant Jar- No Aluminum Deodorant for Women, Men, Teens, & Kids \u2013 Paraben Sulfate Free Cream Deodorant with Shea Butter, Coconut Oil, Vitamin E & Baking Soda (Jasmine)\nPRETTY FRANK\n{'Brand': 'PRETTY FRANK', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Scent': 'Jasmine, Coconut', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '3.42 x 2.79 x 2.59 inches; 5.61 Ounces'}\nI like the fact that its organic and made in the US.
