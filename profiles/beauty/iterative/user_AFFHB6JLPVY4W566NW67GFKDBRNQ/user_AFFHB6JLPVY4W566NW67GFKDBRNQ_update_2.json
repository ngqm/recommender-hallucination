Just take some practice to get good at using it on your self and others hand.  The power cord is not long enough and the drill bits is hard to push them in and to pull out.  If you have never used a drill start working with the lower speed first.\nReview Title: Works very well\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
