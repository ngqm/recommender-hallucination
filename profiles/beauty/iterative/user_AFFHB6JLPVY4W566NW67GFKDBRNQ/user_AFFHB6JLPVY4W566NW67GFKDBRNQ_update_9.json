  "reference_summary": "Qiray Hair Ties For Women Coil Hair Ties,Large Lace Phnom Penh,5 Colors 10 Pieces.\nQiray\n{'Material': 'Rubber', 'Item Form': 'elastic', 'Brand': 'Qiray', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '3.15 x 3.15 x 2.36 inches', 'Number of Pieces': '10', 'Product Dimensions': '3.15 x 3.15 x 2.36 inches; 2.82 Ounces', 'UPC': '655160582486'}\nVery pretty, they have a good stretch depending you your hairstyle you may twist twice.  You get two of each color.  The only thing I did not like is that these hair ties have a paint smell to them so wash them before wearing them.\nGood\nSTYLEAGAL Portable Electric Nail Drill, Manicure Pedicure Drill Kit Professional nail starter kit for beginners acrylic with drill\uff082020 Upgraded\uff09\nstyleagal\n{'Brand': 'styleagal', 'Voltage': '5 Volts', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.8 x 4.5 x 2 inches; 8.01 Ounces', 'UPC': '782913461771', 'Manufacturer': 'STYLEAGAL'}\n[[VIDEOID:c1d81e3cfad618ed65e971a49ab65264]] This is a nice drill great for beginners.  Just take some practice to get good at using it on your self and others hand.  The power cord is not long enough and the drill bits is hard to push them in and to pull out.  If you have never used a drill start working with the lower speed first.\nWorks very well\nPretty Frank Natural Deodorant Jar- No Aluminum Deodorant for Women, Men, Teens, & Kids \u2013 Paraben Sulfate Free Cream Deodorant with Shea Butter, Coconut Oil, Vitamin E & Baking Soda (Jasmine)\nPRETTY FRANK\n{'Brand': 'PRETTY FRANK', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Scent': 'Jasmine, Coconut', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '3.42 x 2.79 x 2.59 inches; 5.61 Ounces'}\nI like the fact that its organic and made in the US. However, this is not a deodorant for someone who is on the move. I do have sweaty underarms and I had to clean my armpits and apply this several times a day to be dry.  I don't like that I have to put this on with my fingers.  I was dry long as I wasn't moving around to much and in a cool place.  The jasmine scent is wonderful.  It is a small jar but you get a lot.\nNot for me\nYsesoAi 28 Pcs Hair Curlers Spiral Curls No Heat Wave Hair Curlers Styling Kit Spiral Hair Curlers Magic Hair Rollers with 2 Pieces Styling Hooks for Most Kinds of Hairstyles (20 cm/ 7.8 inches)\nYsesoAi\n{'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Brand': 'YsesoAi', 'Color': 'Pink, Blue, Ivory, Yellow, Green', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '1.5 x 1.7 x 1.1 inches', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Product Dimensions': '1.5 x 1.7 x 1.1 inches; 6.38 Ounces', 'UPC': '745895771436'}\nMy hair is naturally curly so , I wanted to see how it would do on a blowout.  I like the curly pattern that it creates the only problem I had was my hair was to long for this, pulling your hair threw with the hook that's given was easy. It did not hurt to pull your hair threw the spiral curlers.\nShort Hair Only\nAMAJULIE Non Slip Flexible Silicon Wigs Fix Strong Hold Comfort Silicone Lace Wig Grip Transparent Headband Hair Band Adjustable for Lace Wigs (Light Brown)\nAMAJULIE\n{'Material': 'Silicone', 'Fabric Type': 'Silicone,Silicon,Lace', 'Brand': 'AMAJULIE', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '3.98 x 2.28 x 0.55 inches; 0.88 Ounces', 'UPC': '192389741275'}\nI love this thing, it's very comfortable and has nice snug fit.  It's not to tight and the ridges are on the top and bottom so it stays on your head and grips the lace on the wig.  You don't see the grip under your lace, this thing really keeps your wig on.  You must be wearing a Lace Front wig for it to work.\nMy new friend\nGlitter Poly Nail Gel Extensions Builder Gel UV/LED Soak Off Acrylic Fashion Gel Polish Set for Nails Beginner DIY Nail Art at Home 8 colors-15g (Pink series)\nMIZHSE\n{'Brand': 'MIZHSE', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '478.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '9', 'Package Dimensions': '9.76 x 4.88 x 1.42 inches; 12.8 Ounces'}\nThis kit only comes with the poly gel, nail forms and a free gift. You will need your own tools to apply. I love this formula, very easy work with it doesn\u2019t dry fast so you have to build or layer. What I like the most that after putting under the lamp your nails don\u2019t have that tacky layer.  So the poly gel is sheer but building as in adding more will make it thicker.  I also like the nail forms.\nThe best I\u2019ve used so far\n7pcs Pearl Hair Clips Large Hair Clips Pins Barrette Ties Hair Headwear Barrette for Party Wedding Daily, Gift for Girls and Women\nMEETWIN\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.5 x 3.5 x 0.2 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '723668014119'}\nThese are very pretty to jazz up your hairstyle. I love the big clips very easy to open and close also holds a of hair. None of the pearls were scratch or peeling. Definitely worth getting.\nBeautiful Pearl accessories\nCurly Girl Hair Spray Bottle \u2013 Ultra Fine Extended Water Mister for Curly Hairstyling, Care and Moisturizing (10 Fl. Oz. & 24 Fl.

With the mist spray water isn\u2019t dripping everywhere. I don\u2019t have to keep refilling it up every day like I do with the regular spray bottle. Every easy to use just fill up with water put on the nozzle and spray where you like.\nEvery curly hair girl or guy needs this!\nShort Bob Wig Human Hair Pixie Cut Wigs Natural Color Lace Wigs 100% Virgin Huam Hair Lace Front Side Part Wigs for Women\nMarchQueen\n{'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Special Feature': 'Glueless', 'Brand': 'MarchQueen', 'Package Dimensions': '12.64 x 8.86 x 2.05 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'UPC': '779303841725'}\nSuch a cute wig the hair wasn't soft as I thought it was be but its very nice.
