I use soft crayon liners, or a brush of my lipstick, to create an one-the-spot liner all the time - so this seemed like a great buy.<br /><br />These are clearly imported. The good news is the manufacturer actually lists the ingredients on the box;  I've taken a photo of the box so you can see the ingredients - personally, I don't recommend using products where you can't see the ingredients before you order.<br /><br />The pencils you get are an interesting range, and seem to vary from package to package. Mine were in a variety of colors; the one color I was looking for - a basic nude - was not in my package - but I got a range of plums (which I never wear) and pinks (which I rarely wear).<br /><br />If you've used any of your mom's pencils, you're familiar with carmine, which can flake. You have to be careful with the pressure used to avoid application debris, but it's the best to stop lipstick from bleeding or feathering. Since none of the colors were perfect, I used a lighter pink with my lipstick so it wasn't noticeable, and it worked fine.\nReview Title: Cost Effecctive Mixed Bag\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Hair Bands for Women's Hair, Fashion Headbands, Headbands for Women, Headband for Fitness, Head Band for Outdoor Activities, Gift Pack 2pc, High Elastic, Non Slip, Breathable, Soft.\nJust Decors\n{'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material': 'Polyester, Cotton', 'Fabric Type': 'Cloth', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Brand': 'Just Decors', 'Package Dimensions': '11.38 x 7.87 x 1.14 inches; 3.53 Ounces', 'UPC': '750226635974'}\nI got these headbands because of that one enticing line: \"perfect to keep the sweat out of your face.\" When I'm hot, my hairline starts dripping. Really. We call that a \"glow\" in the south, but it's just plain sweat, and it runs into my eyes, and then my eyes are stinging, my glasses get fogged and wet, and I'm just one huge, damp, panicky  blind mess.<br /><br />Which may be normal when you're working out, but when you're, say, touring the greenhouse or strolling the beach, I'm pretty sure it's unattractive. When you add sunscreen to the mix, dripping down my face, I've actually attracted a concerned crowd in the past, which makes me nervous, and then you can add clammy hands to the list of woes.<br /><br />You wouldn't think a seemingly simple headband like this would do the trick, but it actually has. The headband gets damp; my face stays dry. I normally wear a ball cap when I garden - hoping I won't burn my head while basically risking heat exhaustion - and I put this on first, then the cap.  The headband is a little bit bulky, being double thickness, but not too much so; wonder of wonders, wearing it, my face has stayed dry for the entire time I've been outside. No sweaty face, no drippy mess, no glasses I can't see through (or gnats interested in this new swampy damp visitor). I would wear these if they were hideous, they're so effective, but they're not - navy with flowers or white with flowers - I could wear them as a fashion statement. And so effective.<br /><br />Suddenly I can be outside without causing a shower on my face. It's a miracle. So pleased!\nKeeps My Face Dry!\nGL-Turelifes Liquid Eyebrow Styling Gel 3D Feathery Brows Shaping Cream Waterproof Natural Wild Eyebrow Styling Glue Long Lasting Eye Brow Gel Fresh Styling\nGL-Turelifes\n{'Brand': 'GL-Turelifes', 'Item Form': 'Cream,Gel,Liquid,Eyebrow Pencil,Eyebrow Powder', 'Finish Type': 'Natural', 'Special Feature': 'Waterproof, Long Lasting', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Product Dimensions': '3.46 x 0.55 x 0.55 inches; 0.32 Ounces'}\nI use eye shadow, eye liner, and eyebrow shadow, and I think properly shaped eyebrows have a huge impact on how your face can appear to others.<br /><br />This product helps shape, and hold your eyebrows. It's like clear mascara, so it helps to brush - and hold - each existing hair.  It does have an expiration date, so make sure the product you're using isn't past the date.<br /><br />I have to admit I'm not a fan of the \"feathery\" eyebrow look, but I am a fan of ensuring that what eyebrow you have stays in place and provides a good base to build on, which this product supports.<br /><br />Once you use this gel, you can augment your shaped eyebrows with eyebrow shadow, which can provide a light shaping line, and help fill your brow in with consistent shading.  You can build on that, or use by itself a pencil, to add additional depth or go for that vintage look. This gel just gives you another tool to make your brows more defined.\nShape Eyebrows, Shape Face!\nLip Liner Set 12 Colors Natural Lip Liner Makeup Pencil Long Lasting Matte Velvet Lip Liner\nMarine Forest\n{'Brand': 'Marine Forest', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Item Form': 'Pencil', 'Finish Type': 'Matte,Velvet', 'Product Benefits': 'Smoothening', 'Package Dimensions': '6.42 x 2.28 x 0.94 inches; 2.24 Ounces', 'UPC': '729843697955'}\nLike most reviewers, the prospect of 12 lip liners was too tempting to pass up.
