It's like clear mascara, so it helps to brush - and hold - each existing hair.  It does have an expiration date, so make sure the product you're using isn't past the date.<br /><br />I have to admit I'm not a fan of the \"feathery\" eyebrow look, but I am a fan of ensuring that what eyebrow you have stays in place and provides a good base to build on, which this product supports.<br /><br />Once you use this gel, you can augment your shaped eyebrows with eyebrow shadow, which can provide a light shaping line, and help fill your brow in with consistent shading.  You can build on that, or use by itself a pencil, to add additional depth or go for that vintage look. This gel just gives you another tool to make your brows more defined.\nReview Title: Shape Eyebrows, Shape Face!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Really. We call that a \"glow\" in the south, but it's just plain sweat, and it runs into my eyes, and then my eyes are stinging, my glasses get fogged and wet, and I'm just one huge, damp, panicky  blind mess.<br /><br />Which may be normal when you're working out, but when you're, say, touring the greenhouse or strolling the beach, I'm pretty sure it's unattractive. When you add sunscreen to the mix, dripping down my face, I've actually attracted a concerned crowd in the past, which makes me nervous, and then you can add clammy hands to the list of woes.<br /><br />You wouldn't think a seemingly simple headband like this would do the trick, but it actually has. The headband gets damp; my face stays dry. I normally wear a ball cap when I garden - hoping I won't burn my head while basically risking heat exhaustion - and I put this on first, then the cap.  The headband is a little bit bulky, being double thickness, but not too much so; wonder of wonders, wearing it, my face has stayed dry for the entire time I've been outside. No sweaty face, no drippy mess, no glasses I can't see through (or gnats interested in this new swampy damp visitor). I would wear these if they were hideous, they're so effective, but they're not - navy with flowers or white with flowers - I could wear them as a fashion statement. And so effective.<br /><br />Suddenly I can be outside without causing a shower on my face. It's a miracle.
