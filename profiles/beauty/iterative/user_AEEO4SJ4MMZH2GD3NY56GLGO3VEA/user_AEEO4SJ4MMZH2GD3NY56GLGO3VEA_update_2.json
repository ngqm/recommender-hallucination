About ten years ago, I stopped using salt at the table. Because of a family history of hypertension, I wanted to start lowering my sodium intake, and just start a few healthier eating habits, in general. I used to sit at the table and sprinkle salt on my food before I'd even tasted it, and I just thought it was a terribly unhealthy habit and that it was time for a change. I'm not sure of all its health benefits of this pink Himalayan salt, or how significant they are, but I like the flavor. The kid in me loves the pretty pink color, and while I know, rationally, that it has no bearing on the flavor, I can't help but enjoy the way it looks in the shaker, with its grains of different shades. I tasted a bit upon opening the bag. To me, it doesn't have as strong a salty taste as regular table salt does, and it dissipates more rapidly on the tongue. In use with cooking, I also feel it's not as salty as my normal variety. It does a great job of allowing my other spices to do the work, and the seasoning blends I use can be better appreciated. I've also found that if I accidentally get a bit heavy-handed with this salt, it's more forgiving, since it's not as salty. Overall, I'm enjoying the way it looks and tastes, and my next experiment will be making my own body scrub. I was able to purchase this Himalayan pink salt at a discounted rate in exchange for my evaluation and unbiased review.\nReview Title: A tasty alternative to table salt...\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

My only complaint and the reason for taking off a star is that some of the images are too small for longer nails. I'm not yet good enough at stamping to &#34;stretch&#34; the images yet, but I plan to learn.\nEtched well, but I wish images were larger.\nPlant Therapy Himalayan Pink Salt.
