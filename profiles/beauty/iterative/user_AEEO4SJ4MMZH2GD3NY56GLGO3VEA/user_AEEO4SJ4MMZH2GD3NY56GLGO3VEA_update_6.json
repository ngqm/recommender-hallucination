It appears I was correct.<br /><br />It's clear, which is always nice, for me. I have eczema, and the more natural the ingredients, the better.

My only complaint and the reason for taking off a star is that some of the images are too small for longer nails. I'm not yet good enough at stamping to &#34;stretch&#34; the images yet, but I plan to learn.\nEtched well, but I wish images were larger.\nPlant Therapy Himalayan Pink Salt.

About ten years ago, I stopped using salt at the table. Because of a family history of hypertension, I wanted to start lowering my sodium intake, and just start a few healthier eating habits, in general. I used to sit at the table and sprinkle salt on my food before I'd even tasted it, and I just thought it was a terribly unhealthy habit and that it was time for a change. I'm not sure of all its health benefits of this pink Himalayan salt, or how significant they are, but I like the flavor. The kid in me loves the pretty pink color, and while I know, rationally, that it has no bearing on the flavor, I can't help but enjoy the way it looks in the shaker, with its grains of different shades. I tasted a bit upon opening the bag. To me, it doesn't have as strong a salty taste as regular table salt does, and it dissipates more rapidly on the tongue. In use with cooking, I also feel it's not as salty as my normal variety. It does a great job of allowing my other spices to do the work, and the seasoning blends I use can be better appreciated. I've also found that if I accidentally get a bit heavy-handed with this salt, it's more forgiving, since it's not as salty. Overall, I'm enjoying the way it looks and tastes, and my next experiment will be making my own body scrub. I was able to purchase this Himalayan pink salt at a discounted rate in exchange for my evaluation and unbiased review.\nA tasty alternative to table salt...\nModern Mirror 92231 Dual-sided Led Illuminated Tabletop Makeup Silver Mirror\nModern Mirror\n{'Brand': 'Modern Mirror', 'Room Type': 'Bathroom', 'Shape': 'Round', 'Product Dimensions': '7.2 x 4 x 11.5 inches; 15 Ounces', 'Mounting Type': 'Tabletop Mount', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'UPC': '692014021838'}\nThis makeup mirror is very stylish. It's fairly compact and is very lightweight.  It doesn't have the shiny surface displayed in the picture, but is made of a metallic gray plastic. It would blend well with nearly any decor, and I like the way it looks with my stainless steel bathroom accessories.<br /><br />It has two mirrors; the first is a regular mirror, while the other side is a magnifying mirror. The magnifying effect is a really good one, and there is little to no distortion.<br /><br />It comes with the three AA batteries it requires, which is a plus. It also has an outlet for an AC adapter, which isn't included, but is something most households probably have lying around. It turns on and off by sliding the single switch on the mirror's base. The light it gives off is bright, and illuminates both the mirror and my face.<br /><br /> It seems everyone in my household has adopted this mirror as part of their morning ritual. My husband uses it for shaving, while my daughter and I use it for makeup and skin treatments. It's very nice and would be useful, not only in the bathroom, but on the bedroom dresser, as well.<br /><br />I received this mirror free in exchange for my evaluation and unbiased review. Any opinion I've expressed is purely mine and based on my own personal experience using this mirror.\nLightweight and compact...\nLiquid Latex Fashions - Clear Zombie Skin Makeup Body Paint for Adults and Kids, Ideal for School Plays, Parties, Theater, Cosplays and Carnivals- 4 Oz\nLiquid Latex Fashions\n{'Color': 'Clear', 'Brand': 'Liquid Latex Fashions', 'Item Weight': '4 Ounces', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Package Information': 'Bottle', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '3 x 3 x 3 inches; 4 Ounces', 'Item model number': '010446a', 'UPC': '793379160191 811832010446', 'Manufacturer': 'Liquid Latex Fashions'}\nThis liquid latex is of good quality. I got it to use as a nail art barrier for stamping and gradients. It works well, and I appreciate the ammonia-free formula. This latex also has less of that fishy smell they latex has; it's there, but very faint.<br /><br />It goes on white, for easy application, and dries clear. It is sticky, but a little cuticle oil or cornstarch helps, if it's a bother. I didn't find it so sticky it was unmanageable, I just exercised a little care.<br /><br />This latex works exactly as I need it to for stamping. It peels off cleanly, in a single piece. It doesn't peel up my stamping, and it makes cleanup minimal. I'm very happy with my purchase, and would recommend it.<br /><br />This latex was a personal purchase, made at the regular price listed at the time. I am not obligated to provide a review, but choose to do so.\nExcellent nail art barrier...\nInnoLife Nail Art Drill Treatments KIT Electric File Buffer Bits Acrylics 6 File Pedicure Hands & Nails Repair (110V US 1.5M Plug) - Pink\nInnolife\n['Product Description Electric Nail Art Pen Shape File Drilling Handpiece Machine 6 Optional Bits (5 diamond bits, 1 emery rod with 6 sanding bands) Electric Nail Art Drill Variable speed control: 3,000 RPM up to 20,000 RPM Handpiece can directly connected to electricity, easy to carry around!!

It's touted as being good for beginners, but I was really nervous about using it for the first time, because it came with absolutely no instructions. Yikes! I'd cut my nails down to nubbins, and have been wearing falsies, so I figured it was a great way to get some practice.<br /><br />There are a few notes on the product listing about how to insert and remove the drill bits, so with that being all I had to go on, I just went for it.<br /><br />As I had no clue as to which bits were for what job, I had to wing it. I tried two. The first I tried wasn't quite coarse enough, so I went with the larger, barrel-shaped bit, which worked well for what I wanted. I'd basically put on some stiletto tips, and managed to jab every family member at least once. I didn't want to completely remove them, but I wanted to take them down a bit and round out the tips. Once I changed the bit this drill did a great job.<br /><br />It got a little warm, but didn't get too hot, and it didn't overheat and stop on me. In my photo is what they looked like right after I was done. I did go over the edges briefly with an emery board for the couple of rough spots left, simply because I'm not yet quite adept enough to get the perfect shaping I want, but practice is key.<br /><br />It's for the same reason that I haven't yet tried the drill on my natural nails. I will, though, once I get a little more know-how under my belt. So, in summary, I like it, and it seems to be beginner-friendly, but I wish there were detailed information available on its use.<br /><br />I received this nail drill free to try in exchange for my evaluation and unbiased review. Any opinion I've expressed is purely mine and based on my own personal experience using this drill.\nWorks well, but detailed instructions would have been helpful...\nBEST ROSE CLAY FACIAL WASH - - Includes Rose Clay the Trendy New ingredient used for fighting wrinkles and aging! - Handcrafted Face Wash Cleanser - Anti Aging Cleanser\n{'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Scent': 'Rose', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '7.8 x 2 x 1.9 inches; 9.6 Ounces', 'UPC': '780873595130'}\nI wasn't sure what to expect from this facial wash, when I got it.
