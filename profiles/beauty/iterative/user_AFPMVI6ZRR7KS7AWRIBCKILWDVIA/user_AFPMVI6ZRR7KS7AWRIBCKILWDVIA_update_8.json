It doesn't fit my makeup needs in everyday life.<br /><br />Katiebabs\nA Pass For Me (C Grade)\nBouquet Garni Body Shower White Musk - Unique Fragrance Decanting Engineering Method gives Long Lasting Rich Fragrance - Gentle and Mild Cleansing Scented Body Wash with Natural Surfactant 17.85 Fl Oz\nBouquet Garni\n{'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Skin Type': 'All, Dry', 'Brand': 'Bouquet Garni', 'Scent': 'Garni', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '8.23 x 6.34 x 3.66 inches; 1.34 Pounds'}\nIf you like the scent of vanilla mixed in with soap, this body wash is for you. It creates a nice lather but it doesn't have that natural smell and more along the lines of chemical. But it does an okay job.<br /><br />Katiebabs\nSoap and Vanilla Combined (B Grade)\nFollain Everybody Bar Soap | Lavender & Bergamot, Skin Moisturizing Hand & Body Cleanser with Shea Butter, Argan Oil, Hydrate for Softer Skin, Non-Drying, Rich-Lather, Cruelty Free, 5 oz\nFollain\n{'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Brand': 'Follain', 'Scent': 'Bergamot,Lavender', 'Material Feature': 'Cru, Non GMO, Dermatologist Tested', 'Product Dimensions': '3.75 x 2.25 x 1 inches; 5.11 Ounces', 'Item model number': '692764483009', 'UPC': '692764483009'}\nNice, scented soap that should fulfill all your bathing needs. The price may be a bit higher than most soaps, but this is a more quality brand and far from generic as you can get.<br /><br />Katiebabs\nNice, scented soap that should fulfill all your bathing needs (B+ Grade)\nAvajar Blue LED Hydrating Cream Mask 5 Pack - Hydrating Face Masks for Women | Moisturizing Face Mask for Girls | Collagen Face Sheet Masks Set | Korean Face Mask Sheets Pack | Sheet Mask For Face\na DAILY SELF-CARE COSMETICS avajar\n{'Brand': 'a DAILY SELF-CARE COSMETICS avajar', 'Item Form': 'Cream, Sheet', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Moisture', 'Scent': 'Hydrating', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Product Dimensions': '5.67 x 0.98 x 7.28 inches; 6.38 Ounces'}\nThese masks are too hard to put on your face because the mask is so wet and covered cream, it rips and leaves you without a full face mask. And if and when you can put the mask on your face without ripping it, it is uncomfortable, like you are wearing a wet paper towel. I would give this a pass.<br /><br />Katiebabs\nMasks Will Rip When Trying to Put on Face (D Grade)\nSpanature Lavender Hand & Body Lotion Travel Size Selection 4 Pack, Relaxing and Revitalizing Moisturizer for Rough and Dry Skin, Nourishing and Gentle for All Skin Types, Made In Korea - 75 ml/2.53oz\nSpanature\n{'Brand': 'Spanature', 'Scent': 'Lavender', 'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Unit Count': '4.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '4', 'Package Dimensions': '5.08 x 4.29 x 2.91 inches; 1.06 Pounds', 'UPC': '088234470592'}\nThis lavender hand and body cream will have you wanting more of it.
