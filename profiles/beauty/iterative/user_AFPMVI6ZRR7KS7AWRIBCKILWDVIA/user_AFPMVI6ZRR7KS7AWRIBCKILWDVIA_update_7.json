It doesn't fit my makeup needs in everyday life.<br /><br />Katiebabs\nA Pass For Me (C Grade)\nBouquet Garni Body Shower White Musk - Unique Fragrance Decanting Engineering Method gives Long Lasting Rich Fragrance - Gentle and Mild Cleansing Scented Body Wash with Natural Surfactant 17.85 Fl Oz\nBouquet Garni\n{'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Skin Type': 'All, Dry', 'Brand': 'Bouquet Garni', 'Scent': 'Garni', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '8.23 x 6.34 x 3.66 inches; 1.34 Pounds'}\nIf you like the scent of vanilla mixed in with soap, this body wash is for you. It creates a nice lather but it doesn't have that natural smell and more along the lines of chemical. But it does an okay job.<br /><br />Katiebabs\nSoap and Vanilla Combined (B Grade)\nFollain Everybody Bar Soap | Lavender & Bergamot, Skin Moisturizing Hand & Body Cleanser with Shea Butter, Argan Oil, Hydrate for Softer Skin, Non-Drying, Rich-Lather, Cruelty Free, 5 oz\nFollain\n{'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Brand': 'Follain', 'Scent': 'Bergamot,Lavender', 'Material Feature': 'Cru, Non GMO, Dermatologist Tested', 'Product Dimensions': '3.75 x 2.25 x 1 inches; 5.11 Ounces', 'Item model number': '692764483009', 'UPC': '692764483009'}\nNice, scented soap that should fulfill all your bathing needs.

And if and when you can put the mask on your face without ripping it, it is uncomfortable, like you are wearing a wet paper towel.
