They are so easy to use and give such gorgeous waves (Just like what you would get if you had done a rollerset on your hair). You get those gorgeous, wide, spiral curls that would compliment anyone. They bend quite easily, which is a surprise since I have heard jumbo flexi rods are difficult to bend. You do have to have long hair in order to use them properly.<br />It will also hold better if you have thick hair with texture to it. Bone straight hair won't hold too well. I highly recomment these, there are my new faves !\nReview Title: The best bendy rollers/Flexi rods I have ever used !\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
