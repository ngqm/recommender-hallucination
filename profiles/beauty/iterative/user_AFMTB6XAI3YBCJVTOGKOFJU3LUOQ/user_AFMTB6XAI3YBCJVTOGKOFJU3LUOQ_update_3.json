  "reference_summary": "Del Monte Sauerkraut 14.5 oz. (3-Pack)\n{'Package Dimensions': '8.4 x 4.9 x 2.9 inches; 14.46 Ounces', 'UPC': '741655221609'}\nWe have strayed from a national name brand of sauer kraut and was that a  big mistake. The store brand was one that almost everyone set aside on their plate and did not eat. We went back to a  name brand and that was Del Monte. The kraut we think is the best on the market. We do nto like that other kinds of kraut such as Bavarian. We want the real stuff, at least to us it is the real stuff. Did you know the whole  14.5 oz can only has 10 calories in it and zero fat. Even for carbs there is only 1g. Now this is where we definitely go wrong as we serve it with smoked sausage, which we know is totally off the chart. Don't do this often---just occasionally. The meal is delicious. I do have a note fro Del Monte. Remember when your cans contained 16 oz of kraut, then you cut back and now it's 14.5 oz. Please quit doing this to us!.Do you realize, and I am sure you do, that I now have about 10% LESS to serve to my family.\nSome Of The Best Sauer Kraut There Is !\nSpa Grade Jade Roller for Face with Gua Sha | Jade Face Roller Massager | Jade Facial Roller | Face Roller Massager | Jade Rollers | Wrinkle Roller\nJane Cosmetics\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.1 x 3.4 x 1.2 inches; 4.8 Ounces', 'UPC': '814689026516', 'Manufacturer': 'Jane & Co.'}\nThis Jade face roller and Jade Gua Sha tool comes packaged nicely.  This roller is a little nicer than the last one I reviewed, therefore the reason for the 5 start.  We enjoy using this one more than our other one.  This is better put together and seems to be a grade or two better.\nJade Roller\nMountain Falls Regular Nail Polish Remover for Natural Nails with Vitamin E and Panthenol, 10 Fluid Ounce\nMountain Falls\n{'Brand': 'Mountain Falls', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Item Weight': '0.7 Pounds', 'Unit Count': '10 Fl Oz'}\nAnother quality product from Mountain Falls.
