This organizer reminds me of the inexpensive makeup box I use to buy my girls when they were 6 years old.  I expected a lot more from this organizer considering it cost almost $55.  This is a plastic organizer.  The organizer has some scuff marks on the body and then a couple on the clear top lid.  I am disappointed with this organizer especially at this price point.\nReview Title: Not Impressed\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Del Monte Sauerkraut 14.5 oz. (3-Pack)\n{'Package Dimensions': '8.4 x 4.9 x 2.9 inches; 14.46 Ounces', 'UPC': '741655221609'}\nWe have strayed from a national name brand of sauer kraut and was that a  big mistake. The store brand was one that almost everyone set aside on their plate and did not eat. We went back to a  name brand and that was Del Monte. The kraut we think is the best on the market. We do nto like that other kinds of kraut such as Bavarian. We want the real stuff, at least to us it is the real stuff. Did you know the whole  14.5 oz can only has 10 calories in it and zero fat. Even for carbs there is only 1g. Now this is where we definitely go wrong as we serve it with smoked sausage, which we know is totally off the chart. Don't do this often---just occasionally. The meal is delicious. I do have a note fro Del Monte. Remember when your cans contained 16 oz of kraut, then you cut back and now it's 14.5 oz. Please quit doing this to us!.Do you realize, and I am sure you do, that I now have about 10% LESS to serve to my family.\nSome Of The Best Sauer Kraut There Is !\nSpa Grade Jade Roller for Face with Gua Sha | Jade Face Roller Massager | Jade Facial Roller | Face Roller Massager | Jade Rollers | Wrinkle Roller\nJane Cosmetics\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.1 x 3.4 x 1.2 inches; 4.8 Ounces', 'UPC': '814689026516', 'Manufacturer': 'Jane & Co.'}\nThis Jade face roller and Jade Gua Sha tool comes packaged nicely.  This roller is a little nicer than the last one I reviewed, therefore the reason for the 5 start.  We enjoy using this one more than our other one.  This is better put together and seems to be a grade or two better.\nJade Roller\nMountain Falls Regular Nail Polish Remover for Natural Nails with Vitamin E and Panthenol, 10 Fluid Ounce\nMountain Falls\n{'Brand': 'Mountain Falls', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Item Weight': '0.7 Pounds', 'Unit Count': '10 Fl Oz'}\nAnother quality product from Mountain Falls.

This remover has 1 head that rotates to 3 different buffing disks.  There is a rough, medium and smooth grinding disk.  These disk do a great job.  There is a small cleaning brush and a USB cord include.  The device appears to be well made.  The speed on the head is good and does not slow down when using.  I have only charged this device once and it is still running.  This is a good product at a good price.  Highly recommend.\nGood Triple Disk Callus Remover\nDAN Technology Anti-Scald 200\u2109-500\u2109 Electric Press Hot Comb for Black Hair, Beard and Wigs, Ceramic Unisex Hair Beard Straightener and Curler, Dual Voltage for Travel, Home and Salon Use\nDAN Technology\n{'Brand': 'DAN Technology', 'Hair Type': 'All, Curly', 'Material': 'Ceramic', 'Size': 'Medium', 'Item Weight': '0.6 Pounds', 'Package Dimensions': '12.9 x 4.8 x 2.4 inches; 9.6 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'DAN Technology'}\nMy daughter really likes this Dan Technology Hot Comb.<br /><br />There are several features that she likes.<br />1.

All the bottles are the same 8 oz size.  I like the spray handles.  They fit in my hand and are easy to spray.  The sprayer can be set 3 ways.... OFF,  STREAM,  and MIST.  I am currently using the mist on my plants.  The liquid comes out evenly and does not drip out of the nozzle.  The pick up hose inside the bottle goes all the way to the bottom so you get all the liquid.  These are 3 good spray bottles and well worth the price.\nGood size plastic spray bottles\nSpray Bottle,Fine Mist Mini Clear50ml/2oz Spray Bottles,Small Reusable Empty Plastic Bottles with Atomizer Pumps (25 pack,2 Funnels included)\nWoaiwo-q\n{'Brand': 'Woaiwo-q', 'Material': 'Polypropylene', 'Capacity': '50 Milliliters, 60 Milliliters', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Special Feature': 'Mist Spray'}\nThese are nice small, short plastic bottles.
