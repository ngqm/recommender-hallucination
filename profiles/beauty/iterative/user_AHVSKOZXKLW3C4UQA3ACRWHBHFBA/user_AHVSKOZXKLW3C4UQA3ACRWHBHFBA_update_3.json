  "reference_summary": "Manicure and Pedicure Nail Clipper from POWERGROOMING - Powerful Trimmer for Thick and Thin Finger Nails and Toe Nails - Included Nail File and\"Catcher\" for Easy Cleanup (1 Pack)\nPOWERGROOMING\n{'Brand': 'POWERGROOMING', 'Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Blade Edge': 'Straight', 'Blade Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Target Audience': 'Women, Men', 'Package Dimensions': '3.8 x 1.3 x 1 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'UPC': '653233212735', 'Manufacturer': 'POWERGROOMING'}\nI really loved the modern look of these clippers and file; however, i took one star away as the small nail file is not as sharp as I would have liked. I'm used to an old Revlon diamond file that works much faster.<br />As others have said, you can very easily remove the black base on the nail clippers if it seems unwieldy to you. It felt just fine to me.\nSuper attractive clippers and file in a leather look case.\nAussie Hairspray Instant Freeze Extreme Hold 7 Ounce (207ml) (2 Pack)\nAussie\n['Aussie Hairspray Instant Freeze Extreme Hold 7 Ounce (207ml) (2 Pack)']\n{'Scent': 'Unscented', 'Liquid Volume': '7 Fluid Ounces', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Brand': 'Aussie', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '4.3 x 2 x 8.5 inches; 11.04 Ounces', 'UPC': '381519078040 787734409902 038785520000', 'Manufacturer': 'Aussie'}\nA tiny spritz of this not only holds my hair, but makes it look fuller.<br />I imagine it will last a long time; so, its also a great value.<br />I was always loath to try these freeze-type hairsprays, thinking they would look stiff, but this doesn\u2019t.<br />No discernible fragrance, either.\nExactly what I\u2019ve been looking for.
