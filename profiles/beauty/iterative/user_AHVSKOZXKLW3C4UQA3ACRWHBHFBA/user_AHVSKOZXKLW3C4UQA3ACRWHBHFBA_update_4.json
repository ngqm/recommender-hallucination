It\u2019s very emollient without being greasy at all.<br /><br />I am usually sensitive to products and this gave me no negative reactions.<br /><br />It only takes a tiny little bit to moisturize my upper and lower lids. Of course, I stay away from the eyelash area as I don\u2019t want any of this in my eyes.<br /><br />One jar has lasted for months.<br /><br />The only thing I don\u2019t like is the container as it means sticking my finger into it and I really don\u2019t like that delivery system. I would vastly prefer if it had a small nozzle tube that could stand on its end. I know it wouldn\u2019t look as fancy, but it would be far more user friendly.\nReview Title: I have been using it for months and love it!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Manicure and Pedicure Nail Clipper from POWERGROOMING - Powerful Trimmer for Thick and Thin Finger Nails and Toe Nails - Included Nail File and\"Catcher\" for Easy Cleanup (1 Pack)\nPOWERGROOMING\n{'Brand': 'POWERGROOMING', 'Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Blade Edge': 'Straight', 'Blade Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Target Audience': 'Women, Men', 'Package Dimensions': '3.8 x 1.3 x 1 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'UPC': '653233212735', 'Manufacturer': 'POWERGROOMING'}\nI really loved the modern look of these clippers and file; however, i took one star away as the small nail file is not as sharp as I would have liked. I'm used to an old Revlon diamond file that works much faster.<br />As others have said, you can very easily remove the black base on the nail clippers if it seems unwieldy to you. It felt just fine to me.\nSuper attractive clippers and file in a leather look case.\nAussie Hairspray Instant Freeze Extreme Hold 7 Ounce (207ml) (2 Pack)\nAussie\n['Aussie Hairspray Instant Freeze Extreme Hold 7 Ounce (207ml) (2 Pack)']\n{'Scent': 'Unscented', 'Liquid Volume': '7 Fluid Ounces', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Brand': 'Aussie', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '4.3 x 2 x 8.5 inches; 11.04 Ounces', 'UPC': '381519078040 787734409902 038785520000', 'Manufacturer': 'Aussie'}\nA tiny spritz of this not only holds my hair, but makes it look fuller.<br />I imagine it will last a long time; so, its also a great value.<br />I was always loath to try these freeze-type hairsprays, thinking they would look stiff, but this doesn\u2019t.<br />No discernible fragrance, either.\nExactly what I\u2019ve been looking for. Fantastic hold with no residue or helmet head.\nCOLORGRAM Artist Formula Auto Brow Pencil 0.25g- True Beauty K-Drama Makeup, Built-in-Spoolie, Clump-Free Formula, Softly Glides, Natural Look (01 Ash Brown)\nCOLORGRAM\n[\"Featuring a unique, triangular tip, Brow Definer's retractable pencil design is ideal for outlining and filling your brows in one fluid motion. The custom spooley end is created with a precise width and firmness to seamlessly blend color.\"]\n{'Brand': 'COLORGRAM', 'Item Form': 'Pencil', 'Finish Type': 'Natural', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Product Benefits': 'Softening', 'Product Dimensions': '0.59 x 0.71 x 4.53 inches; 3.7 Ounces'}\nThis was pretty impossible to use. It was so dry and hard that it wouldn\u2019t even apply color to my brow. I<br />I would strongly suggest going with the Maybelline brow precise or the Maybelline brow ultra slim. Both of those are phenomenal and fairly priced. I think you can get them with Amazon\u2019s subscribe and save, too.\nI could barely get this to apply to my brow\u2026old product?\nIvnil hair removal spray pack of 2\nIvnil\n{'Item Form': 'Spray', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Anti-aging', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Brand': 'Ivnil', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Fl Oz', 'Package Dimensions': '2.76 x 2.32 x 2.28 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'UPC': '752771042412'}\nI have been using this eye cream for months, day and night, and just adore it.
