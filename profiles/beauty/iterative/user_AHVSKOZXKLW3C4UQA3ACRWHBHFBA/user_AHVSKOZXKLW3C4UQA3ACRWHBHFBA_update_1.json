I'm used to an old Revlon diamond file that works much faster.<br />As others have said, you can very easily remove the black base on the nail clippers if it seems unwieldy to you. It felt just fine to me.\nReview Title: Super attractive clippers and file in a leather look case.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
