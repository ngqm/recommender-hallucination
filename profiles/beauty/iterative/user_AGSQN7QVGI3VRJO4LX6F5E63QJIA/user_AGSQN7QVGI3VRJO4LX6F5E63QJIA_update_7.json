Each pack contains 12 wipes.<br /><br />I wanted to try these wipes because I thought they could be a better option for me than regular baby wipes for my period accident clean ups & they are pretty nice (not perfect).<br /><br />I have heavy extended length menstrual periods and have always used regular baby wipes for any messy / accident clean ups. That way I can just throw them away after I'm done with them.<br /><br />These bathing wipes are way larger than a typical baby wipe. They are white in color and have a light perfume type of scent (which is probably the Chamomile Extract).<br /><br />They can be microwaved (for no more than 15 seconds according to the pack) if you wanted them warm but I just used them \"as is\" right out of the packs.<br /><br />They are wet enough to get the job done but not dripping wet (leaking) everywhere. They are also a nice thickness and soft to the touch.<br /><br />They didn't irritate my sensitive skin at all. They also aren't soapy at all, they left my skin feeling okay (clean) maybe a little bit sticky but nothing that I couldn't tolerate.<br /><br />I do like these wipes overall because they are large in size and affordable.\nReview Title: They Are Not Bad \ud83d\udc69\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Mountain Falls Advanced Formula Nail Polish Remover Pads with 96% Acetone, for Natural Nails, 10 Count\nMountain Falls\n{'Brand': 'Mountain Falls', 'Item Form': 'Pad', 'Item Weight': '0.01 Pounds', 'Unit Count': '10 Count'}\nThese nail polish remover pads come individually wrapped & there are 10 in the box.<br /><br />They smell just like normal, traditional nail polish remover & we all know what that smells like. Strong!!! As soon as I tore open the packet ... bam. That smell hit me.<br /><br />The actual pads come out of the packet folded in half, have a pinkish color & they seem to be made out of felt or a felt like fabric.<br /><br />I decided to use one to take off my bright Red toenail polish. The first 2 nails came clean but then I started to notice that the remover pad was smearing the polish all over my toes & leaving finger nail polish color on my fingers.<br /><br />Overall, the pads do work but you're probably going to have to use at least 2 at a time. That means only 5 nail polish removals per box & for the price listed, I find them highly overpriced.<br /><br />Excuse my swollen foot picture, I'm trying to show how using just 1 nail polish remover pad left my toenail/toe area with a pinkish red hue.\nJust Okay \ud83d\udc85\nBouquet Garni Body Shower White Musk - Unique Fragrance Decanting Engineering Method gives Long Lasting Rich Fragrance - Gentle and Mild Cleansing Scented Body Wash with Natural Surfactant 17.85 Fl Oz\nBouquet Garni\n{'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Skin Type': 'All, Dry', 'Brand': 'Bouquet Garni', 'Scent': 'Garni', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '8.23 x 6.34 x 3.66 inches; 1.34 Pounds'}\nI was so excited to try this \"Bouquet Garni Body / Shower Wash\".<br /><br />The presentation is so nice & makes the product seem so high end.<br /><br />The body wash arrives in its own logo cardboard box. Suitable for gift giving.<br /><br />The bottle itself is a pump bottle, with a beautiful label and Silver colored accent on the pump. It really is pretty.<br /><br />The actual body wash is Clear in color & smells like Vanilla overall with a tiny hint of a musky smell.<br /><br />I found that the body wash does lather up really well and does leave the skin nicely scented.<br /><br />The problem I had was it also caused some skin irritation. Causing my skin to turn red and blotchy. I have extremely sensitive skin anyway so this is a personal issue specific to me, my skin.<br /><br />Others could use this body wash and be just fine.<br /><br />I tried to check the ingredients list on the bottle and it is written in what looks like Korean or Chinese.<br /><br />I went back and checked the website, the few ingredients I found listed are Sodium Chloride, Citric Acids & Lavender Extract.\nSmells Good But Caused Irritation \ud83d\ude41\nBeard Brush, Comb, Scissors Grooming Kit for Men's Care, Perfect to Distribute Balm or Oil for Growth & Styling, Adds Shine & Softness Black Color\nGROW ALPHA BEARD\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.4 x 3.4 x 2.3 inches; 7.2 Ounces', 'UPC': '300875400470 719279662702'}\nThis three piece set arrives in a Black logo box. The set includes a brush, a comb and a pair of scissors.<br /><br />The brush fits nicely in your hand with a sort of contoured wooden handle. The bristles are somewhat firm but at the same time have some give to them.<br /><br />The comb is made of what I assume is plastic. It has 2 different size teeth.<br /><br />The scissors are made of stainless steel. A decent size for clipping stray hairs around your mustache / nose area.<br /><br />My boyfriend used the scissors to clean up his mustache. You could also use them to clip any stray nose hairs. He really loved the brush and carries it around with him to brush his hair (the hair on his head since he doesn't have a beard).\nBoyfriend Recommended \ud83d\udc68\nGerm Shark PX50 Travel Wipes - Travel Sanitizing Wipes - 4 Paks of 50 each (200 Wipes) in Resealable Foil Travel Wipes Case\nGerm Shark\n{'Brand': 'Germ Shark', 'Unit Count': '200.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '4', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Item Form': 'Wipe', 'Package Dimensions': '10.16 x 10.12 x 4.65 inches; 3.59 Pounds', 'UPC': '375158000142'}\nI received 4 packs of \"Germ Shark PX50 70% Isopropyl Alcohol Wipes\". They are about the size of most baby wipes & arrive in packs like that as well. Fifty wipes per pack.<br /><br />The wipes themselves are really well made. There are White in color, smell like Alcohol  (obviously) and are very durable. There is no lint / small pieces of fiber from the wipes left behind as I wiped my hands, phone screen, etcetera.<br /><br />The quality is excellent. They have the perfect amount of alcohol on each wipe to get the job done but not so much that excess liquid is dripping everywhere.<br /><br />My only problem with these alcohol wipes is the price. Despite the convenience & quality I can honestly say I would not purchase them \"again\" at the listed price.\nQuality & Convenience \ud83d\udccc\nBath Body Brush with Super Comfy Bristles for Universal Skin,Long Bamboo Handle Gentle Exfoliation Improve Skin's Health and Beauty Wet or Dry Brushing Back Scrubber for Shower\nZhaoyun\n['Bath Body Exfoliating Brush,Shower Back Cleaning Scrubber with Long Handle,Dry or Wet Skin Exfoliator Brush with Soft Bristles Back Washer', 'Perfect for Daily Hygiene and Sensitive Skin.', 'Soft Nylon Bristles Be Easier to produce abundant foam,Just add some gel on it and rub the bristles.', 'This Brush will help you a better bath experience, Feel Fresh and Renewed Every Day.', 'Long Reach Handle', 'The Extended 16 inches Long Handle Will Use More Friendly.', 'Note\uff1athis brush bristles is too soft so if you want to exfoliate, we recommend using it with a body scrub.']\n{'Product Dimensions': '17 x 4 x 2 inches; 7.55 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Zhaoyun'}\nThe \"Bath Body Brush With Super Comfy Bristles\" is a nice addition to any shower / bathtime routine.<br /><br />It has a very sturdy handle made of Bamboo. You can really apply pressure to scrub those hard to reach areas without any worries at all that the handle will break. Unlike my previous brush that had a plastic handle.<br /><br />The bristles themselves are so soft. I loved them dry but as I wet them and applied some body wash the bristles weren't as great as I initially thought. They were almost too soft. I feel like they weren't doing as good of a job scrubbing the skin as some of my previous body brushes that had stiffer bristles did.<br /><br />I would have preferred that the bristles be a little more stiffer. So, as I used the brush for soaping up my body I actually felt some type of friction against my skin.\nVery Well Made / Sturdy \ud83d\udcaa\nAIUMMO Nail Art Brush, 5 PCS Nail Art Design Pen Painting Tools set with Nail Liner Brush Nail Extension UV Gel Nail Builder Brush for Salon at Home DIY Nail Manicure\nAIUMMO\n{'Color': 'Pink, Copper', 'Brand': 'AIUMMO', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '7.91 x 2.68 x 0.55 inches; 1.45 Ounces'}\nI received one \"AIUMMO Nail Art Brush Set\". This set includes 5 brushes.<br /><br />The set comes in a cheap plastic pouch but the brushes are actually pretty nice.<br /><br />They have a Pink / Purple color design, are easy to hold & use. The bristles don't fall out when you are using them either.<br /><br />The two brushes that have the least amount of bristles are my favorites. They are like ultra fine & are great for painting designs like stripes, lines & even little dots on your fingernails.<br /><br />The only downside to these brushes was after about 3 uses the bristles all curved to one side, like a C shape. That kind of sucked.<br /><br />The other 3 brushes with more bristles are still in good, like new shape.\nNot A Bad Set Of Brushes \ud83d\udc85\nNew Road Health Supply - No Rinse Bathing Wipes for Adults, Disposable Shower Wipes, Adult Wipes for Elderly and Bedridden, pH Balanced and Hypoallergenic, 12 Count Pack of 3\nRevive Rinse-Free\n{'Brand': 'Revive Rinse-Free', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Material Feature': 'Disposable', 'Unit Count': '12.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '3', 'Package Dimensions': '11.5 x 5.31 x 1.81 inches; 1.17 Pounds', 'UPC': '850030075147', 'Manufacturer': 'Revive Rinse-Free'}\nI received 3 packs of \"Revive Rinse Free Bathing Wipes\".
