  "reference_summary": "Mountain Falls Advanced Formula Nail Polish Remover Pads with 96% Acetone, for Natural Nails, 10 Count\nMountain Falls\n{'Brand': 'Mountain Falls', 'Item Form': 'Pad', 'Item Weight': '0.01 Pounds', 'Unit Count': '10 Count'}\nThese nail polish remover pads come individually wrapped & there are 10 in the box.<br /><br />They smell just like normal, traditional nail polish remover & we all know what that smells like. Strong!!! As soon as I tore open the packet ... bam. That smell hit me.<br /><br />The actual pads come out of the packet folded in half, have a pinkish color & they seem to be made out of felt or a felt like fabric.<br /><br />I decided to use one to take off my bright Red toenail polish. The first 2 nails came clean but then I started to notice that the remover pad was smearing the polish all over my toes & leaving finger nail polish color on my fingers.<br /><br />Overall, the pads do work but you're probably going to have to use at least 2 at a time. That means only 5 nail polish removals per box & for the price listed, I find them highly overpriced.<br /><br />Excuse my swollen foot picture, I'm trying to show how using just 1 nail polish remover pad left my toenail/toe area with a pinkish red hue.\nJust Okay \ud83d\udc85\nBouquet Garni Body Shower White Musk - Unique Fragrance Decanting Engineering Method gives Long Lasting Rich Fragrance - Gentle and Mild Cleansing Scented Body Wash with Natural Surfactant 17.85 Fl Oz\nBouquet Garni\n{'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Skin Type': 'All, Dry', 'Brand': 'Bouquet Garni', 'Scent': 'Garni', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '8.23 x 6.34 x 3.66 inches; 1.34 Pounds'}\nI was so excited to try this \"Bouquet Garni Body / Shower Wash\".<br /><br />The presentation is so nice & makes the product seem so high end.<br /><br />The body wash arrives in its own logo cardboard box.
