Strong!!! As soon as I tore open the packet ... bam. That smell hit me.<br /><br />The actual pads come out of the packet folded in half, have a pinkish color & they seem to be made out of felt or a felt like fabric.<br /><br />I decided to use one to take off my bright Red toenail polish. The first 2 nails came clean but then I started to notice that the remover pad was smearing the polish all over my toes & leaving finger nail polish color on my fingers.<br /><br />Overall, the pads do work but you're probably going to have to use at least 2 at a time. That means only 5 nail polish removals per box & for the price listed, I find them highly overpriced.<br /><br />Excuse my swollen foot picture, I'm trying to show how using just 1 nail polish remover pad left my toenail/toe area with a pinkish red hue.\nReview Title: Just Okay \ud83d\udc85\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
