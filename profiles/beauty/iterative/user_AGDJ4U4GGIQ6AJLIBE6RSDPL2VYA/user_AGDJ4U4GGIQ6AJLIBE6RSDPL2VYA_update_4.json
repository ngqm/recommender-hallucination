The roll is removable and needs to be put in the freezer for about 15-20 minutes. Then it's easily inserted back. It feels great on my face in the morning, wakes me right up and sort of revitalizes, plus I use it on my neck to close the pores. It works great with localized pain when you need something cold to bring  immediate relief. I must say it hold cold for a while, so one session will last however long you need. Good roller for pain relief and natural cosmetic treatments.\nReview Title: Interesting way to self care\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
