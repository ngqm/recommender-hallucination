The bars are pretty small but they give off a nice scent. They lather well and do leave skin softer than after use of regular soap. The only problem is that you use it once, and it starts to disintegrate. It turns into mush that can be scooped up from the soap dish. Even if you completely dry it, it still disintegrates. I like using it but I wish it would keep its shape.\nReview Title: Okay soap\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

The roll is removable and needs to be put in the freezer for about 15-20 minutes. Then it's easily inserted back. It feels great on my face in the morning, wakes me right up and sort of revitalizes, plus I use it on my neck to close the pores. It works great with localized pain when you need something cold to bring  immediate relief. I must say it hold cold for a while, so one session will last however long you need.
