The loop that held the spring just broke while my daughter was resting. Not too sturdy. Next day we tried matte black clip, and it's holding steady but now I have to be gentle with it. The hair bands are a nice bonus as well as the storage box it all came with. So some of them are sturdy, some of them are flimsy. But they hold up hair well and tight.\nReview Title: Hmmm\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

It has wonderful scent that keeps hair smelling great long after the shower, gets hair clean and moisturizes scalp well. I like using it.\nLove the scent\nLip MOISTURIZER by MERLOTSPF15 - Intense Therapy Lip Moisturizer - Grape Seed Infused - for Healing Dry, Chapped Lips. Made with Beeswax, Coconut Oil, Vitamin E - Color FreeSPF 15\nMerlot\n{'Package Dimensions': '2.71 x 1.57 x 0.59 inches; 0.32 Ounces'}\nThis chapstick is tasteless and has no smell. Unlike many others, when applied it does not leave lips feeling greasy - it starts working right away. Lips are moist, supple, and it stays on for long periods of time. I like it. I have a bad habit of peeling my lips, and when this chapstick is on, I do not have the urge to do it.\nGood chapstick\nBior\u00e9 J-Beauty Makeup Removing Moisturizing Cleansing Jelly, Top Japanese Makeup Remover, Gentle Skin Cleanser, Mild Floral Fragrance, Non-Greasy, 7.8 Ounce\nBior\u00e9\n['Bior\u00e9 J-Beauty Makeup Removing Moisturizing Cleansing Jelly is a non-greasy makeup remover that removes dirt and impurities from deep below the surface of your skin.

The wipes have pleasant scent, remove make up really well from eye shadow to mist water that is pretty thick. It leaves skin clean and moisturized. I like using them. The size is enough to remove a good chunk of make up at one time.\nGood make up remover wipes\nIce Roller for Face & Eye by Charmlily, Puffiness, Migraine, Pain Relief - Cold Facial Massager Treatment to Reduce Puffy Face & Tighten Pores, Under Eye Wrinkles (Pink)\nCHARMLILY\n{'Brand': 'CHARMLILY', 'Special Feature': 'Heat', 'Water Resistance Level': 'Not Water Resistant', 'Package Dimensions': '7.8 x 3.54 x 2.48 inches; 6.35 Ounces', 'UPC': '679360098356', 'Manufacturer': 'CHARMLILY'}\nThis roller is made out of lightweight plastic base and a a little sturdier roll that seems to be filled with some kind of gel. The roll is removable and needs to be put in the freezer for about 15-20 minutes. Then it's easily inserted back. It feels great on my face in the morning, wakes me right up and sort of revitalizes, plus I use it on my neck to close the pores. It works great with localized pain when you need something cold to bring  immediate relief. I must say it hold cold for a while, so one session will last however long you need. Good roller for pain relief and natural cosmetic treatments.\nInteresting way to self care\nBodyguard Moisturizing Immunity Soap 6pk | 7 Essential Oils Clinically Evaluated to Boost Immunity and Protect | Moisturizes with Sweet Almond Oil | Healthy PH for Skin Microbiome\nSpa-Da\n{'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Brand': 'Spa-Da', 'Scent': 'Cinnamon', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '8 x 3.3 x 2 inches; 7.2 Ounces', 'UPC': '860003618998'}\nThe soap came in a plastic bag. The bars are pretty small but they give off a nice scent. They lather well and do leave skin softer than after use of regular soap. The only problem is that you use it once, and it starts to disintegrate. It turns into mush that can be scooped up from the soap dish. Even if you completely dry it, it still disintegrates. I like using it but I wish it would keep its shape.\nOkay soap\nClaw Hair Clips, IKOCO 6 Pack Jaw Clips Stylish Matte Plastic Strong Hold Hair Clamps Box Packaged for Thin Fine Hair with 10Pcs Black Hair ties (2.4Inch)\nIKOCO\n{'Brand': 'IKOCO', 'Hair Type': 'Fine', 'Color': 'Green,Grey', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material': 'Plastic, Metal, Acrylic', 'Product Dimensions': '6.25 x 4.25 x 2 inches; 5.89 Ounces'}\nFirst day use, by the end of the day brown hair clip suddenly gave out.
