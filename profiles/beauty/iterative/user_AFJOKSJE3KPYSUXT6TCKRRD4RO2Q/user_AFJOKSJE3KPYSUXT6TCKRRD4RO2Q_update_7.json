It comes packaged in a plastic box, in plastic bags, in a hairnet to make sure it doesn't knot. The hair has an okay quality for its purpose, sits well on the head, and does look like we'd expected. What threw us was that the box claims it's 100% Brazilian hair (what's that?) but it also claims it's made in China. Maybe more knowledge-able wig-wearers will understand that. The hair has a synthetic feel to it and doesn't style quite as well as it could. But, as said, for our purposes it works very well.\nReview Title: Looks nice and sits well\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Bouquet Garni Body Shower White Musk - Unique Fragrance Decanting Engineering Method gives Long Lasting Rich Fragrance - Gentle and Mild Cleansing Scented Body Wash with Natural Surfactant 17.85 Fl Oz\nBouquet Garni\n{'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Skin Type': 'All, Dry', 'Brand': 'Bouquet Garni', 'Scent': 'Garni', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '8.23 x 6.34 x 3.66 inches; 1.34 Pounds'}\nI picked this one up because a little pampering in the shower doesn't hurt.<br /><br />Pros: - pump top easy to use and proportion<br />  - lovely design<br />  - doesn't tip over when reaching for it<br />  - nice smell<br /><br />Cons:  - doesn't sud up quite as much as I like<br /><br />With a larger family comes less 'pamper' time...and this one might not be much, but a little extra, lovely odor is a bonus in my life. This one sits well on the edge of the tub/shower and doesn't tip over every time I reach for it. The pump top works well and makes it easy to get soap without fiddling. It smells nice without being overwhelming and doesn't hang forever on the skin. The soap itself doesn't sud up as much as I'd like (can there be enough bubbles?), but it's not bad, either. The spreads easily, doesn't leave any residue or films, doesn't irritate the skin, and washes off without troubles. So, I'm satisfied.\nCleans and lovely odor\nFacial Skincare,Cucumber Essence Hydrating Moisturizing Revitalizing Hydration Fruit Extract Deep Cleaning Facial Skincare Sheet for All Skin Type Care, 35ml/1.18oz, Pack of 5\nPalNour\n{}\nCucumbers are supposed to be amazing for the skin. So, I wanted to give these a go.<br /><br />Pro: - moisten. Very moist.<br />  - mask doesn't rip or tear<br />  - plastic backing for easier application<br />  - gentle, pleasant aroma<br />  - sinks quickly into skin after massaging at end<br /><br />Cons: - thin<br />  - hard to slide into place...and then doesn't fit quite right<br />  - suggested wear time is 20-25 mins....longer than usual<br /><br />These masks come individually packaged in robust and easy to open pouches. The mask has a sturdy, plastic backing, which is the only reason it can be unfolded and placed on without any trouble because these are thin. Surprisingly, they don't rip or tear easily, though. After taking off the backing, it takes a little maneuvering to get these to sit in place. Firstly, the thin material wanted to bunch and roll along the edges of the face, and the lack of thickness made it difficult to get to lay flat. Also, the eye holes aren't quite right. I, my son, and my daughter tried them (each with very different face sizes) and all of us had trouble with the eyes. When they were in position, The bridge of the nose wouldn't stay pressed against the skin, but kept lifting up. The suggested wear time is 20 to 25 minutes, which is longer than the 15 to 20 I normally see on masks. Removing the mask, however, is no problem, and there's a good amount of moisture left over to massage into the skin....which also works well<br /><br />The masks are moistening and have a gentle, pleasant odor (although I can't really place it). These are refreshing and leave the skin shiny. If only they'd sit better, I'd enjoy them more.\nMoistens\nSoo'AE Sweet Pink Bubble Mask, Clarifying & Softening, 1 Count\nSOOAE\n{'Brand': 'SOOAE', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Product Benefits': 'Softening,Softer', 'Scent': 'Peach', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Product Dimensions': '3.5 x 0.1 x 5.5 inches; 0.32 Ounces'}\nA bubble mask was something I hadn't tried yet. So, I was curious.<br /><br />Pros: - pretty, pink coloring<br />  - quite a bit in package<br />  - goes on easily<br />  - doesn't drip or ooze<br />  - gentle, soapy odor<br />  - fun to have to foam up on face<br /><br />This comes in the usual, mask, foil pouch and is easy to rip open. The mask-fluid is pinkish and has the appearance of yoghurt. It has a flowery, soapy odor, but this isn't over-powering by any means. It's no problem to spread over the face and doesn't drip or run while doing so. It actually starts to foam the second it hits the skin. This was actually fun to watch (joy in little things) and tingles a bit, too. Even the foam stays in place and doesn't run off of the skin or drip.<br /><br />It is to be worn for 3 min, and then washed off....like a mud mask (but foam is simply more enjoyable than mud). It rinses off pretty easily and leaves the skin feeling refreshed and a pinkish hue. It's simply a nice experience and a change up from the usual masks and muds.\nBubbly, quick and fun\nCARLA Lacto Biome Balancing Cream Skin Care for Sensitive Dry Skin Face Hydrating Moisturizer\nNY FASHIONCITY\n{'Brand': 'NY FASHIONCITY', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '4.3387 Ounce', 'Use for': 'Face', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'UPC': '191752068773'}\nThe cream comes is a white box, light cardboard box with the glass jar inside (this has a white, thick plastic lid. It looks simple and in the elegant direction. Upon opening the lid, there's a plastic cover, which needs to be removed (and tossed). The creams is white and carries a citrus odor.  It is smooth and thick enough to easily dip out of the jar with the fingers. It has a definite water-base feel to it.<br />It spreads onto the skin easily and sinks in relatively quickly. The skin does feel slightly tighter(? I guess I'll call it that) right away. I could tell where I had put the cream on and where not. It moistens the skin, and the citrus smell lingers. I have no trouble putting on make-up afterwards. So, far it seems to be smoothing the skin, but only time will tell how it does on that end.\nReally enjoying it\nUJM Magnetic Eyelashes 10 Pairs Reusable Magnetic Eyelash and Eyeliner Kit Natural Look False Lashes with Tweezers No Glue Needed Waterproof Magnetic Lashes\nUJM\n{'Brand': 'UJM', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '8 x 4 x 0.4 inches', 'Material Feature': 'Gluten Free', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Mounting Type': 'Eyelash Glue', 'Product Dimensions': '8 x 4 x 0.4 inches; 2.89 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'UJM-010'}\nAfter hearing several friends praise magnetic eyelashes, I decided to give these a go.<br />The package goes with 10 pairs of eyelashes, each held into place by a magnetic strip, and each one slightly different than the other. There are two containers of magnetic eye liner and one plastic tweezers.<br />The eyeliner has a thin brush which makes it simple to paint the black line where it needs to be and keep it straight. I had to go back and re-do the very edges to make sure there was enough to hold the lashes. These are easy to remove from the box with the tweezers and place onto the eyes. I was surprised how well the lashes hold...it's not over grippy but they stay in place as long as you don't knock them around. The felt a bit scratchy along the corner to the nose, although it wasn't really rubbing. This sensation was only slight and soon forgotten.<br /><br />The eyelashes are easy to remove and place back into the box for re-usage. The eyeliner came off so much easier than I thought it would....with a little warm water. It balls off into tiny chunks and doesn't run or scuff or leave marks behind.<br /><br />These work better than I thought they might and I will be using them again.\nStay in place\nHeyedrate Activated Charcoal Soap Bar and Face Wash | Organic, Vegan, Natural Soap made with Dead Sea Mud and Our Essential Oil Blend (1 Pack (5 Ounces))\nEye Love\n{'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Brand': 'Eye Love', 'Scent': 'Eucalyptus, Coconut, Grapefruit, Rosemary', 'Material Feature': 'Organic, Natural, Vegan', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '4 x 1 x 1 inches; 4.97 Ounces', 'UPC': '850436007827'}\nMy son loves charcoal soaps. So, we gave this one a try.<br /><br />Pros: - smooth<br />  - very pleasant, herbal smell<br />  -  Dead Sea mud nice additive<br />  - has a nice, homemade cut<br /><br />Oddity (but not really a con): - seems to be almost moist although it isn't<br /><br />This soap has such a pleasant odor in comparison to the usual charcoal soaps my son uses. It also doesn't leave as sticky of a black residue in the shower. It is smooth and soapy, and is very nice on the skin...which I'm assuming has something to do with the Dead Sea mud. The bar isn't factory cut but has a nice, homemade appearance. My son really likes this one quite a bit.\nPretty good soap\nBlack To Grey Ombre Synthetic Wigs Mixed Color Natural Wave Wigs for Women Natural Hairline Lace Long Wig for Daily Use Heat Resistant Hair Replacement Wigs (Ombre grey)\nRefined hair\n{'Package Dimensions': '10.04 x 5.94 x 2.09 inches; 9.91 Ounces'}\nWe picked this one up for a Halloween costume.
