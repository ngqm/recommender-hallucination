Very moist.<br />  - mask doesn't rip or tear<br />  - plastic backing for easier application<br />  - gentle, pleasant aroma<br />  - sinks quickly into skin after massaging at end<br /><br />Cons: - thin<br />  - hard to slide into place...and then doesn't fit quite right<br />  - suggested wear time is 20-25 mins....longer than usual<br /><br />These masks come individually packaged in robust and easy to open pouches. The mask has a sturdy, plastic backing, which is the only reason it can be unfolded and placed on without any trouble because these are thin. Surprisingly, they don't rip or tear easily, though. After taking off the backing, it takes a little maneuvering to get these to sit in place. Firstly, the thin material wanted to bunch and roll along the edges of the face, and the lack of thickness made it difficult to get to lay flat. Also, the eye holes aren't quite right. I, my son, and my daughter tried them (each with very different face sizes) and all of us had trouble with the eyes. When they were in position, The bridge of the nose wouldn't stay pressed against the skin, but kept lifting up. The suggested wear time is 20 to 25 minutes, which is longer than the 15 to 20 I normally see on masks. Removing the mask, however, is no problem, and there's a good amount of moisture left over to massage into the skin....which also works well<br /><br />The masks are moistening and have a gentle, pleasant odor (although I can't really place it). These are refreshing and leave the skin shiny. If only they'd sit better, I'd enjoy them more.\nReview Title: Moistens\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

This one sits well on the edge of the tub/shower and doesn't tip over every time I reach for it. The pump top works well and makes it easy to get soap without fiddling. It smells nice without being overwhelming and doesn't hang forever on the skin. The soap itself doesn't sud up as much as I'd like (can there be enough bubbles?), but it's not bad, either. The spreads easily, doesn't leave any residue or films, doesn't irritate the skin, and washes off without troubles. So, I'm satisfied.\nCleans and lovely odor\nFacial Skincare,Cucumber Essence Hydrating Moisturizing Revitalizing Hydration Fruit Extract Deep Cleaning Facial Skincare Sheet for All Skin Type Care, 35ml/1.18oz, Pack of 5\nPalNour\n{}\nCucumbers are supposed to be amazing for the skin.
