This one sits well on the edge of the tub/shower and doesn't tip over every time I reach for it. The pump top works well and makes it easy to get soap without fiddling. It smells nice without being overwhelming and doesn't hang forever on the skin. The soap itself doesn't sud up as much as I'd like (can there be enough bubbles?), but it's not bad, either. The spreads easily, doesn't leave any residue or films, doesn't irritate the skin, and washes off without troubles. So, I'm satisfied.\nReview Title: Cleans and lovely odor\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
