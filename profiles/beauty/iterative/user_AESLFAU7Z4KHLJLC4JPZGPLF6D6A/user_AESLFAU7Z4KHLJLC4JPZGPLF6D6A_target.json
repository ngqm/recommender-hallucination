The smell is somewhat unpleasant, but certainly intolerable. I am just happy that it works as advertised.  I will warn you to be careful, though.  I ended up with some very dry skin on my leg from this cream.  It heeled, so that makes me happy.  As for the inhibitor... It kind of works... it at least slows down the growth of the hair, and wen the hair returns the roots are considerably more fragile.  very pleased!\nReview Title: excellent product, but don't allow cream to sit too long!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
