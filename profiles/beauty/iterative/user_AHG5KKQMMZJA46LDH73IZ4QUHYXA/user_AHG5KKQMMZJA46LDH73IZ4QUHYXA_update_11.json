Scent is very cologne like with a strong backbone of sweet lemon rind/lemonhead. It's in no way overpowering but has a fair presence. I find the scent enjoyable and the oil decent, I would prefer it a little more slick but this is a great happy medium and I can just go extra if need be.\nReview Title: Good stuff.

  "reference_summary": "MARLOWE. Essentials Kit for Men No. 202 | Gift Set with 9 Products, Toiletry Bag | Lotion, Shave, Wash, Soap, Pomade, Lip Balm | Simple & Effective\nMARLOWE. M BLEND\n{'Package Dimensions': '10.24 x 5.24 x 4.76 inches; 2.62 Pounds', 'UPC': '859984007822'}\nI am a fan of MARLOW products...I have several others not included in this set and all are great. I'll break down each product briefly below.<br /><br />BAG: Very nice, basic black but well padded and holds it's shape. I basic in shape but I higher quality then usual.<br /><br />SOAP: Great balsam/fir scent. Excellent balance of exfoliation and suds. Leaves body invigorated, soft and smelling great!<br /><br />SHAVE: Has a tea scent, hint of some sort of alcohol. Builds into a creamy texture, not much sud but decent coverage. Does it's job. Finishes with a clean scent.<br /><br />FACE WASH: Nice balsam/fir scent to it. A little goes a long way! Very slick, seems to not penetrate but wash the exterior of skin. Takes some work to wash off. Finishes with a green tea scent and refreshed.<br /><br />FACE MOISTURIZER: Has a tea/alcohol scent at first...Goes on smooth. Dries fairly quickly, leaving a sweet green tea scent. Leaves face feeling soft not oily.<br /><br />POMADE: Great scent, more cologne like. Goes on easy, not too tacky or slick. Does a decent job.<br /><br />LIP BALM: Awesome balm!!! At first I thought it was an odd addition to the set. But man I love this balm. Goes on with a hint of sweet tea. Not waxy, not glossy, just a perfect balance that keeps lips moisturized.\nGreat set...All you need in one bundle. Great gift for someone.\nAZURE Hyaluronic & Retinol Anti Aging Under Eye Pads- Moisturizing & Rejuvenating Eye Mask Patches - Reduces Fine Lines, Wrinkles, Dark Circles & Puffiness - Skin Care Made in Korea - 5 Pairs\nAzure Cosmetics\n{'Brand': 'Azure Cosmetics', 'Item Form': 'Under eye Patch', 'Product Benefits': 'Moisturizing', 'Scent': 'Unscented', 'Material Type Free': 'Paraben Free', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '3.5 x 1 x 6 inches; 2.08 Ounces', 'Item model number': '689513260202', 'UPC': '689513260202', 'Manufacturer': 'Just Solutions!'}\nPretty straight forward. Come 2 to a sealed pouch. They are stacked in the pouch so they can be a little difficult to get apart and straightened out. No noticeable or standout scent to them. Apply smooth, nice that they have slits so you can shape it to your contour. They do a nice job refreshing and smoothing my eyes.\nNice product.

Applies and spreads well. Leave a hydrated feel without an oily or shiny residual. Happy with it's performance, just not crazy about the scent. Smells earthy, like peat moss.\nThin but works well. Not crazy about the scent.\nMD Complete Bright & Healthy Vitamin C+ Vitalizing Face Serum| with Vitamin C, Vitamin E and Herbal Extracts | Potent Antioxidant Protection, Nourishes, Brightens and Evens Skin 0.5 fl oz\nMD Complete by Dr. Brian Zelickson\n{'Skin Type': 'Acne Prone, Sensitive', 'Use for': 'Face', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'MD Complete by Dr. Brian Zelickson', 'Item Form': 'Serum', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.05 x 1.63 x 3.75 inches; 4.97 Ounces', 'UPC': '850458005573'}\nFirst, the scent is AMAZING...Sweet blood orange with a grapefruit bubble gum undertone, maybe even some jasmine and peppermint, something that awakens your olfactory. Its very strong but not overpowering. Truly one of the best things I've smelt.<br /><br />APPLICATION: Goes on fairly oily and blends pretty well. Immediately brings color to my face, I have medium skin and it starts with an apricot redness but fades back to an awakened tone. I really enjoy that about this, I see others complain about this so maybe it's not best for fair skinned people?.<br /><br />Once dry, I am left with a matte sheen that is well hydrated. You expect it to feel oily but it's more like a raw feel. A really nice balance of hydrated but not wet and definitely softer. I really enjoy this product as well as their others I've tried and will happily continue to use this as my nightly regiment.\nAmazing scent. Brings out the color in my skin.\nDog Paw Washer Automatic Cleaner for Small and Medium dogs with Brush Pet Foot Cup Silicone\nMr Ros\n{'Brand': 'Mr Ros', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Material': 'Silicone', 'Product Dimensions': '3.94 x 3.94 x 6.3 inches; 15.66 Ounces'}\n[[VIDEOID:5d66b612355cbdece6627644534d9174]] The biggest downside to this cleaner is it's price. Price is subjective, but you don't feel like you are getting a $50 product. The logo is just a crappy sticker, it feels pretty thin, isn't very powerful and didn't come with a wall plug (only cord, not a huge deal but for the price...). There are similar ones for less.<br /><br />Performance wish, I like it a lot. Coming from a manual one, this makes for much easier work to wrangle my dog an let this do the work. It is not very powerful but that is okay as it doesn't scare my dogs. This is a 4 star product but I feel I had to remove another star for it's price/value.\nNice brush. Good fit for my 75lb bullies.\nMr. Pristine Organic Beard Conditioner to Grow, Thicken, Moisturize and Protect Your Beard, 8.5 oz.\nMr. Pristine\n{'Brand': 'Mr. Pristine', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Hair Type': 'Dry', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '8.5 Fl Oz', 'Package Dimensions': '3.1 x 2.5 x 2.36 inches; 7.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '627843801825', 'Manufacturer': 'Mr. Pristine'}\nI would give it 2 stars but I actually like the (opposite) effect it had on my beard. It ended up drying out my beard but gave it a fuller effect. The conditioner itself is a thick lotion like consistency, very hard to squeeze out. Scent is a light spearmint that doesn't transfer to my beard well. Disappears after rinsing. End effect left my beard and face feeling dry and chapped, not what I want from a conditioner.\nThickened but dried out my beard.\nAutomatic Hand Soap/Sanitizer Dispenser Kit - Table liquid Dispenser Pump Station 13.5 oz. Alcohol-Based Sprayer\nYAPASPT\n{'Color': 'Transparent', 'Material': 'Abs', 'Brand': 'YAPASPT', 'Number of Sets': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '8.4 x 4 x 3.5 inches; 10.41 Ounces', 'UPC': '710050025280'}\n**update** Unit stopped working after a few days. New (and tested) batteries placed in it and it won't power on. The second part, which is my original review stands true...However, I can not longer give a good rating to a product that lasted a couple days. Your results may vary.<br /><br />Nice little dispenser. Good goldielocks size, not too big, not too small. Doesn't get in the way but doesn't get overlooked. Sanitary design and functions well.\n*update* Stopped working.\nPortable Hard Travel Gift Case for Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryer, Storage Case Box Organizer for Dyson Supersonic HD01,Black\nForlin\n{'Package Dimensions': '14.69 x 12.09 x 3.7 inches; 1.76 Pounds'}\nPrice seems a bit high, but you are getting a very nice case that is a great fit for you high priced hair dryer...So the price is a bit relevant in that sense. Every item fit securely in it's place and the box has a nice hard shell to it. The hard shell is a medium strength...Sturdy, not floppy but not crush proof but does a great job of protection and would feel safe packing this in a suitcase for travel.\nGreat investment protection.\nNAILGIL Poly Nail Gel (Temperature)\nNAIL GIL\n{'Brand': 'NAIL GIL', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'gel', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '9.45 x 4.72 x 1.18 inches'}\nNice set for the money. Packaged nicely to make for a great gift. Colors are on point and so far they are holding up will on my wife, who is a nurse and bangs her hands around all day.\nNice set. Great gift.\n3 Barrel Curling Iron, 25mm Curling Waver Iron Hair Waver with LCD Display Adjustable Temperature 1 Inch Tourmaline Ceramic Triple Hair Crimper Hair Tools for Deep Waves All Style (1#)\nSolati\n{'Brand': 'Solati', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy, Curly, Normal', 'Material': 'Ceramic', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Max Temperature Setting': '210 Degrees Celsius', 'Package Dimensions': '15.94 x 4.21 x 3.5 inches; 1.54 Pounds', 'UPC': '757350981861', 'Manufacturer': 'Solati'}\nReally nice iron! 5 stars based off of it's value at a $35 price point. Is it a top of the line, 5 star iron? No...But for this price, it is an excellent value for an entry level device. The handle is very ergonomic with an on/off button with +/- temperature control. It heats up quick enough, giving you a temp readout on the LCD display. The iron itself is a little thin and somewhat cheaply painted but it functions nicely. The clasp opens and closes with ease but has good retention. My wife was unsure if she'd like one of these and she is very happy with it and it's results!\nGreat for it's price!\nBold Men, Beard Oil 30ml- Beard Oil, Conditioner and Softener, Natural Essential Oils of Cedarwood and Patchouli (Mad Man)\nBOLD MEN\n{'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Scent': 'Fresh', 'Liquid Volume': '30 Milliliters', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Product Dimensions': '1.57 x 1.57 x 4.33 inches; 2.89 Ounces', 'UPC': '793611800632'}\nGood stuff...The oil is on the mild/medium side, not to greasy or shiny, a good balance. Scent is very cologne like with a strong backbone of sweet lemon rind/lemonhead. It's in no way overpowering but has a fair presence. I find the scent enjoyable and the oil decent, I would prefer it a little more slick but this is a great happy medium and I can just go extra if need be.\nGood stuff. A bit cologne-y but not overpowering.",
