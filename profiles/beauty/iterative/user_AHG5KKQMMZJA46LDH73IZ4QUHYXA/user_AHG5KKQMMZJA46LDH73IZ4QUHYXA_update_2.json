M BLEND\n{'Package Dimensions': '10.24 x 5.24 x 4.76 inches; 2.62 Pounds', 'UPC': '859984007822'}\nI am a fan of MARLOW products...I have several others not included in this set and all are great. I'll break down each product briefly below.<br /><br />BAG: Very nice, basic black but well padded and holds it's shape. I basic in shape but I higher quality then usual.<br /><br />SOAP: Great balsam/fir scent. Excellent balance of exfoliation and suds. Leaves body invigorated, soft and smelling great!<br /><br />SHAVE: Has a tea scent, hint of some sort of alcohol. Builds into a creamy texture, not much sud but decent coverage. Does it's job. Finishes with a clean scent.<br /><br />FACE WASH: Nice balsam/fir scent to it. A little goes a long way! Very slick, seems to not penetrate but wash the exterior of skin. Takes some work to wash off. Finishes with a green tea scent and refreshed.<br /><br />FACE MOISTURIZER: Has a tea/alcohol scent at first...Goes on smooth. Dries fairly quickly, leaving a sweet green tea scent. Leaves face feeling soft not oily.<br /><br />POMADE: Great scent, more cologne like. Goes on easy, not too tacky or slick. Does a decent job.<br /><br />LIP BALM: Awesome balm!!! At first I thought it was an odd addition to the set. But man I love this balm. Goes on with a hint of sweet tea. Not waxy, not glossy, just a perfect balance that keeps lips moisturized.\nGreat set...All you need in one bundle.
