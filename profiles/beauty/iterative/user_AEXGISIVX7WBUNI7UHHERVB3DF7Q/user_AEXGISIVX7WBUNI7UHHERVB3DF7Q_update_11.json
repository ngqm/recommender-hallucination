It\u2019s very easy to apply, just like clear liquid eyeliner. It\u2019s good that it does not irritate my wife\u2019s sensitive skin at all. She has tried on her lashes and has noticed a slight difference in the thickness of them. I am sure that time will bring more dramatic results. The product is a bit pricey for the amount you get though.\nEasy to apply, does not irritate.\n2-Pack Puretize 16.9 Oz Hand Sanitizing Gel w/Pump Tops - Extra Strength 70% Ethyl Alcohol - Moisturizing Formula with Aloe Vera, Vitamin E & Botanical Extracts - Quick Drying Formula\nPure Daily Care\n{'Brand': 'Pure Daily Care', 'Unit Count': '33.8 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Special Feature': 'Moisturizing', 'Scent': 'Unscented', 'Package Dimensions': '7 x 6.5 x 4.5 inches; 1.06 Pounds', 'UPC': '810016711360'}\nThis hand sanitizer by Puretize is great. During the time of the pandemic, this is a must! It contains 70% alcohol, which is great to kill those nasty germs \ud83e\udda0! It smells similar to rubbing alcohol, however it\u2019s not too strong. I love this hand sanitizer as it doesn\u2019t dry out my hands like others. Every family needs a bottle of this in their home!\nSanitizes without drying out hands!\n21\u00b0C 4 Pieces Detangling Brush and Hair Comb Set Knots Detangler Easy to Clean for Kinky Wavy Curly Coily Wet Dry Oil Thick Long Natural Hair(Pink)\n21\u00b0C\n{'Brand': '21\u00b0C', 'Special Feature': 'Detangling', 'Product Benefits': 'Detangle', 'Unit Count': '8.3 Ounce', 'Hair Type': 'All, Coarse, Wavy, Dry, Curly, Thick', 'Package Dimensions': '10.3 x 3.4 x 1.7 inches; 8.5 Ounces'}\nThis 4 piece hair set is great! My wife has wavy hair, as well as my daughter, and myself. My son has long, curly, coarse hair. This set works on all of our hair types! The largest hollowed our brush is great for blow drying. The smaller comb/brush is designed to remove tangles from curly hair, and it works well when using with detangling spray. There is a small attachment included, which hooks onto the back of the brush to keep the bristles together. You also get a wide tooth comb and a parting comb. Everything included in the set is lightweight and easy to hold. It\u2019s a great set at an amazing price!\nThe perfect set for your hair!\nShakira Perfumes - Dance for Women - Long Lasting - Femenine, Charming and Modern Perfume - Fruity Floral Notes - Ideal for Day Wear - 1.7 Fl Oz\nShakira\n{'Brand': 'Shakira', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Item Volume': '50 Milliliters', 'Scent': 'Dance', 'Special Feature': 'Long Lasting', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Language': 'English', 'Product Dimensions': '2.64 x 2.05 x 5.63 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'Item model number': '8411061823033'}\nMy wife really likes this perfume by Shakira! It has a nice sweet scent, with a hint of spice. It\u2019s an incredibly sexy scent that I love too! \u2764\ufe0f It doesn\u2019t last the whole day, however if you reapply in the afternoon, it does. The bottle is beautiful too! Just looks weird with my wife grabbing Shakira\u2019s bod and spraying. \ud83d\ude02 We got a good laugh out of it!\nSweet with a little bit of spice!\nBath Bombs, SAZEN Bath Bomb with Natural & Organic Essential Oils, Shea Coconut Butter for Skin Moisturize, Bubble Spa Bath, Birthday Mothers Day Christmas Handmade Gift Set for Women Kids Her Him\nSAZEN\n{'Brand': 'SAZEN', 'Scent': 'Coconut', 'Material Feature': 'Organic Ingredients', 'Unit Count': '24.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '24', 'Package Dimensions': '12.17 x 6.26 x 2.24 inches; 2.65 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'SAZEN 01', 'UPC': '745103723622', 'Manufacturer': 'SAZEN'}\nThese bath bombs are great, especially for the price.

Each bath bomb is wrapped in tissue paper and labeled. The packaging is just amazing!<br /><br />The scents are strong, so these may not work for you if you are sensitive to strong scents. I personally think they smell wonderful!\nPackaged so nicely and smell lovely!\n10 Pairs Reusable Magnetic Eyelashes and 2 Tubes of Magnetic Eyeliner Kit, Upgraded 3D 5D Natural Look Magnetic Fake Lashes and Liner Set - No Glue Need\nSTRONGLO\n{'Brand': 'STRONGLO', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '8.11 x 5.94 x 0.87 inches', 'Material Feature': 'Gluten Free', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Mounting Type': 'Eyelash Glue', 'Product Dimensions': '8.11 x 5.94 x 0.87 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nMy wife has always wanted to try magnetic eyelashes, so she decided to give these a shot. They really do work! But, with these practice makes perfect.<br /><br />They come with 2 tubes of magnetic eyeliner (black), and 10 sets of eyelashes along with the application tool. When you apply the magnetic eyeliner, you have to be precise. The eyeliner is black, and will look very dark if you do too thick of a line. I would do thinner lines if possible, with about 2 layers so that the eyeliner is not overwhelming. Once the eyeliner dries, use the application tool to put the lashes on.<br /><br />It does feel a bit strange at first (if false lashes are new to you), and it may tickle around your eyes when you blink. But yes, these really work! With more practice my wife will get better at this.<br /><br />The only thing is that the magnetic eyeliner does not come off easily. You will need a good eye makeup remover to get this off as it\u2019s waterproof!\nPractice makes perfect\n26 Inches Long Hair\nSENSAIRUITE\n{'Brand': 'SENSAIRUITE', 'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Extension Length': '26 Inches', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Package Dimensions': '11.18 x 6.97 x 6.38 inches; 1.9 Pounds'}\nThis mannequin head is great for the price. It includes the clamp, and the hair is very thick. The hair is not real human hair, it\u2019s synthetic... so it doesn\u2019t curl very good like real human hair.<br /><br />It is great for trying out new hair styles though, even for practicing hair cutting. It comes with 2 clips and rubber bands as well.\nIt\u2019s great for testing new hairstyles!\nSpanature Green Tea Hand & Body Lotion Travel Size Selection, 4 Pack, Revitalizing Moisturizer for Rough and Dry Skin, Nourishing and Gentle for All Skin Types, Made In Korea - 75 ml/2.53oz\nSpanature\n{'Brand': 'Spanature', 'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Active Ingredients': 'Green tea', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '4', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.9 x 2.1 x 1.9 inches; 8.8 Ounces'}\nThis 4 pack of travel lotions by Spanature is super nice, from the presentation of the product, to the performance of the product.
