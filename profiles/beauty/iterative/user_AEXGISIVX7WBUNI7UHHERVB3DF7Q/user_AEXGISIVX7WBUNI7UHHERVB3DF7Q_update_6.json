My wife has wavy hair, as well as my daughter, and myself. My son has long, curly, coarse hair. This set works on all of our hair types! The largest hollowed our brush is great for blow drying. The smaller comb/brush is designed to remove tangles from curly hair, and it works well when using with detangling spray. There is a small attachment included, which hooks onto the back of the brush to keep the bristles together. You also get a wide tooth comb and a parting comb. Everything included in the set is lightweight and easy to hold. It\u2019s a great set at an amazing price!\nReview Title: The perfect set for your hair!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
