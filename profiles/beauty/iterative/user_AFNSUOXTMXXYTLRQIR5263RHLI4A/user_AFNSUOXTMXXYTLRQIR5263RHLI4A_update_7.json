Thank you as\nLook great\nMisaki - Kolinsky Acrylic Nail Brush Powder For Manicure and Pedicure - Size #10 (Crimped)\nMISAKI\n{'Brand': 'MISAKI', 'Handle Material': 'Acrylic', 'Head Material': 'Kolinsky', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '8 x 0.5 x 0.5 inches; 0.32 Ounces'}\nMy brush did not come in a box like some pictures show, just in a plastic container. I used it today for the first time. Now, let me tell you, it takes me a while to know if I like a brush or not. To get used to it. I have some very good brushes but this one just beat them all! I love it! It is my definitely favorite brush! It's very high quality, holds its shape perfectly, acrylic doesn't get stuck in it.. It is by far the best brush I've ever used. I will recommend it to all my nail tech friends and will get a bunch of them as soon as I can just to make sure I'm good on brushes. And in case they quit selling them.<br /><br />By the way, the fact that it's short is a plus in my book. That way I'm not worried that I'm gonna get it in my customer's eye when I'm brushing the acrylic back to the cuticle area. And it fits perfectly in my hand.\nPerfect.\nPrettyDiva 1g Holographic Powder Rainbow Unicorn Chrome Nails Powder Manicure Pigment Top Grade\nPretty Diva\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2.01 x 1.61 x 0.39 inches; 0.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '701630344631', 'Manufacturer': 'Pretty Diva'}\nThis holographic powder is amazing!

Just under half of the bottle. And keep in mind that orange wood sticks are pretty thick, so it pushed some of the polish up, too. So a third at best.\nNot 18 ml!\nTOMICCA Bright Colors Gel Nail Polish Set UV LED Gel Polish Kit 6 Color Silver Gold Pink Soak Off Gel Nail Polish\nTOMICCA Holy\n{'Brand': 'TOMICCA Holy', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Number of Items': '6', 'Number of Pieces': '6', 'Liquid Volume': '5 Milliliters', 'Package Dimensions': '6.2 x 4.2 x 1.6 inches; 8.47 Ounces'}\nThe colors are so beautiful!
