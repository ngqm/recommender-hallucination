I used it today for the first time. Now, let me tell you, it takes me a while to know if I like a brush or not. To get used to it. I have some very good brushes but this one just beat them all! I love it! It is my definitely favorite brush! It's very high quality, holds its shape perfectly, acrylic doesn't get stuck in it.. It is by far the best brush I've ever used. I will recommend it to all my nail tech friends and will get a bunch of them as soon as I can just to make sure I'm good on brushes. And in case they quit selling them.<br /><br />By the way, the fact that it's short is a plus in my book. That way I'm not worried that I'm gonna get it in my customer's eye when I'm brushing the acrylic back to the cuticle area. And it fits perfectly in my hand.\nReview Title: Perfect.\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
