Good ones are almost impossible to find. This one is well worth the money. I ordered the 18\u201d and when I received it (prime 2 days) it looked like a hot mess. Yellow, body wave soft but messy. I colored it with medium ash blond and light ash blond box color. It took the ash color too well! I went back and redid it in pale beige blond and lightened it up. I still need to do platinum highlights and a shadow root. I conditioned, blow dried and straightened with a flat iron. It straightened absolutely beautifully. I cut off about 3\u201d because sadly the ends were too thin. The hair is gorgeous though. I curl it with a 1 1/4\u201d curling iron and it looks great at first but curl doesn\u2019t stay well in humidity. It remains soft smooth and silky though. Now the cap-lace front appears pretty much preplucked. I plucked my part. I did not pluck the edges as they were great as is. Lace melted into my hairline. Cap is comfortable and wefts do not show. Good natural density. My one issue:: this cap is BIG. That\u2019s perfect if you have a bigger head or tons of bio hair but I don\u2019t. I\u2019m a petite average and the bigger circumference on this wig makes it difficult to lay the lace without overlap and buckling. Also the cap itself is a little baggy on me. I make it work but I could never wear it without a wig grip underneath and it\u2019s still biggish. Overall though a great wig for the price!!\nReview Title: Great human hair for under $200!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
