  "reference_summary": "Skymore 30ml Fast Hair Growth Serum, Anti-Hair Loss, Hair Thinning Treatment, 100% Pure & Natural, Non-Greasy, Nourishing & Moisturizing, All Hair Types\nSkymore\n{'Brand': 'Skymore', 'Item Form': 'serum', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Fl Oz', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '3.94 x 3.94 x 3.94 inches; 3.07 Ounces'}\nI waited to write review so this product had time to work or not. It arrived 1July. I used that day & have used everyday as of 28July. There are actual tiny strands of hair growing from my scalp where there hasn't been in 4yrs due to medication needed from a horrific accident. Do exactly as instructions indicate. Product arrived well packaged. As a woman lost hair is devastating. To try products with no results will have most women severely depressed. This product made me smile, laugh, cry, and sob all in that order. It was so much to take in when I saw lil sprout's of my hair growing from my scalp, just amazing.. Definitely worth trying. Only 4 stars because I'm not sure how long I'll have to use or if I stop using will my hair stop growing. Other than that reason I would have given 5 star.. Would recommend.\nI have tiny strands of hair where there hasnt been any in 4years\nGejoy 12 Pieces Shiny Scrunchie Elastics Scrunchy Bobbles Metallic Hair Scrunchies for Dance Show Party Gym Club of Women and Girls\n{'Item Weight': '0.11 Pounds', 'Number of Pieces': '12', 'Unit Count': '12.00 Count', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.4 x 4.57 x 0.94 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '797153595056'}\nThese arrived in a vacuum sealed package!!
