  "reference_summary": "Travel Bottles Keychain, 1.7oz/50ml Portable Hand Sanitizer Bottles, Fine Mist Spray Keychain Bottles, Empty Leakproof Refillable Containers with Flip/Spray Cap Plastic Travel Bottles (5PC)\nXITENBAO\n{'Brand': 'XITENBAO', 'Material': 'Silicone,Plastic', 'Capacity': '50 Milliliters, 1.7 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Special Feature': 'Portable, Mist Spray, Leakproof', 'Package Dimensions': '7 x 7 x 2.5 inches; 3.99 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'klp-001', 'UPC': '192408404112'}\nIn this set u get:<br />5 hard plastic bottles<br />5 carabiners: blue, red, yellow, purple, and green<br />5 pump bottle sprayers<br />5 squeezy bottle tops<br />1 collapsable blue funnel<br /><br />These bottles are designed to hang upside-down using the included carabiner.  They attach easily to any loop, whether it be a purse, belt, or backpack.  I really like the fact that the tops are interchangeable.  Ive never seen that options b4.  I also really like the funnel it comes with.  It doesnt take up much room b/c it collapses into itself for easy storage.  It is a little difficult to fill the bottles, even with the provided funnel.  The bottoms of the bottles are rounded, so u cant place them on the counter to fill them.  It CAN be done with one hand, but it is much easier to do with a 2nd person helping.  I dont like that they are made out of hard plastic.  It doesnt matter if u are just using it as a sprayer, but if u need it to be a squeezable bottle, it is difficult to get every drop out.  When u fill the bottle to use with the mister, u need to pay attention to the included straw inside.  It has to wrap around the area where the carabiner fits in order to get every last drop out of the container.  needless to say, I like this product's versatility, and especially during covid they r a great idea for hand sanitizer.  I hope this was helpful.\nthey remind me of transformers\nTCM Men's Cleansing Activated Charcoal Bar Soap - For all skin types - 5oz (1 Pack)\nTCM\n{'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'TCM', 'Scent': 'Coconut', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Youth', 'Package Dimensions': '3.7 x 2.01 x 1.34 inches; 5.26 Ounces', 'UPC': '851058008179'}\nmy boyfriend LOVES all kinds of bar soap!!!  he gets soooo excited when a new 1 arrives.  he really liked the fact that this 1 was charcoal... he's had many over the years and has really liked them... this 1... not so much.  he said it feels more like a lotion rather than a soap... that being said, it does lather up very well.  he said it is more of a grey then a black and he didnt like the size of the bar.  he said it was awkward in his hand, but it dirtied the floor less than other charcoal soap.  he didnt love this bar.
