Biodegradable Hydrating Hand Wipes, With Collagen and Peptides to Smooth and Improve Elasticity, 15 Individually Wrapped Wipes (Refresh Line - Fresh Citrus)\nReview Date: 2020/11/06\nStore: BUSYCO\nAverage Rating: 3.5\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'BUSYCO', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '4.5 x 7.3 x 3.5 inches; 4.16 Ounces'}\nReview Text: 10 for $12 is... well lets face it... is pricey.  if u r looking to use this like a wet one at a restaurant or after touching money... u R NOT GOING TO BUY THIS PRODUCT.  if u r going to use it as intended... for \"freshening up\" u might purchase these overpriced wipes.  the package talks about eco friendly and being compostable, but really these things just mean more expensive for the consumer.  its like what the lady at Toyota said to me.  there r 2 types of people who the buy Prius.  ones who only want to save money on gas and the ones who dont care how much something costs as long as its for the environment.  thats how this wipe makes me feel.<br />the consistency of the wipe is soft and WAY thicker then a wet one, but size wise... its about the same.  its definitely not big enough to do ur whole body and it certainly isn't wet enough to even try.  u would have to pick and choose the places u would need it most.  it says that its unscented... but apparently unscented has a scent.  my friend and I wiped our hands last night and decided we hated the scent.  I do like the packaging.  its nice and bright and easy to find at the bottom of ur purse.  I think the box it comes in is a waste of money on the company's end.  its a cube that measures about 3.75\" x 3.5\" x 4.25\".  it has 10 yes 10 prepackaged wipes inside.  they could have easily been compressed down to a smaller package, which would in turn made it more eco friendly.  so in conclusion, im a Prius owner who only cares about the price of gasoline, and these r just way to expensive for me to actually purchase... especially during a pandemic where people r loosing their jobs left and right.  I hope this was helpful.\nReview Title: I guess it depends on what u wanna do with it.\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Travel Bottles Keychain, 1.7oz/50ml Portable Hand Sanitizer Bottles, Fine Mist Spray Keychain Bottles, Empty Leakproof Refillable Containers with Flip/Spray Cap Plastic Travel Bottles (5PC)\nXITENBAO\n{'Brand': 'XITENBAO', 'Material': 'Silicone,Plastic', 'Capacity': '50 Milliliters, 1.7 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Special Feature': 'Portable, Mist Spray, Leakproof', 'Package Dimensions': '7 x 7 x 2.5 inches; 3.99 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'klp-001', 'UPC': '192408404112'}\nIn this set u get:<br />5 hard plastic bottles<br />5 carabiners: blue, red, yellow, purple, and green<br />5 pump bottle sprayers<br />5 squeezy bottle tops<br />1 collapsable blue funnel<br /><br />These bottles are designed to hang upside-down using the included carabiner.  They attach easily to any loop, whether it be a purse, belt, or backpack.  I really like the fact that the tops are interchangeable.  Ive never seen that options b4.  I also really like the funnel it comes with.  It doesnt take up much room b/c it collapses into itself for easy storage.  It is a little difficult to fill the bottles, even with the provided funnel.  The bottoms of the bottles are rounded, so u cant place them on the counter to fill them.  It CAN be done with one hand, but it is much easier to do with a 2nd person helping.  I dont like that they are made out of hard plastic.  It doesnt matter if u are just using it as a sprayer, but if u need it to be a squeezable bottle, it is difficult to get every drop out.  When u fill the bottle to use with the mister, u need to pay attention to the included straw inside.  It has to wrap around the area where the carabiner fits in order to get every last drop out of the container.  needless to say, I like this product's versatility, and especially during covid they r a great idea for hand sanitizer.  I hope this was helpful.\nthey remind me of transformers\nTCM Men's Cleansing Activated Charcoal Bar Soap - For all skin types - 5oz (1 Pack)\nTCM\n{'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'TCM', 'Scent': 'Coconut', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Youth', 'Package Dimensions': '3.7 x 2.01 x 1.34 inches; 5.26 Ounces', 'UPC': '851058008179'}\nmy boyfriend LOVES all kinds of bar soap!!!  he gets soooo excited when a new 1 arrives.  he really liked the fact that this 1 was charcoal... he's had many over the years and has really liked them... this 1... not so much.  he said it feels more like a lotion rather than a soap... that being said, it does lather up very well.  he said it is more of a grey then a black and he didnt like the size of the bar.  he said it was awkward in his hand, but it dirtied the floor less than other charcoal soap.  he didnt love this bar.
