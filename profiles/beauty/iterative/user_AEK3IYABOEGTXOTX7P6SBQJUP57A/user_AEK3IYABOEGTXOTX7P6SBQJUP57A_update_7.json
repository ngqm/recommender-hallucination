I had plenty left on my hands to do my neck and behind my ears after I completed my face.  the thing I LOVE most about black wolf products is that they remember that all eyes are not created equal... yes I said eyes... my 42 year old eyes can not see most directions on the bottles that come in.  these guys must know how I feel b/c they ALWAYS type them in a very large font, which is great b/c it saves me from having to call my boyfriend through Alexa to come in and read them to me!!!  I hope this was helpful.\nReview Title: is this a lotion or a face scrub?\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Travel Bottles Keychain, 1.7oz/50ml Portable Hand Sanitizer Bottles, Fine Mist Spray Keychain Bottles, Empty Leakproof Refillable Containers with Flip/Spray Cap Plastic Travel Bottles (5PC)\nXITENBAO\n{'Brand': 'XITENBAO', 'Material': 'Silicone,Plastic', 'Capacity': '50 Milliliters, 1.7 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Special Feature': 'Portable, Mist Spray, Leakproof', 'Package Dimensions': '7 x 7 x 2.5 inches; 3.99 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'klp-001', 'UPC': '192408404112'}\nIn this set u get:<br />5 hard plastic bottles<br />5 carabiners: blue, red, yellow, purple, and green<br />5 pump bottle sprayers<br />5 squeezy bottle tops<br />1 collapsable blue funnel<br /><br />These bottles are designed to hang upside-down using the included carabiner.  They attach easily to any loop, whether it be a purse, belt, or backpack.  I really like the fact that the tops are interchangeable.  Ive never seen that options b4.  I also really like the funnel it comes with.  It doesnt take up much room b/c it collapses into itself for easy storage.  It is a little difficult to fill the bottles, even with the provided funnel.  The bottoms of the bottles are rounded, so u cant place them on the counter to fill them.  It CAN be done with one hand, but it is much easier to do with a 2nd person helping.  I dont like that they are made out of hard plastic.  It doesnt matter if u are just using it as a sprayer, but if u need it to be a squeezable bottle, it is difficult to get every drop out.  When u fill the bottle to use with the mister, u need to pay attention to the included straw inside.  It has to wrap around the area where the carabiner fits in order to get every last drop out of the container.  needless to say, I like this product's versatility, and especially during covid they r a great idea for hand sanitizer.  I hope this was helpful.\nthey remind me of transformers\nTCM Men's Cleansing Activated Charcoal Bar Soap - For all skin types - 5oz (1 Pack)\nTCM\n{'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'TCM', 'Scent': 'Coconut', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Youth', 'Package Dimensions': '3.7 x 2.01 x 1.34 inches; 5.26 Ounces', 'UPC': '851058008179'}\nmy boyfriend LOVES all kinds of bar soap!!!  he gets soooo excited when a new 1 arrives.  he really liked the fact that this 1 was charcoal... he's had many over the years and has really liked them... this 1... not so much.  he said it feels more like a lotion rather than a soap... that being said, it does lather up very well.  he said it is more of a grey then a black and he didnt like the size of the bar.  he said it was awkward in his hand, but it dirtied the floor less than other charcoal soap.  he didnt love this bar.  I hope this was helpful.\nmy boyfriend knows his bar soap\nBusy Co. Biodegradable Hydrating Hand Wipes, With Collagen and Peptides to Smooth and Improve Elasticity, 15 Individually Wrapped Wipes (Refresh Line - Fresh Citrus)\nBUSYCO\n{'Brand': 'BUSYCO', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '4.5 x 7.3 x 3.5 inches; 4.16 Ounces'}\n10 for $12 is... well lets face it... is pricey.  if u r looking to use this like a wet one at a restaurant or after touching money... u R NOT GOING TO BUY THIS PRODUCT.  if u r going to use it as intended... for \"freshening up\" u might purchase these overpriced wipes.  the package talks about eco friendly and being compostable, but really these things just mean more expensive for the consumer.  its like what the lady at Toyota said to me.  there r 2 types of people who the buy Prius.  ones who only want to save money on gas and the ones who dont care how much something costs as long as its for the environment.  thats how this wipe makes me feel.<br />the consistency of the wipe is soft and WAY thicker then a wet one, but size wise... its about the same.  its definitely not big enough to do ur whole body and it certainly isn't wet enough to even try.  u would have to pick and choose the places u would need it most.  it says that its unscented... but apparently unscented has a scent.  my friend and I wiped our hands last night and decided we hated the scent.  I do like the packaging.  its nice and bright and easy to find at the bottom of ur purse.  I think the box it comes in is a waste of money on the company's end.  its a cube that measures about 3.75\" x 3.5\" x 4.25\".  it has 10 yes 10 prepackaged wipes inside.  they could have easily been compressed down to a smaller package, which would in turn made it more eco friendly.  so in conclusion, im a Prius owner who only cares about the price of gasoline, and these r just way to expensive for me to actually purchase... especially during a pandemic where people r loosing their jobs left and right.  I hope this was helpful.\nI guess it depends on what u wanna do with it.\nSegems Organic Handmade Whipped Body Butter with Cocoa Butter\nSegems\n{'Product Dimensions': '4 x 3 x 3 inches; 8.99 Ounces', 'UPC': '860003694657', 'Manufacturer': 'Segems'}\nI liked the package, but that was about it.  this \"whipped\" body butter is more like looking at dried up cookie dough.  the jar had a safety seal that was pretty difficult to remove.  once I finally pried it open, I found a tiny spoon drowning in the gritty mess.  after some effort, I managed to release the spoon from the quick sand and dig out some body butter.  It took a long time for the substance to melt into an oily mess.  I rubbed it on my legs at work around 3pm.  I got home at 9pm and sat on the couch with my boyfriend.  he started to rub my legs like he does every night and said, \"eh what's that?!?!\"  yup... 6 hours later, the \"body butter\" was still a greasy mess.  my sister buys body butter all the time so I asked her about her experiences with it... she said, \"nothing like what u r describing.\"  ok... so after all of this nonsense...im going with a hard NO on this purchase.  it wont be getting used up at my house.  Im glad I didnt order this as a gift for my sister for xmas... I would have been embarrassed... oh and the scent wasnt wonderful either.  I hope this was helpful.\nits not for me\nEASYDEW Starter Moist Whip Foam 5.07 fl oz - Non-Drying, Gentle & Purifying Foaming Cleanser with Ceramide I Exfoliating Daily Face Wash that Removes Dirts and Makeup\nEASYDEW\n{'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Skin Type': 'All, Oily to combination skin, Normal to dry skin, Sensitive to acne-prone skin', 'Brand': 'EASYDEW', 'Scent': 'Light floral', 'Material Feature': 'Cruelty Free', 'Product Dimensions': '2.28 x 1.81 x 7.01 inches; 6.74 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Cosmax'}\nlet me start by saying I removed 1 star b/c I had to go back and check the product I ordered vs what I put on my face last night.  the name and the description on the website is nowhere near what I applied to my face in the shower.  it says its a foam and it shows a girls hand with a bubbly foam gently resting in her palm.  that wasnt my experience.  I entered a wrestling match the minute I stepped into my shower.  the stuff was very difficult to get out of the tube.  it has a hint of a suntan lotion smell, which was very nice.  it comes out in a tight, white string into ur hand... and it goes on and stays on like lotion!!!  where's the foam?  where's the bubbles?  I dont know but they didnt attend the party at my shower last night.  with all that being said about the misleading product name and page, the product works.  my face was very clean and not over dried at all.  it does mention that its an exfoliator, but it is a creamy substance with no sand or beads inside.  again, this product does a great job of cleansing ur skin, but dont be surprised when u dont get any bubbles or foam in ur hand.<br />UPDATE:<br />after using it all week I have noticed that there are a couple of tiny beads floating around in the lotion to make its claim as an exfoliator.  I wouldnt say there r a lot in it, but they r in the product.  I hope this was helpful.\nfoam?  what foam?\nBodyguard Moisturizing Immunity Soap 6pk | 7 Essential Oils Clinically Evaluated to Boost Immunity and Protect | Moisturizes with Sweet Almond Oil | Healthy PH for Skin Microbiome\nSpa-Da\n{'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Brand': 'Spa-Da', 'Scent': 'Cinnamon', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '8 x 3.3 x 2 inches; 7.2 Ounces', 'UPC': '860003618998'}\nive ordered a lot of soap from amazon to try.  my boyfriend LOVES expensive soaps!  usually I fill his stocking with them, but this year I filled it with special salts instead.  I thought he was going to love these small travel sized soap that come 6 in a resealable bag, but they fell short of his expectations.  he hated the scent!  the clove smell was just to overpowering.  each bar fits nicely in ur hand b/c they r teardrop shaped and at 1 st they r a little gritty.  it has a cross stamped in it and it really feels more like a guest hand washing soap or something u would get for free at a hotel.  thats about the thickness of each bar.  its handmade here in the USA (which I love) in Ohio and it does leave ur skin feeling moisturized, even though it doesnt lather much.  we r going to move the rest of the bars of soap to our guest bathroom for hand washing only.  I hope this was helpful.\nnot his favorite\nBlack Wolf - Men\u2019s Gentle Hydrating Face Wash - 5 Fl Oz - Hydrating Sugar Technology Blend Helps Replenish Moisture - Natural Oils Argan, Coconut, & Safflower Hydrate Your Skin, Great for Dry Skin\nBlack Wolf\n{'Item Form': 'Foam', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Brand': 'Black Wolf', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '7.09 x 6.97 x 2.01 inches; 6.07 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'BLKWLF_FACEWASH_DRY', 'UPC': '850021340070'}\nBlack Wolf always does a good job with their products.  they never seem to disappoint.  this product was a little weird when I 1st opened it in the shower.  when I squeezed it into my hand, it left me wondering if it was a lotion or a face wash.  it looks and smells like lotion.  it is on the thicker side and for that reason, a TINY BIT goes a long way.  u dont need to waste ur money by using to much product on ur face.
