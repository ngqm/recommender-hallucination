They attach easily to any loop, whether it be a purse, belt, or backpack.  I really like the fact that the tops are interchangeable.  Ive never seen that options b4.  I also really like the funnel it comes with.  It doesnt take up much room b/c it collapses into itself for easy storage.  It is a little difficult to fill the bottles, even with the provided funnel.  The bottoms of the bottles are rounded, so u cant place them on the counter to fill them.  It CAN be done with one hand, but it is much easier to do with a 2nd person helping.  I dont like that they are made out of hard plastic.  It doesnt matter if u are just using it as a sprayer, but if u need it to be a squeezable bottle, it is difficult to get every drop out.  When u fill the bottle to use with the mister, u need to pay attention to the included straw inside.  It has to wrap around the area where the carabiner fits in order to get every last drop out of the container.  needless to say, I like this product's versatility, and especially during covid they r a great idea for hand sanitizer.  I hope this was helpful.\nReview Title: they remind me of transformers\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
