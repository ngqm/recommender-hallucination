  "reference_summary": "Butecare Eyelash Growth Enhancer & Brow Serum for Long - Amazon Vine\n{'Package Dimensions': '4.5 x 0.9 x 0.9 inches; 0.81 Ounces'}\nThis is my own personal experience with this lash growth enhancer and my own opinion. I did not notice any difference in my lashes since I started using it a month ago. I've documented my experience with pictures every 3 days. I gave it 2 stars and not 1 because I've seen that it's worked for others but I guess it isn't compatible with my biology. I'm  bit disappointed.\nDidn't work for me.\nWater Flosser Cordless Teeth Cleaner, SOOCAS Professional Oral Irrigator 230ML Portable and Rechargeable Water Dental Flosser with 3 Modes and 4 Jet Tips, IPX7 Waterproof, USB Charged for 30 Days Use\nSOOCAS\n{'Brand': 'SOOCAS', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Special Feature': 'Por, Multiple Operation Modes, Multiple Tips', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Tank Volume': '230 Milliliters', 'Package Dimensions': '9.49 x 4.41 x 3.23 inches; 1.08 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'SOOCAS W3', 'Manufacturer': 'SOOCAS'}\nI wasn't expecting my mirror to get a cleaning also! I was excited to finally have a water pick so when I received my package I immediately set it up and studied the directions. Once I was confident, I began and as soon as i turn it on, water went everywhere! It all ricochet ed all oclver my bathroom counter and mirror. Safe to say that you literally need to use this in the shower. But besides that, it has many attachments, different speeds and does a great job!\nMessy but works great!\nWay Of Will Sweet Orange Body Wash, Moisturizing Body Wash with Sweet Orange Essential Oil, Body Wash for Women and Men, Paraben and Sulfate Free, 120 mL\nWay Of Will\n{'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Skin Type': 'Oily,All Skin Types', 'Brand': 'Way Of Will', 'Scent': 'Sweet Orange', 'Material Type Free': 'Paraben,Sulfate Free', 'Product Dimensions': '6 x 1.5 x 1.5 inches; 4 Ounces', 'UPC': '840652000191'}\nThis body wash is excellent.
