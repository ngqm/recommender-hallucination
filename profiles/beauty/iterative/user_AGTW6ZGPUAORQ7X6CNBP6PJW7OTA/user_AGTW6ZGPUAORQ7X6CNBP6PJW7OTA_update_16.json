The saying \"never judge a book by its cover\" does NOT apply in this CASE. PLEASE try out this mascara. My lashes looked significantly longer and thicker with out any flakes or clumps. A very long lasting mascara  for a relatively decent price. Also, considering how long lasting it wore, the removal was insanely easy. I love this mascara!\nReview Title: Impressed!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Butecare Eyelash Growth Enhancer & Brow Serum for Long - Amazon Vine\n{'Package Dimensions': '4.5 x 0.9 x 0.9 inches; 0.81 Ounces'}\nThis is my own personal experience with this lash growth enhancer and my own opinion. I did not notice any difference in my lashes since I started using it a month ago. I've documented my experience with pictures every 3 days. I gave it 2 stars and not 1 because I've seen that it's worked for others but I guess it isn't compatible with my biology. I'm  bit disappointed.\nDidn't work for me.\nWater Flosser Cordless Teeth Cleaner, SOOCAS Professional Oral Irrigator 230ML Portable and Rechargeable Water Dental Flosser with 3 Modes and 4 Jet Tips, IPX7 Waterproof, USB Charged for 30 Days Use\nSOOCAS\n{'Brand': 'SOOCAS', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Special Feature': 'Por, Multiple Operation Modes, Multiple Tips', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Tank Volume': '230 Milliliters', 'Package Dimensions': '9.49 x 4.41 x 3.23 inches; 1.08 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'SOOCAS W3', 'Manufacturer': 'SOOCAS'}\nI wasn't expecting my mirror to get a cleaning also! I was excited to finally have a water pick so when I received my package I immediately set it up and studied the directions. Once I was confident, I began and as soon as i turn it on, water went everywhere! It all ricochet ed all oclver my bathroom counter and mirror. Safe to say that you literally need to use this in the shower. But besides that, it has many attachments, different speeds and does a great job!\nMessy but works great!\nWay Of Will Sweet Orange Body Wash, Moisturizing Body Wash with Sweet Orange Essential Oil, Body Wash for Women and Men, Paraben and Sulfate Free, 120 mL\nWay Of Will\n{'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Skin Type': 'Oily,All Skin Types', 'Brand': 'Way Of Will', 'Scent': 'Sweet Orange', 'Material Type Free': 'Paraben,Sulfate Free', 'Product Dimensions': '6 x 1.5 x 1.5 inches; 4 Ounces', 'UPC': '840652000191'}\nThis body wash is excellent. The scent is delicious, like real orange, the lather is thick with small bubbles, and it noticeably moisturizes your skin. The only drawback is the price. It's currently listed for $10 for 4 ounces, which is basically travel size.\nExcellent Quality Body Wash\nBRING GREEN Super Yulmu Pore Deep Cleansing Foam 200ml - Adlay Seed Powder and Clay Contained Exfoliating Rich Foam Cleanser, Remove Dead Skin Cells & Blackeads, Moisturizing Deep Cleanser\nBRING GREEN\n{'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Brand': 'BRING GREEN', 'Scent': 'Tea Tree', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Number of Items': '1'}\nI really like the consistency of this face wash. It's like wet clay, with a gentle and pleasant scent. It has just the right amount of lather and it spreads very easily over my face. The only drawback is that is will dry your face out. I suppose this can be countered with a basic facial moisturizer.\nDeep Cleaning\nC.O. Bigelow Shampoo, Lavender Peppermint Shampoo Cleanses & Soothes Hair & Scalp, Luxury Shampoo for Men & Women, 10.4 Fl Oz.\nC. O. Bigelow\n{'Brand': 'C. O. Bigelow', 'Item Form': 'Lotion,Liquid,Gel', 'Scent': 'Fresh,Lavender,Peppermint', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material Type Free': 'Paraben Free', 'Package Dimensions': '5.91 x 2.32 x 2.24 inches; 10.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '815691009023'}\nThis shampoo smells great. The scent is very natural, but unfortunately it's not. Rather than using the pricier essential oils of peppermint and lavender, the company uses synthesized fragrance. The lather is decent and washes your hair about as well as any bargain-priced brand from the supermarket shelf. I did notice that it leaves my hair feeling a bit flat. There is no reason for the high price aside from name familiarity, as this brand is used by some hotel chains.\nOverpriced for What You're Getting\nTaya Beauty Inner Core Hair Strong Anti-Breakage Shampoo & Conditioner Duo - Strengthening and Repairing Formula - Free From Sulfates and Parabens - 8 fl oz Bottles\nTAYA I AM.\n['INNER CORE SHAMPOO: Ingredients: Water/Aqua/Eau, Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Acrylates Copolymer, Glycerin, Glycol Distearate, Bambusa Vulgaris Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Panthenol, Dimethicone, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Cetrimonium Chloride, Hydroxypropyl Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Cetyl Alcohol, Bis-Cetearyl Amodimethicone, Polyquaternium-11, Laureth-4, Laureth-23, Decylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Amodimethicone, Cocamide MIPA, Trideceth-12, Kaolin, Polysorbate 20, Fragrance/Parfum, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Coconut Acid, Sodium Methyltaurate, Isopropanolamine, Tocopherol, Salicylic Acid, Cyclotetrasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Amyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Salicylate, Linalool.

Both smell like sweet coconut.<br />The shampoo has a thick and luxurious lather and definitely feels like it adds volume to my hair.<br />The conditioner is thick, but light, a bit like a body butter. It softens my hair and leaves it extremely soft and silky.<br />The only reason I can't give these products five stars is because I think they're a bit overpriced. Yes, they create great results, but so do a lot of comparable brands that are less than half the price.\nA Great Combination\nBeast Blue Ultra Cooling Body Wash, 6 oz -Beast\nTame the Beast\n{'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Brand': 'Tame the Beast', 'Scent': 'Green Tea', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '7 x 3 x 2 inches; 7.2 Ounces', 'UPC': '817662018539'}\nThis is definitely a \"cooling\" body wash. It makes my skin tingle and would be excellent in the summer months when you need to bring your body temperature down. The scent is like menthol-eucalyptus, but a bit sweeter. The lather is very thick and smooth, and it rinses away leaving my skin feeling cool and moisturized. The only reason for the 4-star rating is the price. $15 is a bit much for 6 ounces of product.\nCool and Moisturizing\nGents of London Design Paste Matt Firm Hold Professional Hair Styling Wax (3 oz)\nGENTS OF LONDON\n{'Hair Type': 'All', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Liquid Volume': '3 Fluid Ounces', 'Item Form': 'Wax', 'Brand': 'GENTS OF LONDON'}\nThis is a great product. The hold is strong, the finish is truly matte, and the price is a lot better than comparable clays, waxes and fibers. It has a light, masculine scent.\nGreat Hold and Finish\nTheSalonGuy CLUTCH Matte Styling Clay Firm Hold Matte Finish Pliable Texture 3.5 oz\nTHESALONGUY\n{'Hair Type': 'Dry', 'Liquid Volume': '3.5 Fluid Ounces', 'Item Form': 'Clay', 'Brand': 'THESALONGUY', 'Number of Items': '1', 'UPC': '860344000636'}\nApplying to medium length hair with a light prestyler.<br /><br />Scent: Very spicy. Christmas spices.<br />Texture: Waxy clay. Very thick.<br />Application: Thick and a bit tough to emulsify in the hands. A bit sticky during application.<br />Styling: Pretty responsive, but you have to work quickly.<br />Finish: Very high hold. Fairly low shine, but not matte.\nGreat Hold, but Sticky\nNo Brainer Gentle Facial Cleanser, 6 fl. oz, For Dry & Sensitive Skin, Leaves Skin Feeling Clean, Soft and Hydrated, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein & Amino Acids Restores Skin by Higher Education Skincare\nHigher Education\n{'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Brand': 'Higher Education', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '6.00 Fl Oz', 'Package Dimensions': '7.2 x 2.3 x 2.3 inches; 8.01 Ounces', 'UPC': '811381030056'}\nAside from being a tad overpriced for a daily face wash, this stuff is great. It smells like cucumber - clean and fresh, it has the consistency of aloe vera gel but a bit thicker. The lather is low-foam. It feels great on my skin, and leaves it feeling soft and moisturized. Definitely a high quality product.\nFresh and Moisturizing\nGrinding Away Skin Polishing Scrub, 3 fl. oz., Polishing Scrub Works to Improve Skin's Texture and Tone by Buffing Away Dead Skin Cells by Higher Education Skincare\nHigher Education\n{'Brand': 'Higher Education', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Product Benefits': 'Smoother', 'Material Feature': 'Gluten Free, Cruelty Free', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.59 x 3.58 x 1.61 inches; 3 Ounces', 'UPC': '811381031008'}\nPricey, but it\u2019s a high quality scrub. Great texture and exfoliation.\nA Soft, Moisturized Finish\n6 Pack Spray Bottles,Empty Plastic Clear Small Transparent Travel Bottles Pump Bottle Lotion Dispenser Bottle Set,Refillable Liquid Containers 3oz and 2 oz\nCehomi\n{'Package Dimensions': '8.98 x 6.14 x 1.1 inches; 0.81 Ounces'}\nThese bottles are very good quality. All in perfect working order. They\u2019re a great buy for the price.\nReally Nice\nHigher Education Skincare: Goal Digger - Silky Moisturizing Cucumber Creme; formulated for dry and sensitive skin; cucumber extract; natural extract: melon, kale, cabbage, ginger, turmeric - 1.7 fl oz\nHigher Education\n{'Brand': 'Higher Education', 'Scent': 'Cucumber', 'Item Form': 'Creme', 'Unit Count': '1.7 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2.88 x 2.88 x 2.13 inches; 7.2 Ounces', 'UPC': '811381032050'}\nI really like this moisturizer. The consistency is extremely soft and smooth, and it feels incredible on my skin. It moisturizes wonderfully and feels like it actually fortifies the skin, making it feel thicker and stronger. The scent is very fresh and it absorbs well. I am already noticing (after a few days) a slight lightening of the skin under my eyes, which is exciting. A bit pricey, but definitely high quality.\nHigh Quality Face Moisturizer\nTheSalonGuy Pre Game Extreme Hold Wax Paste 3.5oz\nTHESALONGUY\n{'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Liquid Volume': '3.5 Fluid Ounces', 'Item Form': 'Wax', 'Brand': 'THESALONGUY', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5 x 5 x 3 inches; 3.52 Ounces', 'UPC': '860242002480'}\nThis is a very unique and effective product.<br /><br />Used with a light pre-styler on medium-length hair:<br /><br />Scent: It's a light scent. Warm and slightly spiced. Very pleasant and masculine.<br />Consistency: Extremely creamy. Becomes slightly tacky when emulsifying.<br />Styling: Smooth through the hair at first, with increasing tug the more you style. This is not a problem for me and is part of getting great hold from a product.<br />Finish: Slightly shiny at first, but becomes much more matte as it dries in the hair.<br />Hold: Legitimate all-day hold without becoming too rigid to restyle.<br /><br />This is one of my new favorites. Seriously good in all areas, which is so rare. TheSalonGuy has a real winner with this one.\nExcellent in All Areas\nWinky Lux Pop Sugar Eyeshadow Palette | 9 Colorful Shades in Metallic, Satin, Matte, Glitter & Pressed Glitter finishes\nWinky Lux\n{'Color': 'Ivory, Black', 'Brand': 'Winky Lux', 'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Finish Type': 'Satin', 'Special Feature': 'Travel size, Matte', 'Package Dimensions': '4.33 x 4.29 x 0.59 inches; 0.53 Ounces', 'UPC': '818324022086'}\nThis is a very decent palette for the price. I like the shades offered, and they are of good quality.\nA Good Addition\n4D Silk Fiber Lash Mascara Black, Natural Waterproof Mascara Extra Long Lash,Thick Thickening and Lengthening, No Clumping, No Smudging, Lasting Voluminous Eyelashes Dramatic Extension Mascara\nSIKEMAY\n{'Color': 'Black', 'Special Feature': 'Smudge Proof, Non Clumping', 'Brand': 'SIKEMAY', 'Specialty': 'Waterproof, Hypoallergenic', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '8.9 x 4 x 1.1 inches; 2.57 Ounces', 'UPC': '764690676852', 'Manufacturer': 'SIKEMAY'}\nNever heard of this brand but it was definitely the packaging that caught my attention.
