  "reference_summary": "Butecare Eyelash Growth Enhancer & Brow Serum for Long - Amazon Vine\n{'Package Dimensions': '4.5 x 0.9 x 0.9 inches; 0.81 Ounces'}\nThis is my own personal experience with this lash growth enhancer and my own opinion. I did not notice any difference in my lashes since I started using it a month ago. I've documented my experience with pictures every 3 days. I gave it 2 stars and not 1 because I've seen that it's worked for others but I guess it isn't compatible with my biology. I'm  bit disappointed.\nDidn't work for me.\nWater Flosser Cordless Teeth Cleaner, SOOCAS Professional Oral Irrigator 230ML Portable and Rechargeable Water Dental Flosser with 3 Modes and 4 Jet Tips, IPX7 Waterproof, USB Charged for 30 Days Use\nSOOCAS\n{'Brand': 'SOOCAS', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Special Feature': 'Por, Multiple Operation Modes, Multiple Tips', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Tank Volume': '230 Milliliters', 'Package Dimensions': '9.49 x 4.41 x 3.23 inches; 1.08 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'SOOCAS W3', 'Manufacturer': 'SOOCAS'}\nI wasn't expecting my mirror to get a cleaning also!
