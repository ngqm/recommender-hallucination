The powder does not. Can't get enough powder on the presser to do any good. Doesn't show up well and not enough powder to really transfer or even do 1 brow without repressing the powder multiple times. I use the stencils with another kit. The powder and powder applicator are a joke\nReview Title: Powder didn't work at all\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
