The soft wax pots from my old warmer have a lot of space on the sides even with the removable insert, but it still heats and melted them nicely.  My problem comes with the shape of the warmer.  I scrape the side of the stick that I'm not using on the edge of the pot to conserve my wax and the round shape makes it tip if I do this too hard.  It only comes with the warmer and the removable pot.  To not come with any more than that i feel like $50 is kind of steep.  (At the time of writing this $39.99 which is more reasonable.  The bottom glows red or green letting you know if your wax is up to temp. Its nice and looks nice, but not great for my usage.\nReview Title: Looks great but not practical for me\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
