Cold Brewed Organic Hibiscus with Natural Honey - Softening Hair Mask for Women & Men\nRATED GREEN\n{'Brand': 'RATED GREEN', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Material Feature': 'Organic, Natural', 'Hair Type': 'Fine', 'Product Benefits': 'Moisturizing', 'Product Dimensions': '19.69 x 19.69 x 11.02 inches; 7.8 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'RGNOP2'}\nUsed my regular shampoo, then followed up with this hair mask. Left it on for 5 mins and brushed it through my hair with a comb in the shower. The smell is amazing( if you like bananas, which I do ) After washing I let my hair air dry and my hair is so smooth and soft. I also have a nice shine to my hair. I notice with this product a little goes a long way so one bottle can last a while. Never used a hair mask before and I really like the life it gave my hair back.  I will continue to use this 1-2 times a week.\nAmazing soft smooth hair after use\nUtrue 2PCS Rhinestone Headbands\uff08random color\uff09\nUtrue\n{'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material': 'Plastic', 'Fabric Type': 'plastic', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Brand': 'Utrue', 'Product Dimensions': '2 x 2 x 0.5 inches; 8.36 Ounces', 'UPC': '787365720155'}\nI have to say these are really nice headbands and very well made. The stones sparkle. Now this could just be preference, I don't like how bulky they are and how much they pop up on my head. Thats why I gave them 4 stars. They are comfortable and you can wear all day without getting a headache!\nReally well made.. buttt\nRated Green - Hibiscus Moisturizing Scalp Pack - Tube - 6.76 fl. oz.
