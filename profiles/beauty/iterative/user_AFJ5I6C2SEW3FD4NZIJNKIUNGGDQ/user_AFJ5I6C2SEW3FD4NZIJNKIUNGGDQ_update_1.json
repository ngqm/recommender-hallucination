Cold Brewed Organic Hibiscus with Natural Honey - Softening Hair Mask for Women & Men\nReview Date: 2021/09/25\nStore: RATED GREEN\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'RATED GREEN', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Material Feature': 'Organic, Natural', 'Hair Type': 'Fine', 'Product Benefits': 'Moisturizing', 'Product Dimensions': '19.69 x 19.69 x 11.02 inches; 7.8 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'RGNOP2'}\nReview Text: Used my regular shampoo, then followed up with this hair mask. Left it on for 5 mins and brushed it through my hair with a comb in the shower. The smell is amazing( if you like bananas, which I do ) After washing I let my hair air dry and my hair is so smooth and soft. I also have a nice shine to my hair. I notice with this product a little goes a long way so one bottle can last a while. Never used a hair mask before and I really like the life it gave my hair back.  I will continue to use this 1-2 times a week.\nReview Title: Amazing soft smooth hair after use\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
