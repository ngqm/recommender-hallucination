The mask is well coated with the honey tea tree serum on a mesh-like sheet. I use the extra serum in the package and apply it on my neck and arms. It's soothing and refreshing, and the scent is not to strong. It made my skin feel soft and supple. It didn't irritate my skin at all. Next time, I'll put it in fridge prior to using for a more cooling experience.\nReview Title: Great face mask\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
