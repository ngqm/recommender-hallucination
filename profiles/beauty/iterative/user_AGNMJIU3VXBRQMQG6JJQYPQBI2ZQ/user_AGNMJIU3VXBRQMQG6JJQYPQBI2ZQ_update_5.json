You need at least 5-8 pumps for it to somewhat lather and coat the skin. I use a body glove with this wash by the way. The scent smells okay, however, it does smell like stuff you'd use to clean the bathroom or other household objects. Haven't had an allergic reactions to it. It doesn't really moisturize but doesn't strip the skin and dry it out. Great that it is vegan and plant-derived but there's nothing special about this body wash. I wouldn't recommend it.\nReview Title: Meh, doesn't lather well\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "[miclan] Honey Teatree Relaxing Mask 10pcs - Mediheal Family Brand Facial Sheet Mask Full of Hydrating Soothing Purifying Skin with Teatree and Honey\nmiclan\n{'Brand': 'Miclan', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Product Benefits': 'Soothing,Skin Soothing,Soothes', 'Scent': 'Honey', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Package Dimensions': '7.91 x 4.25 x 1.5 inches; 11.99 Ounces'}\nGreat mask to use after a long day. The mask is well coated with the honey tea tree serum on a mesh-like sheet. I use the extra serum in the package and apply it on my neck and arms. It's soothing and refreshing, and the scent is not to strong. It made my skin feel soft and supple. It didn't irritate my skin at all. Next time, I'll put it in fridge prior to using for a more cooling experience.\nGreat face mask\nSilicone Back Scrubber For Shower,Strong Rub Back Mud Silica Gel Bath Towel, Easy to Clean, All Parts Of The Body To Remove Ash And Mud\nLHIUEM\n{'Material': 'Silicone', 'Brand': 'LHIUEM', 'Operation Mode': 'Manual', 'Package Dimensions': '11.02 x 7.87 x 2.48 inches; 1.21 Pounds', 'UPC': '791523116391'}\nIt does lightly scrub the back a bit. Lathers and spreads the body wash well, however, it is sort of heavy and a pain to use. I\u2019ll still use it but not on a daily basis. I hang it over the shower door because there\u2019s no where to rest it in the tub area\nIt\u2019s okay\nBRING GREEN Artemisia Calming Real Pack 100g - Redness Relief Skin Soothing & Moisturizing Facial Wash off Mask, Mild Salicylic Acid Natural Ingredients Skin Care, for Senstive & Damaged Skin\nBRING GREEN\n{'Brand': 'BRING GREEN', 'Scent': 'Rose', 'Skin Type': 'acne prone', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '3.4 x 2.9 x 2.9 inches; 8.78 Ounces'}\nI like the cooling effect it gave when I applied it to my skin. It comes with a big spatula that you use to apply and remove the gel. I use this 1-2x week to give my irritated skin a break. Had to refer back to their amazon product page to get the directions on how to use and for how long. I apply a good amount to my face and leave it on for 20 minutes. The gel smells very herbal and has tiny bits of artemisia leaf in it.  The mask did help reduce the redness on my cheeks and nose. It left my skin feeling moisturized and refreshed. Definitely recommend for people with irritated and oily skin or after a long week of wearing a tight N95 mask.\nVery cooling\nGlow Line Individual Hand Wipes - Hand Wipes Travel Size, Lavender Rose Travel Hand Wipes - Moist Towelettes Individually Wrapped, Wet Wipes Individually Wrapped w/Murumuru Seed & Peptides - 15 ct\nBUSYCO\n{'Brand': 'BUSYCO', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Unit Count': '15.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '4.5 x 7.3 x 3.5 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nThese wipes are okay to use when your hands are feeling soiled. They're saturated and well stay pretty wet for a few minutes or so.  Unscented and doesn't leave my hands dry or sticky. The size of the wipe is a little smaller compared to other hand wipes. The wipes do have phenoxyethanol, which can contain trace amounts of 1, -dioxane (carcinogen) but apparently it's safe at low levels (FYI). It's stated on the box that they try to be zero waste, but honestly... not really. They come individually packaged in a plastic bag and in a box, which are both not biodegradable. It would've been better if the wipes came all together in one packet instead of individual packs. It would've reduced some waste. The wipes are expensive at $.90 each. Not worth it in my opinion.\nBiodegradable wipes but not the packaging\nHylunia Hydrate Body Wash - Energizing Blend With Mango 8.5 oz\nHylunia\n{'Product Dimensions': '2 x 2 x 5 inches; 11.22 Ounces', 'Item model number': '059ENM-250-R', 'UPC': '185449000313'}\nThis body wash isn't the best.
