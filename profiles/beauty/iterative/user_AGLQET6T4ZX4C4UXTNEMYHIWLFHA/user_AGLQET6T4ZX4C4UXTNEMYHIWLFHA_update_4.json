  "reference_summary": "Replacement Toothbrush Heads Compatible For Oral-B Braun Electric Toothbrush ,Sensitive brush heads Extra soft bristles. 8 Count\nYuanJian\n{'Brand': 'YuanJian', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Kid', 'Item Firmness Description': 'Extra Soft', 'Number of Pieces': '8', 'Item Form': 'ROUND', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '0.43 x 0.39 x 2.76 inches; 0.81 Ounces', 'UPC': '633337444805'}\nI have used several Oral-B model toothbrushes over the years and have tried many different brush heads.  I always come back to the standard size like this one.  It just fits my mouth and gums better than the larger ones.  These generic replacement heads works just fine.  There are subtle differences.  The extra soft is more like a soft.  Not near as firm as some replacements heads I've tried though.  That's good.  I think they slide onto the motor easier than the originals.  I really can't see any reason to pay more for the original brush heads.  These are a good value.\nGood replacement brush for a lot less money.\nManicure and Pedicure Nail Clipper from POWERGROOMING - Powerful Trimmer for Thick and Thin Finger Nails and Toe Nails - Included Nail File and\"Catcher\" for Easy Cleanup (1 Pack)\nPOWERGROOMING\n{'Brand': 'POWERGROOMING', 'Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Blade Edge': 'Straight', 'Blade Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Target Audience': 'Women, Men', 'Package Dimensions': '3.8 x 1.3 x 1 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'UPC': '653233212735', 'Manufacturer': 'POWERGROOMING'}\nThis is a nice little clipper set with nail and case.  The trimmer is sharp and has a nice, secure feel to it.  The metal nail file is hand and effective.  The slim case neatly holds everything in place.  I deducted a star because I didn't find the nail catcher all that useful.  It adds bulk and doesn't always work.  The catcher is easy to remove so I mostly leave it off.\nClippers cut just fine but nail catcher is iffy.\nEye Mask Natural Mulberry 100% Silk Super Smooth Sleep Eye Mask for Eye Mask for Puffy Eyes for Dry Eyes for Dark Circles Sleeping Travel While Camping Multi Purpose Men and Women Eye Mask\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.3 x 1.6 x 0.4 inches; 0.81 Ounces'}\nI have been using eye masks for years.  This is the largest one I have ever tried.  It does a good job locking light, and it is soft and comfortable.  Since it is not as contoured as some I've used,  it does let some light in through the bottom.  Like most masks, the elastic strap can slip or become uncomfortable.  I gave it 4 stars because it is better than the cheaper ones I've used.\nReally large eye mask.\n2019 Newest Nose Hair Trimmer for Men Women MASWATER Professional Electric Nose Ear Hair Trimmer Clipper Painless Wet/Dry Trimming Premium Quality Stainless Steel Dual-Edge Blades Won't Break!\nmaswater\n{'Brand': 'Maswater', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Nose,Facial Hair,Beards,Grooming,Trimmer,Professional', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Included Components': 'Clipper, Battery', 'Color': 'Silver', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1 x 1 x 5 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Batteries': '1 AA batteries required.', 'UPC': '699949549697', 'Manufacturer': 'MASWATER'}\nI have had a few of this type trimmer over the years but this one seems to be more powerful.
