You are supposed to rinse off the scrub after rubbing it in, but it tasted so good that I found myself licking the peachy sugar off.  The directions are very simple, just put a bit of scrub on your lips and rub them in for about 30 seconds, then rinse off.  My lips are visibly smoother after using this product.  The jar is small, but a little goes a long way so I'll be making this last.\nReview Title: Smells great, tastes great\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
