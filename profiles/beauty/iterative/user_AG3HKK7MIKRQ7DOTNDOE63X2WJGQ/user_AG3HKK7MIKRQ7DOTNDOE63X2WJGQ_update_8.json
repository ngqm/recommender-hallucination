It smells heavenly.  The scent is a mood lifter as described.  The body wash leaves my skin soft and smooth.<br /><br />The bottle is surprisingly small, but a little goes a long way.\nOrange scent is heavenly\nSplendora Sugar Lip Scrub - Peach - (20g / 0.7oz.)\nSplendora\n{'Brand': 'Splendora', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Product Benefits': 'Exfoliating', 'Material Feature': 'Certified Organic', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '1.73 x 1.73 x 1.34 inches; 0.7 Ounces', 'UPC': '736640550444'}\n(Reviewed by my wife): This lip scrub smells great and tastes great.  You are supposed to rinse off the scrub after rubbing it in, but it tasted so good that I found myself licking the peachy sugar off.  The directions are very simple, just put a bit of scrub on your lips and rub them in for about 30 seconds, then rinse off.  My lips are visibly smoother after using this product.  The jar is small, but a little goes a long way so I'll be making this last.\nSmells great, tastes great\nLip MOISTURIZER by MERLOTSPF15 - Intense Therapy Lip Moisturizer - Grape Seed Infused - for Healing Dry, Chapped Lips.

The bottles have an interesting opening mechanism.  You turn the top and squeeze the product out through a mesh hole on the top.  Unfortunately, the top on our shampoo bottle is defective and none of us can get it open.  The conditioner is very nice though.  It is thick and smooth and detangles well.  It also smells nice.\nShampoo bottle won't open\nPharmacopia Tangerine-Flavored Lip Balm - Set of 2, 0.25oz - Nourishing Herbal Lip Elixir with 100% Natural and Certified Organic Ingredients\nPharmacopia\n{'Brand': 'Pharmacopia', 'Item Form': 'Balm', 'Finish Type': 'Natural', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Soothing,Nourishing', 'Package Dimensions': '3.6 x 1.7 x 0.7 inches; 0.25 Ounces', 'UPC': '087819800366'}\nThis product is way better than traditional Chapstick.
