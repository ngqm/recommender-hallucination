It makes applying the product very easy and helps avoid wasting product.  The eye treatment smells great and goes on smooth.  It moisturizes well and leaves a little shine, reducing the appearance of dark circles and lines.  It is not a miracle product, however, and it does not get rid of really dark circles like the ones I have around my eyes.\nReview Title: Love the roller applicator\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Body Scrubs for Women Premium Organic Nimiah Exfoliating Body Scrub with Activated Bamboo Charcoal Natural Salt Exfoliator Scrubs for Body Foot Hand Skin Care\nNimiah\n{'Brand': 'Nimiah', 'Skin Type': 'Acne Prone', 'Product Benefits': 'Exfoliating', 'Material Feature': 'Certified Organic', 'Use for': 'Hands, Whole Body', 'Package Dimensions': '2.7 x 2.7 x 2.1 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'UPC': '192242919810'}\nPros:<br /><br />*The scrub is really good at exfoliating skin;<br />*After a week of daily use of this scrub, my skin is noticeably softer and brighter;<br />*It is kind of fun to use because it feels/looks like you are rubbing dirt all over your body;<br />*The jar is small but a little goes a long way.<br /><br />Cons:<br />*The charcoal scrub is a bit messy if you are not careful.  I have to quickly rinse my shower after each use because the stuff has flicked everywhere.\nGreat scrub\nWay Of Will Sweet Orange Body Wash, Moisturizing Body Wash with Sweet Orange Essential Oil, Body Wash for Women and Men, Paraben and Sulfate Free, 120 mL\nWay Of Will\n{'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Skin Type': 'Oily,All Skin Types', 'Brand': 'Way Of Will', 'Scent': 'Sweet Orange', 'Material Type Free': 'Paraben,Sulfate Free', 'Product Dimensions': '6 x 1.5 x 1.5 inches; 4 Ounces', 'UPC': '840652000191'}\n(Reviewed by my wife): I did not expect to like this sweet orange essential oil body wash (It's orange!).  It smells heavenly.  The scent is a mood lifter as described.  The body wash leaves my skin soft and smooth.<br /><br />The bottle is surprisingly small, but a little goes a long way.\nOrange scent is heavenly\nSplendora Sugar Lip Scrub - Peach - (20g / 0.7oz.)\nSplendora\n{'Brand': 'Splendora', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Product Benefits': 'Exfoliating', 'Material Feature': 'Certified Organic', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '1.73 x 1.73 x 1.34 inches; 0.7 Ounces', 'UPC': '736640550444'}\n(Reviewed by my wife): This lip scrub smells great and tastes great.  You are supposed to rinse off the scrub after rubbing it in, but it tasted so good that I found myself licking the peachy sugar off.  The directions are very simple, just put a bit of scrub on your lips and rub them in for about 30 seconds, then rinse off.  My lips are visibly smoother after using this product.  The jar is small, but a little goes a long way so I'll be making this last.\nSmells great, tastes great\nLip MOISTURIZER by MERLOTSPF15 - Intense Therapy Lip Moisturizer - Grape Seed Infused - for Healing Dry, Chapped Lips.

The bottles have an interesting opening mechanism.  You turn the top and squeeze the product out through a mesh hole on the top.  Unfortunately, the top on our shampoo bottle is defective and none of us can get it open.  The conditioner is very nice though.  It is thick and smooth and detangles well.  It also smells nice.\nShampoo bottle won't open\nPharmacopia Tangerine-Flavored Lip Balm - Set of 2, 0.25oz - Nourishing Herbal Lip Elixir with 100% Natural and Certified Organic Ingredients\nPharmacopia\n{'Brand': 'Pharmacopia', 'Item Form': 'Balm', 'Finish Type': 'Natural', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Soothing,Nourishing', 'Package Dimensions': '3.6 x 1.7 x 0.7 inches; 0.25 Ounces', 'UPC': '087819800366'}\nThis product is way better than traditional Chapstick. It is very moisturizing and non-waxy.  It leaves my lips soft and smooth.  The dry lip relief lasts longer than Chapstick.  The tangerine scent is heavenly.\nWay better than Chapstick\nC.O.

The scent is not overpowering like some peppermint shampoos I've tried;<br />*It lathers really well.<br />*It leaves my hair feeling and looking shiny and clean.<br /><br />What I don't like about the product:<br />*The bottle is relatively small for the price ($18.00 for 10.14 ounces at the time of this review);<br />*The cap broke off after the first use.\nSmells great and lathers well\n13.5 fl.

It does not foam/lather at all.  Instead, it is so thick it has the consistency of lotion.  It is gentle but cleans effectively.  It leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.\nThick and gentle\nWorkman's Friend Ultimate Hand Care Bundle\nWORKMAN'S FRIEND\n{'Package Dimensions': '9 x 4.5 x 2.3 inches; 1.3 Pounds', 'UPC': '023857030709'}\nThis is a great, complete hand hair set for anyone with dry, cracked hands.  It would make a good gift.<br /><br />*The charcoal scrub is very gritty so it's good for getting dirt out of the cracks on your hands.<br />*The barrier cream is helpful for prevention of dry hands (stop it before it even starts).<br />*Both the barrier cream and the hand cream have the nice side effect of reducing the appearance of wrinkles/aging on your hands.<br />*The products are gentle and excellent quality.<br />*A little goes a long way.\nAwesome products\nIryasa Under Eye Oil - Dark Circles Under Eye Treatment - Natural Anti Aging Serum for Under Eye Bags Treatment, Puffy Eyes Treatment, Eye Lifting and Firming - Eye Serum for Men & Women - 0.27 fl oz\nIRYASA\n{'Skin Type': 'All', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Eye Treatment,Anti-aging', 'Use for': 'Eyes', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'IRYASA', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '0.79 x 0.79 x 3.43 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\n(Reviewed by my wife): I love the roller applicator of this under eye treatment.
