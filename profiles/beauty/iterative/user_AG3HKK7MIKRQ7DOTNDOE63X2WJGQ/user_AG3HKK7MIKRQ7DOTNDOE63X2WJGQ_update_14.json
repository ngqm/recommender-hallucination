I'm not sure how much the primer really helps because I also like the mascara on its own.  The mascara is long lasting and doesn't flake off.  I am a fan of pink so of course I like the pink wand.\nReview Title: Doesn't smear/smudge\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I have to quickly rinse my shower after each use because the stuff has flicked everywhere.\nGreat scrub\nWay Of Will Sweet Orange Body Wash, Moisturizing Body Wash with Sweet Orange Essential Oil, Body Wash for Women and Men, Paraben and Sulfate Free, 120 mL\nWay Of Will\n{'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Skin Type': 'Oily,All Skin Types', 'Brand': 'Way Of Will', 'Scent': 'Sweet Orange', 'Material Type Free': 'Paraben,Sulfate Free', 'Product Dimensions': '6 x 1.5 x 1.5 inches; 4 Ounces', 'UPC': '840652000191'}\n(Reviewed by my wife): I did not expect to like this sweet orange essential oil body wash (It's orange!).  It smells heavenly.  The scent is a mood lifter as described.  The body wash leaves my skin soft and smooth.<br /><br />The bottle is surprisingly small, but a little goes a long way.\nOrange scent is heavenly\nSplendora Sugar Lip Scrub - Peach - (20g / 0.7oz.)\nSplendora\n{'Brand': 'Splendora', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Product Benefits': 'Exfoliating', 'Material Feature': 'Certified Organic', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '1.73 x 1.73 x 1.34 inches; 0.7 Ounces', 'UPC': '736640550444'}\n(Reviewed by my wife): This lip scrub smells great and tastes great.  You are supposed to rinse off the scrub after rubbing it in, but it tasted so good that I found myself licking the peachy sugar off.  The directions are very simple, just put a bit of scrub on your lips and rub them in for about 30 seconds, then rinse off.  My lips are visibly smoother after using this product.  The jar is small, but a little goes a long way so I'll be making this last.\nSmells great, tastes great\nLip MOISTURIZER by MERLOTSPF15 - Intense Therapy Lip Moisturizer - Grape Seed Infused - for Healing Dry, Chapped Lips.

The bottles have an interesting opening mechanism.  You turn the top and squeeze the product out through a mesh hole on the top.  Unfortunately, the top on our shampoo bottle is defective and none of us can get it open.  The conditioner is very nice though.  It is thick and smooth and detangles well.  It also smells nice.\nShampoo bottle won't open\nPharmacopia Tangerine-Flavored Lip Balm - Set of 2, 0.25oz - Nourishing Herbal Lip Elixir with 100% Natural and Certified Organic Ingredients\nPharmacopia\n{'Brand': 'Pharmacopia', 'Item Form': 'Balm', 'Finish Type': 'Natural', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Soothing,Nourishing', 'Package Dimensions': '3.6 x 1.7 x 0.7 inches; 0.25 Ounces', 'UPC': '087819800366'}\nThis product is way better than traditional Chapstick.

It would make a good gift.<br /><br />*The charcoal scrub is very gritty so it's good for getting dirt out of the cracks on your hands.<br />*The barrier cream is helpful for prevention of dry hands (stop it before it even starts).<br />*Both the barrier cream and the hand cream have the nice side effect of reducing the appearance of wrinkles/aging on your hands.<br />*The products are gentle and excellent quality.<br />*A little goes a long way.\nAwesome products\nIryasa Under Eye Oil - Dark Circles Under Eye Treatment - Natural Anti Aging Serum for Under Eye Bags Treatment, Puffy Eyes Treatment, Eye Lifting and Firming - Eye Serum for Men & Women - 0.27 fl oz\nIRYASA\n{'Skin Type': 'All', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Eye Treatment,Anti-aging', 'Use for': 'Eyes', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'IRYASA', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '0.79 x 0.79 x 3.43 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\n(Reviewed by my wife): I love the roller applicator of this under eye treatment.  It makes applying the product very easy and helps avoid wasting product.  The eye treatment smells great and goes on smooth.  It moisturizes well and leaves a little shine, reducing the appearance of dark circles and lines.  It is not a miracle product, however, and it does not get rid of really dark circles like the ones I have around my eyes.\nLove the roller applicator\nQIC 4D Silk Fiber Lash Mascara, Fiber Mascara, Waterproof Mascara, Natural Thick Thickening and Lengthening Mascara Lasting All Day\nJoruby\n{'Brand': 'Joruby', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Water Resistance Level': 'Waterproof', 'Package Dimensions': '5.3 x 0.8 x 0.8 inches; 0.81 Ounces'}\n(Reviewed by my wife): I was very disappointed in this mascara.

Tape shut.  Leave on for 60-90 minutes then wash off.<br />*The box says that it should take 1-2 days for peeling to start but my personal experience was that it took 3-4 days for the peeling to start.<br />*At $11.99 for two pairs (you can use the product up to once a month) it's a good deal.<br />*The adhesive did not stick well for me so I put my own socks over the booties and they stayed on fine.<br />*Once the peeling is done my feet are significantly softer and smoother.\nWorks well\nLenghthening Mascara by Almay,Volume & Lift, Eye Makeup, Hypoallergenic and Fragrance Free, 010 Blackest Black, 0.24 Fl Oz\nAlmay\n['Enjoy visibly longer, lifted lashes in one gentle swipe with Almay Length & Lift Mascara\u2122.
