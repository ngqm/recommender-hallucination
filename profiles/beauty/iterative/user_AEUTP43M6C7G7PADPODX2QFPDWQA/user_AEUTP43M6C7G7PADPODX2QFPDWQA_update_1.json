It's a weaker concentration of retinol but with that trade, you get a less harsh serum that still keeps your skin hydrated and has a lesser chance of causing irritation. You can most likely use this as a serum/cream combo. Likely a big bonus for those with sensitive skin.<br /><br />I've taken a break from my usual Tretinoin cream due to the extreme sun in my area but I do still need to keep up with chemical exfoliants and retinol has the added bonus of fighting acne like Tret does. My skin is definitely smoothing out again and looks more even, but it's a very very subtle improvement so I'm not sure if those that have significant texture issues or need a lot of brightening or fading will be pleased with this as it most likely would take a while to see visible results.<br /><br />It's not a bad product but with such a low retinol percentage it is quite expensive compared to other retinol serums/creams on the market and also comes in a small bottle. I do like it but I don't think it's something I'd purchase myself if only because of that.\nReview Title: Good for a gentle exfoliation or those with already good skin.\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
