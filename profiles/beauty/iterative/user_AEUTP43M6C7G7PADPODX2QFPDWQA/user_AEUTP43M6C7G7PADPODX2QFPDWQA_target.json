Saltair has been great for that and the body wash especially is so lovely. Black Tide smells rich, sexy, and very warm. To me it's not at all \"masculine\" but it's definitely not a flowery, sweet fragrance (which I hate anyway). Makes bath time feel extra luxurious! Larger is great with my nylon bath cloth, and my skin feels soft and supple after to the point that I could probably skip body lotion if I was in a real time crunch.<br /><br />The aluminum bottles are wonderful too. Sturdy and I get to feel better about disposal when the product is used up and have my shower situation look nice as well.\nReview Title: Smells and feels great\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "MBA Renewing Retinol Serum, 1.7 fl. oz, 0.5% Retinol Hydrates & Brightens Skin's Appearance by Diminishing the Look of Breakouts, Hyperpigmentation, and Signs of Aging by Higher Education Skincare\nHigher Education\n{'Skin Type': 'All', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'Higher Education', 'Item Form': 'Serum', 'Unit Count': '1.7 Fl Oz', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.5 x 3.4 x 1.5 inches; 3.99 Ounces', 'UPC': '811381034009'}\nIf you need a mild chemical exfoliant and want to cut out products from your routine, this might be the serum for you. It's a weaker concentration of retinol but with that trade, you get a less harsh serum that still keeps your skin hydrated and has a lesser chance of causing irritation. You can most likely use this as a serum/cream combo. Likely a big bonus for those with sensitive skin.<br /><br />I've taken a break from my usual Tretinoin cream due to the extreme sun in my area but I do still need to keep up with chemical exfoliants and retinol has the added bonus of fighting acne like Tret does. My skin is definitely smoothing out again and looks more even, but it's a very very subtle improvement so I'm not sure if those that have significant texture issues or need a lot of brightening or fading will be pleased with this as it most likely would take a while to see visible results.<br /><br />It's not a bad product but with such a low retinol percentage it is quite expensive compared to other retinol serums/creams on the market and also comes in a small bottle. I do like it but I don't think it's something I'd purchase myself if only because of that.\nGood for a gentle exfoliation or those with already good skin.\nMainBasics Headband with Buttons for Face Masks (Gray)\nMainBasics\n{'Number of Items': '1', 'Brand': 'MainBasics', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '9.5 x 3.5 x 0.3 inches; 0.81 Ounces', 'UPC': '790887351233'}\nThis is a great little headband for securing your facemask if you've either worn a rash on your ears due to bands or just need it a little tighter on your face for a better seal. The little buttons are very secure on the headband and to me don't seem in danger of popping off. The cloth is very soft and firm on the head so it stays in place pretty well through the day and isn't super thick so those in hotter climates won't be sweating through terribly and soaking the band.<br /><br />I'm giving this 5 stars because it DOES do what it's supposed to (stays on the head, secures bands around the buttons, etc) and feels good and soft but sadly my head/face is just too petite for this to work with a mask so I'm having to stick with my children's sized masks or the ones that go around the back of my head to ensure I don't have gapping around my cheeks or chin. The headband does it's job, masks are just too big/wide for me to actually have them work together.<br /><br />So it IS a very good product, it's just not enough to solve my personal issue and that's not a fault of the headband so it would be unfair to rate it poorly because of that. In all likelihood for the vast majority of people, this will work perfectly<br /><br />However, I still use it as a plain headband! I like that it's so firmly in place that I can use it to hold my hair back when I wash my face and do my skincare routine and works great when I'm excercising and don't want a mess of curls flying into my sweaty face. So it's still serving a great purpose for me even if I can't use it with masks!\nWorks, lightweight, and comfortable - my face is just too small for use with masks\nSpa Headband \u2013Cute Headband for Washing Face Facial Makeup Skincare Yoga Sports Headbands Soft Coral Fleece Hair Band for Shower Washing Face (4 pcs)\nTereshar\n{'Material': 'Microfiber', 'Fabric Type': 'fleece', 'Number of Items': '4', 'Brand': 'Tereshar', 'Item Form': 'wrap', 'Package Dimensions': '10.31 x 7.28 x 2.09 inches; 5.29 Ounces'}\nVery snug, definitely good for smaller faces like me but might be too tight on those with bigger heads. They're very soft and make daily and nightly skincare just a bit more fun.\nCute designs, soft material\nDetangling Brush for Curly Hair,Natural Hair Brush for Hair Textured 3A to 4C Kinky Wavy/Curly/Coily/Wet/Dry/Oil/Thick/Long Hair, Exfoliating for Beautiful and Shiny Curls\nBeeGift\n{'Brand': 'BeeGift', 'Shape': 'Oblong', 'Handle Material': 'Rubber', 'Special Feature': 'Detangling', 'Product Benefits': 'Detangle', 'Package Dimensions': '5 x 3 x 0.35 inches; 1.6 Ounces', 'UPC': '742089431473'}\nThis is a fabulous brush for textured hair. I have 2c/3a hair and I love that this will gently detangle my hair even when it's dry without totally disrupting my curl pattern. It just glides through your hair.\nSo good for curls!\nMicrofiber Hair Towel Two Layers Turban Wrap YANJIE Super Absorbent Shower Head Towel Hair Caps with 2 Buttons,Quick Dryer Hat,Bathing Wrapped Cap for Women Girls Mom Daughter(Blue&Purple)\nYanJie\n{'Package Dimensions': '12.2 x 7.4 x 3.11 inches; 10.58 Ounces'}\nFirstly, I don't use these as a wrap on my head but rather to blot my hair after a shower. They work wonderfully though. I have short curly hair and the absorbancy is A+, it soaks up so much water without making my hair frizzy while still leaving enough moisture post-shower for me to easily work product through my hair.\nGreat on my short hair\nAtlas Semi Matte Texture Putty | Medium Shine | Medium Hold | Thickening | Texturizing | Defining | Styling and Grooming Product for Men and Women | For All Hair Types\nAtlas\n{'Hair Type': 'Coarse, Wavy, Curly', 'Scent': 'Masculine', 'Liquid Volume': '70 Milliliters', 'Item Form': 'Clay', 'Brand': 'Atlas', 'Product Dimensions': '2.95 x 2.95 x 1.18 inches; 2.57 Ounces', 'UPC': '854659007237'}\nAtlas makes really good pomades/clay/etc and this is maybe my 2nd favorite. It's very matte, but more of a natural matte and has moderate-high hold. It adds texture and re-styling ability to my hair without making it look greasy and unwashed.<br /><br />My only complaint is that's it's pretty easy to use too much.  I use just a little (not even a pea size) and it's great, but if you use just a tiny bit more then lord have mercy my hair feels like a helmet on my head.\nGreat control, easy to overdo it though\nSaltair Body Wash (Black Tide)\nSaltair\n{'Skin Type': 'All, Normal', 'Brand': 'Saltair', 'Material Feature': 'Gluten Free, Cruelty, Plant Based', 'Material Type Free': 'Aluminum,Cruelty Free,Gluten,Paraben Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '8.78 x 3.39 x 3.31 inches; 1.48 Pounds', 'UPC': '810083680187'}\nI'm a skincare junkie and it irks me how hard it is to find genuinely good body products. Saltair has been great for that and the body wash especially is so lovely. Black Tide smells rich, sexy, and very warm. To me it's not at all \"masculine\" but it's definitely not a flowery, sweet fragrance (which I hate anyway). Makes bath time feel extra luxurious!
