Plenty of face masks, plenty of eye masks and it even comes with a cute lip collagen mask. The face scrubber is soft and I love freezing the eye mask and wearing it in the tub. You can wear it warm or cold. The whole kit would be great for a birthday gift or wedding shower gift since it is neatly packaged.\nReview Title: Spa Day!!!\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Bath Bombs, SAZEN Bath Bomb with Natural & Organic Essential Oils, Shea Coconut Butter for Skin Moisturize, Bubble Spa Bath, Birthday Mothers Day Christmas Handmade Gift Set for Women Kids Her Him\nSAZEN\n{'Brand': 'SAZEN', 'Scent': 'Coconut', 'Material Feature': 'Organic Ingredients', 'Unit Count': '24.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '24', 'Package Dimensions': '12.17 x 6.26 x 2.24 inches; 2.65 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'SAZEN 01', 'UPC': '745103723622', 'Manufacturer': 'SAZEN'}\n[[VIDEOID:73b249dcdf678ad402a99764551a434d]] When you open the box, you see 18 magical pieces and think this is excellent. Unfortunately, they are super perfume scented, but the perfume goes away in just a moment of two in the bath. I used 2 in one bath and was disappointed that the scent didn't linger for much longer than it did. Especially since the description specifies that it would be great for sinuses! These are more for children who don't enjoy the spa setting as much and just want colorful tubs.\nNot Much Scent...\nQiray Hair Ties For Women Coil Hair Ties,Large Lace Phnom Penh,5 Colors 10 Pieces.\nQiray\n{'Material': 'Rubber', 'Item Form': 'elastic', 'Brand': 'Qiray', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '3.15 x 3.15 x 2.36 inches', 'Number of Pieces': '10', 'Product Dimensions': '3.15 x 3.15 x 2.36 inches; 2.82 Ounces', 'UPC': '655160582486'}\nThe concept behind these hair ties  are great but they are itchy if you wear them on your wrist. As far as stretch goes though they do well for a couple of wears. I found them to be a lot looser after a week. Cute but not the best.\nA Little Itchy\nMaya Mari Hydrating Argan Oil Shampoo \u2013 Rich in Nutrients, Restores Moisture & Shine, 32 oz\nMAYA MARI\n{'Brand': 'MAYA MARI', 'Hair Type': 'Damaged,Curly Hair', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material Type Free': 'Paraben Free', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating', 'Product Dimensions': '3.25 x 3.25 x 10 inches; 1.94 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'MMAROILSP', 'UPC': '850004068267'}\nI'm slightly indifferent to this shampoo. We use argan oil shampoo often but this one is hit or miss. It makes my hair more greasy than shiny while it works great for my husbands. It does lather pretty well and the bottle is large, but it just didn't cut it for mine. I have thick hair and what we thought was the extra shine left a layer of grease on my brush the next day. Not typical for my hair and my wash schedule.\nShine or Grease?\nFacial Kit For Women - Includes Facial Mask, Facial Makeup Wipes, Nose Strips, Facial Cleansers, Facial- Self Care Package For Women (Multivitamin Facial Kit)\nGolden Gift Box\n{'Brand': 'Golden Gift Box', 'Item Form': 'Wipes', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Product Dimensions': '9 x 9 x 3 inches; 2.47 Pounds', 'UPC': '758176585684'}\n[[VIDEOID:f054bc1ef56dd4b625a57cf8672d7c56]] This has EVERYTHING I need to clean up in the evening or have a spa day at home.
