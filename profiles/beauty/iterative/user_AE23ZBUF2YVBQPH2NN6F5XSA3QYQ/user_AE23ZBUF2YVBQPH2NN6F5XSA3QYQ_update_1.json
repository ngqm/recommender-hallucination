Unfortunately, they are super perfume scented, but the perfume goes away in just a moment of two in the bath. I used 2 in one bath and was disappointed that the scent didn't linger for much longer than it did. Especially since the description specifies that it would be great for sinuses! These are more for children who don't enjoy the spa setting as much and just want colorful tubs.\nReview Title: Not Much Scent...\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
