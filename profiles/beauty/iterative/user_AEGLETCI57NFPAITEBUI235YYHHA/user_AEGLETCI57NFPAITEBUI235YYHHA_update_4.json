This serum has calmed my redness by miles, my blemishes don't last a long, and this stuff absorbs lightning fast. It feels so smooth, soft (like velvet), and the texture is thin and easy to work with. There is no smell and a little goes a long way. I definitely plan to keep this serum as a repeat staple in my routine.\nReview Title: Very nice\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

And I am not sure my skin even likes this product because the past few times I have applied it, I would get one or two breakouts. It could be related to something else but the longer I go without this product, the few the problems I have. I prefer the skindinavia lines but don't take my word for it, this product could work for you!\nI loved how this made my makeup look but I don't ...\nSec Clinical Stress Respn Size 1.6z Secret Clinical Stress Response 1.6z\nSecret\n{'Brand': 'Secret', 'Number of Items': '4', 'Unit Count': '4.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '5.4 x 2.8 x 1.5 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nI have been using this for so long and I like it but I do not know if I will continue to repurchase because I think my body has stopped responding to it. If I was in a pinch and needed something asap, I would go back to this because I know it but currently I am trying other things to see if they compare.\n... have been using this for so long and I like it but I do not know if I will ...\nGarnier Fructis Volume Extend Instant Bodifier Dry Shampoo 3.40 oz (Pack of 2)\nGarnier\n{'Brand': 'Garnier', 'Hair Type': 'Dry', 'Item Form': 'Spray', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Item Weight': '0.01 Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '8.2 x 2.7 x 1.8 inches; 0.01 Ounces', 'UPC': '603084294954'}\nI like this dry shampoo because it feels so light in my hair, it doesn\u2019t feel sticky or tough. I do not feel it gives my hair volume but it does well in cancelling excess oils and smelling good. I would repurchase but I would have preferred more volume (hence my four stars).\nGood, not perfect for me.\nDr. Denese Cannabis Sativa Super Serum with Soothing Calming Organic Cold-Pressed Hemp Oil, Ginger, Bisabolol, Ceramides - Reduce Look of Wrinkles, Moisturize & Improved Tightness - Cruelty-Free - 2oz\nDr. Denese\n{'Skin Type': 'All, Oily, Sensitive, Dry', 'Product Benefits': 'Dr. Denese', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'Dr. Denese', 'Item Form': 'Serum', 'Package Dimensions': '4.6 x 2.6 x 1.7 inches; 2 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Dr. Denese'}\nAfter using this for several days now, I am officially in love with this.
