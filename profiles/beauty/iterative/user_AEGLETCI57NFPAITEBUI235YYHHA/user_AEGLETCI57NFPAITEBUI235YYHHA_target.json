This powder is super finely milled, very soft, and great at setting my face makeup without making it more cakey. Bonus, there is no fragrance whatsoever (you would be surprised how many powders I have come across with a scent). However, this does not extend the longevity of my makeup wear. It did not hold back my oily complexion and it while it did make my skin look soft at the beginning of the day, by the end my skin looked a little more textured than it already does. So, I think for me, this powder is a no-go but someone else may have better luck with it.\nReview Title: It's okay, not my favorite\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Mary Kay Makeup Finishing Spray by Skindin\u00e4via\nMary Kay\n{'Item Form': 'Spray', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Package Information': 'Bottle', 'Brand': 'Mary Kay', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '5 x 2 x 5 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nI loved how this made my makeup look but I don't feel like it made much of difference in longevity. And I am not sure my skin even likes this product because the past few times I have applied it, I would get one or two breakouts. It could be related to something else but the longer I go without this product, the few the problems I have. I prefer the skindinavia lines but don't take my word for it, this product could work for you!\nI loved how this made my makeup look but I don't ...\nSec Clinical Stress Respn Size 1.6z Secret Clinical Stress Response 1.6z\nSecret\n{'Brand': 'Secret', 'Number of Items': '4', 'Unit Count': '4.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '5.4 x 2.8 x 1.5 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nI have been using this for so long and I like it but I do not know if I will continue to repurchase because I think my body has stopped responding to it. If I was in a pinch and needed something asap, I would go back to this because I know it but currently I am trying other things to see if they compare.\n... have been using this for so long and I like it but I do not know if I will ...\nGarnier Fructis Volume Extend Instant Bodifier Dry Shampoo 3.40 oz (Pack of 2)\nGarnier\n{'Brand': 'Garnier', 'Hair Type': 'Dry', 'Item Form': 'Spray', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Item Weight': '0.01 Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '8.2 x 2.7 x 1.8 inches; 0.01 Ounces', 'UPC': '603084294954'}\nI like this dry shampoo because it feels so light in my hair, it doesn\u2019t feel sticky or tough. I do not feel it gives my hair volume but it does well in cancelling excess oils and smelling good. I would repurchase but I would have preferred more volume (hence my four stars).\nGood, not perfect for me.\nDr. Denese Cannabis Sativa Super Serum with Soothing Calming Organic Cold-Pressed Hemp Oil, Ginger, Bisabolol, Ceramides - Reduce Look of Wrinkles, Moisturize & Improved Tightness - Cruelty-Free - 2oz\nDr. Denese\n{'Skin Type': 'All, Oily, Sensitive, Dry', 'Product Benefits': 'Dr. Denese', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'Dr. Denese', 'Item Form': 'Serum', 'Package Dimensions': '4.6 x 2.6 x 1.7 inches; 2 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Dr. Denese'}\nAfter using this for several days now, I am officially in love with this. This serum has calmed my redness by miles, my blemishes don't last a long, and this stuff absorbs lightning fast. It feels so smooth, soft (like velvet), and the texture is thin and easy to work with. There is no smell and a little goes a long way. I definitely plan to keep this serum as a repeat staple in my routine.\nVery nice\nZeitun Natural Anti Cellulite Body Scrub - Organic Coffee Body Scrub Exfoliator With Robusta & Dead Sea Salt - Cinnamon, Ginger And Moisturizing Oils, 7 oz\nZeitun\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.57 x 5.91 x 8.27 inches; 7 Ounces'}\nI like this coffee scrub! The ingredients are simple, yet powerful. It smells like a good, spiced coffee dessert with the cinnamon and ginger. As with any coffee scrub, you have to use this consistently to see any kind of results. I find that this improves my skin softness and shaving is a dream after I use this scrub. Overall a great scrub!\nNice\nSAISZE Jaw Exerciser, Facial Fat Burner Double Chin Reducer Eliminator for Jawline Shaper, Neck Muscle Training Helps Face Slimming for Men Women (Blue)\nSAISZE\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.68 x 4.69 x 1.77 inches; 2.4 Ounces'}\nI do not think I will continue to use this gadget. For one, like others have said, it is larger than it appears. It is kind of hard to get into my mouth and biting it is not really ergonomic. I followed the directions in the description and boiled it so that when I bit down, the clear bits became an impression of my teeth. However, I did not find that to be much help later on. I used this a couple of times and while I did find my jaw feeling sore afterwards, I do not feel comfortable using it for the long term. My jaw is not in good alignment (something I need surgery for but can't afford) so I got this with hopes that it could help support my jaw and keep it from getting worse. I also have a hard time with jaw discomfort from teeth grinding and my dentist said that exercises can help alleviate that issue. Due to the large size and ill-fit, I fear that it could do more damage to my jaw and bite than help. I think overall this is a lost cause for me but maybe someone else will have better luck.\nNot really a fan\nLoose Face Powder Long Lasting and Waterproof Oil Control Moisturizing Setting Powder Makeup 1.76 Oz\nMarine Forest\n{'Package Dimensions': '2.76 x 2.76 x 1.57 inches; 3.17 Ounces', 'UPC': '762403926959'}\nI have oily/combo skin and I am always on the hunt for some good powders.
