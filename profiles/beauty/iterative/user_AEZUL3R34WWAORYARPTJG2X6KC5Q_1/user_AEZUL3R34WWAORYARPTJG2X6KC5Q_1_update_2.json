This Minetan tan booster mousse has a light foamy texture and goes on clear. It definitely helps your sunless tanner last longer and is decently moisturizing.<br /><br />Honestly I do like this mousse, but I personally prefer Minetan tan extending lotion to this mousse. The mousse seams to me to have a little bit of stiffness and stickiness when I put it on my skin. I do still like the mousse, but I would take there lotion over this if given the choice. But still a good product! I think it\u2019s more personal preference as I prefer the brands lotion tanning products to there mousse ones.\nReview Title: Great product!\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "TINY BUDDHA Mindfulness Gift Set Includes Soothing Bath and Shower Gel, Relaxing Pillow Spray, Calming Essential Oil Roll-On, Lychee Flower Scented Candle and Daily Mindfulness Practice Guide\nTiny Buddha\n{'Brand': 'Tiny Buddha', 'Special Feature': 'Scented', 'Seasons': 'All Seasons', 'Item Volume': '1 Fluid Ounces', 'Unit Count': '12.00 Fl Oz', 'Package Dimensions': '8.35 x 8.07 x 2.52 inches; 1.45 Pounds', 'Manufacturer': 'KMI Brands'}\nWhile I really like this Tiny Buddha Mindfullness set, mine came completely soaked, so much that the box was falling apart. The culprit was the pillow spray that had leaked almost completely out since the lid wasn\u2019t on securely. Which is a shame because I absolutely love pillow sprays and use them every single night, and this one smelled really good.<br /><br />That being said the rest of the set was just ok for me. The candle does smell good, but it is super tiny and only burned for a few hours before it was gone. The shower gel smells amazing, but didn\u2019t lather as well as I hoped and the scent didn\u2019t linger. And the essential oil roll on was alright, though it smelled kind of musty or something. I would have given this 4 stars if the pillow spray wasn\u2019t leaked everywhere, but it was, so only 3 stars.\nPillow spray leaked everywhere, but it smelled really good\nMINETAN BODY.SKIN Tan Booster Foam - Boosts Color Results for Deeper, Darker, Longer Lasting Results, 10.14 fl oz\n{'Brand': 'MINETAN BODY.SKIN', 'Product Benefits': 'Suits all skin types & tones for those wanting to boost the results from their self tan with illuminating results.Suits all skin types & tones for those wanting to boost the results from their self tan with illuminating results.
