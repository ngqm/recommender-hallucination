First it claims to be a room and pillow spray, but it\u2019s not, or at least this scent isn\u2019t. It\u2019s not relaxing at all and it\u2019s way to strong for a pillow spray.<br /><br />Generally I love hibiscus scents, but there is just something really off about this one, it\u2019s almost perfume like. Plus the sprayer nozzle on this is terrible. It shouts out huge droplets that splatter everywhere and leak down the container and onto my hand every time. They put two different caps on this, but then the sprayer is terrible\u2026 why? Overall I was just really unimpressed by this. I have tried other products from this brand like there essential oils, and I have generally liked them. But this is just a huge miss for me.\nReview Title: Terrible spray nozzle and scent is more like perfume\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "TINY BUDDHA Mindfulness Gift Set Includes Soothing Bath and Shower Gel, Relaxing Pillow Spray, Calming Essential Oil Roll-On, Lychee Flower Scented Candle and Daily Mindfulness Practice Guide\nTiny Buddha\n{'Brand': 'Tiny Buddha', 'Special Feature': 'Scented', 'Seasons': 'All Seasons', 'Item Volume': '1 Fluid Ounces', 'Unit Count': '12.00 Fl Oz', 'Package Dimensions': '8.35 x 8.07 x 2.52 inches; 1.45 Pounds', 'Manufacturer': 'KMI Brands'}\nWhile I really like this Tiny Buddha Mindfullness set, mine came completely soaked, so much that the box was falling apart. The culprit was the pillow spray that had leaked almost completely out since the lid wasn\u2019t on securely. Which is a shame because I absolutely love pillow sprays and use them every single night, and this one smelled really good.<br /><br />That being said the rest of the set was just ok for me. The candle does smell good, but it is super tiny and only burned for a few hours before it was gone. The shower gel smells amazing, but didn\u2019t lather as well as I hoped and the scent didn\u2019t linger. And the essential oil roll on was alright, though it smelled kind of musty or something. I would have given this 4 stars if the pillow spray wasn\u2019t leaked everywhere, but it was, so only 3 stars.\nPillow spray leaked everywhere, but it smelled really good\nMINETAN BODY.SKIN Tan Booster Foam - Boosts Color Results for Deeper, Darker, Longer Lasting Results, 10.14 fl oz\n{'Brand': 'MINETAN BODY.SKIN', 'Product Benefits': 'Suits all skin types & tones for those wanting to boost the results from their self tan with illuminating results.Suits all skin types & tones for those wanting to boost the results from their self tan with illuminating results.   See more', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Material Feature': 'Certified Organic', 'Item Weight': '0.36 Kilograms', 'Product Dimensions': '21.26 x 21.26 x 87.4 inches; 12.7 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'MIH201905'}\nI have been using Minetan products for a few years now almost exclusively, so it goes without saying that I love most of there products! This Minetan tan booster mousse has a light foamy texture and goes on clear. It definitely helps your sunless tanner last longer and is decently moisturizing.<br /><br />Honestly I do like this mousse, but I personally prefer Minetan tan extending lotion to this mousse. The mousse seams to me to have a little bit of stiffness and stickiness when I put it on my skin. I do still like the mousse, but I would take there lotion over this if given the choice. But still a good product! I think it\u2019s more personal preference as I prefer the brands lotion tanning products to there mousse ones.\nGreat product!\nOreola Fish Line Hair Extensions Real Human Hair Natural Black Wire Hair Extensions Straight Hairpiece for Women #1B 20inch 120G\nOreola\n{'Brand': 'Oreola', 'Color': '#1B Natural Black', 'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Extension Length': '20 Inches', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Package Dimensions': '7.87 x 3.94 x 1.97 inches; 8 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Oreola'}\nThe hair itself is actually gorgeous on this Oreola Halo hair extensions. It\u2019s very high quality and the color is not one monotone color, but instead multiple colors and is blended together beautifully. I have a bit of experience with these types of wigs and I find them the easiest for me for quick application. Once you get the hang of putting these on you can do it pretty quick, just watch lots of tutorials on utube and you will be a pro in no time!<br /><br />The only critique I have is that I wish the hair were just a bit thicker. It\u2019s gorgeous hair and it\u2019s nice and long and easy to work with, but it\u2019s just not very thick. Which kind of limits who can use it. If you have short hair that\u2019s above chin length then this will not work for you. But overall it\u2019s still great quality and I\u2019m happy with it!\nBeautiful hair and well made\nikoo E-Styler Pro Heated Hair Styling Brush for Women, Thermal & Ceramic, Straightens & Creates Waves, Rotating Power Cable, Auto-Off, One-Touch-Navigation for Easy Heat Control - Beluga Black\nikoo\n{'Brand': 'Ikoo', 'Color': 'Black', 'Material': 'Ceramic', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Special Feature': 'Auto-off', 'Product Dimensions': '13.03 x 4.53 x 3.35 inches; 2.01 Pounds'}\nI have tried quite a lot of electric styling brushes over the last few years, and I have to say that this is definitely the best designed and overall best one I have used. The design of it with the grooves on the sides makes it so that your hair doesn\u2019t tangle or wave awkwardly. It fells solid and seams to be good quality overall.<br /><br />This IMO E-styler isn\u2019t going to give you stick straight hair like a straightener would, but it does work very well for giving you a more natural looking straightness without making your hair look thin, unlike a traditional straightener.<br /><br />On the flip side, it is not going to give you tighter curls, it\u2019s more for waves and again more natural looking waves. But it does do waves very well.<br /><br />It\u2019s definitely unique and I have never seen one quite like this. But that\u2019s not a bad thing! As long as your aware of what it can and can\u2019t do and the types of styles it can produce, then you will be happy with it! Overall it\u2019s pricy, but I like it a lot!\nVery unique and excels at natural looking straightening and waves\nFlorona Hibiscus Air Freshener Room Spray for Deep Sleep 100 ml - Pure & Unrefined Pillow Mist & Linen Spray (Hibiscus,100 ml)\nFLORONA\n{'Package Dimensions': '5.75 x 1.73 x 1.69 inches; 4.73 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'FLORONA'}\nNot really a fan of this Florona Hibiscus room freshener.
