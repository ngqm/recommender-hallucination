The culprit was the pillow spray that had leaked almost completely out since the lid wasn\u2019t on securely. Which is a shame because I absolutely love pillow sprays and use them every single night, and this one smelled really good.<br /><br />That being said the rest of the set was just ok for me. The candle does smell good, but it is super tiny and only burned for a few hours before it was gone. The shower gel smells amazing, but didn\u2019t lather as well as I hoped and the scent didn\u2019t linger. And the essential oil roll on was alright, though it smelled kind of musty or something. I would have given this 4 stars if the pillow spray wasn\u2019t leaked everywhere, but it was, so only 3 stars.\nReview Title: Pillow spray leaked everywhere, but it smelled really good\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
