So when I had the opportunity to try out this Neogenlab snail mucus essence I jumped on it.<br /><br />So far so good. It\u2019s definitely not the consistency that you would think it would be for something that contains a lot of snail mucus, it\u2019s actually quite light and thin. It\u2019s not mucus like or sticky at all and absorbs into your skin quite easily.<br /><br />As far as results go, I have not seen any significant difference in my skin. It does feel nice and does not feel tacky or sticky, plus it dries down pretty fast. I have not had any trouble with using it under makeup or along with other skin care either. Overall It\u2019s a pretty decent essence!\nReview Title: Easy to use\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "TINY BUDDHA Mindfulness Gift Set Includes Soothing Bath and Shower Gel, Relaxing Pillow Spray, Calming Essential Oil Roll-On, Lychee Flower Scented Candle and Daily Mindfulness Practice Guide\nTiny Buddha\n{'Brand': 'Tiny Buddha', 'Special Feature': 'Scented', 'Seasons': 'All Seasons', 'Item Volume': '1 Fluid Ounces', 'Unit Count': '12.00 Fl Oz', 'Package Dimensions': '8.35 x 8.07 x 2.52 inches; 1.45 Pounds', 'Manufacturer': 'KMI Brands'}\nWhile I really like this Tiny Buddha Mindfullness set, mine came completely soaked, so much that the box was falling apart. The culprit was the pillow spray that had leaked almost completely out since the lid wasn\u2019t on securely. Which is a shame because I absolutely love pillow sprays and use them every single night, and this one smelled really good.<br /><br />That being said the rest of the set was just ok for me. The candle does smell good, but it is super tiny and only burned for a few hours before it was gone. The shower gel smells amazing, but didn\u2019t lather as well as I hoped and the scent didn\u2019t linger. And the essential oil roll on was alright, though it smelled kind of musty or something. I would have given this 4 stars if the pillow spray wasn\u2019t leaked everywhere, but it was, so only 3 stars.\nPillow spray leaked everywhere, but it smelled really good\nMINETAN BODY.SKIN Tan Booster Foam - Boosts Color Results for Deeper, Darker, Longer Lasting Results, 10.14 fl oz\n{'Brand': 'MINETAN BODY.SKIN', 'Product Benefits': 'Suits all skin types & tones for those wanting to boost the results from their self tan with illuminating results.Suits all skin types & tones for those wanting to boost the results from their self tan with illuminating results.   See more', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Material Feature': 'Certified Organic', 'Item Weight': '0.36 Kilograms', 'Product Dimensions': '21.26 x 21.26 x 87.4 inches; 12.7 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'MIH201905'}\nI have been using Minetan products for a few years now almost exclusively, so it goes without saying that I love most of there products! This Minetan tan booster mousse has a light foamy texture and goes on clear. It definitely helps your sunless tanner last longer and is decently moisturizing.<br /><br />Honestly I do like this mousse, but I personally prefer Minetan tan extending lotion to this mousse. The mousse seams to me to have a little bit of stiffness and stickiness when I put it on my skin. I do still like the mousse, but I would take there lotion over this if given the choice. But still a good product! I think it\u2019s more personal preference as I prefer the brands lotion tanning products to there mousse ones.\nGreat product!\nOreola Fish Line Hair Extensions Real Human Hair Natural Black Wire Hair Extensions Straight Hairpiece for Women #1B 20inch 120G\nOreola\n{'Brand': 'Oreola', 'Color': '#1B Natural Black', 'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Extension Length': '20 Inches', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Package Dimensions': '7.87 x 3.94 x 1.97 inches; 8 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Oreola'}\nThe hair itself is actually gorgeous on this Oreola Halo hair extensions. It\u2019s very high quality and the color is not one monotone color, but instead multiple colors and is blended together beautifully. I have a bit of experience with these types of wigs and I find them the easiest for me for quick application. Once you get the hang of putting these on you can do it pretty quick, just watch lots of tutorials on utube and you will be a pro in no time!<br /><br />The only critique I have is that I wish the hair were just a bit thicker. It\u2019s gorgeous hair and it\u2019s nice and long and easy to work with, but it\u2019s just not very thick. Which kind of limits who can use it. If you have short hair that\u2019s above chin length then this will not work for you. But overall it\u2019s still great quality and I\u2019m happy with it!\nBeautiful hair and well made\nikoo E-Styler Pro Heated Hair Styling Brush for Women, Thermal & Ceramic, Straightens & Creates Waves, Rotating Power Cable, Auto-Off, One-Touch-Navigation for Easy Heat Control - Beluga Black\nikoo\n{'Brand': 'Ikoo', 'Color': 'Black', 'Material': 'Ceramic', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Special Feature': 'Auto-off', 'Product Dimensions': '13.03 x 4.53 x 3.35 inches; 2.01 Pounds'}\nI have tried quite a lot of electric styling brushes over the last few years, and I have to say that this is definitely the best designed and overall best one I have used. The design of it with the grooves on the sides makes it so that your hair doesn\u2019t tangle or wave awkwardly. It fells solid and seams to be good quality overall.<br /><br />This IMO E-styler isn\u2019t going to give you stick straight hair like a straightener would, but it does work very well for giving you a more natural looking straightness without making your hair look thin, unlike a traditional straightener.<br /><br />On the flip side, it is not going to give you tighter curls, it\u2019s more for waves and again more natural looking waves. But it does do waves very well.<br /><br />It\u2019s definitely unique and I have never seen one quite like this. But that\u2019s not a bad thing! As long as your aware of what it can and can\u2019t do and the types of styles it can produce, then you will be happy with it! Overall it\u2019s pricy, but I like it a lot!\nVery unique and excels at natural looking straightening and waves\nFlorona Hibiscus Air Freshener Room Spray for Deep Sleep 100 ml - Pure & Unrefined Pillow Mist & Linen Spray (Hibiscus,100 ml)\nFLORONA\n{'Package Dimensions': '5.75 x 1.73 x 1.69 inches; 4.73 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'FLORONA'}\nNot really a fan of this Florona Hibiscus room freshener. First it claims to be a room and pillow spray, but it\u2019s not, or at least this scent isn\u2019t. It\u2019s not relaxing at all and it\u2019s way to strong for a pillow spray.<br /><br />Generally I love hibiscus scents, but there is just something really off about this one, it\u2019s almost perfume like. Plus the sprayer nozzle on this is terrible. It shouts out huge droplets that splatter everywhere and leak down the container and onto my hand every time. They put two different caps on this, but then the sprayer is terrible\u2026 why? Overall I was just really unimpressed by this. I have tried other products from this brand like there essential oils, and I have generally liked them. But this is just a huge miss for me.\nTerrible spray nozzle and scent is more like perfume\nTIANG Facial Steamer, Nano Ionic Mist Face Steamer, Hydrating Mist Sprayer Water Oxygen Injection, Nano Steamer Portable Mist Humidifier, for Face Mini Spa Rejuvenation, Moisturizing Refreshing\nTIANG\n{'Brand': 'TIANG', 'Item Form': 'Liquid, Oil, Lotion, Spray', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Use for': 'Face', 'Product Dimensions': '7.09 x 1.61 x 1.61 inches; 6.17 Ounces', 'UPC': '757249753050'}\nI absolutely love these types of nano facial misters and have purchased quite a few over the last 6 months or so both higher and lower end. This TIANG one is about mid level price wise, but I actually thing this works better in a lot of aspects than my more expensive one that costs about 2x the price!<br /><br />My favorite facial mister prior to this was the Flight Mode Cloud Mister which is usually between $40-$50 depending on if it\u2019s on sale or not at that time. And personally I think this TIANG one works even better!<br /><br />First you can actually put an watery essence in this TIANG one, unlike the Flight mode one that doesn\u2019t allow it. This TIANG one also has a better spray than my flight mode one. The flight mode one is insanely fine, honestly it\u2019s actually to fine but it was still my favorite up until now. This TIANG one is slightly stronger of a spray which is enough to really mist your face without feeling like you dumping skincare or water on your skin. This TIANG one also holds a charge longer and I can easily get a day or two out of it even if I am using it frequently throughout the day.<br /><br />The only real negative is the size of this TIANG one bits much larger than my old one and most of the others I have tried. But other than that this is a fantastic machine and I would highly recommend! Sometimes it\u2019s the really simple things that work best!\nWorks better than ones that cones nearly 2x the price\nHeatless Curling Rod Headband Silk 6A 35mm with 1 Clip and 2 Silk Hair Ties No Heat Curls Overnight Curly Ribbon For Hair Tools Sleep In Curler Rollers Head Wrap for Sleeping Long Hair Wave Kit\nwedofever\n{'Item Form': 'Clip', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Material': 'Silk, Cotton', 'Brand': 'Wedofever', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '37 x 1.38 x 1.38 inches', 'Product Dimensions': '37 x 1.38 x 1.38 inches; 6.74 Ounces'}\nI have been curious about these heartless curling rod headbands for a while now. I mean who wouldn\u2019t love to wake up with curled and bouncy hair that you didn\u2019t even have to use heat on?!?! So when I came across this set I figured it was totally worth a try!<br /><br />I\u2019m the set you get the shiny metallic/holographic bag, 2 scrunchies, one hair clip, and the long curling thing itself. Both the scrunchies and the curling rod thing have a satin finish, which is great for your hair and is soft to the touch. The curling rod thing seams to be stuffed with basic stuffing like you would find in a cheap pillow. Honestly the overall quality is just ok, nothing fancy.<br /><br />I have used this multiple times now, and there is for sure a learning curve. It seams simple enough, but the way you wrap it, how tightly you wrap it, how big the sections are that you wrap,  and how damp your hair is all play a huge rule in how it turns out. They do include a little card with pictures on the basics of how to wrap your hair, but the rest you will have to figure out as you go.<br /><br />As far as how well it works, it definitely does work. Even my hair that usually doesn\u2019t hold a curl with heat I was able to get decent wavy styles out of.  This does give a nice wave to it, however if I want truly curly hair or even loose curls then this doesn\u2019t do that for me.<br /><br />One other thing worth the mentioning, I priced these out and this set is 2x-3x more expensive than others sold on here. And being that the quality on this isn\u2019t amazing or anything. Im confused as to why. But overall it\u2019s an ok product.\nNot bad!\nSUPRENT Razors for Men with Matrix Cutter Head, 38.5\u00b0 Golden Angle Shaving Kit for Men, Travelling Razor Kit-1 Mens Razor Handle, 2 Blade Refills,1 Dock,1 Shave Foam\nSUPRENT\n{'Brand': 'SUPRENT', 'Number of Blades': '6', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Handle Material': 'Metal', 'Product Dimensions': '3.94 x 3.94 x 1.97 inches; 1.28 Pounds'}\nI always wondered why no companies ever made 6 bladed razors, but after using this SUPRENT I think I have an idea\u2026<br /><br />This razor looks amazingly sleek and stylish. From the blades and the curve of the handle, to the stylish holder. It oozes style and luxury. That is until you actually want to use it\u2026<br /><br />Just as they claim the handle is alloy and has a good bit of weight to it. But what they don\u2019t tell you is that with wet, sweaty, or shaving foam covered hands this feels like a bar of soap in the shower or one of those slippery snake toys we used to have when I was growing up. The razor head is fixed in what they call an \u201coptimum angle\u201d, except it\u2019s really not. Imagine trying to keep your grip on one of those slippery snakes, while trying to maneuver your hand at all kinds of odd angles to get that \u201coptimum angle\u201d, while 6 nice and sharp blades are around your jugular\u2026.<br /><br />Unfortunately this looks great, but functionally it doesn\u2019t perform. And to be honest that\u2019s a shame since I have used a few different clipper sets from SUPRENT that were amazing all around. This just unfortunately isn\u2019t one of them.\nLooks lux, but that\u2019s about all it has going for it\nProfessional Hair Highlighting Combs Balayage Board, 3 Sizes Weaving Styling With Rat Tail Nylon Teasing Dyeing Combs, Coloring Board Hair Combs Accessories for DIY Salon Styling Barbershop\nCODACE\n{'Material': 'Plastic', 'Brand': 'CODACE', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Size': 'Large', 'Power Source': 'manual', 'Package Dimensions': '10.91 x 4.8 x 0.75 inches; 4.16 Ounces'}\nI really don\u2019t have any complaints about these hair highlighting combs themselves. They work great for what they are intended for and are decently sturdy. They are slightly higher in price than others I have purchased in the past, and are around the same quality. So I do think there a bit overpriced. But other than that they work great!\nSlightly overpriced but work great\nNEOGEN DERMALOGY Cica repair snail essence\n{'Use for': 'Whole Body', 'Scent': 'Cica', 'Brand': 'DERMALOGY by NEOGENLAB', 'Item Volume': '100 Milliliters', 'Unit Count': '3.38 Ounce', 'Product Dimensions': '1.57 x 1.57 x 3.94 inches; 5.93 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'B09CTBZVD6'}\nI have heard of the benefits that snail Mucus has when used in skincare and have been wanting to give it a try for some time but jus never pulled the plug.
