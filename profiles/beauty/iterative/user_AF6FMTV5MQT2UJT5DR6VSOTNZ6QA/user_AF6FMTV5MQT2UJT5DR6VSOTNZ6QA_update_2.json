It detangles my Long, Tangled/Knotted hair SO Easily! No more Pulling & Tugging just to make more Knots & cause Damage to my Hair! The Bristles are not Soft/Coated at their Tips, so be Gentle! This Set includes 2 Brush 'Bases' and 2 Support Pieces to put it together - I chose to make just 1 Brush, with both of the Support Pieces. I don't like the extra set of Holes Showing, and the Brush feels Flimsier then I like with just 1 Support Piece.\nReview Title: Best Detangling Brush I've Used!\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
