The hair is very soft and doesnt tangle. Minimum shedding, nothing major or beyond average. The density is on the low side so it gives a natural appearance. If you like big, diva hair you might now like the 130% density.\nGreat wig for the price!

I didn't really notice anything different. Had a small tingling sensation when applied and left slim residue.\nNo noticeable difference\nN3 No Name Necessary Pore-Minimizing Mattifying Oil and Shine Control Anti-aging Makeup Face Primer Spray (200ml)\nNo Name Necessary\n{'Brand': 'No Name Necessary', 'Skin Type': 'Combination', 'Package Information': 'Bottle', 'Finish Type': 'Matte', 'Specialty': 'Mattifying', 'Product Dimensions': '1.7 x 1.7 x 7.5 inches; 8.78 Ounces'}\nThis primer is nothing short of amazing. The mist that a nozzle gives is a huge deal when it comes to coverage. Some times if the mist is too much its just too messy. But the mist on this one is so fine I barely felt anything on my face when I was applying it and had to be sure that I was even getting product on my faec and opened my eyes to check. I did use more than the recommended amount, which I found to be a bit on the low side since the size of the mist is so small the amount of product that you get out on a single spray is minimum. After I applied, I watched in the mirror as it dried, and the effects were amazing. My shine do go away and I could literally see my pore getting smaller. I could see myself using this alone on a hot summer day without makeup because the finish it gave was just that great. My makeup also went on very easy and smooth and felt as if it was gliding across my face and not going into every wrinkle and groove. I didn't wear my makeup anything close to 16 hours but I did make it through a 8 hour workday flawless. Defiantly a staple now in my makeup bag.\nVery fine mist\nMaynice Soft Nature 3D Mink Stripe Lashes WIth Package 1 pair Y50\nMaynice\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.72 x 2.17 x 0.59 inches; 1.06 Ounces', 'UPC': '743811077808'}\nLoved these lashes.
