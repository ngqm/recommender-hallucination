It is not comfortable in that position at all.<br />The only way I can use it is lying flat on the bed or<br />on the couch.  I use this when I am taking a 15 minute<br />me break.<br />That being said, I found the lights work very well.<br />I found the lights to be very bright and to do their job.<br />I like that there are plenty of lights to cover my whole face<br />and neck.<br />I can feel the electric nodes pulsating on my face.  I can<br />feel them working.  I did not go all the way up on power<br />with the electric nodes, just what I personal could handle.<br />Be careful pulling the nodes out for storage as I pulled out the<br />rubber stopper with the node and had to put it back in after<br />use.<br />I found the remote control to work well also.  It has<br />clearly displayed markings to show me where to turn<br />the power up or to flash the lights and to make them steady.<br />I found that the timer works well also, I can set it and not<br />worry about the time as it keeps track for me.<br />I found the design of the mask good, it just needs to be<br />tweaked some so it is not so heavy on the face sitting up.<br />It a great design just to weighty to sit up.<br />I like that it seems to be made with pretty good quality.<br />The price is good so worth laying down for.<br />I mostly use the red light for collagen activation and wrinkles.<br />I have enclosed pictures so you can make a informed<br />decision based on your own personal needs.\nReview Title: Use lying down\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Its the first<br />I have found that does not.  I found the mirror<br />to be plastic.  I had to removed the plastic paper<br />in the back to start the light.  That keep the<br />battery from being turned on during shipping.<br />Also I removed the plastic on the mirror itself.<br />I found all tools were in good shape and sharp<br />enough to do the scraping of my teeth.<br />I liked that that the tools were all metal<br />and had no plastic in the middle like some<br />do.

It seemed to cure the<br />polish on well and not take to much time.<br />The timer counts up or down depending on the setting<br />I push.<br />I liked all the tools.  They seem adequate<br />in doing there job.<br />I liked the pearls and the rhinestones that<br />came with it.  I found they are very pretty<br />and add that nice touch.<br />I found the buffers to work well.<br />I liked the cuticle pusher and the trimmer.<br />I believe the cuticle pusher is all stainless steel.<br />It pushed my cuticles back very well.<br />Be careful with the trimmer as it is sharp to<br />cut off the dead skin.<br />I liked the nail brush for residue of powder<br />left over when I file and buff my nails.<br />It is suppose to have a basic scrubbing brush<br />in there to for under my nails and to get them clean<br />before applying any of the gel.  That was missing<br />In my kit so I had to use my own.<br />I liked the nail separator that came with it.<br />I found this to really have everything<br />I need to do my nails.<br />I liked how I received in one kit all the things<br />to get started not going to a expensive salon minus<br />the scrub brush.<br />All the tools that came with it seemed<br />to work well.<br />I do believe this would be a great gift for the<br />young or older person who likes to do their<br />nails at home.

They<br />appear to be stainless steel but I am not sure.<br />I started out on level one for the first week.<br />I liked that there were 3 levels so I didn\u2019t have<br />to start out on high.  I liked I could work my<br />way up to different levels at my own pace<br />when I felt comfortable.<br />I did not feel any pain.  My skin did get a<br />little red from the usage and it quickly went<br />away.<br />I like the timer feature so I can know<br />exactly how long I have been working<br />on a area of my body.  It automatically shut off<br />and I knew my time was up on that area and to<br />move on to the next.<br />I am slowly working up to more time.<br />I found the heat to be a nice feeling and I<br />can tell my skin is getting better.  I feel like<br />it is getting tighter and firmer with time.<br />I liked how it works slowly as not to damage<br />my skin.<br />I found it takes time with this product, it is<br />not instantaneous.<br />I liked that I can use it on other parts of my<br />body other than just my face.  Stomach, legs<br />and arms.

We found the rings to work well with<br />using the glue.  We found the rings open in the back for bigger fingers.<br />We found the tweezers to work well and pick up the lashes gently.<br />We found the flat mannequin head with replaceable<br />eyes to work well for our practice.  It is heavier built and<br />should last.  It also has a place in the back for those who<br />have the stand.  We do not.  All eyes have lashes on them already<br />just like real eyes.  The trick is to learn to put these on well<br />enough that they also look like real lashes and blend in with the<br />natural lashes.  This is where our practice part comes in.<br />We like it came with the flat head and 3 extra replaceable sets of eyes<br />in case there is a mess up learning how to apply and remove<br />the lashes.  There is 2 of us trying to learn.<br />There was enough supplies in the box for both of us.  There is also<br />5 sheets of 7 pairs of isolation papers.<br />We did find the glue was in a tiny bottle only 5 ml.  Since we use<br />only a pin head dot to apply the lashes it might last.<br />We like that everything works well for the training of applying<br />lashes.<br />We like there is different sized lash extensions for our<br />practice and there is plenty to practice with.<br />We found this a good learning tool and easy to use.<br />I have enclosed pictures so you can make a informed<br />decision based on your own personal needs.<br />Yes I would recommend this product.\nEverything needed in one package\nL\u2019ange Argan-Infused Round Brush | Lightweight & Ergonomic Design | 43MM Tourmaline Ceramic Barrel\nL'ANGE HAIR\n{'Brand': \"L'ANGE HAIR\", 'Color': 'Rose Gold, Black', 'Shape': 'Round', 'Product Benefits': 'Smoothing', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '10.51 x 2.64 x 2.56 inches; 3.84 Ounces', 'UPC': '810108191223'}\nI like the size of the brush.<br />I like the color of the brush.<br />It's a cute pink with a rose gold barrel.<br />I like the quality of the brush and<br />how well it is made.<br />I like that the brush is infused<br />with argan oil.<br />I like the brush helps me to add<br />volume to my hair and to<br />straighten it at the same time.<br />I like the brush added some shine<br />to my hair.<br />I like the size of the bristles on the<br />brush.  Not too long, not to short.<br />I like the weight of the brush.  I<br />found it to be light in my hand<br />while using it.

I found that<br />the pomade stayed on really well.  A lot<br />better than I was expecting.  It is a cream<br />type and once its dry it is on there.  I<br />like that it is waterproof.  Almost smudge<br />proof in a couple of seconds and smudge<br />proof after it is dry.  Regular water won\u2019t<br />wash it off.  Regular soap didn\u2019t wash it<br />off.
