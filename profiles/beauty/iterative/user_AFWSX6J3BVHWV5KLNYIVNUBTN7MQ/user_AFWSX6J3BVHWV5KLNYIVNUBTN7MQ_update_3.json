Its the first<br />I have found that does not.  I found the mirror<br />to be plastic.  I had to removed the plastic paper<br />in the back to start the light.  That keep the<br />battery from being turned on during shipping.<br />Also I removed the plastic on the mirror itself.<br />I found all tools were in good shape and sharp<br />enough to do the scraping of my teeth.<br />I liked that that the tools were all metal<br />and had no plastic in the middle like some<br />do.  I found the very sharp tip\u2019s covered in hard<br />plastic for protection.<br />It came in a cute little card board tube<br />and has a little carrying bag to keep the<br />tools inside so they don\u2019t get lost.<br />I drink coffee and my teeth get stain\u2019s<br />and these really help\u2019s with getting the<br />stains off and the tartar.<br />It takes a little practice to get it right<br />and I found these tools to work the way<br />they are supposed too.<br />I am using these for my self but I see no<br />reason you couldn\u2019t use them on an animal<br />if you need too.<br />I liked that I can get under my gum line.<br />I have enclosed pictures so you can make a<br />informed decision based on your own personal<br />needs.<br />Yes I would recommend this product.\nThey do the job\nBQYPOWER Gel Nail Polish Kit with UV Light 84W LED Nail Lamp 8 Nude Colors Gel Nail Polish Starter Kit with No Wipe Base Top Coat, Manicure Kit, Nail Primer, Nail Art Decorations Home DIY Gift\nBQYPOWER\n{'Brand': 'BQYPOWER', 'Included Components': 'Top Coat, Gel Nail, Nail Lamp', 'Finish Type': 'Matte', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Package Dimensions': '10.51 x 9.84 x 5.08 inches; 3.33 Pounds'}\nI liked all the colors of the polish.<br />I liked I can do matte or glossy<br />on my nails.<br />I received 8 colors of polish,<br />a top and bottom coat of polish and<br />a frosted seal coat .<br />I liked the uv light that dried the<br />polish on.
