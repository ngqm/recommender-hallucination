Its the first<br />I have found that does not.  I found the mirror<br />to be plastic.  I had to removed the plastic paper<br />in the back to start the light.  That keep the<br />battery from being turned on during shipping.<br />Also I removed the plastic on the mirror itself.<br />I found all tools were in good shape and sharp<br />enough to do the scraping of my teeth.<br />I liked that that the tools were all metal<br />and had no plastic in the middle like some<br />do.  I found the very sharp tip\u2019s covered in hard<br />plastic for protection.<br />It came in a cute little card board tube<br />and has a little carrying bag to keep the<br />tools inside so they don\u2019t get lost.<br />I drink coffee and my teeth get stain\u2019s<br />and these really help\u2019s with getting the<br />stains off and the tartar.<br />It takes a little practice to get it right<br />and I found these tools to work the way<br />they are supposed too.<br />I am using these for my self but I see no<br />reason you couldn\u2019t use them on an animal<br />if you need too.<br />I liked that I can get under my gum line.<br />I have enclosed pictures so you can make a<br />informed decision based on your own personal<br />needs.<br />Yes I would recommend this product.\nThey do the job\nBQYPOWER Gel Nail Polish Kit with UV Light 84W LED Nail Lamp 8 Nude Colors Gel Nail Polish Starter Kit with No Wipe Base Top Coat, Manicure Kit, Nail Primer, Nail Art Decorations Home DIY Gift\nBQYPOWER\n{'Brand': 'BQYPOWER', 'Included Components': 'Top Coat, Gel Nail, Nail Lamp', 'Finish Type': 'Matte', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Package Dimensions': '10.51 x 9.84 x 5.08 inches; 3.33 Pounds'}\nI liked all the colors of the polish.<br />I liked I can do matte or glossy<br />on my nails.<br />I received 8 colors of polish,<br />a top and bottom coat of polish and<br />a frosted seal coat .<br />I liked the uv light that dried the<br />polish on.  It seemed to cure the<br />polish on well and not take to much time.<br />The timer counts up or down depending on the setting<br />I push.<br />I liked all the tools.  They seem adequate<br />in doing there job.<br />I liked the pearls and the rhinestones that<br />came with it.  I found they are very pretty<br />and add that nice touch.<br />I found the buffers to work well.<br />I liked the cuticle pusher and the trimmer.<br />I believe the cuticle pusher is all stainless steel.<br />It pushed my cuticles back very well.<br />Be careful with the trimmer as it is sharp to<br />cut off the dead skin.<br />I liked the nail brush for residue of powder<br />left over when I file and buff my nails.<br />It is suppose to have a basic scrubbing brush<br />in there to for under my nails and to get them clean<br />before applying any of the gel.  That was missing<br />In my kit so I had to use my own.<br />I liked the nail separator that came with it.<br />I found this to really have everything<br />I need to do my nails.<br />I liked how I received in one kit all the things<br />to get started not going to a expensive salon minus<br />the scrub brush.<br />All the tools that came with it seemed<br />to work well.<br />I do believe this would be a great gift for the<br />young or older person who likes to do their<br />nails at home.

They<br />appear to be stainless steel but I am not sure.<br />I started out on level one for the first week.<br />I liked that there were 3 levels so I didn\u2019t have<br />to start out on high.  I liked I could work my<br />way up to different levels at my own pace<br />when I felt comfortable.<br />I did not feel any pain.  My skin did get a<br />little red from the usage and it quickly went<br />away.<br />I like the timer feature so I can know<br />exactly how long I have been working<br />on a area of my body.  It automatically shut off<br />and I knew my time was up on that area and to<br />move on to the next.<br />I am slowly working up to more time.<br />I found the heat to be a nice feeling and I<br />can tell my skin is getting better.  I feel like<br />it is getting tighter and firmer with time.<br />I liked how it works slowly as not to damage<br />my skin.<br />I found it takes time with this product, it is<br />not instantaneous.<br />I liked that I can use it on other parts of my<br />body other than just my face.  Stomach, legs<br />and arms.  Slowly and with time I am seeing results from<br />the machine.<br />I have enclosed pictures so you can make a informed<br />decision based on your own personal needs.\nWorks, have patience\nTCOTBE 3 Pcs 6D Hair Like Authentic Eyebrows ,Simulation Eyebrow Stickers,Waterproof Imitation Ecological Natural Tattoo Eyebrow Stickers,Temporary Brow Tattoo\nTCOTBE\n{'Brand': 'TCOTBE', 'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Color': 'Natural', 'Finish Type': 'Natural', 'Special Feature': 'Waterproof', 'Package Dimensions': '8.2 x 5.79 x 0.16 inches; 0.63 Ounces'}\nI like the fact there is<br />3 sheets, so 10 stickers to a pack.<br />The first time I put them on straight out of the<br />shower on a cleanly wash face<br />and it stuck on so well<br />I almost could not get it off.<br />The reason I had to take it off<br />was my own fault in placement.<br />Pay very close attention to where<br />you want them placed.<br />I think these make a great tool for<br />my arsenal of makeup products.<br />I like how well they stick and how<br />I can wash my face with out them<br />coming off for a few days.<br />I found with the right placement<br />they look good on and are worth getting<br />the placement right so I don\u2019t have to<br />fiddle with my eye brow pencil everyday.<br />I found that when I have them on they look the same<br />as someone who get micro blading done.<br />I have enclosed pictures so you can make a informed<br />decision based on your own personal needs.<br />Yes I would recommend this product\nPay attention to placement, they work if you do it right\nSet of 3 tongue scrapers for adult, tool cleaner against bad breath.
