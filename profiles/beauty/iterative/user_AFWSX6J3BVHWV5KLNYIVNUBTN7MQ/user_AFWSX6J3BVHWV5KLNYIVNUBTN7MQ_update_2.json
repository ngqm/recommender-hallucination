Its the first<br />I have found that does not.  I found the mirror<br />to be plastic.  I had to removed the plastic paper<br />in the back to start the light.  That keep the<br />battery from being turned on during shipping.<br />Also I removed the plastic on the mirror itself.<br />I found all tools were in good shape and sharp<br />enough to do the scraping of my teeth.<br />I liked that that the tools were all metal<br />and had no plastic in the middle like some<br />do.  I found the very sharp tip\u2019s covered in hard<br />plastic for protection.<br />It came in a cute little card board tube<br />and has a little carrying bag to keep the<br />tools inside so they don\u2019t get lost.<br />I drink coffee and my teeth get stain\u2019s<br />and these really help\u2019s with getting the<br />stains off and the tartar.<br />It takes a little practice to get it right<br />and I found these tools to work the way<br />they are supposed too.<br />I am using these for my self but I see no<br />reason you couldn\u2019t use them on an animal<br />if you need too.<br />I liked that I can get under my gum line.<br />I have enclosed pictures so you can make a<br />informed decision based on your own personal<br />needs.<br />Yes I would recommend this product.\nReview Title: They do the job\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
