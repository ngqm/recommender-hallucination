After all, no one wants to look older or tired. I try all kinds of skin care products and really work hard at keeping my skin in good shape, so I decided I'd give this a try.I was speaking to a friend of mine recently whose skin always looks gorgeous. I asked her what she did to look so good? She is considerably older than me, but has no wrinkling and very pretty skin. She told me that she visits a dermatologist regularly and that she uses a retinol cream and that she pays 60.00 for just a small tube, plus the cost of the doctor visit. Now I am not sure of the strength of the retinoI cream she is using is, and I noticed this is 2.5% so I think that's a pretty effective dosage.The product came in a 1.7 fluid ounce moisturizer. I noticed that the retinol moisturizer also had Vitamin E & B5, Green Tea, Jojoba Oil, Propolis and shea butter. So I thought about Vitamin A or retinol and what it does for the skin. Vitamin A stimulates and thickens the dermis where collagen, blood vessels and elastin are thereby reducing wrinkles and increasing blood flow to the surface of your skin. Vitamin A actually expands the deposit of collagen in the skin; therefore slowing down the normal aging breakdown of your collagen and elastin. I've also read when studying skin care (and I really researched it) that Vitamin A increases blood flow and reduces the symptoms of rosacea, helps heal wounds more quickly, repairs cells in the skin and optimizes UV protection, exfoliates to make the skin more smooth, supple and even and even decreases melanin granules reducing brown spots and pigmentation. Vitamin A decreases sebum (oil) thereby treating acne very well and even helps with the eradication of precancerous lesions of the skin and improves hydration. Skins miracle healer!My mother has always used vitamin E. She is in her 70's and still has beautiful skin and is very selective about what she puts on her skin. I've read that Vitamin E has been used in skincare for so long that it sometimes gets passed over for newer, more exotic-sounding ingredients that are sometimes advertised or added to products. But Vitamin E is a highly beneficial ingredient, a strong defense against free radicals and the damage the environment does to the skin. When it\u2019s combined with other antioxidants, It is an exceptional line of defense for your skin.The product is very good quality with no redness, burning itching or negative side effects. It doesn't leave your face shiny or greasy and seems to absorb within just a couple of minutes. I notice an immediate firming of the skin but no discomfort or a feeling of being too tight. There is no build up or product residue. This product has a  nice smell, light and soothing, and is quite easy to use. It's good that the items come in a pump, because exposure to air effects good quality ingredients. A little goes a long way, and the product seems to be lasting a good long time. I use many of Majestic Pure products, and I have had excellent luck with them all and no issues. This moisturizer already is reducing fine line and wrinkles in my skin. It really helps to keep down oiliness and shine off my face. I use this moisturizer on clean skin and I let it soak in, and use under the the throat and jaw line for added firmness. While I am applying my eye makeup, I let the cream soak in. This anti aging skin cream keeps your skin supple and moisturized. So far no complaints or problems and all the products I've tried and it works well for me.

  "reference_summary": "Genesea Perfecting Serum for Face for a Tightening, Optimally Hydrating Sensation - Innovative Anti Aging Beauty Facial Serum - Promotes Youthful, Glowing Looking, Lifted Skin Appearance - 1.1 Ounce\n{'Package Dimensions': '6.5 x 1.6 x 1.6 inches; 1.6 Ounces'}\nWe are all searching for the fountain of youth! Okay I don't want to look old and wrinkled!  The description very much interested me so I decided I was ready to try it here!!  I've never tried anything from the dead sea and when I read that the product was made within a few miles of the Dead Sea, with no mineral degradation during transport.  I was anxious to give it a try. I try all sorts of things to keep that youthful glow of the skin but I also am selective about what I apply to my skin. Everything was natural here though, and It is not tested on animals, contains NO Alcohol, Sulfate or Parabens and is non- toxic.<br /><br />The product came in a 1.1 fluid ounce moisturizing serum. This product contains Glycerin and essential Dead Sea Minerals, known for their exceptional hydroscopic attributes and as a source of beautifying minerals. I read that in the description and thought what in the world is hydroscopic...so I looked it up.  &#34;Hygroscopy (etymology and pronunciation) is the ability of a substance to attract and hold water molecules from the surrounding environment. This is achieved through either absorption or adsorption with the absorbing or adsorbing substance becoming physically changed somewhat.&#34; They perform synergistically (which means together with) Squalane, Dunaliella Salina Extract, Jojoba Seed Oil and Wheat Protein to help increase the skin's moister levels and diminish water loss for a more vital and glowing overall look. After reading that in the description and researching what some of the terms meant, I decided to put the product to the test.  I have aging sking that is somewhat problematic with large pores and a few minor areas of sagging skin.  I read clearly in the description that Genesea Perfecting Serum helps to disapate the signs of skin aging such as fine lines, wrinkles and sagginess and that you would see effects of the serum in five minutes.<br /><br />I've been using the serum for a good while now sometimes under makeup and every night before going to bed at night on clean dry skin. The serum is of excellent quality with no redness, burning itching or negative side effects. It doesn't react against or burn the skin. I don't have a problem with it leaving my face greasy or shiny and it quickly absorbs into the skin within just a couple of minutes. I notice an immediate firming and suppleness of the skin but no discomfort or a feeling of being too taut. There is no build up or product residue left on the skin at all. This product has a nice smell, light and kind of floral smelling,  but no bad smell at all.  It is quite easy to use with an pump dispenser for the serum. I always prefer a pump dispenser as it keeps the integrity of the product by keeping air and contaminants out.  A little of the serum goes a long way, and the product is lasting a good long time.<br /><br />This product really hydrates my skin and make it look nice and firm almost immediately. This serum  really works and is reducing wrinkles and fine lines I have starting in my skin. The skin on my face looks so much more supple.  It also seems to keep down oiliness and shine off my face. My skin also looks clearer with less break outs and skin problems. I use the serum on clean skin of the face and I let it soak in. I also add the serum all over my face, and under the the throat and jaw line for added firmness and last I add a good moisturizing cream. While I am applying my eye makeup, I let the serums and cream soak in. The face serum contains ingredient that keep your skin smooth and moisturized.<br /><br />It seems to me that the manufacturers of the product have researched and thought out the effects of this product and have provided a great combination of products to promote beautiful skin. So far no complaints or problems and all the products I've tried appear to be working very well for me.\nGreat serum that really works!\nRetinol 2.5% Cream From Majestic Pure for Face and Eye Area Will Nourish Your Skin, Potent Anti Aging Formula Reduces Wrinkles, Stretch Marks & Redness, 50ml\nMAJESTIC PURE\n{'Brand': 'MAJESTIC PURE', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Use for': 'Face', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '3.3 x 2.9 x 2.4 inches; 5.6 Ounces', 'UPC': '784190666689 684758988935'}\n[[ASIN:B00VXEQ0WO Retinol 2.5% Cream From Majestic Pure for Face and Eye Area Will Nourish Your Skin, Potent Anti Aging Formula Reduces the Appearances of Wrinkles, Stretch Marks & Redness, 50ml]]<br /><br />I purchased Majestic Pure Retinol Cream because I am always looking for something that will help give my skin a more youthful appearance.
