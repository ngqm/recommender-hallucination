Okay I don't want to look old and wrinkled!  The description very much interested me so I decided I was ready to try it here!!  I've never tried anything from the dead sea and when I read that the product was made within a few miles of the Dead Sea, with no mineral degradation during transport.  I was anxious to give it a try. I try all sorts of things to keep that youthful glow of the skin but I also am selective about what I apply to my skin. Everything was natural here though, and It is not tested on animals, contains NO Alcohol, Sulfate or Parabens and is non- toxic.<br /><br />The product came in a 1.1 fluid ounce moisturizing serum. This product contains Glycerin and essential Dead Sea Minerals, known for their exceptional hydroscopic attributes and as a source of beautifying minerals. I read that in the description and thought what in the world is hydroscopic...so I looked it up.  &#34;Hygroscopy (etymology and pronunciation) is the ability of a substance to attract and hold water molecules from the surrounding environment. This is achieved through either absorption or adsorption with the absorbing or adsorbing substance becoming physically changed somewhat.&#34; They perform synergistically (which means together with) Squalane, Dunaliella Salina Extract, Jojoba Seed Oil and Wheat Protein to help increase the skin's moister levels and diminish water loss for a more vital and glowing overall look. After reading that in the description and researching what some of the terms meant, I decided to put the product to the test.  I have aging sking that is somewhat problematic with large pores and a few minor areas of sagging skin.  I read clearly in the description that Genesea Perfecting Serum helps to disapate the signs of skin aging such as fine lines, wrinkles and sagginess and that you would see effects of the serum in five minutes.<br /><br />I've been using the serum for a good while now sometimes under makeup and every night before going to bed at night on clean dry skin. The serum is of excellent quality with no redness, burning itching or negative side effects. It doesn't react against or burn the skin. I don't have a problem with it leaving my face greasy or shiny and it quickly absorbs into the skin within just a couple of minutes. I notice an immediate firming and suppleness of the skin but no discomfort or a feeling of being too taut. There is no build up or product residue left on the skin at all. This product has a nice smell, light and kind of floral smelling,  but no bad smell at all.  It is quite easy to use with an pump dispenser for the serum. I always prefer a pump dispenser as it keeps the integrity of the product by keeping air and contaminants out.  A little of the serum goes a long way, and the product is lasting a good long time.<br /><br />This product really hydrates my skin and make it look nice and firm almost immediately. This serum  really works and is reducing wrinkles and fine lines I have starting in my skin. The skin on my face looks so much more supple.  It also seems to keep down oiliness and shine off my face. My skin also looks clearer with less break outs and skin problems. I use the serum on clean skin of the face and I let it soak in. I also add the serum all over my face, and under the the throat and jaw line for added firmness and last I add a good moisturizing cream. While I am applying my eye makeup, I let the serums and cream soak in. The face serum contains ingredient that keep your skin smooth and moisturized.<br /><br />It seems to me that the manufacturers of the product have researched and thought out the effects of this product and have provided a great combination of products to promote beautiful skin. So far no complaints or problems and all the products I've tried appear to be working very well for me.\nReview Title: Great serum that really works!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
