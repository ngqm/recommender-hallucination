I hang them on a pole in my laundry/bathroom and use them for reusable cosmetic rounds. I can place the dirt ones in one basket and the clean ones can sit in the other waiting to be used. It's a neat and organized way to contain numerous cosmetic rounds which I use to also wash my face. Recommended.\nReview Title: Perfect for reusable cosmetic rounds\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
