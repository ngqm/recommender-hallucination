I have rough dry feet and I've been searching for years for the right product. After using this my feet are softer and they look much better. The dead skin came off really well after use. My feet look okay enough to wear sandals now.

I wish it wasn't fragrance free though. I personally like a little fragrance with my shampoo experience. I also love the way my hair smells afterwards. It's nice and it does clean well but I wish they'd consider making a similar product that's scented with jasmine or lavender.\nNice Product, No smell\nViviDreamore Satin Bonnet Silk Bonnet for Sleeping Silk Sleep Cap Hair Bonnet for Sleeping Bonnets for Women Curly Natural Braid Hair Bonnet for Men Adjustable Wide Band Double Layer(Brown)\nViviDreamore\n{}\nThis review is for ViviDreamore Satin Bonnet Silk Bonnet for Sleeping Silk Sleep Cap Hair Bonnet for Sleeping.<br /><br />This is the perfect bonnet because unlike the others it's adjustable. There's a big black belt sewn inside that you use to adjust it to whatever size you want. It can be loose and comfortable if that's the way you adjust it and it won't slip off, even while you're sleeping, it's still the perfect fit. I have a million of these bonnets and they're now way too loose after minimal wear only because you can't adjust them the way you can this one.\nPerfect adjustable bonnet\nLA MAXIME chemical free, natural organic vegan best body oil after shower for glowing skin, anti-aging with vitamins A C E for wrinkle repair & soothing hydrating body oil for extremely dry aging, mature, sensitive atopic eczema skin conditions for women and men over 30 40 50 60 (3.4 fl oz)\nLA MAXIME\n{'Brand': 'LA MAXIME', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Active Ingredients': 'coconut oil,sunflower seed oil,vitamin a,watermelon', 'Unit Count': '3.40 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.94 x 2.24 x 2.13 inches; 10.58 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'HGRBO-100', 'UPC': '611138337502'}\nThis review is for LA MAXIME Heavenly Glow Regenerating Body Oil.<br /><br />I love this product. I now use it after I shower and I can't believe I've not been using it before. It's the perfect cap for a shower. My skin is so soft and silky after I shower like never before. I wish it was a little more within  my budget though. I really truly like the luxurious experience and so if it were I would be purchasing more.\nLuxurious\nShower Cap for Women Reusable Long Hair Double Waterproof Large Shower Hair Hat Adjustable (11 inches, Black, Blue, Bowknot)\nWhaleLife\n{'Brand': 'WhaleLife', 'Material': 'Elastic', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Pattern': 'Solid', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Product Dimensions': '4.72 x 5.91 x 0.2 inches; 3.53 Ounces', 'UPC': '759263505202'}\nThis review is for Shower Cap for Women Reusable Long Hair.<br /><br />It's a beautiful very well made shower cap that's perfect for my needs.

I noticed a difference in the texture of my skin in just a few weeks, and it's non-irritating and completely moisturizing so it's been great for my dry sensitive skin.
