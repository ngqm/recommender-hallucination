There's a big black belt sewn inside that you use to adjust it to whatever size you want. It can be loose and comfortable if that's the way you adjust it and it won't slip off, even while you're sleeping, it's still the perfect fit. I have a million of these bonnets and they're now way too loose after minimal wear only because you can't adjust them the way you can this one.\nPerfect adjustable bonnet\nLA MAXIME chemical free, natural organic vegan best body oil after shower for glowing skin, anti-aging with vitamins A C E for wrinkle repair & soothing hydrating body oil for extremely dry aging, mature, sensitive atopic eczema skin conditions for women and men over 30 40 50 60 (3.4 fl oz)\nLA MAXIME\n{'Brand': 'LA MAXIME', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Active Ingredients': 'coconut oil,sunflower seed oil,vitamin a,watermelon', 'Unit Count': '3.40 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.94 x 2.24 x 2.13 inches; 10.58 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'HGRBO-100', 'UPC': '611138337502'}\nThis review is for LA MAXIME Heavenly Glow Regenerating Body Oil.<br /><br />I love this product.
