  "reference_summary": "Bath Pillow for Bathtub, Spa Pillows for Neck Head Shoulders Back Support, Thick Bath Tub Cushion with 6 Suction Cups Men Women Breathable Comfort 4D Air Mesh Quick Dry Headrest Bath Accessories\nAzun\n{'Brand': 'Azun', 'Material': 'Mesh', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '13 x 11 x 1 inches', 'Product Care Instructions': 'Hand Wash Only', 'Product Dimensions': '13 x 11 x 1 inches; 11.36 Ounces'}\nThis bath pillow is so soft and comfortable! It offers perfect neck support for true relaxation. I love that it has big suction cups that are durable and strong, it allows the pillow to stay in place and not float away like other neck pillows I've owned. I squeezed out the water and hung it in my shower until it stopped dripping all the access water, then I just hung in on my towel hooks to completely dry (it's lightweight and dried fast). This is the perfect bathtime accessory, I highly recommend it.\nPerfect for comfort and relaxation \ud83d\udec0\nPumice Stone for Feet, 2 in 1 Double Sided Hard Skin Callus Remover for Feet,Hands and Body, Exfoliator Pedicure File Block Callus Remover Scrubber (Pack of 4)\nKSang\n{'Brand': 'KSang', 'Material': 'Volcanic Stone', 'Is Electric': 'No', 'Item Form': 'Scrubber, Filer', 'Unit Count': '4.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '6 x 5.6 x 2.7 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'UPC': '192242957393'}\nPerfect duo! Each side has it's benefits. I like to start with the white side and finish with the color side for perfectly soft results.\nGreat 2 in 1 pumice stone\n24K Gold Under Eye Mask\u2013 20 Pairs- Under Eye Patches with Face Massager Roller, Anti-Aging Hyaluronic Acid Collagen Eye Masks for Dark Circles and Puffiness Dark Under Eyes Treatment\nFRLEDM\n{'Brand': 'FRLEDM', 'Special Feature': 'Anti Aging', 'Unit Count': '21.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '40', 'Package Dimensions': '7.5 x 7 x 1.5 inches; 11.99 Ounces', 'Batteries': '1 AA batteries required. (included)'}\nThese eye masks are great! They're individually wrapped (which I love). They actually stay put and are cool to the touch (which feels great under my tired eyes) I know many people like using them in the A.M. but I like using them before bedtime. I find that my eyes look refreshed upon waking, they hydrate the delicate area under my eyes. It also includes the pulse facial massager which actually feels nice (has even helped with minor headaches) and helps my night time fave serums to absorb nicely.\nIndividually wrapped pairs that are cool to the touch and hydrating.\nBEPHOLAN Natural Eyelash Growth Serum and Brow Enhancer to Grow Thicker, Longer Lashes for Long, Luscious Lashes and Eyebrows|10ML\nBEPHOLAN\n{'Package Dimensions': '5.94 x 1.18 x 1.06 inches; 0.88 Ounces'}\nI was initially impressed by the lightweight and sheerness of the product because it allows me to apply before eye makeup (which is rare to find, you usually have to use at night or without makeup because it can cause eye makeup to smudge). After consistent use, I've noticed my lashes look fuller and healthier. I've even begun applying the product to my eye brows. This product is easy to use and WORKS!\nEasy to use and actually works!\nPortable Electric Nail Drill,Professional Nail Drill Kit for Acrylic Gel Nails,Efile Nail Drill Manicure Polishing Shape Tools for Beginners Home Salon Use,Purple\nRomanda\n{'Brand': 'Romanda', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '7.17 x 3.15 x 1.77 inches', 'Item Weight': '310 Grams', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Product Dimensions': '7.17 x 3.15 x 1.77 inches; 10.93 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'C99', 'Manufacturer': 'Romanda'}\nThis electric nail drill/file is very durable and easy to use. I only wish the cord was a little longer. The drawstring bag (included) makes it easy to store. Overall, I'm very pleased with this kit and I recommend it.\nVery durable and easy to use \ud83d\udc85\nTINY BUDDHA Mindfulness Gift Set Includes Soothing Bath and Shower Gel, Relaxing Pillow Spray, Calming Essential Oil Roll-On, Lychee Flower Scented Candle and Daily Mindfulness Practice Guide\nTiny Buddha\n{'Brand': 'Tiny Buddha', 'Special Feature': 'Scented', 'Seasons': 'All Seasons', 'Item Volume': '1 Fluid Ounces', 'Unit Count': '12.00 Fl Oz', 'Package Dimensions': '8.35 x 8.07 x 2.52 inches; 1.45 Pounds', 'Manufacturer': 'KMI Brands'}\nThis is the perfect spa day/me time gift (either for self or someone else) it's carefully and beautifully packaged.
