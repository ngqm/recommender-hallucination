It offers perfect neck support for true relaxation. I love that it has big suction cups that are durable and strong, it allows the pillow to stay in place and not float away like other neck pillows I've owned. I squeezed out the water and hung it in my shower until it stopped dripping all the access water, then I just hung in on my towel hooks to completely dry (it's lightweight and dried fast). This is the perfect bathtime accessory, I highly recommend it.\nPerfect for comfort and relaxation \ud83d\udec0\nPumice Stone for Feet, 2 in 1 Double Sided Hard Skin Callus Remover for Feet,Hands and Body, Exfoliator Pedicure File Block Callus Remover Scrubber (Pack of 4)\nKSang\n{'Brand': 'KSang', 'Material': 'Volcanic Stone', 'Is Electric': 'No', 'Item Form': 'Scrubber, Filer', 'Unit Count': '4.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '6 x 5.6 x 2.7 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'UPC': '192242957393'}\nPerfect duo!
