They actually stay put and are cool to the touch (which feels great under my tired eyes) I know many people like using them in the A.M. but I like using them before bedtime. I find that my eyes look refreshed upon waking, they hydrate the delicate area under my eyes. It also includes the pulse facial massager which actually feels nice (has even helped with minor headaches) and helps my night time fave serums to absorb nicely.\nReview Title: Individually wrapped pairs that are cool to the touch and hydrating.\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
