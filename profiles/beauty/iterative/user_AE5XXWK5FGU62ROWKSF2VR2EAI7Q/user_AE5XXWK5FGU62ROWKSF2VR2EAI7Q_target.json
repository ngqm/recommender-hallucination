Or individual clear totes (so you can see inside). If you do that let them decorate it with stickers. It makes things more fun and takes the fear out of nail trimming for them.<br /><br />I suggest keeping them separate because if one kid gets a nail fungus, athletes foot, hand/foot/mouth then you\u2019re less likely to spread it by not sharing tools.<br /><br />Overall I\u2019m happy with these and would order this kit again.\nReview Title: Very good kids kit\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Mane Tame Deluxe Pomade 3.3oz/97mL - Firm Hold, Medium Shine - Made in USA, Water-Based, Combable, Rinses Out Easily, BARBER RECOMMENDED - Best used on dry hair\nMane Tame Professional Men's Grooming\n{'Hair Type': 'Dry', 'Liquid Volume': '118 Milliliters', 'Item Form': 'Clay', 'Brand': \"Mane Tame Professional Men's Grooming\", 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '3 x 3 x 2.5 inches; 5.6 Ounces', 'UPC': '851088008163'}\nI ordered this because I\u2019m tired of using big-box store hair gel.<br /><br />I miss using pomade style products and for the few dollars I used to save, 2020 has taught me to treat myself to the small luxuries in life.<br /><br />Overall, you get A LOT of product in this jar.<br />I like the texture and the hold.<br /><br />I spike up my hair a little and this worked well for that.<br /><br />My problem, and mind you it\u2019s MY problem not the product; is I personally don\u2019t like the smell. It\u2019s like a hairdresser perfume like scent. Very much like it\u2019s got some cologne mixed into it.<br /><br />You can smell the cologne through the shipping bag.<br /><br />Overall while I don\u2019t like the scent I absolutely appreciate the quantity provided. The value is definitely there.\nI don\u2019t like the scent but it works well\nBold Men, Mens Hair Gel\"Casual Hold\" 100ml, Mens Styling Gel\nBOLD MEN\n{'Hair Type': 'All, Dry, Curly, Thick, Thin', 'Material Type Free': 'Alcohol Free', 'Scent': 'Natural', 'Liquid Volume': '100 Milliliters', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Product Dimensions': '2.36 x 2.36 x 2.36 inches; 4.16 Ounces', 'Item model number': '793611800243', 'UPC': '793611800243'}\nI\u2019m sick of using big-box store tube gel and want to get back to using more boutique products.<br /><br />I opened this and was NOT expecting it to be clear.<br />It\u2019s a cross between a gel and pomade.<br /><br />I really like the smell. Something like fait sour patch kids.<br /><br />It holds well too, not greasy, not gooey etc.<br /><br />I\u2019m glad I ordered this to give it a try.\nSmells a little like sour patch kids, decent hold\nRose Quartz Roller with Derma Roller Kit, Microneedling Face Roller 0.25mm and Body Microneedle Roller 0.3mm\nLOLYSENTA\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.95 x 6.54 x 1.81 inches; 12.63 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'LS10', 'UPC': '019213737276', 'Manufacturer': 'Lolysenta'}\nI ordered this with the Mrs.<br />The roller for her and the derma rollers for me.<br /><br />She leaves hers in the fridge and absolutely loves it! It rolls smoothly and the cool treatment/light pressure are very therapeutic/ stress releasing.<br /><br />I tried it too and was surprised how good that felt.<br /><br />The derma rollers are nice. They roll smoothly and come sealed.<br /><br />Overall this is a great multi-use kit for the value. I definitely recommend it.\nRolls very smooth!\nBold Men, Beard Oil 30ml- Beard Oil, Conditioner and Softener, Natural Essential Oils of Cedarwood and Patchouli (Freshman)\nBOLD MEN\n{'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Scent': 'Fresh', 'Liquid Volume': '30 Milliliters', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Product Dimensions': '1.57 x 1.57 x 4.33 inches; 2.89 Ounces', 'UPC': '793611800649'}\nI ordered this because I\u2019m trying to walk away from box-box stores and start to support smaller business and their boutique brands.<br /><br />My wife HATES strong scents.<br />I\u2019m not a huge fan of strong cologne or coco/Shea butter scent or those that linger too strong like that (or with vanilla).<br /><br />This has a bit of a citrus/fresh scent. I REALLY like it.<br /><br />Mine arrived in a damaged box that looked like it was opened before. I\u2019m not sure if it was so I\u2019m not deducting a star. It might have just been crushed during shipping.<br /><br />Overall I\u2019m happy with this.\nI REALLY like this scent\nRose Quartz Roller with Derma Roller 0.25mm, Facial Kit with Microneedle and Pink Jade Rollers\nLOLYSENTA\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.1 x 5.1 x 1.6 inches; 8.78 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'LS17', 'UPC': '850002524062', 'Manufacturer': 'LOLYSENTA, LLC'}\nI ordered this to split with my wife.<br /><br />The roller is for her and the derma roller for me.<br /><br />She keeps her stone roller in the fridge and she really likes it. It rolls very smoothly without any pushing, pinching it tugging.<br /><br />I like the derma roller so far. I\u2019m testing it out as part of a stretch mark treatment.<br /><br />I like how everything arrived sterile packaged and sealed.<br /><br />I do recommend this kit.\nSterile packaging good value\nBold Men, Mens Hair Brush For Head and Beard, Thick and Thin Hair Types\nBOLD MEN\n{'Brand': 'BOLD MEN', 'Shape': 'Oblong', 'Handle Material': 'Wood', 'Product Benefits': 'Smoothing', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Product Dimensions': '2.36 x 2.36 x 1.97 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '793611800557'}\nI ordered this to replace an older beard brush I had.<br /><br />At first glance I thought it might be nice but there\u2019s some issues.<br /><br />The bristles are all different lengths so they aren\u2019t trimmed to actually be uniform (not a huge deal).<br /><br />They slapped the product label right on the wood. It doesn\u2019t come with any type of packaging. Plastic bag or anything.<br /><br />The big problem. The wood on mine is all split and cracking.<br /><br />I do not recommend this brush. It\u2019s not good for personal use or as a gift.\nVery cheaply made\nNail File and Buffers,TsMADDTs 14 Pack Professional Manicure Tools Set with 6PCS 100/180 Grit Nail Files Double Sided Emery Board 6PCS Nail Buffer Block 120 Grit Nail Scrubbing Brush Cuticle Knife\nTsMADDTs\n{'Package Dimensions': '9.96 x 5.39 x 1.02 inches; 3.77 Ounces', 'UPC': '616010018579', 'Manufacturer': 'TsMADDTs'}\nI ordered this for two kids who have a fear of getting their nails trimmed.<br /><br />The colors help make things more fun for them.<br /><br />It\u2019s made things much easier for us.<br /><br />My only suggestion is if you\u2019re going to split the pack for two different kids you should also get two different toiletry bags.
