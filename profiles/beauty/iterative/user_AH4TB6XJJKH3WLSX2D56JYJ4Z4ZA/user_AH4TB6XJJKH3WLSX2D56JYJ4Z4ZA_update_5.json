The consistency is a bit weird , you only need one coat but the bottles feel empty. They are very very light compared to other gel polishes around the same size. These do change colors but only with hot water and for a few seconds, after they go back to normal which i thought wasn't very fun. They are nice colors however, i just don't know if you get a good amount of products as the bottles are dark and feel almost empty. Regardless if you're into color changing polishes these do technically work.\nReview Title: Okay Gel Polishes\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I have yet to use polygel with them but they hold pretty good with a full cover nail on top of my natural nail. I definitely recommend these for beginners who struggle with dual forms.\nGreat clips for polygel\nUV LED Nail Lamp \u2013 128W Rapid-Curing Gel Nails Dryer for Manicures and Pedicures \u2013 Dual-Voltage with Extra-Long Cable, Multi-Language Manual \u2013 Professional Gel Lamp for Homes or Salons by OVLUX, Gold\nOVLUX\n{'Brand': 'OVLUX', 'Special Feature': 'Energy Efficient', 'Light Source Type': 'LED', 'Material': 'Gel', 'Connectivity Technology': 'USB', 'Package Dimensions': '9.4 x 8.3 x 4.3 inches; 1.55 Pounds', 'UPC': '765453999881'}\nThis nail lamp is stunning. I love the finish and the gold color. It has a nice weight to it, it does not feel cheap it works fantastically, and you can also take off the bottom if you'd like to use it for a pedicure. I definitely recommend this nail lamp it is not only great but beautiful as well.
