They are long and sturdy and they fit bigger nail beds. I compared them to other nail tips I have and these are bigger, i definitely recommend for people with bigger nail beds.\nLong and Sturdy\n20pcs Nail Tips Clips for Quick Building Polygel Nail Forms Nail Tips Clip for Finger Nail Extension DIY Manicure Nail Art Tool\ntiggell\n{'Size': '20 Count (Pack of 1)', 'Material': 'Plastic', 'Brand': 'Tiggell', 'Style': 'French', 'Coverage': 'Full Well Tips', 'Package Dimensions': '8.98 x 6.85 x 2.2 inches; 4.16 Ounces', 'UPC': '795853588163'}\nI LOVE working on polygel, however whenever i use dual forms they tend to pop up and it makes it hard to hold down while putting my finger into the lamp so i decided to try these out. I have yet to use polygel with them but they hold pretty good with a full cover nail on top of my natural nail. I definitely recommend these for beginners who struggle with dual forms.\nGreat clips for polygel\nUV LED Nail Lamp \u2013 128W Rapid-Curing Gel Nails Dryer for Manicures and Pedicures \u2013 Dual-Voltage with Extra-Long Cable, Multi-Language Manual \u2013 Professional Gel Lamp for Homes or Salons by OVLUX, Gold\nOVLUX\n{'Brand': 'OVLUX', 'Special Feature': 'Energy Efficient', 'Light Source Type': 'LED', 'Material': 'Gel', 'Connectivity Technology': 'USB', 'Package Dimensions': '9.4 x 8.3 x 4.3 inches; 1.55 Pounds', 'UPC': '765453999881'}\nThis nail lamp is stunning. I love the finish and the gold color. It has a nice weight to it, it does not feel cheap it works fantastically, and you can also take off the bottom if you'd like to use it for a pedicure. I definitely recommend this nail lamp it is not only great but beautiful as well. A definite eye catcher.\nThe beautifulest of them all\nYIZIJIZI 2 Pack Reusable Shower Cap, Large Shower Caps for women, Double Layer Waterproof Hair Caps for Long Thick Hair Bath Caps for Hair Care (pink & grey)\nYIZIJIZI\n{'Brand': 'YIZIJIZI', 'Material': 'Polyester', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '5.91 x 5.51 x 3.15 inches', 'Product Dimensions': '5.91 x 5.51 x 3.15 inches; 3.07 Ounces'}\nThese satin looking shower caps are very pretty. They feel nice and smooth look satin and they are also 100% water proof. They have 2 layers one being the satin looking material and the inside being plastic so water does not enter. It also came with 5 additional regular disposable shower caps to use under the cap for extra security. These caps are a must, they look super chic and you won't be spending money regularly on disposable ones, it's a win win.\nPretty and Functional\nColor Changing Gel Nail Polish Set Spring Summer Mood Nail Polish for Starter and Professional 6 Colors Pink Red Blue Yellow Purple Brown Manicure Kit for Valentine\u2019s Day Girlfriend Gift\nASKITO\n{'Brand': 'ASKITO', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'Gel', 'Special Feature': 'Long Lasting,Long-lasting', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '1.62 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '6', 'Liquid Volume': '0.27 Fluid Ounces'}\nThese gel polishes are okay. The consistency is a bit weird , you only need one coat but the bottles feel empty. They are very very light compared to other gel polishes around the same size. These do change colors but only with hot water and for a few seconds, after they go back to normal which i thought wasn't very fun. They are nice colors however, i just don't know if you get a good amount of products as the bottles are dark and feel almost empty. Regardless if you're into color changing polishes these do technically work.\nOkay Gel Polishes\nTweezers for Eyebrows, MORGLES 5PCS Tweezers for Women Precision Tweezers Set with Eyebrow Brush Leather Case for Eyebrow Ingrown Hair Removal\nMORGLES\n{'Package Dimensions': '6.73 x 4.06 x 0.75 inches; 7.83 Ounces', 'UPC': '616010018807', 'Manufacturer': 'MORGLES'}\nThese eyebrow tweezers are great. They are sharp, have a nice weight and work great. They pluck eyebrow hairs easily and grab even the smallest of hairs effortlessly. I really liked this set and will definitely recommend these for people who do their own eyebrows.\namazing tweezers\nCONBOLA Make Up Organizer 5 in 1 Dresser Organizer,Portable for Lipstick and Jewlry ,Makeup Organizer and Temporary Makeup Brush Holder,Multi-purpose for Girl Women.36.6cm18cm.(Blue)\nCONBOLA\n{'Material': 'Silicone', 'Special Feature': 'Portable', 'Color': 'Blue', 'Brand': 'CONBOLA', 'Mounting Type': 'Tabletop Mount', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Package Type': 'Standard Packaging', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '15.08 x 7.44 x 1.5 inches; 1.65 Pounds', 'UPC': '750226660013'}\nThis make up organizer is perfect for traveling or if you do not have much space for a bigger mirror.
