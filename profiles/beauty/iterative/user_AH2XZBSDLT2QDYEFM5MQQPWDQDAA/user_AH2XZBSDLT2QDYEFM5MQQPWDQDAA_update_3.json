Each individually wrapped sheet is about the size of a piece of standard copy paper. They hold up well through the whole wash. I personally don't care for the scent. I felt like I'd rubbed down with a pine tree car freshener, but that's just me. Words of caution.  It says good from nose to toes. It tastes nasty though, so beware when using it near your mouth. Ugh. I'll be keeping mine in my vehicle for unexpected spills and a messy four year old. This would be a great product for hikers with no access to water and a need to freshen up.\nReview Title: Works great for quick clean ups\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "JOYYUM 1000W 2-in-1 Hot Air Spin Brush Styler Auto-rotating Negative Ionic Hair Curler Dryer Brush, 1 1/2 Inch and 2 Inch Brush Attachments, Lavander Fog\nJOYYUM\n{'Brand': 'JOYYUM', 'Material': 'Titanium', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Special Feature': 'Comb, Portable, Massage, Hot', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Curling', 'Package Dimensions': '16.3 x 5.4 x 3.2 inches; 1.85 Pounds', 'UPC': '787414814279', 'Manufacturer': 'JOYYUM'}\nHard to rate this as it does not work with fine, layered hair. It has no clamp to hold hair in place so it just spins right out. Might work with longer, fine hair that is of one length.\nNot great with fine, layered hair\nJDO Eyelash Curler and 4D Silk Fiber Lash Mascara Value Set-Lash Curler with Refill Pads for No Pinching or Pulling, Mascara Natural Thickening- Long Lasting Waterproof & Smudge-Proof\nJDO\n{'Package Dimensions': '6 x 4 x 1 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nI double applied the mascara just to see a difference. There wasn't much between my natural lashes and the made up ones. I found that my lashes also clumped together. As far as waterproof? In this dismal time of masks I found that i sweat like crazy with it on. My regular mascara is not water proof and inevitability ended up on my upper cheeks. So I had high hopes for this. The odd thing kid I didn't see any mascara running down my face, but at the end if the day I had very little mascara left on my lashes. Hmm. So thus is my take. If you want a really nice lash curler, this would be a good choice. It comes with three additional pads for future use. The handle is held shut by a removable plastic piece. Why, I'm not sure. For packaging? At any rate it works very well. The mascara? I think of it as emergency makeup.\nLove the curler, meh on the mascara\nallez outdoor | Biodegradable Cleansing Cloths | Natural Plant-Based Face and Body Wipes | PH Balanced | Cactus Bloom and Chaparral Scent | 20ct Individually Wrapped Towelettes\nAllez\n{'Brand': 'Allez', 'Skin Type': 'Oily, Combination, Dry, Normal', 'Material Feature': 'Biodegradable Warning', 'Unit Count': '20.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '6.2 x 5.4 x 4.2 inches; 13.62 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'ABWPS001', 'UPC': '860000823210', 'Manufacturer': 'Allez Outdoor, LLC'}\nThese wipes are great for a quick wash up.
