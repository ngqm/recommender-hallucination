There wasn't much between my natural lashes and the made up ones. I found that my lashes also clumped together. As far as waterproof? In this dismal time of masks I found that i sweat like crazy with it on. My regular mascara is not water proof and inevitability ended up on my upper cheeks. So I had high hopes for this. The odd thing kid I didn't see any mascara running down my face, but at the end if the day I had very little mascara left on my lashes. Hmm. So thus is my take. If you want a really nice lash curler, this would be a good choice. It comes with three additional pads for future use. The handle is held shut by a removable plastic piece. Why, I'm not sure. For packaging? At any rate it works very well. The mascara? I think of it as emergency makeup.\nReview Title: Love the curler, meh on the mascara\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

It has no clamp to hold hair in place so it just spins right out.
