Too sticky for a dry shampoo that others said it was a family member of, no hold like a traditional hair spray. Into the trash it goes.

  "reference_summary": "JOYYUM 1000W 2-in-1 Hot Air Spin Brush Styler Auto-rotating Negative Ionic Hair Curler Dryer Brush, 1 1/2 Inch and 2 Inch Brush Attachments, Lavander Fog\nJOYYUM\n{'Brand': 'JOYYUM', 'Material': 'Titanium', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Special Feature': 'Comb, Portable, Massage, Hot', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Curling', 'Package Dimensions': '16.3 x 5.4 x 3.2 inches; 1.85 Pounds', 'UPC': '787414814279', 'Manufacturer': 'JOYYUM'}\nHard to rate this as it does not work with fine, layered hair. It has no clamp to hold hair in place so it just spins right out. Might work with longer, fine hair that is of one length.\nNot great with fine, layered hair\nJDO Eyelash Curler and 4D Silk Fiber Lash Mascara Value Set-Lash Curler with Refill Pads for No Pinching or Pulling, Mascara Natural Thickening- Long Lasting Waterproof & Smudge-Proof\nJDO\n{'Package Dimensions': '6 x 4 x 1 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nI double applied the mascara just to see a difference. There wasn't much between my natural lashes and the made up ones. I found that my lashes also clumped together. As far as waterproof? In this dismal time of masks I found that i sweat like crazy with it on. My regular mascara is not water proof and inevitability ended up on my upper cheeks. So I had high hopes for this. The odd thing kid I didn't see any mascara running down my face, but at the end if the day I had very little mascara left on my lashes. Hmm. So thus is my take. If you want a really nice lash curler, this would be a good choice. It comes with three additional pads for future use. The handle is held shut by a removable plastic piece. Why, I'm not sure. For packaging? At any rate it works very well. The mascara? I think of it as emergency makeup.\nLove the curler, meh on the mascara\nallez outdoor | Biodegradable Cleansing Cloths | Natural Plant-Based Face and Body Wipes | PH Balanced | Cactus Bloom and Chaparral Scent | 20ct Individually Wrapped Towelettes\nAllez\n{'Brand': 'Allez', 'Skin Type': 'Oily, Combination, Dry, Normal', 'Material Feature': 'Biodegradable Warning', 'Unit Count': '20.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '6.2 x 5.4 x 4.2 inches; 13.62 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'ABWPS001', 'UPC': '860000823210', 'Manufacturer': 'Allez Outdoor, LLC'}\nThese wipes are great for a quick wash up. Each individually wrapped sheet is about the size of a piece of standard copy paper. They hold up well through the whole wash. I personally don't care for the scent. I felt like I'd rubbed down with a pine tree car freshener, but that's just me. Words of caution.  It says good from nose to toes. It tastes nasty though, so beware when using it near your mouth. Ugh. I'll be keeping mine in my vehicle for unexpected spills and a messy four year old. This would be a great product for hikers with no access to water and a need to freshen up.\nWorks great for quick clean ups\n7pcs Pearl Hair Clips Large Hair Clips Pins Barrette Ties Hair Headwear Barrette for Party Wedding Daily, Gift for Girls and Women\nMEETWIN\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.5 x 3.5 x 0.2 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '723668014119'}\nThese barrettes are exactly as pictured, quite lovely. It should be noted that they are quite large, at least 3\" long, so not designed for little girls. Beautiful for teens or adults. Easy to use, look pretty well made.\nLovely, large barrettes\nPortable Travel Bottles Set,Leak Proof Squeezable Silicon Tubes Travel Size Toiletries Containers,TSA Approved Refillable Travel Accessories for Shampoo Liquids (1.3Oz,4 Pack)\nZAYOR\n{'Brand': 'ZAYOR', 'Material': 'Silicone', 'Capacity': '1.3 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '4', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '1.97 x 1.38 x 3.54 inches', 'Product Dimensions': '1.97 x 1.38 x 3.54 inches; 4.02 Ounces', 'UPC': '729993071100'}\nLove these!  I had purchased individual bottles of hand sanitizer long before Covid-19 became an issue, at a pretty dear price per ounce. When the sanitizers became scarce I actually made my own using aloe vera, alcohol and orange oil.  It turned out ok, but I lacked small bottles to divide it up.  I eventually found some 2 oz bottles, but they did not have these great carabiners to hook onto purses, backpacks, belts, etc.  These bottle are really well made, with a good thickness to them and easily loaded.  The sanitizer I have hooked to my purse now is actually in a little rubber \"holster\". I am constantly snagging it on things that make the bottle fall out. This product will take care of that problem, hands down. These would also be great for hiking/camping. Perfect size for hand soap, shampoo, etc, that can be hooked to a backpack and not weigh down the user.\nGreat multi use bottles\nOrganic Dry Shampoo Light - Dry Shampoo Travel Size, Hair Powder Dry Shampoo for Women and Men, Volumizing Powder for Hair and Texture Powder, Hair Volume Powder for Blonde Hair\nBeauty by Earth\n{'Brand': 'Beauty by Earth', 'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Unit Count': '1.5 Ounce', 'Package Dimensions': '5.5 x 1.3 x 1.3 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '850003968254'}\nI have tried many brands of dry shampoo, most I have liked.  This product was an adventure. First off, it is literally dry, not in an aerosol type of container.  You screw open the top (like and elmers glue bottle) and shake onto your head. Well. The little safety piece of cardboard was not attached to the bottle but stuck in the lid.  I did not know this until I tried to use it to no avail. And when you open the bottle be prepared for stuff to fly out. When I did get to the point I could use it, it turned out to be so light colored and obvious on my head I had to work it well into my hair, brush and shake my head so it was not such a glaring product. I will admit it did a great job in \"thickening\" my very fine hair, but it really needs to come in colors; blonde, brunette, etc. so it is not so obvious.  Will I buy it again? Probably not, but it will go into my travel bag for emergency use if I have the time to shake, rattle and roll my head.\nDecent product but has some issues\nBeautyGARDE MAGIC Charcoal Facial Cleanser - detoxifying and anti-pollution face cleanser, Nonie Creme\nBeautyGARDE\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.5 x 2.13 x 7.75 inches; 4.8 Ounces', 'Item model number': '1201', 'UPC': '856365007242'}\nMy son really liked this cleanser. He is a bearded fellow to sometimes cleansers can be problematic when trying to rinse out. This product works really well for him and his girlfriend. I have used many charcoal products and have always been pleased with the outcome. This cleanser is easy to use and leaves the skin feeling smooth and refreshed.\nworks well, a hit with my adult son\nMIRACLE Gold Straight Razor, Straight Edge Razor Non-Slip Sustainable Metal Handle, Black Cutthroat Barber Razor Holder, Disposable Straight Razor Blades Kit\nMiracle\n{'Brand': 'Miracle', 'Number of Blades': '1', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Handle Material': 'Stainless,Stainless Steel,Metal Handle,Aluminium,Metal,Steel', 'Color': 'Gold'}\nMy son tried this out on his beard to shape it up. It didn't work well on the beard part, but was okay in taking off the fine hairs on his cheeks. The whole set up is very flimsy, feels cheap with just a so so outcome after use. This might be good for anyone just starting to shave that might want to graduate to a straight edge down the road. Just don't expect professional results if you have an established beard you want to maintain. My son's beard is not particularly dense but enough so that this is a no go for him. Maintaining a light beard or the 5 oclock shadow look might be possible.\ndefinitely not professional tool\nBirthday Gift, Yachyee hair removal device\nYachyee\n[\"What's in Yachyee Relaxing Gifts for Women:\", '--- 12 oz Rose Gold insulated stainless steel tumbler with a reusable straw and cleaning brush, with the words \"\"Beauty begins the moment you love yourself\"\". --- Flower Petal Bath Bombs, drop them into the tub to relax among the delicate aromas of vanilla and lavender petals. --- Scented Candle, made of 100% soy wax, luxurious and all-natural, can immediately turn your space into a little serene and peaceful flower garden. --- Rose Bar Soap, made with natural flower essential oil to bring you to a dreamland of lavender cloud. --- Beautiful Key Bottle Opener and heart shape Wine Bottle Stopper --- Greeting Card, you can write your special blessing to her. \ud83c\udf88 DON\\'T FORGET TO SELECT \"\"THIS ORDER CONTAINS A GIFT\"\" AT CHECKOUT TO ADD YOUR FREE PERSONALIZED MESSAGE THROUGH AMAZON.\ud83c\udf88 50th 60th 40th birthday gifts for women 30th birthday gifts for her get well soon gift basket gifts for women gift basket for women self care gifts for women sister birthday gifts from sister']\n{'Item Form': 'Variety', 'Material Feature': 'Organic Ingredients, Vegan', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'Yachyee', 'Number of Items': '4', 'Product Dimensions': '7.7 x 6.8 x 3.5 inches; 12 Ounces', 'UPC': '697478889727', 'Manufacturer': 'Yachyee'}\nThis box has everything you or a best bud needs for some r & r at home.
