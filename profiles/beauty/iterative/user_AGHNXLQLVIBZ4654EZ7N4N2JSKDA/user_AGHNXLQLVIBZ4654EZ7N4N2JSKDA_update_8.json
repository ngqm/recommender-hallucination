I like to use this in the morning, as it's just the right amount of moisture to carry me through the day.<br /><br />This is unscented and doesn't irritate my skin at all. It's a little runny, so the hole it comes out of is a tad big and sometimes dispenses too much all at once, but now that I know that, it's not too hard to control.<br /><br />And not that it matters to some, but I think the packaging design is quite pretty.\nReview Title: Gentle, Unscented Moisturizer\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "24K Gold Under Eye Mask\u2013 20 Pairs- Under Eye Patches with Face Massager Roller, Anti-Aging Hyaluronic Acid Collagen Eye Masks for Dark Circles and Puffiness Dark Under Eyes Treatment\nFRLEDM\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.4 x 6.8 x 1.1 inches; 1.2 Pounds', 'Batteries': '1 AA batteries required. (included)', 'UPC': '616985543564', 'Manufacturer': 'FRLEDM'}\nI love using eye masks, so I got this, because there were 20 pairs in the box, which is a really good deal for the price. I also liked the ingredients listed. But after receiving this, I'm a little disappointed, because it says, \"Main Ingredients\" and it doesn't have a list of all the ingredients anywhere. So, I do wonder what else is in these.<br /><br />Saying that - these stay on well, didn't bother my skin left my eye area soft. So, yes, a list of ingredients would've been nice, but I like them anyway.<br /><br />As far as the vibrating facial massager wand - I didn't expect to use it, because I use stone rollers and stones on my face, but I can see this helping with lymphatic and sinus drainage, so I'll keep it on hand for that. It's actually a pretty nifty little gadget that takes a normal sized battery (and comes with it), so I kind of like it. :)\nGreat value for good eye masks.\nGIOVANNI Hemp Hydrating Hair Shine Spray, 4.3 oz. - Hemp Seed Oil, Aloe Vera, Frankincense Helps Stimulate Moisturize & Revitalize Damaged Hair, No Parabens, Color Safe, Lauryl & Laureth Sulfate Free\nGIOVANNI\n['GIOVANNI Hemp Hydrating Hair Shine Spray creates gloss that rocks, with a smooth surface that talks. This Mist will seal in any hairstyle, bridging the gap between natural and salon quality. GIOVANNI was the first full-range, salon-inspired hair-care brand in natural product stores, and today is the #1 selling Hair Care* lines in the United States Natural Products Industry. But before there was a brand, there was a pioneer. Arthur Guidotti had a vision and a love for all things hair. He began developing his passion as a hairstylist in Hollywood and Beverly Hills. By the 1960s, Arthur was maturing his talents and decided to open his own salon, called On Sunset. The salon was a bustling site, on the famous Sunset Strip, and a hit with many Hollywood celebrities, including Lucille Ball. Since 1979 the GIOVANNI Rule of Balance has been our commitment to make each product as pure and as natural as possible without sacrificing exceptional product performance. GIOVANNI is committed to creating only the highest-performance formulations, wrapped in aesthetically beautiful packaging and marketed with extraordinary visuals and graphics.*According to SPINs.']\n{'Product Benefits': 'Frizz Control, Shine', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Scent': 'Frankincense', 'Liquid Volume': '5.6 Fluid Ounces', 'Item Form': 'Spray', 'Product Dimensions': '2 x 2 x 4.75 inches; 5.6 Ounces', 'Item model number': '18640', 'UPC': '716237186409', 'Manufacturer': 'AmazonUs/GIOR7', 'Country of Origin': 'USA'}\nI have curly, dry, frizzy hair that needs lots of additional conditioning and is NEVER shiny. I'm always looking for products that add moisture, shine, and control to my hair.<br /><br />I use the GIOVANNI Mousse Air-Turbo Charged Hair Styling Foam and really like it, so I was excited to try another GIOVANNI product. I like spraying this Hemp Hydrating Hair Shine on my dry hair, and it really does add shine. I also love the scent. It smells yummy. I also like to comb it through my hair to put my hair back in a ponytail. It tames the frizz just a bit.<br /><br />The bottle did come with oil covering the outside, but it's been over 100 degrees here, so it might've just been affected by the heat in travel. It cleaned off fine (and it was inside a ziplock bag).\nMakes my hair shiny\n24 Inches Synthetic Long Curly Blonde Wig Natural Wavy Hair NONE Lace Heat Resistant Wigs for Women Cosplay Costume\nAILIWEI\n{'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '6.69 x 3.94 x 1.97 inches', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy, Curly', 'Special Feature': 'Heat Resistant', 'Brand': 'AILIWEI', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '6.69 x 3.94 x 1.97 inches; 9.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '710731915817'}\nI've been picking up things for our Halloween costumes (even if we will just be enjoying together at home), and this is one of the things I added to our costumes barrel.<br /><br />The wig went on well and was tried on by most members of my family. It is tight enough to keep the hairline from showing and stays put.<br /><br />The hair quality, itself, is great! I am no wig expert (can count on one hand the times I've worn one), but this seems like a nice wig.\nNice wig!\nPippa Of London Magic Star Eyeshadow\u00a0Powder Pencil,\u00a0Long Lasting,\u00a0Blendable\u00a0Eye Make Up Stick\nPippa Of London\n{'Color': 'Chalfont 303 \u2013 a shimmering shade of pearl', 'Brand': 'Pippa Of London', 'Item Form': 'Stick, Pencil, Powder', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.25 x 0.83 x 0.75 inches; 0.35 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Pippa of London', 'Country of Origin': 'United Kingdom'}\nI wasn't sure I would like an eyeshadow pencil with a different colors on each side. It just seemed like it would be difficult to get one without the other. But really, it's not too bad.<br /><br />The colors go on pretty well, even the lighter color does. They go on in a narrower line, of course, but then you can take your finger, or a brush, and spread it out to look more like an eyeshadow rather than a pencil. It's a little harder to apply under the eyes when you have a pencil design like this, but it's doable. (It is a powder, though, so it doesn't stay very well underneath the eyes.)<br /><br />Overall, pretty colors, interesting pencil design, and a good product that I can recommend.\nPretty colors that go on nicely.\nMagnesium Salt Bath Flakes | 8 lb Bulk Size | Body and Foot Soak | By Horbaach\nHorb\u00e4ach\n{'Brand': 'Horb\u00e4ach', 'Product Benefits': 'Relaxing', 'Unit Count': '128.0 Ounce', 'Item Weight': '8 Pounds', 'Variety': 'Bath Soak', 'Product Dimensions': '10 x 3 x 15 inches; 8 Pounds', 'UPC': '840050601426', 'Manufacturer': 'Horbaach'}\nI'm a bath taker and I always use either epsom salts or magnesium chloride flakes. You would think they'd all kind of be the same, but take it from me, they're not. Sometimes the salts are very difficult to dissolve and don't have the same feel. But these flakes are awesome! They dissolve easily and make the water feel so soft and lovely. I feel wonderful after bathing in these salts.<br /><br />The package was popped open when it arrived, but I taped it up and it's held fine. Sometimes that happens with heavy bags being thrown in flimsy boxes.<br /><br />The bag says to use 3 cups, but I usually do about 2, because I prefer having expensive magnesium chloride flakes last a little longer. Two cups is quite sufficient and is what is recommended with many other brands.\nDissolves well, works beautifully\nC'est Moi Vanilla Vibes Sugar Balm Body Scrub | Invigorating & Hydrating Exfoliant, Clinically Tested Non-Toxic Ingredients feat. Organic Shea Butter, Coconut Oil & Avocado Oil, EWG Verified, 6 oz\nC'est Moi\n{'Brand': \"C'est Moi\", 'Item Form': 'Balm', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating', 'Active Ingredients': 'Sugar', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '3.5 x 3.5 x 2 inches; 6 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'PR-COM-RT-X994317', 'UPC': '039897302607'}\nLet me start by saying that I love body scrubs that leave my skin softened rather than feeling like it's been scrubbed to death and stripped of all moisture. My favorite has been Kiehl's Creme de Corps Soy Milk & Honey Body Polish, and I haven't really found anything that I like as much as that. I wanted to try this because I like the brand C'est Moi, and also because this product comes in a handy jar, which makes it so easy to scoop out and apply to skin.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this product didn't live up to my expectations. It does have excellent exfoliators and feels like a good scrub for the skin all over my body, but the residue it leaves on my skin is icky. It's just too much - kind of feels like a coating of Crisco on my skin.<br /><br />Also, the scent is odd. It doesn't smell like vanilla. It smells like... well, it's hard to explain. It's just off, and I had an aversion to it.\nGreasy Residue and Scent is Odd\nMISS SPA Head to Toe Body and Facial Mask Set, Brighten Under-Eye, Deep Therapy Lip Mask, Moisturizing Foot Booties, Anti-Aging, Anti-Wrinkle, Skin Care for Women, 3-Pack\nMISS SPA\n{'Brand': 'MISS SPA', 'Product Benefits': 'Softening', 'Scent': 'Fresh', 'Skin Type': 'Dry,All Skin Types', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Product Dimensions': '3.07 x 0.24 x 4.33 inches; 2.15 Ounces', 'UPC': '838623303099'}\nFirst off, I really enjoyed the moisturizing foot booties. They were my favorite in this set. They were non-irritating and left my feet feeling super soft. (I put socks on immediately after so I wouldn't slip on my bamboo floors.)<br /><br />The eye gels were decent. I didn't see any visible results (like de-puffing) but they felt nice.<br /><br />The lip mask was unique! I didn't know lip masks existed. I panicked at first, feeling like I couldn't breathe, which is totally stupid, because I sit with my mouth closed all the time.  I guess the thought of not breathing through my mouth for 20 minutes sent me into a panic. ha! It didn't feel like it did much to soften my lips, however, so not sure I'd put myself through that panic again (just teasing).<br /><br />This is a cute set and would be a cute addition to a gift.\nDecent set of Masks\nYNN Y-Not-Natural Organic Kakadu Plum Extract Anti-Aging Moisturizer by Jillaroo \u2013 100g | Vitamins E, C, A | Fragrance Free Advanced Skin Care and Wrinkle Removal (Kakadu Plum)\u2026\nYNN Y-Not-Natural\n{'Brand': 'YNN Y-Not-Natural', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '3.5274 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Package Dimensions': '6.54 x 1.85 x 1.81 inches; 3.53 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Y-Not Natural Aust Pty Ltd'}\nThis is a lovely moisturizer that leaves me skin feeling soft and hydrated.
