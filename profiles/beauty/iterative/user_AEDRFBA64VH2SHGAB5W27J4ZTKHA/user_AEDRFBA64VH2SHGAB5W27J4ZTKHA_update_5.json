It has a nice minty smell that doesn't over power and leaves your beard and skin feeling soft and smelling good. Also,grab their conditioner. I recommend this to anyone with a beard. Notable upgrade from traditional soap or shampoo.\nGreat stuff for your beard.\nMr. Pristine Organic Beard Conditioner to Grow, Thicken, Moisturize and Protect Your Beard, 8.5 oz.\nMr. Pristine\n{'Brand': 'Mr. Pristine', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Hair Type': 'Dry', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '8.5 Fl Oz', 'Package Dimensions': '3.1 x 2.5 x 2.36 inches; 7.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '627843801825', 'Manufacturer': 'Mr. Pristine'}\nThis is a really nice conditioner specifically designed for your beard. I recommend starting with Mr.. Pristine's shampoo first. It has a nice minty smell that doesn't over power and leaves your beard and skin feeling soft and smelling good. I recommend this to anyone with a beard.\nHighly recommend. Buy their shampoo as well.\nHyaluronic Acid Serum for face - 11% Low molecules Anti-aging Hydrating Booster Serum 100% Pure Hyaluronic Acid\nMEAROSA DESIGN\n{'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'MEAROSA DESIGN', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Fl Oz', 'Product Dimensions': '1.77 x 1.77 x 3.94 inches; 4.3 Ounces', 'UPC': '628504326121'}\nI really like this hyaluronic acid serum. It absorbs easily and leaves your skin feeling moisturized and tight. I also like the pump as opposed to eye dropper for application. If you need a good serum at a good price, this is a great choice.\nHighly recommend.\nEASYDEW Repair Control Renewal Intensive Moisture 1.69 fl oz - Rapid Wrinkle Care with Human Epidermal Growth Factor I For Dry to Sensitive Skin I Nourishing & Instant Hydration with Ceramide NP\nEASYDEW\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.1 x 1.7 x 1.7 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nThis is a tough one for me. This moisturizer is reasonably lightweight and makes my skin look nice. However, it takes a long time for my skin to absorb fully. Maybe thats part of the repair function? Not sure. Anyway, as such, I recommend this lotion but, if you have the same experience,  make it a night time lotion. Let it work itself in while you sleep!\nGood but slow absorption.\nRose Quartz Roller with Derma Roller Kit, Microneedling Face Roller 0.25mm and Body Microneedle Roller 0.3mm\nLOLYSENTA\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.95 x 6.54 x 1.81 inches; 12.63 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'LS10', 'UPC': '019213737276', 'Manufacturer': 'Lolysenta'}\nGreat value kit.
