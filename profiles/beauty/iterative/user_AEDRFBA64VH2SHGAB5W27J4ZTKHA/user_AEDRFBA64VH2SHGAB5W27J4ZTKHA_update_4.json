This moisturizer is reasonably lightweight and makes my skin look nice. However, it takes a long time for my skin to absorb fully. Maybe thats part of the repair function? Not sure. Anyway, as such, I recommend this lotion but, if you have the same experience,  make it a night time lotion. Let it work itself in while you sleep!\nReview Title: Good but slow absorption.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
