It has a nice minty smell that doesn't over power and leaves your beard and skin feeling soft and smelling good. Also,grab their conditioner. I recommend this to anyone with a beard. Notable upgrade from traditional soap or shampoo.\nGreat stuff for your beard.\nMr. Pristine Organic Beard Conditioner to Grow, Thicken, Moisturize and Protect Your Beard, 8.5 oz.\nMr. Pristine\n{'Brand': 'Mr. Pristine', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Hair Type': 'Dry', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '8.5 Fl Oz', 'Package Dimensions': '3.1 x 2.5 x 2.36 inches; 7.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '627843801825', 'Manufacturer': 'Mr. Pristine'}\nThis is a really nice conditioner specifically designed for your beard. I recommend starting with Mr.. Pristine's shampoo first. It has a nice minty smell that doesn't over power and leaves your beard and skin feeling soft and smelling good. I recommend this to anyone with a beard.\nHighly recommend. Buy their shampoo as well.\nHyaluronic Acid Serum for face - 11% Low molecules Anti-aging Hydrating Booster Serum 100% Pure Hyaluronic Acid\nMEAROSA DESIGN\n{'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'MEAROSA DESIGN', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Fl Oz', 'Product Dimensions': '1.77 x 1.77 x 3.94 inches; 4.3 Ounces', 'UPC': '628504326121'}\nI really like this hyaluronic acid serum. It absorbs easily and leaves your skin feeling moisturized and tight. I also like the pump as opposed to eye dropper for application. If you need a good serum at a good price, this is a great choice.\nHighly recommend.\nEASYDEW Repair Control Renewal Intensive Moisture 1.69 fl oz - Rapid Wrinkle Care with Human Epidermal Growth Factor I For Dry to Sensitive Skin I Nourishing & Instant Hydration with Ceramide NP\nEASYDEW\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.1 x 1.7 x 1.7 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nThis is a tough one for me. This moisturizer is reasonably lightweight and makes my skin look nice. However, it takes a long time for my skin to absorb fully. Maybe thats part of the repair function? Not sure. Anyway, as such, I recommend this lotion but, if you have the same experience,  make it a night time lotion. Let it work itself in while you sleep!\nGood but slow absorption.\nRose Quartz Roller with Derma Roller Kit, Microneedling Face Roller 0.25mm and Body Microneedle Roller 0.3mm\nLOLYSENTA\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.95 x 6.54 x 1.81 inches; 12.63 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'LS10', 'UPC': '019213737276', 'Manufacturer': 'Lolysenta'}\nGreat value kit. My wife is a giant fan of micro needling and rollers. She found this kit to be on par or better than some of the more expensive kits she has used. Good buy.\nSolid value.\nSwiss Botany Pueraria Mirifica Breast Lifters for Women - Breast Enlargement Serum with Pure Pueraria Mirifica Oil for Breast Firming, Lifting and Fuller, Bigger Breast - Large 2oz Bottle\nSwiss Botany\n{'Product Dimensions': '2 x 3 x 4 inches; 2 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Swiss Botany'}\nSo, this is nice and moisturizing but, for $60, I assume you are paying for some perkiness too.
