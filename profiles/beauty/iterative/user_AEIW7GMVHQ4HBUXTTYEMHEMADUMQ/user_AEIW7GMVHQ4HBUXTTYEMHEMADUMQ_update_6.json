My eyes appear blue or green depending on what I'm wearing, and this shadow makes the green in my eyes much deeper and more apparent.<br /><br />I've tried applying it lightly with a finger and it makes a nice translucent color that way that enhances without taking over. With a brush, I put it along my lashes like eyeliner and it came out very nice. If I apply it twice, it's appropriate for nighttime wear.<br /><br />I wear contacts so it's important to me that eye shadow stays where I put it and doesn't flake into my eyes. This shadow passes that test perfectly, so I'll be getting a pale highlighting shade to go with this one. I'm very happy with this product.\nReview Title: Pleasing Color\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Manicure and Pedicure Nail Clipper from POWERGROOMING - Powerful Trimmer for Thick and Thin Finger Nails and Toe Nails - Included Nail File and\"Catcher\" for Easy Cleanup (1 Pack)\nPOWERGROOMING\n{'Brand': 'POWERGROOMING', 'Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Blade Edge': 'Straight', 'Blade Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Target Audience': 'Women, Men', 'Package Dimensions': '3.8 x 1.3 x 1 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'UPC': '653233212735', 'Manufacturer': 'POWERGROOMING'}\nThis clipper is heavy-duty and sharp. It's rather thick, so it's best for people who let their nails get past their toes before trimming them; if your nail is fairly short already, it's hard to get it between the nail and your skin.<br /><br />It works especially well for my husband who tends to let his nails go because they're so hard to cut. No more. These clippers are up to tough nails and they cut them easily.<br /><br />The clippers come with a small case that also includes a petite nail file. Recommended for tough jobs.\nGreat for Tough Nails\nBloomy Essentials Top 3 Organic Essential Oils Starter Set 10 mL (1/3 oz) - USDA Certified Organic - 100% Pure Lavender, Lemon and Peppermint\nBloomy Essentials\n{'Brand': 'Bloomy Essentials', 'Scent': 'Lemon,Peppermint,Lavender', 'Special Feature': 'Pure', 'Seasons': 'All Seasons', 'Item Volume': '10 Milliliters', 'Package Dimensions': '3.8 x 3.6 x 1.2 inches; 6.38 Ounces', 'UPC': '680912084567', 'Manufacturer': 'Bloomy Essentials'}\nThis set of three essential oils is very useful. The oils are certified organic and never tested on animals. The quality seems very high and the oils smell wonderful.  The perfectly packaged set would make a great gift for someone beginning with essential oils or for an old hand since it contains three of the most commonly used oils.<br /><br />Personally, I don't use oils medicinally unless you count the calming benefits of lavender in your mister. I use them either in a mister or atomizer or as a dot of fragrance on my wrist. Essential oils don't cause headaches or change their scent when I wear them.<br /><br />The kit includes lavender, lemon, and peppermint. All three smell absolutely wonderful, whether you use them in a mister or add a drop to your washer's rinse cycle. I always add a drop or two to loads containing our bedding. It's delightful.<br /><br />I would definitely buy Bloomy's brand again. I'm very impressed with the fragrance and quality.\nLovely Essential Oils\nHair Clipper Beard Trimmer Kit for Men,Cordless Hair Trimmer Mustache Trimmer Body Groomer Trimmer for Nose Ear Facial Hair with LED Display USB Rechargeable 5 In 1\n8sanlione\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '6.5 x 1.77 x 1.18 inches; 1.12 Pounds'}\nThis trimmer is fantastic! It's quiet and powerful and has a precision dial that lets you precisely set the trim length from very short to relatively long. With this tool, you won't need to change out removable trim guides for the lengths you want - and if you're like my guy, that also means you won't lose them constantly.<br /><br />This razor feels great in the hand and it glides without pulling on hair - that's worth five stars all by itself. It came fully charged, and it only takes about 90 minutes to completely recharge it. The big LCD readout lets you know how much power is left - it's very convenient.<br /><br />It comes with a beard trimmer, nose and ear hair trimmer, precision trimmer, body groomer, hair trimmer, guide comb, cleaning brush, comb, charging cord, stand, and a traveling bag. There's also an excellent user manual.<br /><br />One added feature that's really appreciated is that you can lock it so it won't turn on accidentally in the travel bag or suitcase.\nFive Stars Plus!\n35.4 Inch Extra Long Silicone Back Scrubber for Shower, 2021 Updated Lengthen Back Scrubber Brush for Men and Women, Exfoliating Back Washer with Wall Hooks, Easy Clean, Comfortable Massage (Green 27.5in)\nMAORULU\n{'Package Dimensions': '8.75 x 5.5 x 2.6 inches; 6.38 Ounces', 'UPC': '757173533773', 'Manufacturer': 'MAORULU'}\nIf brushes irritate your skin when you scrub your back, this silicone back scrubber may be just right for you.  The scrubber has myriads of tiny silicone bristles on one side and varying-sized bumps on the other.  Use it right and you can give your back and neck a nice massage. Add soap to the bristles and get really clean.<br /><br />This set would make a nice gift. It includes four adhesive (but removable) hooks, the scrubber and a foam bath sponge.<br /><br />Personally,  I was hoping for a more vigorous scrub and will probably stick to my scrubbing brush for my back. But I do like using this gentle scrubber on my legs.\nExtremely Gentle Scrubber\nLemon Oil Towelettes - 20 Count\nHerban Essentials\n[\"The Essential Oil Towelettes from Herban Essentials combines clean hands with soothing scents. Our travel hand wipes work to keep your hands clean and skin soft. They also work as face cleansing wipes, face cloths, body wipes for adults bathing, and body wipes for men when you are traveling and cannot stop to take a shower. If you need a midday refresher, use one of our citrus moisture towelettes for an energizing pick-me-up! Our collection includes lemon wipes, facial wipes cleansing cloths, a natural towelette, and men's wipes.\"]\n{'Brand': 'Herban Essentials', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '7 x 1 x 6 inches; 5.29 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Herban Essentials', 'Country of Origin': 'USA'}\nThese are far too expensive to use for everyday wipes, but as a treat, or for a super-dirty job, I absolutely love them. (With these, fried chicken at a picnic wouldn't be too messy.) Yesterday, after a couple hours of gardening in the hot sun, I used one sturdy wipe (they're about 8\"X5\") on my face, neck, chest, arms, and hands, as a very refreshing clean-up.<br /><br />These are nothing but essential oil and water, no chemicals, so your skin won't be dried out or irritated.  I absolutely adore them and will keep some in my handbag and car from now on.\nA Lemony Treat\nHynt Beauty Perfetto Pressed Eye Shadow Singles (Khaki Star)\nHynt Beauty\n{'Brand': 'Hynt Beauty', 'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '3.23 x 2.6 x 0.63 inches; 0.32 Ounces'}\nI don't wear much eye makeup, but the olive-colored Khaki Star really appealed to me.
