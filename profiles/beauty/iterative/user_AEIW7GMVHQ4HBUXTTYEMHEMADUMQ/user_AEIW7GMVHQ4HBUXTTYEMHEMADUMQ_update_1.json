It's rather thick, so it's best for people who let their nails get past their toes before trimming them; if your nail is fairly short already, it's hard to get it between the nail and your skin.<br /><br />It works especially well for my husband who tends to let his nails go because they're so hard to cut. No more. These clippers are up to tough nails and they cut them easily.<br /><br />The clippers come with a small case that also includes a petite nail file. Recommended for tough jobs.\nReview Title: Great for Tough Nails\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
