The oils are certified organic and never tested on animals. The quality seems very high and the oils smell wonderful.  The perfectly packaged set would make a great gift for someone beginning with essential oils or for an old hand since it contains three of the most commonly used oils.<br /><br />Personally, I don't use oils medicinally unless you count the calming benefits of lavender in your mister. I use them either in a mister or atomizer or as a dot of fragrance on my wrist. Essential oils don't cause headaches or change their scent when I wear them.<br /><br />The kit includes lavender, lemon, and peppermint. All three smell absolutely wonderful, whether you use them in a mister or add a drop to your washer's rinse cycle. I always add a drop or two to loads containing our bedding. It's delightful.<br /><br />I would definitely buy Bloomy's brand again. I'm very impressed with the fragrance and quality.\nReview Title: Lovely Essential Oils\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Manicure and Pedicure Nail Clipper from POWERGROOMING - Powerful Trimmer for Thick and Thin Finger Nails and Toe Nails - Included Nail File and\"Catcher\" for Easy Cleanup (1 Pack)\nPOWERGROOMING\n{'Brand': 'POWERGROOMING', 'Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Blade Edge': 'Straight', 'Blade Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Target Audience': 'Women, Men', 'Package Dimensions': '3.8 x 1.3 x 1 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'UPC': '653233212735', 'Manufacturer': 'POWERGROOMING'}\nThis clipper is heavy-duty and sharp. It's rather thick, so it's best for people who let their nails get past their toes before trimming them; if your nail is fairly short already, it's hard to get it between the nail and your skin.<br /><br />It works especially well for my husband who tends to let his nails go because they're so hard to cut. No more. These clippers are up to tough nails and they cut them easily.<br /><br />The clippers come with a small case that also includes a petite nail file. Recommended for tough jobs.\nGreat for Tough Nails\nBloomy Essentials Top 3 Organic Essential Oils Starter Set 10 mL (1/3 oz) - USDA Certified Organic - 100% Pure Lavender, Lemon and Peppermint\nBloomy Essentials\n{'Brand': 'Bloomy Essentials', 'Scent': 'Lemon,Peppermint,Lavender', 'Special Feature': 'Pure', 'Seasons': 'All Seasons', 'Item Volume': '10 Milliliters', 'Package Dimensions': '3.8 x 3.6 x 1.2 inches; 6.38 Ounces', 'UPC': '680912084567', 'Manufacturer': 'Bloomy Essentials'}\nThis set of three essential oils is very useful.
