It dispenses from the tube as a gray color, but the formula contains encapsulated pigments that change color on contact with skin. After applying this to my face, the cream takes on a beige shade that blends well with my skin tone. At first, I thought it would be too orange for my fair skin, but the color really does adjust itself. This CC cream provides light coverage. I use a moisturizer under this because it does make my face feel a little dry.\nReview Title: Blends to match medium to fair skin tones.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Mountain Falls Regular Nail Polish Remover for Natural Nails, with Vitamin E and Panthenol, 6 Fluid Ounce\nMountain Falls\n[\"Don't wait for your next spa day to treat yourself. Mountain Falls Regular Nail Polish Remover has been carefully formulated to quickly and gently care for your nails. The salon quality formula softens cuticles and contains Vitamin E.

It quickly and completely removes nail polish from fingernails and toenails. It\u2019s nice that they included vitamin E and panthenol in the formula. However, I always wash my hands and feet after using nail polish remover, so I don\u2019t think the added panthenol and vitamin E stay on long enough to provide any significant benefits. This product works well enough to deserve 5 stars, but I detracted a star because of the retail cost. There are more affordable nail polish removers that work just as well as this does. The additions of panthenol and vitamin E do not justify the high retail price.\nWorks quickly and effectively, but is overpriced.\nRevitalizing N.M.F Intensive Hydrating Serum that treats Dull, Tired, Dry and Sensitive Skin from Manilla Natural Skincare\nManilla Natural Skincare\n{'Skin Type': 'mature', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydration', 'Brand': 'Manilla Natural Skincare', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Hydrating,Wrinkles', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.38 x 1.38 x 3.54 inches; 3.99 Ounces'}\nThis serum comes in a thick glass bottle and a convenient dropper that makes it easy to apply. The color looks cloudy so I shake it up before each use. It has a thin and watery gel-like texture that is easy to spread evenly over my face. It absorbs quickly into my skin and does not feel sticky nor uncomfortable. It has a sweet scent that is not overpowering. This serum makes my skin looking and feeling smoother than before.\nAbsorbs quickly and improves the look and feel of skin\u2019s surface.\nDr. Au Anti-Aging Face Oil Retinol Serum by Au Natural Skinfood - Promotes Youthful, Glowing Skin | Collagen Boosting Wrinkle Repair | No Oily Residue - Just Soft to the Touch Skin | Day & Night Moisturizing treatment for Men and Women\nA\u00da NATURAL SKINFOOD\n{'Brand': 'A\u00da NATURAL SKINFOOD', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Type': 'Oily', 'Item Volume': '4 Fluid Ounces', 'Product Dimensions': '0.9 x 0.9 x 3.8 inches; 1.59 Ounces'}\nThis face oil makes my skin feel smooth and soft. It applies easily and does not feel too heavy nor greasy. This softens the appearance of the lines on my forehead and around my mouth, making them less pronounced. This has a very light and pleasant scent.\nHydrating face oil for soft and smooth skin.\nFRESHME Mud Mask - Facial Mask Kaolinite Clay Masks Cleansing and Moisturizing Brightening Smoothing Face Mask, 3.4 fl oz\nFRESHME\n{'Brand': 'FRESHME', 'Item Form': 'Clay', 'Product Benefits': 'Moisturizing', 'Skin Type': 'Acne Prone', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Package Dimensions': '5.87 x 1.89 x 1.85 inches; 4.9 Ounces'}\nThis is unlike any clay mask that I have ever used before. This product is water based and does not dry on my skin like most clay masks do. After I apply this to my face and leave it on for about 15 minutes, it still feels moist and slick when I go to rinse it off. The texture of this mask is more gel-like than it is clay. It feels lightweight and does not leave my skin feeling too dry and tight. This mask is effective enough for use during the winter, when my skin tends to be more dry. The product packaging looks attractive, but I wonder if they intentionally misspelled the word \u201cmoisturizing\u201d as \u201cmoistorizing\u201d.\nWater based mask that does not dry on skin.\nEASYDEW Starter Moist Whip Foam 5.07 fl oz - Non-Drying, Gentle & Purifying Foaming Cleanser with Ceramide I Exfoliating Daily Face Wash that Removes Dirts and Makeup\nEASYDEW\n{'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Skin Type': 'All, Oily to combination skin, Normal to dry skin, Sensitive to acne-prone skin', 'Brand': 'EASYDEW', 'Scent': 'Light floral', 'Material Feature': 'Cruelty Free', 'Product Dimensions': '2.28 x 1.81 x 7.01 inches; 6.74 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Cosmax'}\nThis is one of my favorite facial cleansers. I love how this lathers into a rich and creamy foam. This does an excellent job of cleaning my skin. It completely removes makeup, including mascara. This cleanser leaves my skin looking clean and feeling soft and smooth.\nLuxuriously creamy lather that cleans and removes makeup.\nBalance White Mud Balancing Mask by Au Natural Skinfood | Rotorua Exfoliating Mask with 16+ Manuka Honey | Certified | Food For Your Skin | All Skin Types | Made in New Zealand | 1.7 oz\nA\u00da NATURAL SKINFOOD\n{'Brand': 'A\u00da NATURAL SKINFOOD', 'Item Form': 'Mask', 'Product Benefits': 'Exfoliates,Hydrates,Exfoliating', 'Scent': 'Honey', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Product Dimensions': '9.65 x 6.1 x 1.77 inches; 1.7 Ounces'}\nDespite the high price for such a small amount of product you get, this mud mask really does work wonders for my skin. This mask is easy to apply. After spreading this over my entire face, I leave it on for 30 minutes before wiping it off with a wet washcloth. This mask leaves my skin feeling baby soft.\nExpensive, but effectively softens skin.\nHuxley Secret of Sahara Clay Mask Balanced Blend 4.23 fl. oz. | Korean Clay Mask to Refine Pores and Absorb Excess Oil and Sebum | Made with Moroccan Rhassoul Clay\nHuxley\n{'Brand': 'Huxley', 'Item Form': 'Clay', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Special Feature': 'Hypoallergenic', 'Unit Count': '4.23 Fl Oz', 'Product Dimensions': '2.68 x 2.68 x 6.97 inches; 6.38 Ounces'}\nThis clay mask is nice because it is sheer enough so that it doesn\u2019t harden and become too stiff and uncomfortable. It is lightly scented with a clean fragrance that smells pleasant when applying this to my face. The directions state to leave on for 5-10 minutes, and then to rinse it off before it is completely dry. I have noticed that if I do leave this mask on long enough for it to completely dry, it develops an unpleasant scent that smells like sulfur  when I go to remove it.\nWorks best when removed before it completely dries.\nILOJE Capsule CC Cream Comfortable Care SPF48 PA++ 1 pack\nILOJE\n{'Brand': 'ILOJE', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '1.01 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '1.89 x 0.98 x 4.53 inches; 1.69 Ounces'}\nI use this CC cream as my foundation makeup on days when I want to quickly and effortlessly enhance my complexion and blur imperfections.
