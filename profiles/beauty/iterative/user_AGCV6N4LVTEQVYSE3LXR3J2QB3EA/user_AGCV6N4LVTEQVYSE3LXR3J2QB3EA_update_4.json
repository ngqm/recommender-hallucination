This product is water based and does not dry on my skin like most clay masks do. After I apply this to my face and leave it on for about 15 minutes, it still feels moist and slick when I go to rinse it off. The texture of this mask is more gel-like than it is clay. It feels lightweight and does not leave my skin feeling too dry and tight. This mask is effective enough for use during the winter, when my skin tends to be more dry. The product packaging looks attractive, but I wonder if they intentionally misspelled the word \u201cmoisturizing\u201d as \u201cmoistorizing\u201d.\nReview Title: Water based mask that does not dry on skin.\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

It quickly and completely removes nail polish from fingernails and toenails. It\u2019s nice that they included vitamin E and panthenol in the formula. However, I always wash my hands and feet after using nail polish remover, so I don\u2019t think the added panthenol and vitamin E stay on long enough to provide any significant benefits. This product works well enough to deserve 5 stars, but I detracted a star because of the retail cost. There are more affordable nail polish removers that work just as well as this does. The additions of panthenol and vitamin E do not justify the high retail price.\nWorks quickly and effectively, but is overpriced.\nRevitalizing N.M.F Intensive Hydrating Serum that treats Dull, Tired, Dry and Sensitive Skin from Manilla Natural Skincare\nManilla Natural Skincare\n{'Skin Type': 'mature', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydration', 'Brand': 'Manilla Natural Skincare', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Hydrating,Wrinkles', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.38 x 1.38 x 3.54 inches; 3.99 Ounces'}\nThis serum comes in a thick glass bottle and a convenient dropper that makes it easy to apply.
