It quickly and completely removes nail polish from fingernails and toenails. It\u2019s nice that they included vitamin E and panthenol in the formula. However, I always wash my hands and feet after using nail polish remover, so I don\u2019t think the added panthenol and vitamin E stay on long enough to provide any significant benefits. This product works well enough to deserve 5 stars, but I detracted a star because of the retail cost. There are more affordable nail polish removers that work just as well as this does. The additions of panthenol and vitamin E do not justify the high retail price.\nWorks quickly and effectively, but is overpriced.\nRevitalizing N.M.F Intensive Hydrating Serum that treats Dull, Tired, Dry and Sensitive Skin from Manilla Natural Skincare\nManilla Natural Skincare\n{'Skin Type': 'mature', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydration', 'Brand': 'Manilla Natural Skincare', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Hydrating,Wrinkles', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.38 x 1.38 x 3.54 inches; 3.99 Ounces'}\nThis serum comes in a thick glass bottle and a convenient dropper that makes it easy to apply.
