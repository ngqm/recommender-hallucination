It is abrasive and it has a scent that is so distinct and it sticks with you for hours and hours after you have washed your hands. I loathe hospital soap.<br /><br />These little soap sheets are simply amazing. Not only do they pack light - I can stick one little tin in my bag and it takes up almost no space at all, but the sheets themselves are tiny. The sheets dissolve nearly instantly in water, lather perfectly and the smell so nice. They are like a little bathroom oasis at the doctor or hospital. The scent does not linger though, so please do not be worried about smelling like ylang ylang for hours on end.<br /><br />My hands always feel clean when I leave the bathroom and I have even used a sheet to wet a paper towel and wipe my face off.\nReview Title: A Lovely Change From Hospital Soap\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "BFWood\nBFWood\n{'Brand': 'BFWood', 'Shape': 'Oblong', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Hair Type': 'All, Dry, Curly, Thick', 'Material': 'Nylon', 'Package Dimensions': '9.92 x 9.45 x 1.85 inches; 5.08 Ounces'}\nAs most of us are in quarantine and not currently getting regular hair maintenance, having weird hair right now is just normal. I am growing out a pixie cut, not by choice, but by mandate of the State of Michigan. I have experienced a number of difficult hair transitions during this stay home, stay safe period, all of which I hope to never experience again. Currently, my hair is just too short to tuck behind my ear, so it is constantly falling in my face, but thankfully, I am past the super trendy mullet stage.<br /><br />When I had my pixie cut for seven years I washed my hair and dried it with a towel and went on with my life. No comb, no brush, no anything. It was really nice. Now that I actually have hair that tangles and needs attention I require tools. I have a brush with tight bristles that I like, but it pulls. I use leave in conditioner gel that seems to help, but I still pull a lot of hair. I have a very inexpensive comb that does absolutely nothing and I should probably just recycle it.<br /><br />This specific comb and brush set is definitely not the fanciest around. The comb has some heft to it and it does a good job getting my part straight. The brush is very stiff compared to my other brush, but it does not pull all my hair out when it hits a tangle. I also like that this brush doesn't mash my hair down. I have thinner hair and this brush doesn't make me look like I have thin hair.<br /><br />I don't use any styling products or tools, so I am not hard on my brush. I think this brush will hold up just fine in my hands, but I think if I person were using it with lots of accessories and products it might be a placeholder for a more expensive brush.\nDecent Brush For Thin Short Hair\nFolora 4pcs Premium 1 Inch Wide Solid Color Floral Plaid Headband Set for Women Girls, Green\nFolora\n{'Material': 'Plastic', 'Brand': 'Folora', 'Unit Count': '4.00 Count', 'Product Dimensions': '4.72 x 0.98 x 5.51 inches; 3.53 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'FLR-HB-4pcs Green'}\nWhen the covid pandemic hit I had a very short pixie cut, which gradually turned into a mullet because I was unable to get a haircut. I am a creature of habit and I have been getting my hair cut by the same person every fourth Saturday at 9 am for the past seven years. I do not like change. A lot of things happened at the same time. The person who cut my hair moved away, covid shut down our world and my hair continued to grow. I was a mess. I tried using stretchy elastic headbands and found those stayed in place for about fifteen seconds. I successfully used felt backed headbands, but as my hair has grown longer I've found the hair in the back does not cooperate as nicely and the back of the band slips up constantly.<br /><br />I decided to try these bands only because I am now desperate. They work. Huzzah.<br /><br />I will say that I wish they were a little wider and in black, but I know they are meant to appeal to women and girls who want to accessorize and not to people like me who have on more than one occasion stated \"my favorite color is gray\". These headbands stay in place. I have been wearing the plain green one for about six hours in the kitchen, around our two dogs and doing laundry and it has not moved. Also, it does not pinch behind my ears, which I completely anticipated being a problem I would need to deal with, but I was wrong. I have noticed the felt backing has already started to come unglued, which means I am going to need to get the glue gun out and fix it. These are not headbands that are made to last for years. The price does reflect that fact.\nA Stay Put Headband That Works With Short Hair\nFacial Skincare,Cucumber Essence Hydrating Moisturizing Revitalizing Hydration Fruit Extract Deep Cleaning Facial Skincare Sheet for All Skin Type Care, 35ml/1.18oz, Pack of 5\nPalNour\n{}\nI liked these masks and although I did have some issues with the 'essence' and absorption, I did not have any allergic reactions. I have been using masks to combat skin issues I have been having from wearing medical masks. So far this mask has been one of my favorites.<br /><br />- Extremely hydrating and cooling.<br />-Made my skin very soft and smooth for a couple days afterwards.<br />-Easy to use.<br />-Large enough to cover my entire face.<br />-Enough balm to cover my face, neck and probably my entire body.<br />-Mask did become invisible when I had it on. Not that this is super important, but my husband does a mask that makes him look like a robber and it was just an interesting observation.<br /><br />-Has an insane amount of the cucumber balm - so much extra that I needed to wipe it off before I could actually rub it in after I took the mask off.<br />-The balm took forever to dry after I took the mask off. It was not bad, but my face did feel sticky for hours afterwards and I woke up with a tacky face in the middle of the night. Seriously, it was a lot of cucumber. I had to change my pillow case in the morning.\nA Very Balmy, But All Around Good Face Mask\nKOMOREBI 235PCS Temporary Tattoos 24 Sheets Body Stickers for Woman and Girls,Size Small Waterproof Fake Tattoos, Butterflies Style Body Art L5.9''xW4.1'' Tattoo for Party\nFxtiaa\n{'Brand': 'Fxtiaa', 'Size': '24 Count (Pack of 1)', 'Water Resistance Level': 'Waterproof', 'Pattern': 'Floral', 'Number of Pieces': '24', 'Package Dimensions': '7.09 x 4.21 x 0.35 inches; 2.61 Ounces', 'UPC': '783214150326'}\nThese tattoos are fun. There is a ton to pick from and each butterfly is just a little different. They are easy to apply and the sheets they come on are not gigantic so cutting them out is not a huge chore.<br /><br />Application is easy - take off the clear backing, press on skin, wet with a damp cloth for 30 seconds, remove paper.<br /><br />These are the perfect size for a child's party or to give away as a prize.<br /><br />They don't last an infinitely long time, which I'm sure parents would be grateful of.<br /><br />The butterflies that show a shadow clearly in the description do not transfer that way in real life. Those tattoos look more like the butterfly is smudged and not 3D. If this is important to you I would simply cut the shadow part off because it truly does look like a smudge.\nFun Pack of Butterfly Tattoos\nNu-Pore Facial Sheet Mask Packaged Holiday Shippable Gift Set Aloe Vera Pomegranate Hibiscus Green Tea Lavender Cucumber 12 K-Beauty Sheets Perfect for Home Spa Treatment gifts Made in South Korea\nnu-pore\n{'Brand': 'nu-pore', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Product Benefits': 'Soothing,Anti-aging', 'Scent': 'Pomegranate,Lavender', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '9.69 x 6.89 x 1.93 inches; 15.52 Ounces'}\nFirst, these are your typical sheet masks. They have normal directions - wash your face, apply, wait 15 to 20 minutes, remove. Simple.<br /><br />These masks are however a little different in that they come packaged in a lovely little box, wrapped in tissue paper and would be the perfect gift to send someone. There are 12 masks, including two panda masks(!)<br /><br />I like that there are a couple of each mask which will make it possible for both my husband and I to do a mask together.<br /><br />We already did the panda mask and the scent was not overpowering. There is a lot of liquid for the skin to absorb in each packet and we did notice some dripping. This was solved by simply wiping the extra off with a washcloth. We did not rub in all the extra to our faces because it would not have been possible. The masks did not improve our faces to the point where we were amazed, but they were cooling while they were on and it was a fun Saturday, movie night thing to do.\nA Nice Pack - Would Make A Great Gift\nKneipp Body Lotion (Lavender)\n{'Brand': 'Kneipp', 'Scent': 'Lavender', 'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Active Ingredients': 'lavender,vitamin a', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '5.2 x 2.72 x 13.7 inches; 7.05 Ounces'}\nI am sort of a lavender lotion expert. I love the stuff. Most lotions that have lavender either smell like nothing or smell like an entire shop of flowers. Those lotions that do get the scent right usually are full of chemicals.<br /><br />I had never heard of Kneipp before but I really like it. This lotion is not thin, but if you are used to a thick cream it will seem thinner. It does take a little work to absorb, but it is worth it. The scent is not overpowering and I think it does not linger, but is just right.<br /><br />One complaint I do have is that the bottle had no safety seal. For $18 I would think the tube would come with a seal on the top. I was not sure if the bottle had already been used and returned. I just decided to go ahead and be brave and I'm still alive. Kneipp needs to add a seal on their tubes.<br /><br />This is not a sticky or overwhelming lotion and does not leave your skin feeling greasy. Sometimes paying a little more for a product that really works is worth it and this is one of those times.\nA Real Lavender Lotion That Works\nOrganic Self Tanner for Face and Body - Streak Free Sunless Tanner - Self Tanning Lotion with Manuka Honey and Aloe Vera - Fake Tan for Fair to Medium Skin - Indoor Tanning Lotion with Bronzer (8oz)\nDermaChange\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '8 x 3 x 2 inches; 8 Ounces', 'UPC': '860004819929'}\nAs a 42 year old woman with shockingly pale skin I thought it would be interesting to try a sunless tanner. When I was younger I used Jergens sunless tanner and unless I was extremely careful and diligent I ended up orange, streaked or some combination of the two. I did not have high hopes for this sunless tanner, so I started with a small area on one leg.<br /><br />First, this lotion does not have any real scent straight out of the bottle, but it does have a smell that develops once it is on the skin. It is not unpleasant and maybe the scent is dependent on the person, but it is there. Second, it is easy to apply. The first application I only put a tiny amount on my right leg and then immediately washed my hands. I let it dry for about one minute and then got dressed. Simple. Third, it takes a bit for color to appear. I started to tan in about 12 hours and by the next morning I was noticeably browner.<br /><br />The second application I put on both my legs just like normal lotion. I tried paying attention to my knees and ankles, but honestly, I did not really. I washed my hands immediately, but must have brushed my forearm. I let everything dry for about one minute and then got dressed. The next morning I was tan and had a streak of brown on my arm.<br /><br />I like this stuff. It is easy to use and the color lasts. My super pale skin accepts the color and I don't look nearly as translucent.\nEasy To Use And Effective\nTirtyl Hand Soap Sheet Variety Pack - 240 Pack with Portable Storage Tin - Camping/Outdoor/Travel/Handbag - Lavender & Aloe - Bergamot & Ylang Ylang - Jasmine & Patchouli\nTirtyl\n{'Brand': 'Tirtyl', 'Scent': 'Bergamot,Lavender,Jasmine', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Unit Count': '240.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '9.88 x 6.26 x 0.75 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nWe do not get out a lot, but I do go to a lot of doctors' appointments and hospitals and there is nothing I hate more than hospital soap.
