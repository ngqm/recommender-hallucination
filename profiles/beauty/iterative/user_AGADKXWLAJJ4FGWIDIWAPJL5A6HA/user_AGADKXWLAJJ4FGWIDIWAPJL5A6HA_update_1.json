I am growing out a pixie cut, not by choice, but by mandate of the State of Michigan. I have experienced a number of difficult hair transitions during this stay home, stay safe period, all of which I hope to never experience again. Currently, my hair is just too short to tuck behind my ear, so it is constantly falling in my face, but thankfully, I am past the super trendy mullet stage.<br /><br />When I had my pixie cut for seven years I washed my hair and dried it with a towel and went on with my life. No comb, no brush, no anything. It was really nice. Now that I actually have hair that tangles and needs attention I require tools. I have a brush with tight bristles that I like, but it pulls. I use leave in conditioner gel that seems to help, but I still pull a lot of hair. I have a very inexpensive comb that does absolutely nothing and I should probably just recycle it.<br /><br />This specific comb and brush set is definitely not the fanciest around. The comb has some heft to it and it does a good job getting my part straight. The brush is very stiff compared to my other brush, but it does not pull all my hair out when it hits a tangle. I also like that this brush doesn't mash my hair down. I have thinner hair and this brush doesn't make me look like I have thin hair.<br /><br />I don't use any styling products or tools, so I am not hard on my brush. I think this brush will hold up just fine in my hands, but I think if I person were using it with lots of accessories and products it might be a placeholder for a more expensive brush.\nReview Title: Decent Brush For Thin Short Hair\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
