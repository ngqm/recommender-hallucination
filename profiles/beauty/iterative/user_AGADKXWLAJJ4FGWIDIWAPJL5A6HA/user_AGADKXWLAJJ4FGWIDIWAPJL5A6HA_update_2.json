I am a creature of habit and I have been getting my hair cut by the same person every fourth Saturday at 9 am for the past seven years. I do not like change. A lot of things happened at the same time. The person who cut my hair moved away, covid shut down our world and my hair continued to grow. I was a mess. I tried using stretchy elastic headbands and found those stayed in place for about fifteen seconds. I successfully used felt backed headbands, but as my hair has grown longer I've found the hair in the back does not cooperate as nicely and the back of the band slips up constantly.<br /><br />I decided to try these bands only because I am now desperate. They work. Huzzah.<br /><br />I will say that I wish they were a little wider and in black, but I know they are meant to appeal to women and girls who want to accessorize and not to people like me who have on more than one occasion stated \"my favorite color is gray\". These headbands stay in place. I have been wearing the plain green one for about six hours in the kitchen, around our two dogs and doing laundry and it has not moved. Also, it does not pinch behind my ears, which I completely anticipated being a problem I would need to deal with, but I was wrong. I have noticed the felt backing has already started to come unglued, which means I am going to need to get the glue gun out and fix it. These are not headbands that are made to last for years. The price does reflect that fact.\nReview Title: A Stay Put Headband That Works With Short Hair\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I am growing out a pixie cut, not by choice, but by mandate of the State of Michigan. I have experienced a number of difficult hair transitions during this stay home, stay safe period, all of which I hope to never experience again. Currently, my hair is just too short to tuck behind my ear, so it is constantly falling in my face, but thankfully, I am past the super trendy mullet stage.<br /><br />When I had my pixie cut for seven years I washed my hair and dried it with a towel and went on with my life. No comb, no brush, no anything. It was really nice. Now that I actually have hair that tangles and needs attention I require tools. I have a brush with tight bristles that I like, but it pulls. I use leave in conditioner gel that seems to help, but I still pull a lot of hair. I have a very inexpensive comb that does absolutely nothing and I should probably just recycle it.<br /><br />This specific comb and brush set is definitely not the fanciest around. The comb has some heft to it and it does a good job getting my part straight. The brush is very stiff compared to my other brush, but it does not pull all my hair out when it hits a tangle. I also like that this brush doesn't mash my hair down. I have thinner hair and this brush doesn't make me look like I have thin hair.<br /><br />I don't use any styling products or tools, so I am not hard on my brush. I think this brush will hold up just fine in my hands, but I think if I person were using it with lots of accessories and products it might be a placeholder for a more expensive brush.\nDecent Brush For Thin Short Hair\nFolora 4pcs Premium 1 Inch Wide Solid Color Floral Plaid Headband Set for Women Girls, Green\nFolora\n{'Material': 'Plastic', 'Brand': 'Folora', 'Unit Count': '4.00 Count', 'Product Dimensions': '4.72 x 0.98 x 5.51 inches; 3.53 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'FLR-HB-4pcs Green'}\nWhen the covid pandemic hit I had a very short pixie cut, which gradually turned into a mullet because I was unable to get a haircut.
