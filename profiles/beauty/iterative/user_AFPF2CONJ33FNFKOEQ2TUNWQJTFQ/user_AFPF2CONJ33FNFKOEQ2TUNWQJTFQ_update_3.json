After giving birth, I made a witch hazel spray for healing, I made a tea tree toner to soothe skin during breakouts, and I made a room spray with lavender and eucalyptus to keep in the room with the diaper changers. It's great that this comes in a set of three and that the sprayers put out a fine mist rather than a thick set of droplets. I also really like the cobalt blue color. Though I received a sample for review, the positive opinion is my own.\nReview Title: What you see is what you get, a great set for essential oil fans\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Not so with this brand. This brand has the natural scent of the real deal, and is effective to boot. I have a baby, so have been washing my hands about 10 times a day, every time I change his diaper. Between that and all of the diaper wipes I use, my hands have been starting to peel and crack, so I knew I needed a solution.<br /><br />This argan oil came with a regular lid, an eyedropper, and a pump dispenser. I used the pump dispenser and set it right next to my faucet so I could get a quick pump of oil every time I wash my hands. Well, it only took a couple of days to experience really great results. My hands feel normal again, and I am so relieved. From hard skin that was rough and crackled, to soft, happy hands again.<br /><br />I have also used the product on my split ends, and here, I\u2019d like to caution you that only a few drops are needed. It is very effective and soaks and well, so you only need a very small amount.<br /><br />Overall, this argan oil is one of the best I have found. It comes packaged beautifully and looks like a gift, has multiple options for how you dispense it, and is pure, organic, and has the mild scent of real argan oil, unlike some competitors.\nA fantastic product at a fantastic price\nOZNaturals Facial Mask - This Moisturizing Face Mask Contains Rosehip Oil, Pro Vitamin B5 & Amino Acids - This Anti Aging Mask Deeply Hydrates Dry Skin For A Healthy Youthful Glow!\nAuperwel\n[\"POWERHOUSE FORMULATION includes Rosehip Oil Pro-Vitamin B5 Amino Acid Complex and an Herbal Blend that deeply nourishes and refreshes aging skin like no other face mask on the market;MOISTURIZING FACE MASK gives effective hydration to dry dull skin \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\\xa0Natural and active ingredients including hyaluronic acid and Vitamin E leave skin hydrated radiant and more youthful looking;USING THE HIGHEST concentration of natural and active ingredients possible Never compromising on quality and performance Our goal is to give you beautiful skin in eco-friendly ways Fragrance-free;DEEPLY HYDRATING facial mask delivers moisture directly to the skin and helps calm dry skin irritation \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\\xa0Gentle enough for use every day it will become your favorite weapon against dry skin;Satisfaction Guaranteed Unconditional 30-Day Return And Refund Policy Ensures You'll Be Delighted Or Your Money Back Developed By Renowned Aesthetician Angela Irish - For All Skin Types\"]\n{'Brand': 'Auperwel', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating', 'Scent': 'Unscented', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2 x 2 x 1 inches; 4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'GN-15Q6-JVWK', 'UPC': '616806598469', 'Manufacturer': 'Oz Naturals'}\nI had previously been using Lush's Mask of Magnaminty and had really been enjoying it, however I think I was ready for a little bit more of a &#34;grown-up&#34; facial mask to help reduce the appearance of some of the fine lines I have developed in the year since having my son.<br /><br />I have gotten to use this facemask twice and have been super impressed with the results. I am also using the retinol facial moisturizer as well as an ocean mineral toner and cleanser from this brand, and while I was seeing great results from the other products, this mask really supercharged the results. I look like I have had a full nights sleep, which I can assure you I have not! It plumped up some of my wrinkles and just gave my face that dewy fresh appearance that I remember having in my 20s.<br /><br />I received samples of these products to test, but I can't argue with the results. I will certainly be purchasing more from this line.\nGreat when used with the retinol face moisturizer from this brand\nMoYo Natural Labs 8 oz Spray Bottles Fine Mist Empty Travel Containers, BPA Free PET Plastic for Essential Oils and Liquids/Cosmetics (Pack of 2, Blue)\nMoYo Natural Labs\n['MoYo Natural Labs SPRAY BOTTLE 8 OZ HDPE plastic designated by a recyclable does not contain BPA.
