It feels relatively unisex, and doesn't leave a lot of fragrance lingering behind after you rinse it out. I followed up with a peppermint conditioner from the natural food store, and really enjoyed the lovely cooling summer pick me up for my hair.<br /><br />The shampoo is not overly stripping, but definitely leans more towards really getting things clean rather than being overly moisturizing. I found that I could use it about three times a week on my long hair, and then needed to do co-washing or something more moisturizing in between. I really like the shampoo and appreciate having something more herbal like this in my regimen.\nReview Title: Invigorating and fragrant\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Not so with this brand. This brand has the natural scent of the real deal, and is effective to boot. I have a baby, so have been washing my hands about 10 times a day, every time I change his diaper. Between that and all of the diaper wipes I use, my hands have been starting to peel and crack, so I knew I needed a solution.<br /><br />This argan oil came with a regular lid, an eyedropper, and a pump dispenser. I used the pump dispenser and set it right next to my faucet so I could get a quick pump of oil every time I wash my hands. Well, it only took a couple of days to experience really great results. My hands feel normal again, and I am so relieved. From hard skin that was rough and crackled, to soft, happy hands again.<br /><br />I have also used the product on my split ends, and here, I\u2019d like to caution you that only a few drops are needed. It is very effective and soaks and well, so you only need a very small amount.<br /><br />Overall, this argan oil is one of the best I have found. It comes packaged beautifully and looks like a gift, has multiple options for how you dispense it, and is pure, organic, and has the mild scent of real argan oil, unlike some competitors.\nA fantastic product at a fantastic price\nOZNaturals Facial Mask - This Moisturizing Face Mask Contains Rosehip Oil, Pro Vitamin B5 & Amino Acids - This Anti Aging Mask Deeply Hydrates Dry Skin For A Healthy Youthful Glow!\nAuperwel\n[\"POWERHOUSE FORMULATION includes Rosehip Oil Pro-Vitamin B5 Amino Acid Complex and an Herbal Blend that deeply nourishes and refreshes aging skin like no other face mask on the market;MOISTURIZING FACE MASK gives effective hydration to dry dull skin \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\\xa0Natural and active ingredients including hyaluronic acid and Vitamin E leave skin hydrated radiant and more youthful looking;USING THE HIGHEST concentration of natural and active ingredients possible Never compromising on quality and performance Our goal is to give you beautiful skin in eco-friendly ways Fragrance-free;DEEPLY HYDRATING facial mask delivers moisture directly to the skin and helps calm dry skin irritation \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\\xa0Gentle enough for use every day it will become your favorite weapon against dry skin;Satisfaction Guaranteed Unconditional 30-Day Return And Refund Policy Ensures You'll Be Delighted Or Your Money Back Developed By Renowned Aesthetician Angela Irish - For All Skin Types\"]\n{'Brand': 'Auperwel', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating', 'Scent': 'Unscented', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2 x 2 x 1 inches; 4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'GN-15Q6-JVWK', 'UPC': '616806598469', 'Manufacturer': 'Oz Naturals'}\nI had previously been using Lush's Mask of Magnaminty and had really been enjoying it, however I think I was ready for a little bit more of a &#34;grown-up&#34; facial mask to help reduce the appearance of some of the fine lines I have developed in the year since having my son.<br /><br />I have gotten to use this facemask twice and have been super impressed with the results. I am also using the retinol facial moisturizer as well as an ocean mineral toner and cleanser from this brand, and while I was seeing great results from the other products, this mask really supercharged the results. I look like I have had a full nights sleep, which I can assure you I have not! It plumped up some of my wrinkles and just gave my face that dewy fresh appearance that I remember having in my 20s.<br /><br />I received samples of these products to test, but I can't argue with the results. I will certainly be purchasing more from this line.\nGreat when used with the retinol face moisturizer from this brand\nMoYo Natural Labs 8 oz Spray Bottles Fine Mist Empty Travel Containers, BPA Free PET Plastic for Essential Oils and Liquids/Cosmetics (Pack of 2, Blue)\nMoYo Natural Labs\n['MoYo Natural Labs SPRAY BOTTLE 8 OZ HDPE plastic designated by a recyclable does not contain BPA.

After giving birth, I made a witch hazel spray for healing, I made a tea tree toner to soothe skin during breakouts, and I made a room spray with lavender and eucalyptus to keep in the room with the diaper changers. It's great that this comes in a set of three and that the sprayers put out a fine mist rather than a thick set of droplets. I also really like the cobalt blue color. Though I received a sample for review, the positive opinion is my own.\nWhat you see is what you get, a great set for essential oil fans\n[Old Version] QuickBooks Desktop Pro 2019 with Enhanced Payroll [PC Disc]\nIntuit\n[\"Get your finances in order with the QuickBooks Desktop Pro 2019 with Enhanced Payroll (PC Disc).

I began by backing up my QuickBooks desktop Pro 2018, and then began the installation process. It went smoothly and quickly and didn't take very long. I used the express installation which was recommended, and the whole thing was very easily done, retaining all of my previous settings and information.<br /><br />The part that was awful was that I have an existing payroll subscription and had to call into tech-support to upgrade that portion of things. Luckily I was aware of this so when simply entering the information into QuickBooks didn't work, I knew that I was in for a phone call. About 45 minutes later of being on hold and trying to be up sold on QuickBooks online by an Indian tech-support person (hey guys, I just got desktop Pro 2019 upgraded, please don't sell me on QuickBooks online), I was good to go.<br /><br />I think it's absolutely offensive that after you've purchased a software product like this they make you call in as a matter of course to activate. Anybody using this product is either being paid by the hour or runs a business and does not have that kind of spare time to sit around wasting on a process that should be 30 seconds of data entry.<br /><br />I have multiple employees and so end up paying an additional 4 to 8 dollars per month for the subscription to add additional employees. It's another two dollars a month per employee after the first one. Also, be aware that the setting is set to subscribe you to an annual payroll subscription, which if done through QuickBooks will cost you about $420. Purchasing the new upgrade of desktop Pro 2019 with the payroll for a year costs less than that, so being automatically billed such a high amount for just the payroll is offensive and ridiculous.<br /><br />I would really like QuickBooks as a company to reconsider how they deal with their payroll subscriptions and activation of payroll that has already been purchased, because this is a huge problem that is been garnering them poor reviews and lots of bad press for some time. I personally have considered many times changing to a more congenial company just to avoid this particular dance every single year. Do I pay $420 to avoid being on the phone for 45 minutes with somebody from India who act like I've done something terribly wrong by purchasing my payroll upgrade on Amazon along with the software upgrade? Or do I do as I have done most years and purchase the yearly upgrade that comes with the enhanced payroll.<br /><br />As an FYI, the enhanced payroll really does make it very easy to run your quarterly reports and do your e-filing. I did it myself for many years, but now hand the file back and forth to my bookkeeper via email as a portable file.\nDesktop Pro 2019 works great; upgrading an existing payroll subscription is awful\nC.O.

I was really impressed that after only a few days of use, my sides of my fingers of already healed. I didn't expect anything like that, and while I usually prefer to use hand lotions that are scented in some exciting fashion, I am partial to smelling of cupcakes or essential oils, I'm happy to have this simple work horse of a hand cream if it's going to do such a great job.\nSuper moisturizing unscented hand cream\nSHANGPREE Eye Mask (30 pair\uff5c60 masks), under eye patches, Premium Korean Skin Care (Coral Calming)\nSHANGPREE SPA CARE SYSTEM\n{'Brand': 'SHANGPREE SPA CARE SYSTEM', 'Product Benefits': 'Moisture,Smooth', 'Scent': 'Liquorice', 'Special Feature': 'Non Toxic', 'Unit Count': '60.00 Count', 'Product Dimensions': '3.31 x 3.31 x 1.61 inches; 2.96 Ounces'}\nI shouldn't be surprised, since this brand has an incredibly good reputation for providing a high-end and effective experience, but I was indeed surprised by just how much I love these effective and cooling little gel eye masks. I have tried a number of gel eye masks in the past and found them reasonably pleasant, but this one actually left my skin around my eyes notably moisturized and looking younger for the rest of the day after use.<br /><br />I just put these on in the morning right after my shower and did the rest of my facial and hair care routine, got dressed and by the time I was ready to greet my day, I took off the eye masks and moisturized, and the moisture that the eye masks held in actually seemed to take hold and reduce the fine lines that I usually have around my eyes from lack of sleep and having small children and a business to manage.<br /><br />The fragrance is very light and unobtrusive, and the experience of using these is very luxurious. I have tried other eye masks that did not fit very well around my eye area, but these were shaped very nicely.\nBlows away the other I masks I've tried\nSenvenski Color Changing Gel Nail Polish Purple Blue Glitter Fall Autumn Halloween Christmas Kit Chameleon Soak Off UV LED Temperature Art Manicure Kit Varnish (WB020)\nsenvenski\n{'Brand': 'Senvenski', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Material Feature': 'Natural, Cruelty Free, Non-Tox', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Number of Pieces': '4', 'Liquid Volume': '7.3 Milliliters', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '5.51 x 3.94 x 0.59 inches', 'Item Weight': '0.05 Kilograms', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '5.51 x 3.94 x 0.59 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '613635848659'}\nThe color change works well. The colors themselves though are very translucent. The sparkles are large and sparse, but good quality that somehow doesn't feel rough.<br /><br />It cured up well and had decent durability. Overall I'm happy with the quality.
