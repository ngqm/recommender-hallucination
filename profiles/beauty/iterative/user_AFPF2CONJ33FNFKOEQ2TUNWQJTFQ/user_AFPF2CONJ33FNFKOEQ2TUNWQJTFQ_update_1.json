Not so with this brand. This brand has the natural scent of the real deal, and is effective to boot. I have a baby, so have been washing my hands about 10 times a day, every time I change his diaper. Between that and all of the diaper wipes I use, my hands have been starting to peel and crack, so I knew I needed a solution.<br /><br />This argan oil came with a regular lid, an eyedropper, and a pump dispenser. I used the pump dispenser and set it right next to my faucet so I could get a quick pump of oil every time I wash my hands. Well, it only took a couple of days to experience really great results. My hands feel normal again, and I am so relieved. From hard skin that was rough and crackled, to soft, happy hands again.<br /><br />I have also used the product on my split ends, and here, I\u2019d like to caution you that only a few drops are needed. It is very effective and soaks and well, so you only need a very small amount.<br /><br />Overall, this argan oil is one of the best I have found. It comes packaged beautifully and looks like a gift, has multiple options for how you dispense it, and is pure, organic, and has the mild scent of real argan oil, unlike some competitors.\nReview Title: A fantastic product at a fantastic price\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
