It was slightly bigger than some, but you can easily fold over to fit. Holes for eyes and mouth were perfect size, and fits well over the nose! No unpleasant fragrance and lots of essence. The best part is that it doesn't leave your skin feeling even 1% sticky after taking it off! Great quantity for the price as well...definitely recommend!\nReview Title: One of the best!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Eyebrow Stencils & Eyebrow Pencil, 10 Styles of Eyebrow Shaper, Reusable Eyebrow Template with Dark Brown Dual-Ended Pencil & Eyebrow Razor, 3 Minutes Makeup, Suitable For All Face Shape\nVIAMAZ\n{'Brand': 'VIAMAZ', 'Item Form': 'Pencil', 'Finish Type': 'Natural', 'Special Feature': 'Reusable', 'Material Feature': 'Reusable, Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '6.61 x 1.97 x 0.75 inches; 1.13 Ounces'}\nI don't wear makeup often, and since this was something new to me I wanted to try it out. I like the variety of stencils included. It was easy to position and hold one in place. The problem was with the pencil...every time you try to color your eyebrow, the tip just rolls back into the tube after each pass over, making it annoying to have to keep holding the stencil with one hand while constantly twisting the color back out of the applicator with the other! Will probably end up giving these to my daughter, she has more patience than I do!\nNot bad, but not great either!\nCell Fusion C Low pH pHarrier Mask*10sheets | Intensive weak acid care for all skin types, Korean Face Mask\nCell Fusion C\n{'Item Weight': '200 Grams', 'Unit Count': '10.00 Count', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '2.36 x 2.36 x 3.94 inches', 'Brand': 'Cell Fusion C', 'Item Volume': '250 Milliliters', 'Product Dimensions': '2.36 x 2.36 x 3.94 inches; 7.05 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'RLE22305'}\nThis is one of the best masks I've used in a while!
