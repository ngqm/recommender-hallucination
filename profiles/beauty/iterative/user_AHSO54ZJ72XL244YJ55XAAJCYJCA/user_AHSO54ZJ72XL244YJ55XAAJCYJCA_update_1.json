It helps remove his loose hair and he seems to enjoy it when I brush him. I like that I can push a button and it pushes the hair to the ends of the bristles so that I can easily remove the hair. It doesn't get all of the hair, but it is a lot more effective than a normal brush. Overall,  I'm really happy with this brush and would get one like it again.\nReview Title: Nice!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
