With the push of a button,  I'm able to push the hair to the end of the bristles for easy removal. The handle fits comfortably in my hand and my dog seems to enjoy the feel of being brushed. The brush doesn't get completely hair free, but it does seem to be much cleaner than if I had to pick the hair off on my own. I feel like this brush is a great value and would get it again.\nReview Title: Very nice\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

It helps remove his loose hair and he seems to enjoy it when I brush him. I like that I can push a button and it pushes the hair to the ends of the bristles so that I can easily remove the hair. It doesn't get all of the hair, but it is a lot more effective than a normal brush. Overall,  I'm really happy with this brush and would get one like it again.\nNice!\nAOA Studio Collection Makeup Sponge Set Makeup Blender Latex Free and High-definition Set of 5 Makeup Blender For Powder Cream and Liquid, Super Soft Wonder Blender Beauty Cosmetic Beveled\nAOA STUDIO\n{'Brand': 'AOA STUDIO', 'Color': 'Ivory', 'Material': 'Rubber', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Makeup', 'Package Dimensions': '6.85 x 5.39 x 1.97 inches; 1.45 Ounces', 'UPC': '850022931338'}\nI like these blenders. They help blend my foundation much better than cotton pads or by just using my fingers. I prefer wearing make-up to look more natural, so I appreciate that these blenders help me put on my make-up so that lines, etc aren't noticeable. They seem to clean well, and I am enjoying using them as part of my daily routine.\nGreat\n(YOUMIDI) Brush and Cat Brush-Smooth combing brush for short and long hair-Pet shedding combing brush, which can remove loose hair, mats, tangles (Blue)\nyoumidi\n{'Brand': 'youmidi', 'Color': 'Blue', 'Shape': 'Oblong', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '10.59 x 5.04 x 2.44 inches; 0.32 Ounces', 'Item model number': '021', 'UPC': '768647685676'}\nThis is a great self-cleaning brush.
