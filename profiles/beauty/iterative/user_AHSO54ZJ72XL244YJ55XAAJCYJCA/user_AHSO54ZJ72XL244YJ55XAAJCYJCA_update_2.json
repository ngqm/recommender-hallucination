They help blend my foundation much better than cotton pads or by just using my fingers. I prefer wearing make-up to look more natural, so I appreciate that these blenders help me put on my make-up so that lines, etc aren't noticeable. They seem to clean well, and I am enjoying using them as part of my daily routine.\nReview Title: Great\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Dog & Cat Brush, Self Cleaning Slicker Brush for Pet Grooming Brush, Euyona Bee Pet Brush, Cat shedding Brush Gently Removes Loose Undercoat, Mats Tangled Hair Slicker brush for Pet (Dogs Cats Rabbit)\nEuyona\n{'Brand': 'Euyona', 'Shape': 'Oblong', 'Handle Material': 'Metal', 'Special Feature': 'Self Cleaning', 'Product Benefits': 'Smoothing', 'Package Dimensions': '8.35 x 3.39 x 2.83 inches; 5.2 Ounces', 'UPC': '785214618769'}\nI like this brush for my small, short-hair dog. It helps remove his loose hair and he seems to enjoy it when I brush him. I like that I can push a button and it pushes the hair to the ends of the bristles so that I can easily remove the hair. It doesn't get all of the hair, but it is a lot more effective than a normal brush. Overall,  I'm really happy with this brush and would get one like it again.\nNice!\nAOA Studio Collection Makeup Sponge Set Makeup Blender Latex Free and High-definition Set of 5 Makeup Blender For Powder Cream and Liquid, Super Soft Wonder Blender Beauty Cosmetic Beveled\nAOA STUDIO\n{'Brand': 'AOA STUDIO', 'Color': 'Ivory', 'Material': 'Rubber', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Makeup', 'Package Dimensions': '6.85 x 5.39 x 1.97 inches; 1.45 Ounces', 'UPC': '850022931338'}\nI like these blenders.
