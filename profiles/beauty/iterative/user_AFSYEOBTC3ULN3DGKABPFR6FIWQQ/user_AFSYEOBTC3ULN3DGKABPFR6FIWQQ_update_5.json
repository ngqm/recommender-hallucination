They have a strong hold and don\u2019t fall out as easy as other brands we\u2019ve tried! Plus the variety of colors is great so they can match her outfits. They were all accounted for as well! Highly recommend!\nReview Title: Strong hold\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
