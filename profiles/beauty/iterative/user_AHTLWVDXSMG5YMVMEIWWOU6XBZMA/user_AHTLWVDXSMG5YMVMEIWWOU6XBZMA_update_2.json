I do use a cellulite gel and this brush and I can really see an improvement. I used the same combination a couple years ago and was very happy with my results but I fell by the wayside - I'm back and I'll continue to use it forever. Between the gel and the brush, the action of using the brush is the most important and I noticed results after a couple of weeks.\nReview Title: It Works!\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
