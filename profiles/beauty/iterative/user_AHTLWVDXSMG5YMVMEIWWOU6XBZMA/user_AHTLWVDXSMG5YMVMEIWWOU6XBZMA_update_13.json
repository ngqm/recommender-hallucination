They seemed to have a really good effect, without irritating my very sensitive skin. I'm always worried when I try something new -- I get redness, irritation and in bad cases hives so trying anything is a risk. I had absolutely NO problems with these and they left my skin feeling soft and supple and well moisturized.\nReview Title: Very nice!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Easy to use, extremely gentle, and I was using on one side only so I can see a difference after about 3 or 4 uses.  Feels good, works well and no bad after effects, what more do you need?\nNice scrub.\nGnker Cellulite Remover Massager Brush Hair Mask 5 Seconds to Restore Soft Deep Conditioner Magical Hair Treatment Mask for Dry Damaged\nGnker\n{'Package Dimensions': '4.8 x 3.8 x 2.7 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Gnker'}\nOnce I got comfortable using this, the hand part felt weird at first, I've seen decent results. I do use a cellulite gel and this brush and I can really see an improvement. I used the same combination a couple years ago and was very happy with my results but I fell by the wayside - I'm back and I'll continue to use it forever. Between the gel and the brush, the action of using the brush is the most important and I noticed results after a couple of weeks.\nIt Works!\nFace Lift Tapes for Instant Face, Neck and Eye Lift Kit Tape\nC CRYSTAL LEMON\n{'Brand': 'C CRYSTAL LEMON', 'Unit Count': '40.00 Count', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '5.67 x 3.35 x 0.87 inches; 0.6 Ounces', 'UPC': '725330346603'}\nThere are a number of this type of product on the market and this one does not compare favorably to any others that I\u2019ve tried. They don\u2019t hold well and I didn\u2019t notice any improvement. I\u2019ll keep shopping.\nNot impressed.\nMens Sea Facial Detox Facial Mask Sheet for Oily Skin- New Skincare - Blackhead, Pore Cleansing, Peel-off (Age under 35)\nSeptCity\n{'Brand': 'SeptCity', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Product Benefits': 'Detoxifying', 'Skin Type': 'Oily', 'Unit Count': '6.00 Count', 'Product Dimensions': '7.09 x 5.51 x 0.79 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '733424600616'}\nI wasn't really sure about this and when I first opened it I became even more skeptical. It looked like a paper towel and I had to wet it? Fortunately I thought ahead and opened it before soaking it in water and it was relatively easy to handle. I didn't love wearing it for 30 minutes, I got annoyed by then with the masque but 20 minutes was about my limit and I did see results. I liked the masque overall and it seemed to improve the tone and texture of my skin. I knocked off a point because it was a bit cumbersome to use and waiting around for 30 minutes seemed too much for me. I've got very sensitive skin and this was not of problem for me to use (although I did patch test first). If you know what you are going into (the time and effort) I'd recommend this product. If you don't have the time or want to bother with soaking the masque first, try something else but this does work!\nWasn't sure but was surprisingly effective\nJade Roller Microneedle Derma Roller 3 in 1 for Face Massager Tools Set, Beautlinks Real Natural Rose Quartz for Anti Aging Relaxing Eye Puffiness Wrinkles for Face Eyes Neck Body\nBeautlinks\n{'Package Dimensions': '6.85 x 6.3 x 1.73 inches; 10.41 Ounces', 'UPC': '741376342409', 'Manufacturer': 'Beautlinks'}\nI've been watching as every personality is raving about rose quartz and jade and microneedling etc. I did some research (from reputable sources) and there is actually some science to the use of these products. The microneedle blade is small enough for use. It makes little tiny, non-noticeable holes in the surface of your skin (in effect damaging it) so it will produce more collagen. While I wouldn't use it more than once a week, and just until my skin starts to get red, it does appear that my skin is softer and smoother after the treatment. So I'm find on the micro-needler. (Just remember gently, gently). The quartz roller is supposed to reduce redness, smooth the surface of the skin and help with lymphatic drainage. I'm not sure it actually does all that but it does feel nice and has definitely helped with under eye puffiness so it appears to be working. I'm very pleasantly surprised by the effectiveness of these devices and will continue to use them.<br /><br />The packaging is fine and makes them giftable but I'm not sure the quality of the pieces will actually hold up. I've been using them for several months and so far so good but if they do fall apart, I'm willing to invest in more expensive products. For a starter set, I would give this a try to be sure it works for you (and you are willing to do it).\nEffective\nCharyeah Bath Pillow Bathtub Spa Pillow With Powerful Gripping Suctions, Comfortable and Soft 2-Panel Cushions for Head, Neck, Back and Shoulder Support,Fits Hot Tub, Jacuzzi, Spas\nCharyeah\n{'Package Dimensions': '14.33 x 12.28 x 2.2 inches; 9.95 Ounces', 'UPC': '787937393473'}\nI had a bit of trouble in the beginning getting this set exactly right for me but once it was set up (and I marked the spots the suction cups go onto) it's been a wonder. No more sore neck while soaking. I was worried about it staying damp but it doesn't. I do remove it when I'm not relaxing but it fits very nicely in my linen closet so it's only a second away.\nIf you really want to relax\nAloe Vera Gel 100% Natural Moisturisers - Pure Organic Fresh Soothing Aloe-Vera Moisturizing Gel Skin Hair, Aloe Leaf Wash-free Clean After Sun Face Body (8.8 oz)\nCIMIY\n{'Brand': 'CIMIY', 'Scent': 'Aloe Vera', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Unit Count': '8.8 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Product Dimensions': '5.91 x 1.57 x 1.57 inches; 11.22 Ounces'}\nThis is a great Aloe Gel. I keep in the fridge and use it regularly. It\u2019s light enough weight that it doesn\u2019t feel goopy and washes off clean. Very thick, nice and cold from the fridge and it\u2019s great for too much sun or too much kitchen (burns, cuts, grease spatters, etc.). Easy to use - no nasty smell and works.\nNice and washes clean\nNail Files 16 Pcs, Double Sided Emery Board Manicure Tools for Filing Natural Gel and Acrylic Nails for Home and Salon Use\nKeiby Citom\n{'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'Keiby Citom', 'Grit Number': '100', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '7.8 x 5.08 x 0.59 inches; 5.29 Ounces', 'UPC': '742025065137', 'Manufacturer': 'YHIT'}\nThese work okay on natural nails but they don't seem to last as long as some of my older ones that are still in use years later. I generally only use them to touch up rough edges or file down broken nails but I couldn't swear to their durability. I can't imagine them working well on acrylics or gels but since I'm not using either right now I can only attest to the fact that they are working on my natural nails and seem to work okay I'm just not sure about their durability.\nThey work ok on natural nails\nShower Cap \u2013 2 pcs Large Shower Cap \u2013 15 inch Extra Large Shower Cap for Women \u2013 Waterproof Polyester Design with Inner Satin Layer - Adjustable Shower Cap with Buckle and Tightening Belt\nDusjhet\n{'Brand': 'Dusjhet', 'Color': 'Red, Purple, Black', 'Material': 'Polyester', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Pattern': 'Solid', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '13 x 9 x 1.9 inches; 7.37 Ounces', 'UPC': '192236766284'}\nI\u2019ve been looking for a shower cap for a long time that is sturdy, the right size and doesn\u2019t wear out after a few uses. This is promising although it\u2019s bigger than I need/want - I\u2019ll still use it until something better comes along. It is adjustable so it\u2019s very usable just way oversized for my head and the amount of hair I have. It is lightweight and water proof and dries quickly so other than size, it\u2019s great.\nBigger than I expected\nSpray Bottle with Adjustable Nozzle, Suream 10.6oz/300ml Green Mist Sprayer with Stream for Curly Hair, Refillable Empty Plastic Bottle for Hairdressing, Planting, Ironing and Cleaning\nSUREAM\n{'Package Dimensions': '9.88 x 4.49 x 3.07 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'UPC': '735632989217'}\nI\u2019m using this for my body oil and it\u2019s working perfectly. I wasn\u2019t sure it would go through the sprayer but it does and it makes it so much easier to use. It\u2019s a bit messy getting it started (oil you know) but once I got it primed, it\u2019s working fine and I can spray when I finish in the shower and reach my back without help.\nBody Mist\nHWASHIN 12 Pack 3.4oz/100ml Clear Plastic Spray Bottles with White Fine Mist Sprayers for Essential Oils, Perfumes & Aromatherapy (Brush, Funnels, Droppers, Labels & 30ml Measuring Cup Included)\nHWASHIN\n{'Brand': 'HWASHIN', 'Material': 'Plastic', 'Capacity': '100 Milliliters', 'Number of Items': '12', 'Special Feature': 'Mist Spray', 'Package Dimensions': '12.72 x 7.91 x 3.5 inches; 10.05 Ounces'}\nI travel a lot and find that using a mister for a lot of things makes it easier. The problem has always been that the bottles leak or don't mist. These work perfectly and don't leak!\nEasy to use and the mister works\nMakeup Brushes 12PCs- CLOWII Professional Premium Birch Handle Makeup Brush Foundation Concealer Brush Set of 12 with 1 Makeup Cleaner(Black)\nCLOWII\n{'Brand': 'CLOWII', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'For Concealing, For Foundation', 'Material': 'Silicone, Wool', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Item Form': 'Wand', 'Number of Pieces': '12', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Handle Material': 'Silicone', 'Ferrule Material': 'Aluminum', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '8.03 x 4.41 x 1.69 inches; 9.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '741818684043'}\nI got these to add to my travel bag so I don't have to keep taking my regular brushes in and out. These are good quality brushes, are soft and smooth and I didn't have any stray bristles anywhere. Overall very satisfactory. I'm happy I got them, they are getting used frequently and it certainly saves time to have 2 sets.\nDecent Quality - Nice Feel\nWIS Hyaluronic Acid Facial Masks for Women Anti Aging, Moisturizing for All Skin Type 24 Pcs Sheet Mask, Daily Skin Care\n+WIS+\n{'Brand': '+WIS+', 'Item Form': 'Mask', 'Product Benefits': 'Moisturizing', 'Scent': 'Hyaluronic Acid', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '6.18 x 5.04 x 4.13 inches; 1.83 Pounds'}\nI really liked using these. They seemed to have a really good effect, without irritating my very sensitive skin. I'm always worried when I try something new -- I get redness, irritation and in bad cases hives so trying anything is a risk. I had absolutely NO problems with these and they left my skin feeling soft and supple and well moisturized.\nVery nice!",
