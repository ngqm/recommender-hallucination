Generally, she does not like gadgets and new technology, but this toothbrush is easy to operate.  I recommended that she does not charge it after every brushing but rather only when the low battery indicator turns on, and she's been following this suggestion.  She tried one of the included small brush heads, but she really prefers the larger double action brush head.  I was especially pleased when she told me that she noticed her teeth getting whiter and her mouth feeling fresher.  That's all I need to recommend this toothbrush.\nReview Title: Mom enjoys it.\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
