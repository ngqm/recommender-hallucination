  "reference_summary": "Oral-B Professional Care Deluxe Electric Toothbrush -\nOral-B\n{'Brand': 'Oral-B', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Special Feature': 'Brushing Timer', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Color': 'Dark Blue/Light Blue'}\nI bought Oral-B 3000 for my mother and she likes it.  Generally, she does not like gadgets and new technology, but this toothbrush is easy to operate.  I recommended that she does not charge it after every brushing but rather only when the low battery indicator turns on, and she's been following this suggestion.  She tried one of the included small brush heads, but she really prefers the larger double action brush head.  I was especially pleased when she told me that she noticed her teeth getting whiter and her mouth feeling fresher.  That's all I need to recommend this toothbrush.\nMom enjoys it.\nGaming Headphones Chamvict Xbox One Headset with Stereo Sound Ps4 Headset with Mic Noise Canceling for PS4,PC,Laptop,Cell Phone,Xbox,Find Enemies Before They Find You\nChamvict\n['Why to choose us', \"1. \u3010Splendid stereo audio output\u3011Bring you an immersive game experience with stereo sound.You can get clear sound and accurately judge the enemies\u2019 direction especially in \u201cPlayerunknown's Battlegrounds\u201d 2. \u3010360\u00b0 Noise canceling mic\u3011We adopt intelligent chip to cancel outside noise.Just enjoy your own game world.You can judge the enemies direction and shoot in time without any noise.Victory is yours!The mic is flexible and can be adjusted to different angle for 360\u00b0 3. \u3010Comfy for long time wearing\u3011With an extreme light of 0.87pounds, it is professionally designed for long time wearing and relieve your tiredness.The earmuff is breathable and soft, which can give your ear a comfy touch with less stress and keep cool when gaming for long time 4. \u3010Skin-friendly earmuff\u3011Made of superior PU leather material, the earmuff is friendly to your skin 5. \u3010Convenient volume and mic adjustment\u3011You can adjust game sound volume via the pulley and turn on/off mic via the switch anytime when don\u2019t use it\", 'Tips for PS4', '1.

From myself I can add that the manual translation is very lazy and disrespectful to the customers.<br /><br />\"I got the headseat and was very eager to use it. The headset definitely did not disappoint.  The noise blocking was nice, and the headset felt very comfortable on my ears. For me the headset doesn't fit perfectly, there is a small space between my head and the bottom of the ear pads. I get uses to it after a while but i wish ear pads would fit all the way around.  Other than that, I really like the headset and definitely would recommend.\"\nMy son likes this headset\nGrinding Away Skin Polishing Scrub, 3 fl. oz., Polishing Scrub Works to Improve Skin's Texture and Tone by Buffing Away Dead Skin Cells by Higher Education Skincare\nHigher Education\n{'Brand': 'Higher Education', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Product Benefits': 'Smoother', 'Material Feature': 'Gluten Free, Cruelty Free', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.59 x 3.58 x 1.61 inches; 3 Ounces', 'UPC': '811381031008'}\nI like the scrub.  It is rough enough to feel it working, and my face and palms feel super smooth after I use it.  The scent is not particularly good or bad.  It's inoffensive.<br /><br />The scrub is on the pricy side (~10x) compared to the St Ive's medicated apricot scrub or Walmart's Equate medicated apricot scrub that I normally use.  I ordered a few Higher Education products to try and they have very short expiration dates, some less than 2 months away.  I'm not going to use that much product in 2 months, so whatcha the expiration date when you receive your shipment\nLike the scrub.  Pricy. Watch the expiration date.\nStudy Buddy Clay Mask with Detoxifying Bentonite, 3 fl. oz., Exfoliates, Brightens and Clears Pores, Clay Draws Out Impurities and Improves Skin's Texture and Tone by Higher Education Skincare\nHigher Education\n{'Brand': 'Higher Education', 'Item Form': 'Clay', 'Product Benefits': 'Exfoliating', 'Scent': 'Exfoliating', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.6 x 3.6 x 1.3 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'UPC': '811381035006'}\nI like how this mask feels on my skin.  It gives a pleasant tingling sensation.  It has a clay-like consistency and dries on the skin.<br /><br />The one I received expires in 1.5 months which is a very short expiration period.\nI like this mask.  Watch expiration date.\nMBA Renewing Retinol Serum, 1.7 fl. oz, 0.5% Retinol Hydrates & Brightens Skin's Appearance by Diminishing the Look of Breakouts, Hyperpigmentation, and Signs of Aging by Higher Education Skincare\nHigher Education\n{'Skin Type': 'All', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'Higher Education', 'Item Form': 'Serum', 'Unit Count': '1.7 Fl Oz', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.5 x 3.4 x 1.5 inches; 3.99 Ounces', 'UPC': '811381034009'}\nThe cream seems to work to brighten and even out skin tone without drying the skin.  I actually like the results.  However, the tube I received in July has a September expiration date.  Seems too soon.  I'd rate it higher if it had a longer expiration term.<br /><br />I am also a bit puzzled by the packaging.  It looks like a tube, but it has a pump top.  Not sure why it is packaged this way.\nVery short expiration date, but it seems to work.  Weird tube / pump.\nSELF/ish Men's Face Scrub | Exfoliating Facial Cleanser | Deep Cleansing | Effective Shave Prep & Beard Exfoliator for Men | Natural Ingredients | 3.4fl oz\nMELARQT\n{'Brand': 'MELARQT', 'Item Form': 'Scrub', 'Skin Type': 'Acne Prone', 'Product Benefits': 'Exfoliating', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '6.26 x 2.09 x 2.01 inches; 4.73 Ounces', 'Department': 'Men', 'UPC': '810042384002'}\nI like this scrub.  It has a faint but pleasant smell.  It is abrasive enough to make it feel that it is working.  My face (and palms) feel very smooth after I use it.<br /><br />The price, in my opinion, is too high.  I'd rather stick with St. Ives scrub I usually use.\nNice scrub.  Too expensive.\nTCM Men's Cleansing Activated Charcoal Bar Soap - For all skin types - 5oz (1 Pack)\nTCM\n{'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'TCM', 'Scent': 'Coconut', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Youth', 'Package Dimensions': '3.7 x 2.01 x 1.34 inches; 5.26 Ounces', 'UPC': '851058008179'}\nI like the smell of this soap and I like how my skin feels after ri take a shower using this soap, bit I find the shape of it very uncomfortable to hold and use.  There is a reason why mainstream soap bars have a certain shape rather than being cut as rectangular prism.\nSmells nice but uncomfortable to hold\nYolife Acrylic Nail Brush with100% Pure Kolinsky Sable, Nail Art Brush With Brilliant crystal Handle, for Manicure Pedicure (6#, Silver)\nYOLIFE\n{'Color': 'Silver', 'Brand': 'YOLIFE', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.75 x 2 x 0.3 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nCute and pretty brushes!
