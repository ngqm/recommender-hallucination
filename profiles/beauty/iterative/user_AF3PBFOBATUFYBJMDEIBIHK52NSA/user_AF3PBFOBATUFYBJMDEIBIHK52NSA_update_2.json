She reports that it goes on smoothly and feels light on her skin (unlike some other oils she has used). The scent is mild/neutral.

She tried these masks over a period of a couple of months last winter and spring to see if they could make a difference, and I'm happy to report that she gives them a positive rating for several reasons. They have mild ingredients derived from oolong tea and hyaluronic acid (which she has used in other products). The masks are very easy to apply: with some gentle, even pressure she was able to get them evenly onto her skin. After leaving the mask on for about 15 minutes, she felt a definite hydrating result. My wife recommends these!\nExcellent, Hydrating Masks!\nArgan Magic 100% Pure Argan Oil \u2013 Moisturizing Oil that Infuses Skin with Enriched Hydration | Leaves Skin Restored & Refreshed | Non-Greasy | Rich in Vitamin E | Made in USA | Cruelty Free (2 oz)\nArgan Magic\n{'Brand': 'Argan Magic', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Active Ingredients': 'Vitamin e', 'Unit Count': '2 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.2 x 1.1 x 1.1 inches; 2 Ounces', 'UPC': '605923474046'}\nI got this oil for my wife to try, and she really likes it.
