She was kind of curious about the \"plumping\" concept, and although it doesn't do much in that regard, it turns out to be pretty good quality in other ways. The color as shown in the product description is accurate in how it appears on her lips. It applies smoothly, stays on well, and my wife says it gives a nice, moisturized feel. The scent is slight, almost unnoticeable, and there is no strong flavor. The \"gloss\" is moderate, not too showy. Seems like a nice choice. I recommend it.\nReview Title: Interesting...\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "COSMETEA Korean Essence Face Masks - T1 Oolong Tea Hydrating Ampoule Full Facial Masks 10 Pack Treatments, Care Your Skin Anti-Aging, Anti-Wrinkle, Purifying, Deep Moisturizing with Hyaluronic Acid\nCosmetea\n{'Brand': 'Cosmetea', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Unit Count': '10.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '10', 'Package Dimensions': '7.8 x 4.8 x 1.8 inches; 13.62 Ounces'}\nMy wife experiences dry, itchy skin, especially during the colder months. She tried these masks over a period of a couple of months last winter and spring to see if they could make a difference, and I'm happy to report that she gives them a positive rating for several reasons. They have mild ingredients derived from oolong tea and hyaluronic acid (which she has used in other products). The masks are very easy to apply: with some gentle, even pressure she was able to get them evenly onto her skin. After leaving the mask on for about 15 minutes, she felt a definite hydrating result.

She reports that it goes on smoothly and feels light on her skin (unlike some other oils she has used). The scent is mild/neutral. It also leaves her skin feeling nicely moisturized and smooth, which is especially welcomed in the colder weather when her skin tends to dry out.

She has used it now several times, and reports that it is very nice. The citrus scent is pleasant, and the scrub goes on smoothly and easily. Just a little bit of it is all that is needed to create a nice, effective cleansing foam. After using it, my wife says her skin feels soft and refreshed. There is a generous amount in the bottle.
