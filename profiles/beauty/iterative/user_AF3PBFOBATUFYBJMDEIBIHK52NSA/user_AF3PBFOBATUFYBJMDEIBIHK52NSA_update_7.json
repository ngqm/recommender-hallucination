I got this set for both of them, and my wife and daughter both like them.<br /><br />The patches are very easy to apply. They are moisturized, but not really wet and gooey like some other patches we've tried. My wife and daughter found them very easy to apply under their eyes. The patches are shaped so that they naturally follow the curves under your eyes. They come to a point at one end, which fits quite nicely right up near your tear duct. A gentle press gets them set.<br /><br />When done using them, my wife and daughter both report feeling a refreshed, smooth sensation right where the patches were used. The effect is good, but not quite as good as some other patches. This seems to be because these masks don't hold on as long as other masks. After about 10 - 15 minutes, they start to peel away. Other masks hold on much longer, so have more time to work.<br /><br />Overall, these masks are comfortable and easy to use, but a bit less effective than some other ones. Still, I recommend them.\nReview Title: Mostly Very Nice\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "COSMETEA Korean Essence Face Masks - T1 Oolong Tea Hydrating Ampoule Full Facial Masks 10 Pack Treatments, Care Your Skin Anti-Aging, Anti-Wrinkle, Purifying, Deep Moisturizing with Hyaluronic Acid\nCosmetea\n{'Brand': 'Cosmetea', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Unit Count': '10.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '10', 'Package Dimensions': '7.8 x 4.8 x 1.8 inches; 13.62 Ounces'}\nMy wife experiences dry, itchy skin, especially during the colder months. She tried these masks over a period of a couple of months last winter and spring to see if they could make a difference, and I'm happy to report that she gives them a positive rating for several reasons. They have mild ingredients derived from oolong tea and hyaluronic acid (which she has used in other products). The masks are very easy to apply: with some gentle, even pressure she was able to get them evenly onto her skin. After leaving the mask on for about 15 minutes, she felt a definite hydrating result. My wife recommends these!\nExcellent, Hydrating Masks!\nArgan Magic 100% Pure Argan Oil \u2013 Moisturizing Oil that Infuses Skin with Enriched Hydration | Leaves Skin Restored & Refreshed | Non-Greasy | Rich in Vitamin E | Made in USA | Cruelty Free (2 oz)\nArgan Magic\n{'Brand': 'Argan Magic', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Active Ingredients': 'Vitamin e', 'Unit Count': '2 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.2 x 1.1 x 1.1 inches; 2 Ounces', 'UPC': '605923474046'}\nI got this oil for my wife to try, and she really likes it. She reports that it goes on smoothly and feels light on her skin (unlike some other oils she has used). The scent is mild/neutral. It also leaves her skin feeling nicely moisturized and smooth, which is especially welcomed in the colder weather when her skin tends to dry out. Highly recommended.\nExcellent Oil\nO!GETi Vitamin C Foam Cleanser | Foaming Facial Cleanser, Perfect Pore Cleansing Foam, Face Wash for Dry & Sensitive Skin, Sebum Reducing, Moisture Control & Minimizing Pores, Korean Skin Care, Gift for Women, Paraben-free, 4.23 Oz (120g)\nO!GETi\n{'Item Form': 'Foam', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'O!GETi', 'Scent': 'Tangerine', 'Material Feature': 'Natural'}\nI got this scrub for my wife to try while in her nightly baths. She has used it now several times, and reports that it is very nice. The citrus scent is pleasant, and the scrub goes on smoothly and easily. Just a little bit of it is all that is needed to create a nice, effective cleansing foam. After using it, my wife says her skin feels soft and refreshed. There is a generous amount in the bottle. I recommend this.\nVery Pleasant Scrub\nDEROL Lip Plumper, Lip Plumping Lip Gloss, Derol Lip Enhancer, Lip Care serum, Hydrating & Moisturizing Clear Lip Gloss, Tingling Lip Plumper Fuller And Maximizer\u2026\nDEROL\n{'Brand': 'DEROL', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating', 'Item Volume': '5.5 Milliliters', 'Package Information': 'Bottle', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2.32 x 0.7 x 0.7 inches; 0.32 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'AB-11', 'UPC': '735314440425'}\nI got this lip gloss for my wife, and she has been using it for a couple of weeks. She was kind of curious about the \"plumping\" concept, and although it doesn't do much in that regard, it turns out to be pretty good quality in other ways. The color as shown in the product description is accurate in how it appears on her lips. It applies smoothly, stays on well, and my wife says it gives a nice, moisturized feel. The scent is slight, almost unnoticeable, and there is no strong flavor. The \"gloss\" is moderate, not too showy. Seems like a nice choice. I recommend it.\nInteresting...\nZoe Ayla Zoe Ayla Electric Vibrating Noiseless Natural Rose Quartz Stone Roller, Rosegold and Pink\nZo\u00eb Ayla\n['This roller vibrates 6000 times per minute; It activates products absorption and stimulates collagen production. Quartz crystals are believed to lower stress, raise self-esteem, restore confidence and balance emotions. This tool can be used by itself or to massage masks, serums, moisturizers, and facial oils deep into the skin for better absorption. It will boost blood circulation, reduce under-eye swelling and help products absorb better into your skin. Advanced tip: Quartz rollers can be hand-warmed before use or popped in the fridge a few minutes prior to Rolling for an extra cooling effect used cold to re-invigorate a sore and tired face.']\n{'Color': 'Rosegold and Pink', 'Brand': 'Zo\u00eb Ayla', 'Style': 'Vibrator', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '1.03 x 3.51 x 8.27 inches', 'Water Resistance Level': 'Waterproof', 'Product Dimensions': '1.03 x 3.51 x 8.27 inches; 2.82 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'EL-ROLLRQ-BW', 'UPC': '686012006898', 'Manufacturer': 'AmazonUs/87098'}\nMy wife has been trying out some new kinds of skin-care, rejuvenating products, and I got her this to test. After using it for a couple of weeks, it seems like an interesting concept. Whether this device actually restores skin and boosts circulation is very difficult to prove. But my wife reports that her skin feels good after applying the roller, the design of the roller makes it pleasant to handle, and the stone feels smooth and natural on her skin.\nComfortable to Use\nOralphi Soft Tapered Toothbrush, with Super Tapered Bristles for Periodontal Pocket Care (4 Count, Full Head)\nOralphi\n{'Brand': 'Oralphi', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Item Firmness Description': 'Soft', 'Material Feature': 'Reusable', 'Unit Count': '4.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '7.87 x 4.92 x 0.67 inches; 4.66 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Oralphi'}\nI got these toothbrushes for my family, as an option for home and travel use. The brushes are made solidly, very lightweight, and tapered at an angle that does make them comfortable to control. The bristles are very soft. My wife has very sensitive gums, so the softness, for her, is welcomed. Also, for my wife, the angle of the bristles helps with gum care. These are very nice, basic brushes. I recommend them.\nGood Brushes\nGold Collagen Under Eye Patches Mask for dark circles and puffiness by Levitural - Golden Eye Bags Treatment - Mother's Day Gift for Women\nLV Levitural\n{'Brand': 'LV Levitural', 'Item Form': 'Mask', 'Product Benefits': 'Moisturizing,Hydration', 'Scent': 'Rose', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Package Dimensions': '3.25 x 3.25 x 1.6 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'UPC': '766234785310'}\nMy wife and my 13-year-old daughter both like using eye masks, and they have tested numerous kinds.
