  "reference_summary": "COSMETEA Korean Essence Face Masks - T1 Oolong Tea Hydrating Ampoule Full Facial Masks 10 Pack Treatments, Care Your Skin Anti-Aging, Anti-Wrinkle, Purifying, Deep Moisturizing with Hyaluronic Acid\nCosmetea\n{'Brand': 'Cosmetea', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Unit Count': '10.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '10', 'Package Dimensions': '7.8 x 4.8 x 1.8 inches; 13.62 Ounces'}\nMy wife experiences dry, itchy skin, especially during the colder months. She tried these masks over a period of a couple of months last winter and spring to see if they could make a difference, and I'm happy to report that she gives them a positive rating for several reasons. They have mild ingredients derived from oolong tea and hyaluronic acid (which she has used in other products). The masks are very easy to apply: with some gentle, even pressure she was able to get them evenly onto her skin. After leaving the mask on for about 15 minutes, she felt a definite hydrating result.
