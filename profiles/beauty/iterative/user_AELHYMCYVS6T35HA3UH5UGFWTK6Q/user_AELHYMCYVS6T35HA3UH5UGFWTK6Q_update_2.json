I like that it has a pretty case to use if I ever travel with it.  You can store the other brushes (comes with 3.  One for massage, one for sensitive skin and one normal brush)<br />Great that the battery holds a charge for about 30 uses.  Nice feature for when I'm on the road and don't want to bother with the charger at every hotel.<br />Has 3 speeds so you can decide on how much brushing you want on your face.<br />My face feels so clean after I'm done using it.  I put on some night cream, with the massage brush, afterwards and my face is so smooth.  I love it.<br />I'm also wondering how difficult it will be to find replacement brush heads.\nReview Title: Quick and easy facial cleaning in no time\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Pantene Pro-V Damage Detox Rebuilding Conditioner 24 fl oz\nPantene\n{'Brand': 'Pantene', 'Hair Type': 'Damaged,Frizzy', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '24 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '9 x 4 x 2.8 inches; 1.77 Pounds', 'UPC': '080878177301', 'Manufacturer': 'Pantene'}\nIt does make my hair soft but, I can't take the minty smell it has!  I use Pantene products all the time and was shocked when I was in the shower and put this conditioner on my head.  I stopped and looked at the bottle to see what exactly I was using. Doesn't smell nice like the other Pantene Conditioners I've used.  Going to have to put this bottle under my cabinet to use only when I'm desperate. Will go back to the other Pantene conditioners. And I will always open and smell any new shampoo or conditioner I buy.\nDon't like minty smell.\nLumaRx Facial Cleansing Brush with 1-Minute Pulsing Timer and LED Speed Indicator Light, Rechargeable and Showerproof, White/Silver\n{'Material': 'Silver', 'Brand': 'LumaRx', 'Color': 'White/Silver', 'Power Source': 'electric', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '3.88 x 7 x 10 inches', 'Product Dimensions': '3.88 x 7 x 10 inches; 5.6 Ounces', 'Item model number': '1', 'UPC': '074590543216', 'Manufacturer': 'LumaRx'}\nFantastic facial cleaning brush.
