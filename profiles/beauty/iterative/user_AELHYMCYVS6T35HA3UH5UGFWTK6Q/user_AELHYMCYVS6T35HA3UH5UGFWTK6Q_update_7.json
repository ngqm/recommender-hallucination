Seems that it would last quite a long time.\nReview Title: Nice and compact\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Pantene Pro-V Damage Detox Rebuilding Conditioner 24 fl oz\nPantene\n{'Brand': 'Pantene', 'Hair Type': 'Damaged,Frizzy', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '24 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '9 x 4 x 2.8 inches; 1.77 Pounds', 'UPC': '080878177301', 'Manufacturer': 'Pantene'}\nIt does make my hair soft but, I can't take the minty smell it has!  I use Pantene products all the time and was shocked when I was in the shower and put this conditioner on my head.  I stopped and looked at the bottle to see what exactly I was using. Doesn't smell nice like the other Pantene Conditioners I've used.  Going to have to put this bottle under my cabinet to use only when I'm desperate. Will go back to the other Pantene conditioners. And I will always open and smell any new shampoo or conditioner I buy.\nDon't like minty smell.\nLumaRx Facial Cleansing Brush with 1-Minute Pulsing Timer and LED Speed Indicator Light, Rechargeable and Showerproof, White/Silver\n{'Material': 'Silver', 'Brand': 'LumaRx', 'Color': 'White/Silver', 'Power Source': 'electric', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '3.88 x 7 x 10 inches', 'Product Dimensions': '3.88 x 7 x 10 inches; 5.6 Ounces', 'Item model number': '1', 'UPC': '074590543216', 'Manufacturer': 'LumaRx'}\nFantastic facial cleaning brush.  I like that it has a pretty case to use if I ever travel with it.  You can store the other brushes (comes with 3.  One for massage, one for sensitive skin and one normal brush)<br />Great that the battery holds a charge for about 30 uses.  Nice feature for when I'm on the road and don't want to bother with the charger at every hotel.<br />Has 3 speeds so you can decide on how much brushing you want on your face.<br />My face feels so clean after I'm done using it.  I put on some night cream, with the massage brush, afterwards and my face is so smooth.  I love it.<br />I'm also wondering how difficult it will be to find replacement brush heads.\nQuick and easy facial cleaning in no time\nTweezers for Eyebrows, MORGLES 5PCS Tweezers for Women Precision Tweezers Set with Eyebrow Brush Leather Case for Eyebrow Ingrown Hair Removal\nMORGLES\n{'Package Dimensions': '6.73 x 4.06 x 0.75 inches; 7.83 Ounces', 'UPC': '616010018807', 'Manufacturer': 'MORGLES'}\nIt's so hard to find good tweezers that actually grab the hair.  These tweezers seem to work nicely.<br />I tried 3 of them so far and I have no complaints.<br />The case is nice to keep them all organized and easy to find.  The eyebrow brush was a nice addition to this set.<br />The curved scissors work great also.<br />Glad to have this set in my collection.  Will make it so much easier when I need to do a bit of face grooming.\nNice variety\nCAXIRO IPL Hair Removal Device for Women and Man, Permanent Reduction in Hair Regrowth for Body, Face & Precision Areas (Bikini and Underarms)\nCAXIRO\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.76 x 7.68 x 2.32 inches; 1.48 Pounds', 'UPC': '791324774318'}\nI'll say it, I hate shaving.  The older I get the more hair I get on my upper lip.  Horrible.<br />So I am now trying this laser tool to see if it'll help with at least most of my unwanted hair.<br />I haven't been using it long.  I clean and then I shave the areas that I want to laser treat.<br />I would say that after about 3 weeks/3 times a week, you'll see at least a little difference if not a big difference.<br />The device is easy to hold in one hand.<br />Says that it will last my lifetime.  And it probably will.  The  most I'll be using it is the first month or two.  After that I expect only maintenance use.<br />No counter to count down the number of used flashes.  But it's okay.  Not a big deal.<br />It does have to be plugged in.  Again, not an issue.  I only have it out, while using it, for about 10 mins tops.  Takes me 2 seconds to plug it in.<br />Love having this.  Anything that makes a day go a bit easier is okay with me.\nNice Laser Removal Tool\nAnghie Complete Kit for Beginners\nAnghie\n{'Brand': 'Anghie', 'Size': 'Green-shader&liner', 'Water Resistance Level': 'Water Resistant', 'Number of Pieces': '3', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '6.93 x 4.65 x 3.58 inches; 1.54 Pounds', 'UPC': '770240204666', 'Manufacturer': 'Anghie'}\nAfter using different tattoo machines, this one is more just for beginners.<br />It's light and easy to use.  Kit comes with almost everything needed to start practicing.<br />I wanted to see how good this machine would do with lines.  It's okay but, the machine does get a bit on the warm side after having it run for about 60-90 mins.<br />All in all this kit is nice.\nNice machine\nZZLOVE Amino Acids Body Wash for Men Women Moisturizing Shower Gel with Milk Protein Hydrolysate and Natural Plant Extracts\nZZLOVE\n{'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Brand': 'ZZLOVE', 'Scent': 'Honey, Papaya', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '6.77 x 3.03 x 2.95 inches; 14.39 Ounces'}\nI don't like the pump of this wash.  It's so small that it takes so many pumps to get a small amount.  I finally gave up and just poured it out of the bottle.<br />Scent....Not the greatest.  It doesn't last long which is nice because it's not a scent I want to smell like when I get out of the shower.<br />Did lather nice.  Rinsed off and I felt clean.<br />Maybe men would like this better than women.  And some  may like how it smells.  Just not a scent for me.\nIt's just okay\nCuckoo Face Makeup Oil-Absorbing Volcanic Face Roller,Jade Roller Set Facial Beauty Tools,Face Roller Skin Massager for Face\nCuckoo\n['Cuckoo Face Makeup Oil-Absorbing Volcanic Face Roller& Jade Roller', 'Why choose Cuckoo?', 'Cuckoo has one pc of Oil-Absorbing Volcanic Face Roller and one pc of Jade roller.
