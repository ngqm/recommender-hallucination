I was on the edge of breaking my nail trying to take out the plastic thing. I guess that means it's a tight seal. I only needed one pump for the whole face. My face felt super soft after applying and still soft the next day. There is very mild scent. A little goes a long way so I may be able to justify the cost.\nGreat moisturizer\nBABOR Power Serum Ampoule: Beta Glucan | Calms, Strengthens, Soothes | 2D Hyaluronic Acid & Microsilver | Clean & Vegan | Visible Results in 7 Days\nBabor\n{'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Product Benefits': 'Instantly calms, strengthens & soothes complexion while providing intense hydration.
