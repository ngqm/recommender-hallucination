I was on the edge of breaking my nail trying to take out the plastic thing. I guess that means it's a tight seal. I only needed one pump for the whole face. My face felt super soft after applying and still soft the next day. There is very mild scent. A little goes a long way so I may be able to justify the cost.\nReview Title: Great moisturizer\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
