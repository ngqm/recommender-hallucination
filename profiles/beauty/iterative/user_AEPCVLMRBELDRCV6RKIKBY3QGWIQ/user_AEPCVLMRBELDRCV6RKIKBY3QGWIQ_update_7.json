  "reference_summary": "1 Ounce Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Skin \u2013 Hydrating Facial Moisturizer with Anti-Aging Skin Care Properties. Beauty and Skin Care\nTemer\n{'Brand': 'Temer', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Active Ingredients': 'Hyaluronic_acid', 'Unit Count': '1 Fl. Oz', 'Number of Items': '1'}\nFor those of you familiar with Hyaluronic Acid Serum, you know how well this works.  For those of you who are not familiar with it, I would be hesitant to say that Hyaluronic Acid is a go to miracle solution for wrinkles.  It will temporarily reduce them I find, but that's good enough for me.  I tend to use these on days where I've had late nights or need an extra bit of a touch up.  If you haven't tried it before, I'd give it a go to see what you think but for me, it's one of those essentials I keep on hand.\nGood for what it is\n&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&\nYRMJK\n{'Brand': 'YRMJK', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Item Firmness Description': 'Soft', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '9.1 x 3.1 x 2.7 inches; 13.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '738426030676', 'Manufacturer': 'MUTTUS'}\nThis tooth brush has some good features.  The amount of use you'll get out of single charge for instance is quite impressive (although this will depend on how long you've been using it per brushing).  The fact that it comes with a number of spare heads is also good, so you wont be left wanting more.  However the brushing action is simply a vibrating action that will get your teeth cleaner than a regular brushing but not quite as good as an oscillating rotational design BUT considering this toothbrush is about half the price of the competition, that's not too bad.  Quite impressed with the features and the fact that it will give your teeth a good cleaning.\nAlmost perfect\nThe Beachwaver Co. S1.25 Dual Voltage, White\n{'Product Benefits': 'This ceramic, rotating curling iron provides easy, quality waves in minutes!', 'Shape': 'Barrel', 'Brand': 'The Beachwaver Co.', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Material': 'Ceramic', 'Product Dimensions': '15.75 x 1.75 x 2 inches; 15.2 Ounces', 'Item model number': '4354716121', 'UPC': '817741020620 817741022730', 'Manufacturer': 'AmazonUs/SB10T'}\nawesome tool to curl your hair. Does the work for you.  I can see that it would be very easy to hurt oneself while using this iron though.  I would use the iron the slow setting rather than fast and rather than pushing the button down continuously , do it intermittently until the hair is curled up as far as you want it.  It takes  bit of practice.  Iron can be very hot, so maybe start with low setting to get used to mechanisms and then once you are comfortable with the up/down and home button, ok to turn up higher.\nExcellent curling iron!\nGrowom Garden Hose Nozzle 4 Adjustable Spray Patterns Garden Sprayer Heavy Duty Metal Hose Nozzle with 3 Washers for Gardening, Car Washing, Pet Bathing and General Cleaning\nGrowom\n{'Brand': 'Growom', 'Finish Type': 'Polished', 'Material': 'Heavy,Metal', 'Handle Type': 'Lever', 'Package Dimensions': '8.3 x 4.6 x 1.7 inches; 1.15 Pounds'}\nQuite impressed with this sprayer, it feels heavy duty and has a good finish on it.  It comes with a few extra gaskets so there are no leaks from the connectors.  The spring action handle is solid and easy to use.  The adjustable spraying pattern makes it ideal to use on a large garden or on potted plants.\nHeavy duty and solid feel\nLDR by Baysyx - Restorative Glow Hydro Boost Moisturizer | Nourishing Hydration Cream with Collagen Stimulation | Fortified with Hyaluronic Acid | Made in The USA from Natural Ingredients (1.7 Oz)\nLDR\n{'Brand': 'LDR', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '6.3 x 1.2 x 1.1 inches; 1.7 Ounces', 'UPC': '725835779579', 'Manufacturer': 'LDR'}\nThis is a very nice and light moisturizer that really does help hydrate your skin.  What I couldn't believe was the price compared to the competition.  It was excellent value and gave decent results.  The fragrance is also light and doesn't over power the senses.  After using this for a week I have to say my skin feels great.\nNice and light\nVIRTUE Shaping Spray, 7 oz\n{'Product Dimensions': '2 x 2 x 9.5 inches; 8.78 Ounces', 'UPC': '817023022168'}\nThis hairspray works great.  I rarely use hairspray but when I do I like a light hold rather than heavy.  I usually use a sprax wax to tame down the frizzies but this hairspray works for that as well.<br />For the price though, I would probably go with a name brand that I know of over this one.  Packaging and bottle are very nice.\nWow, pretty good stuff!\nPick & Pick (Gentle/metal allergy free material)\nMIND UP\n{'Package Dimensions': '7 x 1.2 x 0.5 inches; 0.63 Ounces'}\nDoes exactly what it says, it's a nice sized pick that's easy to use on ones teeth (providing they have a steady hand and know exactly what they are doing).  It's easy to hold in your hand, it's a good size and fits in between the gaps in my teeth well.\nA great little pick",
