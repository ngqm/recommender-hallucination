Does the work for you.  I can see that it would be very easy to hurt oneself while using this iron though.  I would use the iron the slow setting rather than fast and rather than pushing the button down continuously , do it intermittently until the hair is curled up as far as you want it.  It takes  bit of practice.  Iron can be very hot, so maybe start with low setting to get used to mechanisms and then once you are comfortable with the up/down and home button, ok to turn up higher.\nReview Title: Excellent curling iron!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "1 Ounce Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Skin \u2013 Hydrating Facial Moisturizer with Anti-Aging Skin Care Properties. Beauty and Skin Care\nTemer\n{'Brand': 'Temer', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Active Ingredients': 'Hyaluronic_acid', 'Unit Count': '1 Fl. Oz', 'Number of Items': '1'}\nFor those of you familiar with Hyaluronic Acid Serum, you know how well this works.  For those of you who are not familiar with it, I would be hesitant to say that Hyaluronic Acid is a go to miracle solution for wrinkles.  It will temporarily reduce them I find, but that's good enough for me.  I tend to use these on days where I've had late nights or need an extra bit of a touch up.  If you haven't tried it before, I'd give it a go to see what you think but for me, it's one of those essentials I keep on hand.\nGood for what it is\n&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&\nYRMJK\n{'Brand': 'YRMJK', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Item Firmness Description': 'Soft', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '9.1 x 3.1 x 2.7 inches; 13.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '738426030676', 'Manufacturer': 'MUTTUS'}\nThis tooth brush has some good features.  The amount of use you'll get out of single charge for instance is quite impressive (although this will depend on how long you've been using it per brushing).  The fact that it comes with a number of spare heads is also good, so you wont be left wanting more.  However the brushing action is simply a vibrating action that will get your teeth cleaner than a regular brushing but not quite as good as an oscillating rotational design BUT considering this toothbrush is about half the price of the competition, that's not too bad.  Quite impressed with the features and the fact that it will give your teeth a good cleaning.\nAlmost perfect\nThe Beachwaver Co.
