I\u2019ve had and used IPL lasers in the past but literally none of them were this fast.<br /><br />This thing is so simple and easy to use; read the booklet, follow the instructions, but all you have to do is plug it in and use it. It\u2019s not complicated it\u2019s actually very easy and simple to use.<br /><br />You do have to start with a shaved clean skin and then all you have to do is press and hold the button and in speed mode it will continuously flash as long as you move it along the skin. I have found that IPL laser results are effective and long lasting as long as you use this right. Go by the skin tone graph and use it weekly, unless skin irritation  develops.<br /><br />I absolutely love this thing. I like the little cap that it comes with for precision treatment areas such as the face. The cap Is actually magnetic so it stays on very well. My only gripe with this is that for this price, and this was priced at $379 at the time of purchase, you should get a case with this product, but you do not get any protective case just a box that it ships in, that\u2019s kind of disappointing to me but it\u2019s not a dealbreaker because this product produces excellent results. I would highly highly highly recommend this IPL laser in particular just because of the speed and effectiveness of it. I have pretty sensitive skin and after use I did not have any irritation with it. I used it on my face, under arms, bikini area and legs. I could not believe how fast it was and how easy it was to use!\nImpressive\nU Beauty Preface Kit | Skin Care Gift Value Set with Retinol, Vitamin C Serum Anti-Aging Essentials Skin Tightening Arm Cream + Facial Hyaluronic Acid Morning and Night - 2.7oz (Set of 3)\nU Beauty\n['Our three cult-favorite hero products in an exclusive getaway-ready kit: The essential Travel Trio features the Resurfacing Compound 15ml, SUPER Hydrator 15ml, and SCULPT Arm Compound 50ml.']\n{'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Brand': 'U Beauty', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Use for': 'Neck, Face', 'Item Volume': '15 Milliliters', 'Product Dimensions': '6.5 x 4.33 x 7.87 inches; 1.35 Pounds', 'UPC': '850022804137', 'Manufacturer': 'U Beauty', 'Country of Origin': 'Italy'}\nThis amazing skin care set includes a resurfacing compound, a super hydrator and finally a sculpt compound.<br />This set uses retinol, vitamin C as well as hyaluronic acid to provide skin tightening results for the face, neck and chest areas.
