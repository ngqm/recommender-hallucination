When I read about this product and the lovely smell it had, I was very excited to try it.  Let's take a look.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This cream is yellow in color- very pale yellow.  It is creamy but not heavy.  There is a very faint lemon smell, but there is also a smell which is not good- almost like the oils in the cream are about to turn completely rancid.  They are not quite there yet, but I have used enough products over time where I recognize that smell.<br /><br />That is not necessarily the fault of the cream.  This could have been kept in a hot warehouse too long, or who knows what.  The manufacture date on my box is April 2019.  That is over a year old already.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT WORK?<br />Since it is not unbearable at this point, I wanted to at least test the product for a few days.  There was no burning or stinging, so it is still okay to use for now.  The product is quite nice.  It does soak in quickly and it does not leave the face greasy at all.<br /><br />WHAT IS THE EFFECT ON SKIN?<br />The next morning after using this, I will say that the skin is left looking like it has a slight glow to it.  It does leave the skin looking much nicer than other creams I have used.  It is warmer weather right now and this cream is still not leaving the face greasy or heavy at all.  My skin is definitely left looking nice the next morning.<br /><br />ANY SENSITIVITY?<br />I have not had any sensitivity to the sun or anything else yet.  Like I said, I can not use this long as it is ready to turn bad soon so I only have a short time.  For now, it is really nice.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />I really wish that this cream was fresher than it is.  The product manufacture date on it is April of 2019.  I am really disappointed that I could not test it at its best because it has great potential to be a really nice cream.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS- I can not give this five stars in its current state.  It is potentially really nice cream though.  If you get a fresh one, I imagine it is really nice.  Just make sure to use it up and if you live in a hot climate, keep it in the refrigerator or air conditioning.\nReview Title: Seems To Work, But I Think Mine Might Be Going Rancid\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

She has to go to a camp which has a lot of other teens at it for a week to work for a city reach out program.  She wanted to bring her Clarisonic, but I talked her into trying this one out.  It is easy to transport and use and if it is lost or taken, it is not as expensive to replace.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS BRUSH LIKE?<br />First of all, this comes in a nice hard case which is great for travel.  It comes with one soft brush for daily use and a harder brush for once a week or so use.  There is a silicone brush head which is for dry sensitive skin types.  The brush runs on batteries which did not come with our unit.  They are AA batteries.  There are two speeds- slower for daily use and higher for the harder brush to exfoliate.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT WORK?<br />There are two speeds.  The first speed is very slow and my daughter is not fond of it.  She prefers to use it on the second speed which is faster.  Since it runs on batteries, it is not going to have the consistency as a plug in version.  My daughter prefers the exfoliating brush and uses it 2 times a week.  She feels that it cleans her skin as good or better than her Clarisonic Mia as it gets rid of the dead skin cells leaving her skin softer and more clear too.<br /><br />It seems to be very waterproof.  My daughter uses this in the shower and has had no problems with it.  After almost a month of use, twice a week, she is not having problems with the batteries running down yet.  She does  a lot of house sitting so having this handy has been great.<br /><br />AFTER EXFOLIATING BRUSH<br />After using the exfoliating brush, my daughter wanted me to mention that it is important to put on good moisturizer as the skin has been exfoliated well and you will need to make sure to use moisturizer on the face to protect the skin as it repairs.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />If you want the cleaning of a Clarisonic Mia but want something more travel friendly that cleans well, this might be a brush for you to try out.  Working best on the second speed with the exfoliating brush, twice a week does the trick for our daughter.  She really likes it and thinks it works as good or at times better than her Clarisonic Mia which she still has.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS for this one although it is not fair to grade it against the Clarisonic which is electrically powered, it works as well but does have the battery power.  I debated giving it four stars, but it does work better than any battery powered brush we have tested so far, so I am leaving it at five.  The soft brush is not too great, though, so perhaps see this as FOUR AND A HALF.\nBest Battery Powered Brush We Have Ever Used Cleans As Good As Clarisonic Which We Also Have\nManicure and Pedicure Nail Clipper from POWERGROOMING - Powerful Trimmer for Thick and Thin Finger Nails and Toe Nails - Included Nail File and\"Catcher\" for Easy Cleanup (1 Pack)\nPOWERGROOMING\n{'Brand': 'POWERGROOMING', 'Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Blade Edge': 'Straight', 'Blade Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Target Audience': 'Women, Men', 'Package Dimensions': '3.8 x 1.3 x 1 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'UPC': '653233212735', 'Manufacturer': 'POWERGROOMING'}\nI don't know about you, but our household goes through nail clippers fast.  Most of the time they don't cut right, or they just don't last.  Toenail clippers- well it is even harder to find a decent pair.  Let's see how this set measured up for us..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS NAIL CLIPPER SET LIKE?<br />This set comes with a hefty set of nail clippers.  It says it is for fingernails and toenails.  More on that in a minute.  The clipper comes with a catch all for the clippings.  It also comes with a faux leather snap shut case that also houses a nail file.<br /><br />HOW DO THESE CLIPPER PERFORM?<br />These clippers are surprinsingly nice.  I tried them on both finger and toe nails and they worked very well.  I did not get any ragged edges, or dull bent nails or anything else that I usually have problems with regarding most clippers.  I did even have good results on the thickest nail which is on the largest toe.<br /><br />WHO MIGHT NOT BENEFIT BY THESE CLIPPERS?'<br />The only person I would think would not benefit from these are those who deal with very thick elderly nails.  Those need special clippers.<br /><br />THE NAIL FILE<br />The nail file is nice, very fine grade of file, this files nails decently.  The tip is not overly great at cleaning under the nail but it works okay.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This nail clipper seems to work well on finger and toe nails not having any trouble with ragged edges or dull bending of nails.  The enclosed case is great in that it keeps the file and clippers together.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS. I like the whole set although the nail file could be a bit better.\nFINALLY Truly Nice Toenail Clippers & Bonuses\nCurling Iron 1\u00bc'' with 24k Gold,\u00a0Hair Curler Curling Wand with Dual Voltage for All Hair Types\n{'Package Dimensions': '11.2 x 9.2 x 2.3 inches; 1.95 Pounds', 'UPC': '714453116958'}\nWhen it comes to styling devices, my family all has different preferences because we all have different hair.  This looked like a really great product.  Let's take a look..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This comes in a nice box, well packed in a fancy presentation and comes with a little manual.  The device has four buttons on it which are power, temp up or temp down or timer.  The bent curling iron is supposed to be more handy to use.<br /><br />MANUAL<br />The manual is bare bones.  It looks fancy but never tells what temperature or time would be good to start with for different types of hair.  That was very disappointing.  It does tell how to basically press the buttons and what they are for, however.<br /><br />HOW DID THIS PERFORM?<br />We tried this several times on various occasions.  Each time, we set the temperature higher and higher until we were at the top temp but very few of the curls we tried making worked.  The hair simply had a light bend in it.  When using a different curling iron with each person, the hair looked great.  Finally after trying for the last time today, we have determined that this curling iron just does not work.  I am not sure if we got a bad one or what, but it just does not do hardly anything except leaving a partial bend in the hair no matter how we wind it.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Although a great concept, this curling iron did not seem to curl hair properly no matter what hair we used it on or how high or low the temperature was set.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />TWO STARS.  Great idea, just didn't work at all for us.\nWe Tried EVERYTHING To Get This To Work\nMountain Falls Regular Nail Polish Remover for Natural Nails with Vitamin E and Panthenol, 10 Fluid Ounce\nMountain Falls\n{'Brand': 'Mountain Falls', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Item Weight': '0.7 Pounds', 'Unit Count': '10 Fl Oz'}\nWhen it comes to nail polish remover, I have two choices.  I use either the store brand, or professional brand, which is often pure acetone used in tough removal like gel polish.  Let's look at this one.<br /><br />WHAT TYPE OF POLISH?<br />I had on a very dark red polish which was wearing very intensely for a week.  Removal with some removers would leave red stains everywhere.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This polish remover comes in the same type of bottle most store brands do.  There is no special scent and it is typical remover.<br /><br />HOW DID THIS PERFORM?<br />This polish remover took off the red polish with no problem, left no red staining, and did not leave my nails completely parched like some harsher ones might.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This polish removes regular nail polish (not talking about gel here) very well.  It does not leave nails too stripped.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />Five stars.  It does what it is supposed to to without excessive problems or smells.\nRemoves Regular (Not Gel) Tough Polish Well, Does Not Leave Nails Parched\nElegant Compact Lighted Makeup Mirror for Travel, Purse and Handbags,1X and 10X Magnifying Handheld Makeup Mirror with 12 LEDs Lights,Double Side LED Travel Makeup Mirror(White)\ndeweisn\n{'Package Dimensions': '4.2 x 4.1 x 0.9 inches; 2.82 Ounces'}\nI was spoiled.  I had a wonderful big compact mirror from OTT LITE some time ago.  I used it a lot.  However, it broke and I could not replace it.  I was hoping  Let's take a look.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This mirror closes and snaps shut with a plastic clip on it.  It says open, but honestly, it is not easy to do.  Once open, the inside has the 10X magnifier on one side and the reguiar mirror surrounded by the light ring.<br /><br />ON/OFF<br />This has one light brightness- on.  There is a little switch on the back that you push from one side to the other to turn it on and off.  It does not shut the light off when you close it.<br /><br />CASE<br />The case is quite slick.  If it is cold out and my hands are cold, it is sometimes a bit tough to hold on to this.  Most of the time it is not a problem.<br /><br />BRIGHTNESS<br />This is a bit too bright for me.  It really does seem to be so bright that I can not look into the regular mirror long, but the magnifier is okay IF I REALLY WANT TO SEE MY PORES.  Sorry, but it is a bit overwhelming.<br /><br />BATTERIES<br />This takes 2 CR2032 batteries.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />I am not really that impressed with this mirror.  It works, but it is a bit frustrating to open, and bright to look into.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />THREE STARS.  This works, but it is not the best light in my opinion.  That little switch on the back could easily be damaged in my purse.\nNot Quite As Nice As I Had Hoped- BLINDING At Times\nBE PLAIN Vitamin Ampoule 1.01 fl oz. - Korean Multi Vitamin Serum for Face with Vitamin B, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Hyaluronic Acid\nBe Plain\n{'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'Be Plain', 'Item Weight': '30 Grams', 'Item Volume': '30 Milliliters', 'Unit Count': '1.01 Fl Oz', 'Product Dimensions': '1.57 x 1.57 x 3.74 inches; 1.06 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'BP008'}\nI am always on the lookout for really nice simple skin care.  Let's take a look at this ampule.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This is a clear solution that comes out with an eye dropper.<br /><br />HOW TO USE<br />The idea is that you use a toner on your CLEAN face, apply this to the face and neck and chest, and then follow up with a moisturizer.<br /><br />WHAT DOES IT PROMISE TO DO?<br />This promises to lighted dark spots, and add firmness, glow, and hydration.<br /><br />DOES IT DO WHAT IT SAYS?<br />I used this with another Korean toner which is pretty simple, and also the BE PLAIN Aqua moisturizer.  When used, this did not seem to moisturize that much on its own, and for brightness and glow, I would say not over WOW factor after using for a month.<br /><br />DID SKIN LOOK FIRMER?<br />I guess you could say my skin looked a bit firmer, but nothing so dramatic that people said, \"WOW, WHAT ARE YOU USING ON YOUR FACE?\"<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a scent free, easy to use serum for the face.  It works well with moisturizer, is simple, scent free, and gives a moderate amount of what it says it will do.  It is not remarkable, but it is not terrible either.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  This is decent, but not my favorite product at this point.\nSimple Scent Free Skin Care Absorbs Easily Does It Do What It Says?\nIryasa Night Indulge Cream - Natural Face Cream for Dry Skin - Vegan Anti Aging Night Cream for Women - Firming Cream for Face and Neck - Organic Vitamin C Moisturizer for Face - 1.7oz\nIRYASA\n{'Brand': 'IRYASA', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '1.7 Ounce', 'Use for': 'Face', 'Skin Type': 'Mature', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2.76 x 2.76 x 2.2 inches; 1.76 Ounces'}\nI am all about natural skin care.
