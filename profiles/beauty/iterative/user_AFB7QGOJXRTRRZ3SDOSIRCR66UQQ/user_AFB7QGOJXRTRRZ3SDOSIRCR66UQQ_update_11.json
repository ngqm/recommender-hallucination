I used it to mix/dilute bleach and other chemical products that needed to be in new, unrecycled bottles. sprayer works fine, although one of them did leak when i turned the bottle upside down. not sure if that would happen with all the bottles, or just this one sprayer that i received. if you have other \"plastic\" spray bottles around your house, it will be easy to forget that this one is GLASS, so just be careful.\nnice set of glass bottles!!\nNo Brainer Gentle Facial Cleanser, 6 fl. oz, For Dry & Sensitive Skin, Leaves Skin Feeling Clean, Soft and Hydrated, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein & Amino Acids Restores Skin by Higher Education Skincare\nHigher Education\n{'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Brand': 'Higher Education', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '6.00 Fl Oz', 'Package Dimensions': '7.2 x 2.3 x 2.3 inches; 8.01 Ounces', 'UPC': '811381030056'}\n[[VIDEOID:b3f95d0500123286d6c86e59790a77bd]] i appreciate a product that has a safety foil, so thumbs up for that! nice, clean scent, that reminds me of cucumbers. a thick, almost gel like consistency; doesn't lather very much, but still leaves face feeling fresh, clean, soft and smooth!\nnice scent, gentle cleanser\nBouquet Garni Body Shower White Musk - Unique Fragrance Decanting Engineering Method gives Long Lasting Rich Fragrance - Gentle and Mild Cleansing Scented Body Wash with Natural Surfactant 17.85 Fl Oz\nBouquet Garni\n{'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Skin Type': 'All, Dry', 'Brand': 'Bouquet Garni', 'Scent': 'Garni', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '8.23 x 6.34 x 3.66 inches; 1.34 Pounds'}\n[[VIDEOID:5a1f001511c47e51512c7544aeef60f4]] if you like a musky scent, then this soap is for you. it lathers well (see video) and has a somewhat strong musk scent; not overly strong, but definitely not light. did not dry out my skin. packaged well in a box; pump has a safety guard that doesn't allow the pump to be pressed until it's removed.\nlathers well\nSpray Bottle with Adjustable Nozzle, Suream 10.6oz/300ml Green Mist Sprayer with Stream for Curly Hair, Refillable Empty Plastic Bottle for Hairdressing, Planting, Ironing and Cleaning\nSUREAM\n{'Package Dimensions': '9.88 x 4.49 x 3.07 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'UPC': '735632989217'}\nmade of durable, strong plastic; not flimsy or squeezable like cheaper plastic bottles..nice size and shape. twist open/close spray nozzle. good height, so won\u2019t topple over, even when empty.\ndurable plastic, nice color.\nPet Tear Stain Remover Comb, 8 Pcs Double-Sided Dog Eye Comb Brush, Double Head Grooming Comb, Multipurpose Tool for Small Pet Cat Dogs Crust and Mucus Removal (Silver & Black)\nLBSXQGS\n{'Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Brand': 'LBSXQGS', 'Hair Type': 'Thick', 'Color': 'Silver', 'Size': 'Small', 'Package Dimensions': '9.76 x 6.89 x 0.35 inches; 4.94 Ounces', 'UPC': '805110051801'}\nI tried to use these on my 6lb maltipoo, but she squirmed too much and I was so afraid of poking her eyes with it.
