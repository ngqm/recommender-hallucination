I used it to mix/dilute bleach and other chemical products that needed to be in new, unrecycled bottles. sprayer works fine, although one of them did leak when i turned the bottle upside down. not sure if that would happen with all the bottles, or just this one sprayer that i received. if you have other \"plastic\" spray bottles around your house, it will be easy to forget that this one is GLASS, so just be careful.\nnice set of glass bottles!!\nNo Brainer Gentle Facial Cleanser, 6 fl. oz, For Dry & Sensitive Skin, Leaves Skin Feeling Clean, Soft and Hydrated, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein & Amino Acids Restores Skin by Higher Education Skincare\nHigher Education\n{'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Brand': 'Higher Education', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '6.00 Fl Oz', 'Package Dimensions': '7.2 x 2.3 x 2.3 inches; 8.01 Ounces', 'UPC': '811381030056'}\n[[VIDEOID:b3f95d0500123286d6c86e59790a77bd]] i appreciate a product that has a safety foil, so thumbs up for that! nice, clean scent, that reminds me of cucumbers. a thick, almost gel like consistency; doesn't lather very much, but still leaves face feeling fresh, clean, soft and smooth!\nnice scent, gentle cleanser\nBouquet Garni Body Shower White Musk - Unique Fragrance Decanting Engineering Method gives Long Lasting Rich Fragrance - Gentle and Mild Cleansing Scented Body Wash with Natural Surfactant 17.85 Fl Oz\nBouquet Garni\n{'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Skin Type': 'All, Dry', 'Brand': 'Bouquet Garni', 'Scent': 'Garni', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '8.23 x 6.34 x 3.66 inches; 1.34 Pounds'}\n[[VIDEOID:5a1f001511c47e51512c7544aeef60f4]] if you like a musky scent, then this soap is for you. it lathers well (see video) and has a somewhat strong musk scent; not overly strong, but definitely not light. did not dry out my skin. packaged well in a box; pump has a safety guard that doesn't allow the pump to be pressed until it's removed.\nlathers well\nSpray Bottle with Adjustable Nozzle, Suream 10.6oz/300ml Green Mist Sprayer with Stream for Curly Hair, Refillable Empty Plastic Bottle for Hairdressing, Planting, Ironing and Cleaning\nSUREAM\n{'Package Dimensions': '9.88 x 4.49 x 3.07 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'UPC': '735632989217'}\nmade of durable, strong plastic; not flimsy or squeezable like cheaper plastic bottles..nice size and shape. twist open/close spray nozzle. good height, so won\u2019t topple over, even when empty.\ndurable plastic, nice color.\nPet Tear Stain Remover Comb, 8 Pcs Double-Sided Dog Eye Comb Brush, Double Head Grooming Comb, Multipurpose Tool for Small Pet Cat Dogs Crust and Mucus Removal (Silver & Black)\nLBSXQGS\n{'Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Brand': 'LBSXQGS', 'Hair Type': 'Thick', 'Color': 'Silver', 'Size': 'Small', 'Package Dimensions': '9.76 x 6.89 x 0.35 inches; 4.94 Ounces', 'UPC': '805110051801'}\nI tried to use these on my 6lb maltipoo, but she squirmed too much and I was so afraid of poking her eyes with it.  I used the brush side on her, but it didn't help as much as the puppy comb I use on her regularly. however... these work great for ME!! love it to brush my eyebrows and separate any makeup clumps in my lashes!  not sure what the purpose is of selling these in a pack of 8, except to share and have spare ones everywhere.\nmore safe and useful on human than dog\nBEPHOLAN Natural Eyelash Growth Serum and Brow Enhancer to Grow Thicker, Longer Lashes for Long, Luscious Lashes and Eyebrows|10ML\nBEPHOLAN\n{'Package Dimensions': '5.94 x 1.18 x 1.06 inches; 0.88 Ounces'}\n[[VIDEOID:ab1f3554604ea2e327f24928218d64e1]] I used this for over a month before posting this review. my lashes had no improvement after using this serum. I liked that there was a lot of serum in the small bottle (other serums I've tried always seems like there's not much serum in the bottle), however, a lot of serum gets wasted on the wand because the bottle hole doesn't help to keep any excess inside (see my video for better explanation). still, the bottom line is that this didn't work for me.\nno improvement for me\nNVTED 2 PCS Pet Bath Brush, 2 in 1 Dog Cat Double-Sided Massage Grooming Sponge Bath Shampoo Brushes Soft Silicone Bristles Give Pet Gentle Massage\nNVTED\n{'Brand': 'NVTED', 'Shape': 'Oblong', 'Bristle Material': 'Silicone', 'Unit Count': '2.00 Count', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '8.58 x 6.97 x 2.36 inches; 6.38 Ounces', 'UPC': '711796999392'}\nwe use both brushes to bathe two different breeds, one on a maltese/shitzu and the other on a short haired terrier mix. they both work great and help with the scrubbing. much more effective than just using your hands. the silicone is soft and not rough on their skin. seems very durable and i expect it will last a long time. easy to hold.\ngreat brushes for dog bath\nCOLORGRAM Artist Formula Auto Brow Pencil 0.25g- True Beauty K-Drama Makeup, Built-in-Spoolie, Clump-Free Formula, Softly Glides, Natural Look (05 Gray Brown)\nCOLORGRAM\n{'Brand': 'COLORGRAM', 'Item Form': 'Pencil', 'Finish Type': 'Natural', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Product Benefits': 'Softening'}\ni have very dark brows, but black colored pencils just looks too harsh on me. this gray brown color is a perfect match, to fill in the sparse areas of my brows.  the pencil shape is not a pointy tip, so it\u2019s not really for precision penciling, but more for \u201cfilling in\u201d.  i prefer a natural look, so this works great for my needs.  it\u2019s a twist pencil (no sharpening), and you get about 1\u201d of pencil in the tube.\nperfect color match; natural looking\nROSEGEMM Birthday Gifts For Women- Your Best Friend, Sister, Mom, Wife, Or Any Female!

Not sure if all the items are worth $49, but again, if you need it quick and don't want to put much thought into a personal gift, then this is for you. the rose gold necklace is pretty, and I like that the tumbler is blank with no branding or decorations on it. the bath bombs are mediocre and the candle and body scrub have a light vanilla scent to them. the gift box itself is nice and well packaged. definitely giftable.\nnice gift set with various items\nHMPRT 80s Costumes for Men, Halloween Heavy Metal Rocker Wig with Trucker Hat, Black T-Shirt Outfit, 90s Accessories Blow Up Guitar Music Costume Prop,L\nHMPRT\n['5Pcs Halloween 80s costume include:one 80s hatone 80s mullet wigone 80s black shirtone 80s guitarone wig cap.
