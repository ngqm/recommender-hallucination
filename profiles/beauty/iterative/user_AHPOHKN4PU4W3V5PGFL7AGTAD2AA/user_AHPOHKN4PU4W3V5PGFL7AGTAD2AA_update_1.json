The scent is pretty mild and it lathers richly and my hair does feel nice and clean and soft after using this for a few days. But....there can definitely be a build up if I use it for a week straight. My hair is long and very thick and after a week with this shampoo & matching conditioner I find my hair looks weighed down and flat.\nReview Title: Does a nice job when alternated with other shampoo every few days\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
