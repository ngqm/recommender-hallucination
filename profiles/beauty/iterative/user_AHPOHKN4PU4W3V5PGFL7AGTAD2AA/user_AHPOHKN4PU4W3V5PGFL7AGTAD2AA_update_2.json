They all say they will make your wrinkles or crows feet shrink or smooth out or give your 40 something face a &#34;youthful&#34; glow again. At best, these products moisturize, cleanse, and some provide some protection from sun exposure damage.<br /><br /> This serum from EB5 makes the usual claims, of course, but it's not as outrageously expensive as so many of the other brands. It's a creamy concoction and it takes very little to cover my entire face - the instructions say just use one pump and that is sufficient. There's a faint scent that makes me think of Asian food - I guess that's the sesame seed oil,but the scent fades quickly. It takes about ten minutes to fully absorb into my skin, so I am not using this immediately before going to bed. I haven't had any skin irritation or breaking out in a week. Nor have I noticed any visible difference in the overall condition of my skin and no &#34;plumping&#34; in my laugh lines. My face is soft and it feels just a moisturized as when I use only my regular moisturizer. So....four star rating for no negative reaction and for being a nice enough moisturizer requiring very little product.\nReview Title: Doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. Creamy,  requires very little to use. No actual change to wrinkles.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

My hair is long and very thick and after a week with this shampoo & matching conditioner I find my hair looks weighed down and flat.\nDoes a nice job when alternated with other shampoo every few days\neb5 Collagen Boosting Serum, 1 fl.oz.\neb5\n{'Product Benefits': 'Anti-Aging', 'Scent': 'Green Tea', 'Brand': 'eb5', 'Item Form': 'Serum', 'Material Feature': 'Antioxidant'}\nI'm not a big believer in all the hocus pocus claims made by every single women's skin care product on the market.
