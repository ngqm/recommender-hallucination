One of the ridiculous things is suddenly discovering random hairs on my face. Tweezing is certainly effective, but takes forever and is tiresome.<br /><br />This is the first little shaver of this type I've used. It needs a single AA battery that is not included. It's reasonably quiet when running, has a little light and is easy to hold. It is completely painless as advertised - this actually shaves rather than ripping hair out like those epilator things. It works well and I don't really have any complaints.\nReview Title: Totally painless, needs a battery, but works as it should\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "TRESemme Climate Control Shampoo, 32 Oz\nTRESemm\u00e9\n{'Brand': 'TRESemm\u00e9', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Item Weight': '2.55 Pounds', 'Product Dimensions': '3.2 x 3.2 x 9.2 inches; 2.55 Pounds', 'UPC': '022400651576'}\nI use this in rotation with a couple of other brands. The scent is pretty mild and it lathers richly and my hair does feel nice and clean and soft after using this for a few days. But....there can definitely be a build up if I use it for a week straight. My hair is long and very thick and after a week with this shampoo & matching conditioner I find my hair looks weighed down and flat.\nDoes a nice job when alternated with other shampoo every few days\neb5 Collagen Boosting Serum, 1 fl.oz.\neb5\n{'Product Benefits': 'Anti-Aging', 'Scent': 'Green Tea', 'Brand': 'eb5', 'Item Form': 'Serum', 'Material Feature': 'Antioxidant'}\nI'm not a big believer in all the hocus pocus claims made by every single women's skin care product on the market. They all say they will make your wrinkles or crows feet shrink or smooth out or give your 40 something face a &#34;youthful&#34; glow again. At best, these products moisturize, cleanse, and some provide some protection from sun exposure damage.<br /><br /> This serum from EB5 makes the usual claims, of course, but it's not as outrageously expensive as so many of the other brands. It's a creamy concoction and it takes very little to cover my entire face - the instructions say just use one pump and that is sufficient. There's a faint scent that makes me think of Asian food - I guess that's the sesame seed oil,but the scent fades quickly. It takes about ten minutes to fully absorb into my skin, so I am not using this immediately before going to bed. I haven't had any skin irritation or breaking out in a week. Nor have I noticed any visible difference in the overall condition of my skin and no &#34;plumping&#34; in my laugh lines. My face is soft and it feels just a moisturized as when I use only my regular moisturizer. So....four star rating for no negative reaction and for being a nice enough moisturizer requiring very little product.\nDoesn't irritate my sensitive skin. Creamy,  requires very little to use. No actual change to wrinkles.\nFacial Hair Remover for Women, ZACCER Painless Hair Removal Waterproof Shaver Razor with LED Light for Peach Fuzz Fine Hair Chin Cheek Upper Lip\nZACCER\n{'Brand': 'ZACCER', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Blade Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Head Type': 'Rotary', 'Number of Blades': '2', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.5 x 2.3 x 1.6 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'UPC': '631517350052 680613790910'}\nAs much as I hate to admit it, getting close to 50 brings lots of unpleasant changes and some great ones.
