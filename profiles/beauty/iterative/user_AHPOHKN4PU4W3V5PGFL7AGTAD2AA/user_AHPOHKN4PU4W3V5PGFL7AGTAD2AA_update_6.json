It's in the cars, the house, the horse barn and luggage. We tend to use Purell in the giant wall dispensers in the house and barn, but these big bottles are nice too.<br /><br />The sanitizer smells like what it is. This seems a bit thinner than the Purell, but dries quickly enough. I haven't noticed any sticky residue left behind or excessive drying of our skin. I'm taking one of these with me to West Texas tomorrow for use in the truck and cabin. It fits nicely in my overnight bag pocket.\nReview Title: Seems to work well, no weird residue left behind\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "TRESemme Climate Control Shampoo, 32 Oz\nTRESemm\u00e9\n{'Brand': 'TRESemm\u00e9', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Item Weight': '2.55 Pounds', 'Product Dimensions': '3.2 x 3.2 x 9.2 inches; 2.55 Pounds', 'UPC': '022400651576'}\nI use this in rotation with a couple of other brands. The scent is pretty mild and it lathers richly and my hair does feel nice and clean and soft after using this for a few days. But....there can definitely be a build up if I use it for a week straight. My hair is long and very thick and after a week with this shampoo & matching conditioner I find my hair looks weighed down and flat.\nDoes a nice job when alternated with other shampoo every few days\neb5 Collagen Boosting Serum, 1 fl.oz.\neb5\n{'Product Benefits': 'Anti-Aging', 'Scent': 'Green Tea', 'Brand': 'eb5', 'Item Form': 'Serum', 'Material Feature': 'Antioxidant'}\nI'm not a big believer in all the hocus pocus claims made by every single women's skin care product on the market. They all say they will make your wrinkles or crows feet shrink or smooth out or give your 40 something face a &#34;youthful&#34; glow again. At best, these products moisturize, cleanse, and some provide some protection from sun exposure damage.<br /><br /> This serum from EB5 makes the usual claims, of course, but it's not as outrageously expensive as so many of the other brands. It's a creamy concoction and it takes very little to cover my entire face - the instructions say just use one pump and that is sufficient. There's a faint scent that makes me think of Asian food - I guess that's the sesame seed oil,but the scent fades quickly. It takes about ten minutes to fully absorb into my skin, so I am not using this immediately before going to bed. I haven't had any skin irritation or breaking out in a week. Nor have I noticed any visible difference in the overall condition of my skin and no &#34;plumping&#34; in my laugh lines. My face is soft and it feels just a moisturized as when I use only my regular moisturizer. So....four star rating for no negative reaction and for being a nice enough moisturizer requiring very little product.\nDoesn't irritate my sensitive skin. Creamy,  requires very little to use. No actual change to wrinkles.\nFacial Hair Remover for Women, ZACCER Painless Hair Removal Waterproof Shaver Razor with LED Light for Peach Fuzz Fine Hair Chin Cheek Upper Lip\nZACCER\n{'Brand': 'ZACCER', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Blade Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Head Type': 'Rotary', 'Number of Blades': '2', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.5 x 2.3 x 1.6 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'UPC': '631517350052 680613790910'}\nAs much as I hate to admit it, getting close to 50 brings lots of unpleasant changes and some great ones. One of the ridiculous things is suddenly discovering random hairs on my face. Tweezing is certainly effective, but takes forever and is tiresome.<br /><br />This is the first little shaver of this type I've used. It needs a single AA battery that is not included. It's reasonably quiet when running, has a little light and is easy to hold. It is completely painless as advertised - this actually shaves rather than ripping hair out like those epilator things. It works well and I don't really have any complaints.\nTotally painless, needs a battery, but works as it should\nLilySilk Large Silk Scrunchies for Womens Girls Kids, Green, Pure 100 Real Natural Raw Mulberry Raw Silk, 6A Grade, Beautiful for Hair, Soft, Tie Scrunchies Silk Big Giant\nLilySilk\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.9 x 6.4 x 1.2 inches; 1.59 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'RDUS6111H-02A'}\nI have very thick, very long hair and I work with horses and dogs daily. That means I've got a pony tail every day with a scrunchie. This one is a pretty deep green and it holds my thick hair well. The silk doesn't create friction or split ends and that's good. However, you only get one of these for the price and that is just ridiculous. This thing is no different from any other scrunchie out there except for the silk fabric and that still doesn't make it worth fifteen bucks.\nGood scrunchie for ridiculous price\nBior\u00e9 J-Beauty Makeup Removing Moisturizing Cleansing Jelly, Top Japanese Makeup Remover, Gentle Skin Cleanser, Mild Floral Fragrance, Non-Greasy, 7.8 Ounce\nBior\u00e9\n['Bior\u00e9 J-Beauty Makeup Removing Moisturizing Cleansing Jelly is a non-greasy makeup remover that removes dirt and impurities from deep below the surface of your skin. This top Japanese makeup remover glides on gently and leaves no sticky residue. Formulated with conditioning beauty essence, this jelly leaves skin feeling moisturized and free of makeup. Satisfaction Guaranteed. Limitations may apply.']\n{'Product Dimensions': '1.56 x 2.5 x 7.25 inches; 10.08 Ounces', 'Item model number': '28077_obs', 'UPC': '019100264557', 'Manufacturer': 'Kao USA Inc.'}\nWipes like this are a fill in for actually washing your face with real soap and water,  but they do come in handy sometimes.  I was using these after working horses and shoveling stalls. The wipes are thick enough to get the grime off without tearing. However, after three days, my face broke out in two spots! My friend tried them and after three days, she says she's fine. So it's just me I guess.\nThick and good at removing grime\n2-Pack Puretize 16.9 Oz Hand Sanitizing Gel w/Pump Tops - Extra Strength 70% Ethyl Alcohol - Moisturizing Formula with Aloe Vera, Vitamin E & Botanical Extracts - Quick Drying Formula\nPure Daily Care\n{'Brand': 'Pure Daily Care', 'Unit Count': '33.8 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Special Feature': 'Moisturizing', 'Scent': 'Unscented', 'Package Dimensions': '7 x 6.5 x 4.5 inches; 1.06 Pounds', 'UPC': '810016711360'}\nBetween regular,  every day germs and now Covid-19, we go through a bunch of sanitizer.
