I assume the other is in the same boat, despite being unrefined. Which is a shame, since that is what I got them for. Oh well, partly my fault I guess for not reading the fine print.\nWish I'd seen \"refined\" before selecting.\n8 PCS 40ML Mini Spray Bottles, FANDAMEI Fine Mist Plastic Spray Bottles, Empty Refillable Clear Atomizer for Cleaning, Travel, Essential Oils, Perfume, Makeup Liquids.
