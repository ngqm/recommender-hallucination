This worked up a good lather, not the best, but better than others with a washcloth; the lather didn't disappear either so I didn't need to keep going back to the soap. It's a nice size, larger than others I've tried, and seems like it will last at least a week, probably longer. Non-daily use it could last much longer. As far as moisturizing, I can at least say it didn't dry me out, which is a plus.\nReview Title: Faint scent doesn't linger, good lather.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I assume the other is in the same boat, despite being unrefined. Which is a shame, since that is what I got them for.
