I love that each bottle has the color at the top of the cap. So often it's hard to find the color you're looking for. I got a couple of sets from this company, and they're all quality.\nLove the colors, and that each bottle has the color on the top of the cap.\nGel Nail Polish Set, Glitter 6 Colors Gel Polish Kit Popular Nail Art Design Soak Off LED Lamp Nail Polish Gel Manicure Kit Gifts Set for Girls Women Professional DIY Home Use\nAnzuo\n{'Brand': 'Anzuo', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'gel', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Special Feature': 'Long Lasting', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '6.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '6', 'Number of Pieces': '6', 'Product Dimensions': '5.12 x 3.15 x 3.54 inches; 10.23 Ounces'}\nThese are fun colors; I'd say more New Years Eve party than Xmas. I like that it comes with stickers to mark the top of the caps, but I wish each bottle had the color at the top of the cap already, since it can take some time for the polish to dry. I guess you could write it down? So often it's hard to find the color you're looking for.

Would have preferred color already on cap.\nOrganic Sweet Almond Oil and Fractionated Coconut Oil Bundle for Hair and Skin, 100% Pure and Natural, Hexane-Free, Moisturizing, For Healthy Skin, Silky Hair, Multiuse Body Oil, 16 fl. Oz X 2\nShiny Leaf\n{'Brand': 'Shiny Leaf', 'Scent': 'Almond Oil and Fractionated Coconut', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Unit Count': '32.00 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Package Dimensions': '8.62 x 5.04 x 2.48 inches; 2.23 Pounds', 'UPC': '781584950669'}\nAs another reviewer said, in much better detail so I'll keep my review brief, the coconut oil being refined does nothing for skincare. I assume the other is in the same boat, despite being unrefined. Which is a shame, since that is what I got them for. Oh well, partly my fault I guess for not reading the fine print.\nWish I'd seen \"refined\" before selecting.\n8 PCS 40ML Mini Spray Bottles, FANDAMEI Fine Mist Plastic Spray Bottles, Empty Refillable Clear Atomizer for Cleaning, Travel, Essential Oils, Perfume, Makeup Liquids.

Good price. The two colors make it a little easier for organization.\nSturdy, compact spray bottles.\nHeyedrate Activated Charcoal Soap Bar and Face Wash | Organic, Vegan, Natural Soap made with Dead Sea Mud and Our Essential Oil Blend (1 Pack (5 Ounces))\nEye Love\n{'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Brand': 'Eye Love', 'Scent': 'Eucalyptus, Coconut, Grapefruit, Rosemary', 'Material Feature': 'Organic, Natural, Vegan', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '4 x 1 x 1 inches; 4.97 Ounces', 'UPC': '850436007827'}\nI like the ingredients, not super in love with the scent, but it's faint and doesn't linger, so no problem really. This worked up a good lather, not the best, but better than others with a washcloth; the lather didn't disappear either so I didn't need to keep going back to the soap. It's a nice size, larger than others I've tried, and seems like it will last at least a week, probably longer. Non-daily use it could last much longer. As far as moisturizing, I can at least say it didn't dry me out, which is a plus.\nFaint scent doesn't linger, good lather.\nScrunchie Holder Stands with 8 Pack Large Size Scrunchies - Acrylic Hair Ties Organizer for Teenage Girls and VSCO Girls Gift Stuff\nBeeager\n{'Color': 'Yellow,Gray,White', 'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Item Form': 'Scrunchie', 'Brand': 'Beeager', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Package Dimensions': '10.55 x 3.98 x 3.7 inches; 10.86 Ounces'}\nA scrunchy stand is a great idea.
