I took a couple pictures showing and comparing my eyelashes before and after applying. The mascara was a little pastey but step 1 applied ok and looked fine, but step 2 completely ruined my eyelashes. It looked horrible; The left side got clumped together and the right side looked like my eyelashes were growing baby eyelashes. Very unnatural looking. This claims to be flake free but after it dried i noticed a few little black specks on my cheeks. I had to use one of my old dried up mascara brushes to separate my lashes to fix them. It's also very hard to wash off.\nReview Title: After step 2 my eyelashes looked horrible\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
