Oz', 'Flavor': 'Unflavored', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.41 x 1.5 x 1.5 inches; 3.2 Ounces', 'UPC': '853647007044', 'Manufacturer': 'Raise Them Well'}\nReview Text: I got this to use on my 1 year old! The quality seemed great (all natural, organic and enhanced with fulvic acid!). Ithought it could help her sleep better especially on nights where she is having a hard time (due to teething for an example.) Its easy to apply, rubs in and absorbs well but does feel a little sticky afterwards. It doesnt have much of a smell either maybe a little like lavender but gentle. Ive been doing one pump and rubbing it on her feet and she likes the little foot massage. I could tell it helps her sleep better. She wakes up/squirms less, maybe helping her get a deeper sleep. Very happy to have this for the rough nights.\nReview Title: Works well, a little sticky after-feeling\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

To do so may cause blindness&#34; so i dont know why people are condoning the use of this product on their eyebrows/ eye area. i guess they dont care there is a chance of losing eye sight. also amazon needs to remove this from results for eyebrow tint... glad i saw before i bought!\nNot for use near eyes! may cause blindness!\nSegbeauty empty bottle 290\nTruuMe\n{'Brand': 'Segbeauty', 'Color': 'Clear', 'Material Type Free': 'Dairy Free', 'Item Weight': '3.4 Ounces', 'Bottle Nipple Type': 'Vented', 'Package Dimensions': '7.99 x 3.19 x 2.24 inches; 3.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'AM-160083-03', 'UPC': '701822757553 701822760621'}\nThis mister is awesome! I got it to use on my house plants and it works great. It holds a little of 5oz, the mist very fine, handle is easy to pull, and it's a continuous spray for few seconds per handle pump!

I took a couple pictures showing and comparing my eyelashes before and after applying. The mascara was a little pastey but step 1 applied ok and looked fine, but step 2 completely ruined my eyelashes. It looked horrible; The left side got clumped together and the right side looked like my eyelashes were growing baby eyelashes. Very unnatural looking. This claims to be flake free but after it dried i noticed a few little black specks on my cheeks. I had to use one of my old dried up mascara brushes to separate my lashes to fix them. It's also very hard to wash off.\nAfter step 2 my eyelashes looked horrible\nMagnesium Serum For Kids - All Natural Rub for Kids and Babies, Toxic Free + Free Magnesium Chart PDF\nRaise Them Well\n{'Brand': 'Raise Them Well', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Unit Count': '2 Fl.
