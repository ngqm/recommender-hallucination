It\u2019s very bouncy and not too heavy. Also a plus that the wig is ready to wear and you don\u2019t need to trim any of the front pieces.\nGreat Quality\n4240Pcs Flatback White Opal Rhinestones Glass Crystal Gemstones for Nail Art Face Makeup Glitter Round with Tweezers and Picking Pen (SS6~SS20 Set)\nMEIBITE\n{'Brand': 'MEIBITE', 'Shape': 'Round', 'Number of Pieces': '1', 'Item Form': 'Pen', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Crafts, Nail Arts, Arts', 'Package Dimensions': '7.2 x 4.33 x 0.59 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '749666774886'}\nHad to knock some stars off because of the poor packaging. Yes, you get tons of rhinestones\u2026 so much that I guess it popped off the lid. Thankfully it was enclosed in another packaging. I spent about an hour with tweezers putting the sizes back in the correct spots.\nLots of rhinestones but\u2026\nL\u2019ANGE HAIR Pocket Size Comb | Blush Acetate | Compact Design for Travel | Easy Glide Mini Wide Tooth Comb\nL'ANGE HAIR\n{'Brand': \"L'ANGE HAIR\", 'Hair Type': 'Wavy, Dry', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Product Dimensions': '5 x 3.63 x 0.25 inches; 1.45 Ounces', 'Item model number': '2438', 'UPC': '810108191001'}\nEverything about this pocket size comb is great. I love the pearl pink color and the comb itself is nice and thick. Almost feels like it detangles my hair as I use it. The packaging was neat and the white pouch it comes in is bright white & soft. This will fit in any purse I choose to wear - big or small.\nLove this Comb!\nProfessional Electric Nail Drill, Rechargeable 35000 RPM E-File Nail Drill Kit for Gel, Acrylic Nails, Manicure Pedicure Polishing Tools with 16 Pcs Bits, Great for Home or Salon (Black)\nPLIISLUP\n{'Brand': 'PLIISLUP', 'Color': 'Black', 'Material': 'Aluminum, Metal', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '6.8 x 2.7 x 0.9 inches', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Product Dimensions': '6.8 x 2.7 x 0.9 inches; 1.32 Pounds', 'Batteries': '1 Lithium Ion batteries required. (included)', 'Manufacturer': 'PLIISLUP'}\nI have recently decided to get into doing acrylics and was looking for a nail drill- I\u2019m picky about getting items unless it\u2019s quality AND aesthetically appealing..well, this one was both! Love the different pinks and the nail bits have been easy to figure out (comes with instructions) so far. The drill came nicely packaged and is quieter than any other drill I have heard.\nGreat Nail Drill\nMilyBest Fluffy Lashes False Eyelashes Natural Look Cat Eye Lashes, Dramatic Faux Mink Lashes 3D Effect 18mm D Curl Volume Extension Reusable Wispy Lashes Pack 10 Pairs\nMilyBest\n{'Color': 'B-Sweet Date | 18MM', 'Brand': 'MilyBest', 'Material': 'Faux Mink, Plastic, Cotton', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '7.44 x 4.02 x 0.69 inches', 'Material Feature': 'Cruelty Free', 'Product Dimensions': '7.44 x 4.02 x 0.69 inches; 0.32 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'QC10-T02', 'Manufacturer': 'MilyBest', 'Country of Origin': 'China'}\nYou get so many lashes for the price..these are fluffy and I like that there are different variations. I usually wear lashes with a clear band, so I will be using these for costumes and dramatic looks.

I like this comb and it\u2019s convenient to travel with, however I do believe the price point is a little too much for this item.\nGreat Travel Comb\nMEICOLY Fake Blood Washable,1.06oz Edible Stage Blood,Realistic Drips Sticky Fake Blood with Brush,Safe for Mouth,Teeth,Nosebleed,Halloween,Cosplay,SFX Makeup,Special Effects Cut Flesh Wound,Bright\nMEICOLY\n{'Color': '1.06 oz stage blood,bright', 'Brand': 'MEICOLY', 'Item Weight': '1.06 Ounces', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Package Information': 'Bottle', 'Product Dimensions': '5.12 x 3.15 x 1.18 inches; 1.06 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'MEICOLY', 'Country of Origin': 'China'}\nGreat add on to any Halloween costume or one that you want to make more realistic.

My first time ever wearing half lashes and my experience was<br /><br />\u2022 forgot I was wearing lashes because they are so light<br />\u2022 incredibly easy for anyone to put on!<br />\u2022 no need to worry about the corners lifting up because it\u2019s barely noticeable if they do<br />\u2022 wore comfortably for over 10 hours<br /><br />What a great price for 10 lashes as well!
