It\u2019s very bouncy and not too heavy.

Yes, you get tons of rhinestones\u2026 so much that I guess it popped off the lid. Thankfully it was enclosed in another packaging. I spent about an hour with tweezers putting the sizes back in the correct spots.\nLots of rhinestones but\u2026\nL\u2019ANGE HAIR Pocket Size Comb | Blush Acetate | Compact Design for Travel | Easy Glide Mini Wide Tooth Comb\nL'ANGE HAIR\n{'Brand': \"L'ANGE HAIR\", 'Hair Type': 'Wavy, Dry', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Product Dimensions': '5 x 3.63 x 0.25 inches; 1.45 Ounces', 'Item model number': '2438', 'UPC': '810108191001'}\nEverything about this pocket size comb is great. I love the pearl pink color and the comb itself is nice and thick. Almost feels like it detangles my hair as I use it. The packaging was neat and the white pouch it comes in is bright white & soft. This will fit in any purse I choose to wear - big or small.\nLove this Comb!\nProfessional Electric Nail Drill, Rechargeable 35000 RPM E-File Nail Drill Kit for Gel, Acrylic Nails, Manicure Pedicure Polishing Tools with 16 Pcs Bits, Great for Home or Salon (Black)\nPLIISLUP\n{'Brand': 'PLIISLUP', 'Color': 'Black', 'Material': 'Aluminum, Metal', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '6.8 x 2.7 x 0.9 inches', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Product Dimensions': '6.8 x 2.7 x 0.9 inches; 1.32 Pounds', 'Batteries': '1 Lithium Ion batteries required.

Love the different pinks and the nail bits have been easy to figure out (comes with instructions) so far.

I like this comb and it\u2019s convenient to travel with, however I do believe the price point is a little too much for this item.\nGreat Travel Comb\nMEICOLY Fake Blood Washable,1.06oz Edible Stage Blood,Realistic Drips Sticky Fake Blood with Brush,Safe for Mouth,Teeth,Nosebleed,Halloween,Cosplay,SFX Makeup,Special Effects Cut Flesh Wound,Bright\nMEICOLY\n{'Color': '1.06 oz stage blood,bright', 'Brand': 'MEICOLY', 'Item Weight': '1.06 Ounces', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Package Information': 'Bottle', 'Product Dimensions': '5.12 x 3.15 x 1.18 inches; 1.06 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'MEICOLY', 'Country of Origin': 'China'}\nGreat add on to any Halloween costume or one that you want to make more realistic.
