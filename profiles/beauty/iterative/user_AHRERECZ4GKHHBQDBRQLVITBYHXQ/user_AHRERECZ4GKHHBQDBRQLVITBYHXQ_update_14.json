It\u2019s very bouncy and not too heavy.

Yes, you get tons of rhinestones\u2026 so much that I guess it popped off the lid. Thankfully it was enclosed in another packaging. I spent about an hour with tweezers putting the sizes back in the correct spots.\nLots of rhinestones but\u2026\nL\u2019ANGE HAIR Pocket Size Comb | Blush Acetate | Compact Design for Travel | Easy Glide Mini Wide Tooth Comb\nL'ANGE HAIR\n{'Brand': \"L'ANGE HAIR\", 'Hair Type': 'Wavy, Dry', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Product Dimensions': '5 x 3.63 x 0.25 inches; 1.45 Ounces', 'Item model number': '2438', 'UPC': '810108191001'}\nEverything about this pocket size comb is great.

This will fit in any purse I choose to wear - big or small.\nLove this Comb!\nProfessional Electric Nail Drill, Rechargeable 35000 RPM E-File Nail Drill Kit for Gel, Acrylic Nails, Manicure Pedicure Polishing Tools with 16 Pcs Bits, Great for Home or Salon (Black)\nPLIISLUP\n{'Brand': 'PLIISLUP', 'Color': 'Black', 'Material': 'Aluminum, Metal', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '6.8 x 2.7 x 0.9 inches', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Product Dimensions': '6.8 x 2.7 x 0.9 inches; 1.32 Pounds', 'Batteries': '1 Lithium Ion batteries required.
