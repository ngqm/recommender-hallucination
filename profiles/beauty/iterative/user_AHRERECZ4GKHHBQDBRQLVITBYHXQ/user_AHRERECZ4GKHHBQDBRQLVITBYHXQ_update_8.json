It\u2019s very bouncy and not too heavy. Also a plus that the wig is ready to wear and you don\u2019t need to trim any of the front pieces.\nGreat Quality\n4240Pcs Flatback White Opal Rhinestones Glass Crystal Gemstones for Nail Art Face Makeup Glitter Round with Tweezers and Picking Pen (SS6~SS20 Set)\nMEIBITE\n{'Brand': 'MEIBITE', 'Shape': 'Round', 'Number of Pieces': '1', 'Item Form': 'Pen', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Crafts, Nail Arts, Arts', 'Package Dimensions': '7.2 x 4.33 x 0.59 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '749666774886'}\nHad to knock some stars off because of the poor packaging. Yes, you get tons of rhinestones\u2026 so much that I guess it popped off the lid. Thankfully it was enclosed in another packaging. I spent about an hour with tweezers putting the sizes back in the correct spots.\nLots of rhinestones but\u2026\nL\u2019ANGE HAIR Pocket Size Comb | Blush Acetate | Compact Design for Travel | Easy Glide Mini Wide Tooth Comb\nL'ANGE HAIR\n{'Brand': \"L'ANGE HAIR\", 'Hair Type': 'Wavy, Dry', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Product Dimensions': '5 x 3.63 x 0.25 inches; 1.45 Ounces', 'Item model number': '2438', 'UPC': '810108191001'}\nEverything about this pocket size comb is great.

This will fit in any purse I choose to wear - big or small.\nLove this Comb!\nProfessional Electric Nail Drill, Rechargeable 35000 RPM E-File Nail Drill Kit for Gel, Acrylic Nails, Manicure Pedicure Polishing Tools with 16 Pcs Bits, Great for Home or Salon (Black)\nPLIISLUP\n{'Brand': 'PLIISLUP', 'Color': 'Black', 'Material': 'Aluminum, Metal', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '6.8 x 2.7 x 0.9 inches', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Product Dimensions': '6.8 x 2.7 x 0.9 inches; 1.32 Pounds', 'Batteries': '1 Lithium Ion batteries required. (included)', 'Manufacturer': 'PLIISLUP'}\nI have recently decided to get into doing acrylics and was looking for a nail drill- I\u2019m picky about getting items unless it\u2019s quality AND aesthetically appealing..well, this one was both! Love the different pinks and the nail bits have been easy to figure out (comes with instructions) so far.
