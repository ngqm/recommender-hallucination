They are not super pigmented, but very easy to work with. This is a very nice beginner palette, especially for the under 10 price.<br />That said, these need a primer. They last an okay amount of time, but will fade quickly if you don\u2019t use a primer.<br />Simple cardboard container, very similar to colourpop and bh, but doesn\u2019t have a mirror. Still it\u2019s sturdy and all the pans arrived unbroken!<br />The shades are arranged nicely, it really has a visual appeal, and makes choosing an eye look easier.<br />It\u2019s realky not bad, and while my tastes typically run towards the more luxury and pigmented, this is a good entry for a beginner or lighter makeup user.<br />I will be looking into other palettes by this brand.\nReview Title: High 3 stars\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "30 PCS Blue Hair Care Rollers Hair Curlers Silicone No Clip Hair Style Rollers Soft Magic DIY Curling Hairstyle Tools Hair Accessories\nONEONEY\n{'Item Form': 'Clip', 'Material': 'Silicone', 'Brand': 'ONEONEY', 'Unit Count': '30.00 Count', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.52 x 5.31 x 2.68 inches; 8.57 Ounces'}\nThese are an inexpensive and fairly comfortable way to roll my hair at night. It makes getting up and being ready to go in the morning much faster, since all I have to do is unroll, give a spray and shake - and bam waves for days.<br />However, the quality is decent but not great, one of the rollers looked like it was left out side and got chewed on. But, 1 out of 30 (I counted them) is still good odds for the price.<br />They came in the matching clear blue zipper bag, and are easy to store. I'd happily purchase another set.\nComfy curls\nAG Care Natural Remedy Apple Cider Vinegar Leave On Mist\n{'Brand': 'AG Care', 'Item Form': 'Spray', 'Material Feature': 'Plant Based, Vegan', 'Hair Type': 'All, Color Treated', 'Product Benefits': 'Gently cleanses and seals cuticle to enhance shine.

While it applies strong, it dissipated and left behind a soft clean spicy smell.<br />It worked really well, and was best when I used it after a work out on damp hair vs dry or showered.<br />It\u2019s a nice product in my easy care hair Arsenal, I will be picking it up again for my gym bag for sure!\nSoft hair, smells great!\nThe Sunset Dusk Palette | 15 Color Eye Shadow of BEAUTY GLAZED Eyeshadow Palette | QyeeCosmetics. - Amazon Vine\nQyee Cosmetics\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.1 x 4.1 x 0.6 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'UPC': '725714076539'}\nThis is actually a decent palette of eyeshadows.
