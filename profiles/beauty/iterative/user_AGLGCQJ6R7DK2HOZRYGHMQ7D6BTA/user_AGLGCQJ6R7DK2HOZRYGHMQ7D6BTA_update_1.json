It makes getting up and being ready to go in the morning much faster, since all I have to do is unroll, give a spray and shake - and bam waves for days.<br />However, the quality is decent but not great, one of the rollers looked like it was left out side and got chewed on. But, 1 out of 30 (I counted them) is still good odds for the price.<br />They came in the matching clear blue zipper bag, and are easy to store. I'd happily purchase another set.\nReview Title: Comfy curls\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
