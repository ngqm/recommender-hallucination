Go for it. It's not overly sticky, though the consistency is weird and rubbery coming out of the tube.<br />It goes on dark, dries quickly and doesn't smudge. Does it really lengthen? Eh. Not really for me. But, it's not messy or flaky.<br />I don't know if I will repurchase, but the price point is good.\nReview Title: Cheap and dark\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "30 PCS Blue Hair Care Rollers Hair Curlers Silicone No Clip Hair Style Rollers Soft Magic DIY Curling Hairstyle Tools Hair Accessories\nONEONEY\n{'Item Form': 'Clip', 'Material': 'Silicone', 'Brand': 'ONEONEY', 'Unit Count': '30.00 Count', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.52 x 5.31 x 2.68 inches; 8.57 Ounces'}\nThese are an inexpensive and fairly comfortable way to roll my hair at night. It makes getting up and being ready to go in the morning much faster, since all I have to do is unroll, give a spray and shake - and bam waves for days.<br />However, the quality is decent but not great, one of the rollers looked like it was left out side and got chewed on. But, 1 out of 30 (I counted them) is still good odds for the price.<br />They came in the matching clear blue zipper bag, and are easy to store. I'd happily purchase another set.\nComfy curls\nAG Care Natural Remedy Apple Cider Vinegar Leave On Mist\n{'Brand': 'AG Care', 'Item Form': 'Spray', 'Material Feature': 'Plant Based, Vegan', 'Hair Type': 'All, Color Treated', 'Product Benefits': 'Gently cleanses and seals cuticle to enhance shine. Superfoods and apple cider vinegar support soft, healthy hair.Gently cleanses and seals cuticle to enhance shine. Superfoods and apple cider vinegar support soft, healthy hair.  See more', 'Product Dimensions': '1.75 x 1.75 x 6 inches; 6.14 Ounces', 'Item model number': '100150', 'UPC': '625336002391', 'Manufacturer': 'AG Hair', 'Country of Origin': 'Canada'}\nThis leave in hair remedy from AG smells wonderful, like a sweet and spicy scent. While it applies strong, it dissipated and left behind a soft clean spicy smell.<br />It worked really well, and was best when I used it after a work out on damp hair vs dry or showered.<br />It\u2019s a nice product in my easy care hair Arsenal, I will be picking it up again for my gym bag for sure!\nSoft hair, smells great!\nThe Sunset Dusk Palette | 15 Color Eye Shadow of BEAUTY GLAZED Eyeshadow Palette | QyeeCosmetics. - Amazon Vine\nQyee Cosmetics\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.1 x 4.1 x 0.6 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'UPC': '725714076539'}\nThis is actually a decent palette of eyeshadows. They are not super pigmented, but very easy to work with. This is a very nice beginner palette, especially for the under 10 price.<br />That said, these need a primer. They last an okay amount of time, but will fade quickly if you don\u2019t use a primer.<br />Simple cardboard container, very similar to colourpop and bh, but doesn\u2019t have a mirror. Still it\u2019s sturdy and all the pans arrived unbroken!<br />The shades are arranged nicely, it really has a visual appeal, and makes choosing an eye look easier.<br />It\u2019s realky not bad, and while my tastes typically run towards the more luxury and pigmented, this is a good entry for a beginner or lighter makeup user.<br />I will be looking into other palettes by this brand.\nHigh 3 stars\nTOUCH IN SOL Flawless Skin Top Coat 1.18 fl.oz. (35ml) - One Step Makeup (Nourishing Ampoule + High Adhesive Makeup Base + Fresh Silky Powder), Moisturizing High Coverage Foundation (#1 Light)\nTouch in Sol\n{'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'Touch in Sol', 'Coverage': 'Light', 'Product Benefits': 'Moisturizing,Flawless Skin', 'Package Dimensions': '4 x 2.3 x 2.3 inches; 4.8 Ounces'}\nMy friend recommended this Touch in Sol Flawless skin top coat, and I am so glad she did.<br />It is really more of a foundation, it has perfect medium coverage. It feels amazing on my skin, light and silky smooth. It leaves me looking matte, but not dry. It's surprisingly radiant.<br />I use it over the Touch in Sol primer, without setting powder, and it easily lasts the whole day.<br />So, here I am recommending it to you! Try it! It's amazing!\nFlawless Foundation\n100 pcs Compressed Facial Mask Women DIY Beauty Facial Cotton Paper Compress Masque Disposable Dry Sheet Mask for Skin Face Care\nEvoio\n{'Brand': 'Evoio', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Scent': 'Cotton Paper', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Unit Count': '100.00 Count', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '9.29 x 4.41 x 2.87 inches; 5.96 Ounces'}\nI wasn't sure what to expect from these compressed facial masks in terms of quality, as reviews were across the board. But, they far exceeded my needs and expectations!<br />They are about the size of three dimes stacked, and are embossed with little flowers on top, which is really just a pretty presentation.<br />They expand easily with moisture, I mixed up my own serum solution with essential oil, and it was easy to soak and unfold. I worried I would have to be super delicate so as not to tear the paper, but these are more of a fabric than tissue.<br />In fact, I opened one up to test it's durability. I used some warm water, added some dish soap and went to town scrubbing my basin. No tears, no ripping, no holes. (In fact it cleaned up really well). I used some extra pulling pressure on the cut parts, mouth, eyes chin, and as expected had tears and stretching happen, but that was with abnormal applied pressure.<br />They didn't smell, they didn't feel weird, and they fit great. For the relaxing usage of a home facial these little compact masks are perfect. I know exactly what I'm putting on my face.\nSuper little facial masks!\nWomen Facial Razor for Hair Removal - Dermaplaning Tool Peach Fuzz Trimmer Womens Fine Hair Remover Eyebrow Razors and Dermaplane Face Shavers Women's Exfoliating for Sensitive Skin Essential Travel\nMODEMODE\n[\"MODEMODE Women's Facial Razor Home Dermaplaning - Eyebrow Razor For Women Face Peach Fuzz Hair Removal Womens Face Exfoliating At Daily Eyebrow Shaping Tool\"]\n{'Brand': 'MODEMODE', 'Number of Blades': '1', 'Unit Count': '5.0 Count', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '5 x 1.2 x 0.5 inches; 1.59 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'MODEMODE'}\nThese are some pretty fantastic razors. They are straight edged, but the provided safety edging prevents me from nicking myself while keeping the blade close to my skin.<br />It removes peach fuzz quickly, efficiently. My skin is super smooth for about a week after use. My makeup goes on like butter, and I am convinced my moisturizers and serums also work better on my dermaplaned skin.<br />They are small and precision enough that I can use them around my eyebrows, though I go slow and don't usually use them for that.<br />But for my upper lip, chin, cheeks and forehead I don't know how I got by before these. While my easy to use electric is nice, these are so much closer. Will be a faithful weekly user!\nDermaplaning-tastic\nMountain Falls Advanced Formula Nail Polish Remover Pads with 96% Acetone, for Natural Nails, 10 Count\nMountain Falls\n{'Brand': 'Mountain Falls', 'Item Form': 'Pad', 'Item Weight': '0.01 Pounds', 'Unit Count': '10 Count'}\nI wasn't expecting to love these nearly as much as I do. Thick, large and easily removes all ten nails worth of polish without making my fingers feel overly dried out like using my regular polish remover.<br />Because they are all individually sealed I can keep one in my bag for any polish removing emergencies, which trust me... they happen.<br />These work fast, I don't know what makes the formula 'advanced' but the process is quick and clean.<br />The smell isn't overwhelming, just the basic remover smell. Works great, travels even better. I'll be keeping these on hand!\nSuper Convienent!\nNatwag Makeup Remover Pads,18 Pack 3.74 Inch Reusable Microfiber Cleansing Pad with Laundry Bag Suitable for All Skin Types,3 Color Facial Cleansing Pad Set.\nNatwag\n{'Brand': 'Natwag', 'Skin Type': 'All Skin,Dry', 'Material Feature': 'Reusable', 'Unit Count': '18.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '18', 'Package Dimensions': '4.4 x 4.37 x 2.59 inches; 3.84 Ounces', 'UPC': '745103569701'}\nI adore these makeup remover rounds. They are the perfect size for a clean face, or even just to remove my eye makeup. No getting water everywhere, no harsh chemicals or cleansers, and there is plenty in this set so that I can just use and wash a new one each time.<br />They are very soft, but don't let that mislead you. Add some water, and wipe away the day. Flip it to the longer side and buff and exfoliate. Super soft, super clean skin - zero irritations.<br />Highly recommend and will never be using disposable face wipes again!\nCleansing Pads\nQTMY Crystal Gemstone Headbands Baroque Hair Accessories Head Band Fashion Headwear Hairbands for Women,Pink\nQTMY\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.32 x 5.63 x 1.02 inches; 2.82 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'ZJ', 'Department': 'womens', 'Manufacturer': 'QTMY'}\nThis is a very comfortable headband, it does not have any under grip however and does slip a little. But, it's worth the minor adjustments when wearing.<br />Very sparkly, this gives off everyday princess vibes. Plenty of color to match just about anything, and arrived without any missing crystals or pokey spots,<br />Well made and pretty!!\nFancy Flair\nSesame Street, Bubble Bath, Extra Sensitive, 16 Oz, Pack of 6\nSesame Street\n{'Brand': 'Sesame Street', 'Scent': 'sesame', 'Product Benefits': 'Nourished,Moisturizing', 'Unit Count': '96 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '6', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '9.84 x 7.68 x 5.28 inches; 1 Pounds', 'Item model number': '28051', 'UPC': '735303280513', 'Manufacturer': 'The Village Company'}\nThis is a great bubble bath, soft silky bubbles, long lasting and the scent is really pretty. Not overly strong, and super gentle on my toddlers skin.<br />Happy bath times = happy me!\nSesame Street Bubble Bath\nAldqtz 3PCS Large Star Matte Hair Claw Clips ,Big Nonslip Cute Strong Hold Jaw Clip for Thin Hair Long Hair Thick Hair ,Perfect Star Hair Claw Clips for Women Girls\nAldqtz\n{'Brand': 'Aldqtz', 'Hair Type': 'Curly, Straight', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Style': 'Claw', 'Embellishment': 'Resin', 'Package Dimensions': '9.57 x 4.37 x 1.85 inches; 2.08 Ounces', 'UPC': '725683934441'}\nThis adorable star clip set my hair game bar so high that after wearing it I have no where to go but down.<br />It held my hair up comfortably all day, and I have a thick amount of hair. It also held up my daughters without any issue.<br />It's distinctive shape is so much cuter than the typical claw clip.<br />Highly recommend!!!\nStars Aligned\nFiber Lash Mascara 2pcs Waterproof Dense Extra High Lash Blast Voluminous Lengthening Mascara Black, 0.54 Fl Oz\nMarine Forest\n{'Product Benefits': 'Lengthening', 'Brand': 'Marine Forest', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Item Volume': '0.27 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Information': 'Tube', 'Package Dimensions': '5 x 1.77 x 0.91 inches; 2.82 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'E3050-2', 'UPC': '762403106955'}\nThis mascaras is worth the price, a set of two for under 10? Go for it. It's not overly sticky, though the consistency is weird and rubbery coming out of the tube.<br />It goes on dark, dries quickly and doesn't smudge. Does it really lengthen? Eh. Not really for me. But, it's not messy or flaky.<br />I don't know if I will repurchase, but the price point is good.\nCheap and dark",
