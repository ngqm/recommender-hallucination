  "reference_summary": "30 PCS Blue Hair Care Rollers Hair Curlers Silicone No Clip Hair Style Rollers Soft Magic DIY Curling Hairstyle Tools Hair Accessories\nONEONEY\n{'Item Form': 'Clip', 'Material': 'Silicone', 'Brand': 'ONEONEY', 'Unit Count': '30.00 Count', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.52 x 5.31 x 2.68 inches; 8.57 Ounces'}\nThese are an inexpensive and fairly comfortable way to roll my hair at night. It makes getting up and being ready to go in the morning much faster, since all I have to do is unroll, give a spray and shake - and bam waves for days.<br />However, the quality is decent but not great, one of the rollers looked like it was left out side and got chewed on. But, 1 out of 30 (I counted them) is still good odds for the price.<br />They came in the matching clear blue zipper bag, and are easy to store. I'd happily purchase another set.\nComfy curls\nAG Care Natural Remedy Apple Cider Vinegar Leave On Mist\n{'Brand': 'AG Care', 'Item Form': 'Spray', 'Material Feature': 'Plant Based, Vegan', 'Hair Type': 'All, Color Treated', 'Product Benefits': 'Gently cleanses and seals cuticle to enhance shine. Superfoods and apple cider vinegar support soft, healthy hair.Gently cleanses and seals cuticle to enhance shine. Superfoods and apple cider vinegar support soft, healthy hair.  See more', 'Product Dimensions': '1.75 x 1.75 x 6 inches; 6.14 Ounces', 'Item model number': '100150', 'UPC': '625336002391', 'Manufacturer': 'AG Hair', 'Country of Origin': 'Canada'}\nThis leave in hair remedy from AG smells wonderful, like a sweet and spicy scent. While it applies strong, it dissipated and left behind a soft clean spicy smell.<br />It worked really well, and was best when I used it after a work out on damp hair vs dry or showered.<br />It\u2019s a nice product in my easy care hair Arsenal, I will be picking it up again for my gym bag for sure!\nSoft hair, smells great!\nThe Sunset Dusk Palette | 15 Color Eye Shadow of BEAUTY GLAZED Eyeshadow Palette | QyeeCosmetics. - Amazon Vine\nQyee Cosmetics\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.1 x 4.1 x 0.6 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'UPC': '725714076539'}\nThis is actually a decent palette of eyeshadows. They are not super pigmented, but very easy to work with. This is a very nice beginner palette, especially for the under 10 price.<br />That said, these need a primer. They last an okay amount of time, but will fade quickly if you don\u2019t use a primer.<br />Simple cardboard container, very similar to colourpop and bh, but doesn\u2019t have a mirror. Still it\u2019s sturdy and all the pans arrived unbroken!<br />The shades are arranged nicely, it really has a visual appeal, and makes choosing an eye look easier.<br />It\u2019s realky not bad, and while my tastes typically run towards the more luxury and pigmented, this is a good entry for a beginner or lighter makeup user.<br />I will be looking into other palettes by this brand.\nHigh 3 stars\nTOUCH IN SOL Flawless Skin Top Coat 1.18 fl.oz.
