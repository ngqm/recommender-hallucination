Bigelow\nAverage Rating: 4.6\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'C. O. Bigelow', 'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Unit Count': '4 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Use for': 'Hands', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.6 x 2 x 0.7 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'Item model number': '20002240'}\nReview Text: Harsh frigid air outside and dry heat inside have made my hands so dry this winter. I have a plethora of creams and lotions but nothing works as well as this Quince hand lotion. Seriously, this is best hand cream I've ever used.<br /><br />The tube it good sized and the lotion is thick and creamy. It isn't greasy at all and absorbs into the skin. I does feel like it creates some kind of invisible glove barrier.  Since using it, my hands and cuticles have been softer and are healing.  The scent is very faint and a little odd. I can't quite put my finger on what it is, but it does have a bit of a citrusy scent. It doesn't smell like quince fruit or carrot, but it's not a bad smell.<br /><br />C.O. Bigelow makes amazing products and this one doesn't disappoint.  Put it on at night and your hands will thank you. You'll feel and see a difference in the morning!\nReview Title: Works like a dream\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "YOUFA Brazilian Human Hair Bundles 16 18 20 with Closure Straight Hair Unprocessed Virgin Hair Extensions Natural Color(16 18 20 +14\"closure)\nYOUFA\n{'Brand': 'YOUFA', 'Color': 'Natural', 'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Extension Length': '14 Inches', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '10 x 7.7 x 2.1 inches; 12.8 Ounces'}\nThis hair is soooooo luxurious!!!  The bundles are probably middle weight-not super thin or lightweight but not suer heavy either. They are perfect for making clip in extensions or pony tail wraps.  The hair is soo soft and thick but looks fine with my fine hair.<br />Mine came with a small silk piece to use as a topper or perhaps bangs.  The one I got was a bit weird. The hair all went to a slight angle. I don't know if this is from being packed or what. I am going to wash it and brush it straight while wet and see how it dries. I'd love to have a little topper piece but if it stays slanted I'll make it into something else.\nGorgeous hair!!!\nC.O. Bigelow No. 007 Dr Hiosous Quince Hand Lotion, 4 Ounces\nC. O.
