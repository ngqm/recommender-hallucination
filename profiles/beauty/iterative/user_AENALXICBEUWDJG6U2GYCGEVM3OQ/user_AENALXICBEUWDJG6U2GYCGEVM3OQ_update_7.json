This seems to be the new craze I\u2019m only going to give this one a four-star because I feel like it\u2019s not gonna last two months like it says on the packaging I have medium to long hair and it takes quite a bit of rubbing that\u2019s on in order to feel like I\u2019ve got a good lather going. The price seems pretty comparable to other products out there and it\u2019s definitely worth the try if I had shorter hair maybe it would last longer I\u2019m not sure. It\u2019s made with natural ingredients and no plastic packaging so it\u2019s better for the environment.
