The powders had powder on the outside of the jars, the brush is the size of a Qtip and hard like it was used. The worst part that pist me off so bad, the glue was half gone and a solid chunk. I doubt I will get new glue from them so I'm screwed. (Stores were closed by the time I realized it). Other than ALL that I guess it's ok.
