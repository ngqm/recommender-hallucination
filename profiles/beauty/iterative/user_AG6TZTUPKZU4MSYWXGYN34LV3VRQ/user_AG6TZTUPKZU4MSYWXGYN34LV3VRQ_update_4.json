The powders had powder on the outside of the jars, the brush is the size of a Qtip and hard like it was used. The worst part that pist me off so bad, the glue was half gone and a solid chunk. I doubt I will get new glue from them so I'm screwed. (Stores were closed by the time I realized it). Other than ALL that I guess it's ok. Wish I would have gotten a better one for couple dollars more!\nSo irritating!!!\neBoot 100 Pack of U Shaped Hair Pins Bun Hair Pins with Box and Storage Bag, Golden (6 cm/ 2.36 Inches)\nEBOOT\n{'Brand': 'EBOOT', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material': 'Metal', 'Unit Count': '100 Count', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2.36 x 0.04 x 0.35 inches; 3.36 Ounces', 'UPC': '712971921153'}\nAt first I thought they were amazing but then I realized they kept slipping out of my hair because the second I would put them in my hair they would loose their bend and double the opening. Will be returning!!!\nNot amazing like I hoped \ud83d\ude14\nINOAR PROFESSIONAL - Argan Oil - Promotes Hair Control, Prevents and Repairs Split Ends, and Protects Hair From the Effects of Heat Styling Tools (2 Ounces / 60 Milliliters)\nInoar\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.57 x 1.57 x 4.53 inches; 3.52 Ounces', 'Item model number': '7898581080503', 'Manufacturer': 'Inoar'}\nOMG! This stuff is AMAZING! The bottle was smaller than I expected but it is VERY thick oil so a little drop goes a very long way and it smells so so good. I put a little in after I straighten my hair so my hair is always moisturized\nSoooooo worth it!!!!\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\n2019 Hair Feel Finishing Stick, Broken Hair Cream Finishing Sticks Refreshing Not Greasy Small Broken Hair Shaping Gel Sticks Easy To Shape Hairstyle\nAL'lVER\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.1 x 1 x 0.9 inches; 0.81 Ounces'}\nThe product it\u2019s self sucked.
