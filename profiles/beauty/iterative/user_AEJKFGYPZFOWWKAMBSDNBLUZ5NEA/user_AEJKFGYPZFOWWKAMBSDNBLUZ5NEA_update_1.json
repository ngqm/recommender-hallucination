You get two of each color, and they are very pretty. I don\u2019t have a lot of hair so they were a bit lose on me. With the pearls on them, they really don\u2019t wrap around too many times and look the same. My daughter put them around her bun in her hair. This accentuated the beauty of the hairpiece, and it worked really well-just an idea for these beautiful hair accessories. They are prettier than the pictures. I\u2019ll be interested to see how long they stay together so I\u2019ll put an update later on how well they last. Very pleased with this product so far, but they are not for people with thin hair.\nReview Title: Really beautifully made\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
