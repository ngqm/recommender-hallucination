I figured dark brown would be dark brown, but if you click on dark brown you get a picture of a light red. That is what you will get. These are cute, but they aren\u2019t worth the $10. You can see the wrapping of the ponytail. I wanted to order one that was the right color, but the price is too high for the quality.\nReview Title: Disappointing\u2026dark brown is reddish color.\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

You get two of each color, and they are very pretty. I don\u2019t have a lot of hair so they were a bit lose on me. With the pearls on them, they really don\u2019t wrap around too many times and look the same. My daughter put them around her bun in her hair. This accentuated the beauty of the hairpiece, and it worked really well-just an idea for these beautiful hair accessories. They are prettier than the pictures. I\u2019ll be interested to see how long they stay together so I\u2019ll put an update later on how well they last. Very pleased with this product so far, but they are not for people with thin hair.\nReally beautifully made\nQTMY Fashion Rhinestone Flower Headband,Wide Hair Hoop for Women,Hair Accessories Head Band Headwear,White\nQTMY\n['QTMY Fashion Rhinestone Flower Headband,Wide Hair Hoop for Women,Hair Accessories Head Band Headwear,White']\n{'Color': 'White', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Occasion': 'Wedding', 'Material': 'Pearl', 'Fabric Type': 'Velvet', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.79 x 5.51 x 1.69 inches; 4.59 Ounces'}\nI love this very much. The colors and the beads are amazing ! It did lose one bead when I first got it so that wasn\u2019t nice but I can put it back on sometime. It is very heavy so it slides a lot and is heavy on the head. I get headaches from heavy things so I just have to wear it for special things.

The glue on the back of them is super sticky and a mess to clean off your fingers. I don\u2019t recommend these. I use a different brand that can last up to a week, but these peeked of within about two days. Not all the great to cut and file, either. I was not happy with them, I do not recommend. The color was beautiful though.\nVery thin.\nBBG Headbands for Women, DQCUTE 4 Pack Elastic Headbands for Women Girls Fashion Tie Dye Workout Hair Bands Headwraps for Yoga Running Sports1\nBBG\n{'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material': 'Polyester', 'Fabric Type': 'Polyester,Cotton', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Item Weight': '77 Grams', 'Package Dimensions': '8.31 x 6.06 x 0.55 inches; 2.72 Ounces'}\nThey have bands are pretty.
