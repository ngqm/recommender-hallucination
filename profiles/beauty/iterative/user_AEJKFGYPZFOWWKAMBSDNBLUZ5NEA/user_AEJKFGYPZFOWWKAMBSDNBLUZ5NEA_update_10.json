The small razor didn\u2019t do much, and when putting on the safety cover, it broke. I wasn\u2019t impressed at all with the razor. I used wax strips with the kit, and I\u2019m happy with the results. I wish I had done a before and after picture. I have always had bushy eyebrows. I\u2019ve never got the results I want from professionals. I took a bit too much off, but it is probably the best results I\u2019ve had. So if you want to use stencils to try to get a good shape, this kit will work. You will want a better razor, though. I gave up on using it. Then it broke so easily. I am pleased with the final results.\nReview Title: It\u2019s ok\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

You get two of each color, and they are very pretty. I don\u2019t have a lot of hair so they were a bit lose on me. With the pearls on them, they really don\u2019t wrap around too many times and look the same. My daughter put them around her bun in her hair. This accentuated the beauty of the hairpiece, and it worked really well-just an idea for these beautiful hair accessories. They are prettier than the pictures. I\u2019ll be interested to see how long they stay together so I\u2019ll put an update later on how well they last. Very pleased with this product so far, but they are not for people with thin hair.\nReally beautifully made\nQTMY Fashion Rhinestone Flower Headband,Wide Hair Hoop for Women,Hair Accessories Head Band Headwear,White\nQTMY\n['QTMY Fashion Rhinestone Flower Headband,Wide Hair Hoop for Women,Hair Accessories Head Band Headwear,White']\n{'Color': 'White', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Occasion': 'Wedding', 'Material': 'Pearl', 'Fabric Type': 'Velvet', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.79 x 5.51 x 1.69 inches; 4.59 Ounces'}\nI love this very much. The colors and the beads are amazing ! It did lose one bead when I first got it so that wasn\u2019t nice but I can put it back on sometime. It is very heavy so it slides a lot and is heavy on the head. I get headaches from heavy things so I just have to wear it for special things. I love it very much.\nVery  beautiful.\nPolish Due nails | Stretchable Real Nail Polish Strips| Gloss Solid Color, Ombre , French, Pattern, Glitter Finish 16Pcs | Incudes Nail Wipe, Nail File, Instructional Brochure (Pink Petals)\nPOLISHDUE\n{'Brand': 'POLISHDUE', 'Item Form': 'Strip', 'Color': 'Clear,Pink', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Material Feature': 'Formaldehyde free, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '4.12 x 3.2 x 1.2 inches; 15.84 Ounces'}\nThese are very pretty but very thin. The glue on the back of them is super sticky and a mess to clean off your fingers. I don\u2019t recommend these. I use a different brand that can last up to a week, but these peeked of within about two days. Not all the great to cut and file, either. I was not happy with them, I do not recommend. The color was beautiful though.\nVery thin.\nBBG Headbands for Women, DQCUTE 4 Pack Elastic Headbands for Women Girls Fashion Tie Dye Workout Hair Bands Headwraps for Yoga Running Sports1\nBBG\n{'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material': 'Polyester', 'Fabric Type': 'Polyester,Cotton', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Item Weight': '77 Grams', 'Package Dimensions': '8.31 x 6.06 x 0.55 inches; 2.72 Ounces'}\nThey have bands are pretty.

My daughter has great success with most hair clips. If you are looking for something cute for a young girl, I definitely recommend these.\nAdorable\nBig Claw Hair Clips Super Strong Hold Hair Claw Clips for Women Girls Thick Hair, 4 Rows of Claws Nonslip Hair Clips for Thin Hair, French Plastic Jaw Clips Octopus Clip for All Hair Types , 6 Packs\nMevnccola\n{'Brand': 'Mevnccola', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material': 'Plastic, Metal', 'Unit Count': '6.00 Count', 'Product Dimensions': '2.3 x 1.2 x 2.3 inches; 5.29 Ounces', 'UPC': '733557234627'}\nThese are really cute, and they are a great size for a variety of looks. I really like hair clips\u2026some are far too big to use for anything but all of ones hair and you must have a lot. These are a nice medium size, great colors, and really adorable.\nAdorable\u2026good size.\nTousled Updo Messy Bun Hair Piece Hair Extension with Elastic Rubber Band Scrunchies Extensions Hair Pieces and Ponytails Hair Extensions Synthetic Hair for Women (1B, Tousled Updo Bun)\nMEDO\n{'Brand': 'MEDO', 'Material': 'Rubber', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '5.75 x 5.67 x 1.65 inches; 1.45 Ounces', 'UPC': '779880422164'}\nNot as much hair as some or as nice as some. The colors were pretty standard for the description. I love these types of extensions,these were not my favorite ones out there. However, not bad for the price!\nFairly nice\nMaforsoon Messy Hair Bun Hair Scrunchies Extension 1PCS Curly Wavy Messy Synthetic Chignon for women Updo (Strawberry Blonde)\nMaforsoon\n{'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy, Curly', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Brand': 'Maforsoon', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '7.56 x 6.65 x 1.42 inches; 2.08 Ounces'}\nWhen ordering go by the pictures, not the actual written description. I figured dark brown would be dark brown, but if you click on dark brown you get a picture of a light red. That is what you will get. These are cute, but they aren\u2019t worth the $10. You can see the wrapping of the ponytail. I wanted to order one that was the right color, but the price is too high for the quality.\nDisappointing\u2026dark brown is reddish color.\nODINSON Messy Bun Hair Piece for Women Updo Hair Bun\nODINSON\n{'Material': 'Human, Synthetic', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Brand': 'ODINSON', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '5.2 x 5.2 x 1.61 inches; 4.97 Ounces'}\nMy hair is very hard to match is black\u2026but not the darkest black that is available. It is more what they call off black. I ordered the brown black, but it was a very dark black with little to no brown. It was too dark to look at all natural for me. It is a nice hairpiece\u2026I just seem to wear different colors in different brands. I have a very small amount of gray/white mostly from a brain surgery. This pic is fairly true to color, though the piece is so dark that my hair looks brown-which it definitely isn\u2019t. If your hair is really dark, the black/brown just might work for you.\nNice..but doesn\u2019t match\nEyebrow Stencils & Eyebrow Pencil, 10 Styles of Eyebrow Shaper, Reusable Eyebrow Template with Dark Brown Dual-Ended Pencil & Eyebrow Razor, 3 Minutes Makeup, Suitable For All Face Shape\nVIAMAZ\n{'Brand': 'VIAMAZ', 'Item Form': 'Pencil', 'Finish Type': 'Natural', 'Special Feature': 'Reusable', 'Material Feature': 'Reusable, Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '6.61 x 1.97 x 0.75 inches; 1.13 Ounces'}\nThe stencils work well, and the pencil works though not easily.
