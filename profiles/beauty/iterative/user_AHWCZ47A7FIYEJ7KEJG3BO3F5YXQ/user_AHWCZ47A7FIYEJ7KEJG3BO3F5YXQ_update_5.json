It didn't do much to help my lips. Rather than exfoliate it actually just seemed to dry out my lips and not just a little bit. It wasn't fun. I tried it a few times, as directed. Just apply a small pea-sized amount to the lips using a finger-tip, scrub gently in a circular motion to remove the dead skin cells for about 30 seconds then rinse or eat off remaining sugar. All of that was done, rinsed not eaten though the one thing that was good was that it didn't taste half bad. Alas, my poor lips were left in worse shape than ever. Dry and roughed up. No matter how hard or gentle I used the stuff over a three week period. I finally gave up and had to admit defeat. Perhaps others had better luck?\nReview Title: My lips and this didn't have a lasting friendship\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Underarm Sweat Pads - 80 Pack Dress Shields Armpit Shields Disposable Anti Sweat Women And Men For Fight Hyperhidrosis\nLADES\n{'Brand': 'LADES', 'Number of Items': '80', 'Unit Count': '80.00 Count'}\nThese underarm sweat pads are just the thing for that extra protection in times of need! Sometimes no matter how much or what kind of deodorant you use, you just can't seem to stop the unsightly and ever so embarrassing pit stain of doom.  With these placed in your shirt the sweat never reaches your shirt and your garments are saved!<br />These work very well. To use them you simply lay your shirt down flat, remove the covering over the adhesive, place firmly in the spot needed, and you are good to go. When you are going to take it off remember to very gently remove it because it can become pretty sticky. It mentions this when you read about the product above but it is worth the reminder here!<br />These work very well and are a good option if you have problems often or occasionally with sweaty underarms.\nThese work well\nNatural Solution Himalayan Pink Salt Body Scrub with Natural Honey,Ultra Hydrating and Exfoliating Scrub for Nourishing Essential Body Care - 12.3 oz\nNatural Solution\n['Formulated using unique and natural ingredients of Himalayan Pink Salt and honey. The abrasive material like salt, sugar, rice bran, jojoba beads that rubs away the dead skin cells on the surface, revealing the softer, younger cells. Carefully hand blended with organic essential oils, skin smoothing enhancers and the undeniable exfoliating power of pure, fine grain Dead Sea Salts. Nothing artificial, no chemicals.']\n{'Brand': 'Natural Solution', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Product Benefits': 'Moisturizing, Nourishing, Cleansing', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '3.75 x 3.75 x 3.6 inches; 11.22 Ounces', 'Item model number': '8246A', 'UPC': '818581019805', 'Manufacturer': 'Natural Solution'}\nThis body scrub is really nice.  It smells so good and it smooths the and nourishes the skin perfectly. When you rub this gently onto your skin then rinse it off you can instantly feel the difference. It feels as if all the dead skin has been removed and your pores have been opened. It leaves you soft and refreshed as well as incredibly relaxed.<br />This is a big jar as well that you get and it's worth it for the price. It's definitely worth giving a try if you are interested and able to. It's really good. I love it.\nReally good stuff!\nLilySilk Large Silk Scrunchies for Womens Girls Kids, Green, Pure 100 Real Natural Raw Mulberry Raw Silk, 6A Grade, Beautiful for Hair, Soft, Tie Scrunchies Silk Big Giant\nLilySilk\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.9 x 6.4 x 1.2 inches; 1.59 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'RDUS6111H-02A'}\n(3.5)<br />Beautiful scrunchies. These scrunchies are very nice. They are made from 100% real natural raw mulberry silk. What makes these special is that they are not supposed to pull your hair as much or get stuck like many others do. That is true of these! The scrunchie works great. It goes in nicely, holds the hair back, doesn't slide out, and when it's taken out there is little to no hair caught in it.<br />However, I can't really see that the price for one is a great one. This is something you have to sort of weigh the options out though for yourself. I have noticed less hair pulling and loss with this hair thing, but the cost is up there. It's a good scrunchie but it's truly up to you if you'd spend that much on one. Maybe the other options make the prices seem less daunting?\nGood scrunchies but...\nABOUT ME MediAnswer Collagen Firming Up Mask 4ea (1box) 25g - 77% Pure Collagen Extract Anti-Aging Total Care Facial Mask Sheet, Powerful Hydrating and Anti-Wrinkle Night Skin Care\nSamyang\n{'Brand': 'Samyang', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Anti-aging', 'Scent': 'Fresh', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.1 x 6.3 x 0.9 inches; 0.88 Ounces'}\nThis mask is very nice. I have never used a mask like this one before. It's heavier than the usual thin almost paper or gel like masks that a lot of them seem to be. This one definitely has a bit more to it. It's also a two piece mask which is great in some ways because sometimes I looks like a one person comedy routine trying to get the masks on right while they flip and flop all over.<br />With this mask you put the bottom part then the top by your eyes, it makes it a lot easier. Then you leave it on for at least 20 minutes ( though it says to leave it on for 30 so I did that). When you take it off you gently pat the left over into your skin.<br />It leaves your skin feeling so soft and really well moisturized. I feel like it did a very nice job with firming up the skin as well. I have only used two of these so far, one a week over two weeks, and have really liked the way my skin looked and felt after each use. I would recommend giving these a try if you can. Perhaps in summer as they have a nice cooling feel to them that I bet would feel great in the summer heat!\nThese work very well\nSplendora Sugar Lip Scrub - Peach - (20g / 0.7oz.)\nSplendora\n{'Brand': 'Splendora', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Product Benefits': 'Exfoliating', 'Material Feature': 'Certified Organic', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '1.73 x 1.73 x 1.34 inches; 0.7 Ounces', 'UPC': '736640550444'}\nUnfortunately I wasn't a fan of this one.
