Sometimes no matter how much or what kind of deodorant you use, you just can't seem to stop the unsightly and ever so embarrassing pit stain of doom.  With these placed in your shirt the sweat never reaches your shirt and your garments are saved!<br />These work very well. To use them you simply lay your shirt down flat, remove the covering over the adhesive, place firmly in the spot needed, and you are good to go. When you are going to take it off remember to very gently remove it because it can become pretty sticky. It mentions this when you read about the product above but it is worth the reminder here!<br />These work very well and are a good option if you have problems often or occasionally with sweaty underarms.\nReview Title: These work well\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
