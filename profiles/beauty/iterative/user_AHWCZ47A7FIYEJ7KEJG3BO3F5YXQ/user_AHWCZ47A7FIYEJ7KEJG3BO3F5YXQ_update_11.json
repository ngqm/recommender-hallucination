They work great. You get four things in this set. You'll receive a paddle brush, a rectangle comb, a detangler hair brush, and a tail comb. I don't really use the combs as much as the brushes but did give them a bit of a testing so I could type a review. I absolutely love all of these brushes and combs. They are sturdy and work very well. When used for what they are supposed to be used for specifically I thought they all held up well and did their jobs. They detangled perfectly and when used for styling they were easy to hold on to, didn't get in the way at all, and worked the hair into it's style nicely.<br />I would recommend these if you are looking for a good set of hair brushes and combs that won't cost you much. These are terrific for that!\nReview Title: Great brushes!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Underarm Sweat Pads - 80 Pack Dress Shields Armpit Shields Disposable Anti Sweat Women And Men For Fight Hyperhidrosis\nLADES\n{'Brand': 'LADES', 'Number of Items': '80', 'Unit Count': '80.00 Count'}\nThese underarm sweat pads are just the thing for that extra protection in times of need! Sometimes no matter how much or what kind of deodorant you use, you just can't seem to stop the unsightly and ever so embarrassing pit stain of doom.  With these placed in your shirt the sweat never reaches your shirt and your garments are saved!<br />These work very well. To use them you simply lay your shirt down flat, remove the covering over the adhesive, place firmly in the spot needed, and you are good to go. When you are going to take it off remember to very gently remove it because it can become pretty sticky. It mentions this when you read about the product above but it is worth the reminder here!<br />These work very well and are a good option if you have problems often or occasionally with sweaty underarms.\nThese work well\nNatural Solution Himalayan Pink Salt Body Scrub with Natural Honey,Ultra Hydrating and Exfoliating Scrub for Nourishing Essential Body Care - 12.3 oz\nNatural Solution\n['Formulated using unique and natural ingredients of Himalayan Pink Salt and honey. The abrasive material like salt, sugar, rice bran, jojoba beads that rubs away the dead skin cells on the surface, revealing the softer, younger cells. Carefully hand blended with organic essential oils, skin smoothing enhancers and the undeniable exfoliating power of pure, fine grain Dead Sea Salts. Nothing artificial, no chemicals.']\n{'Brand': 'Natural Solution', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Product Benefits': 'Moisturizing, Nourishing, Cleansing', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '3.75 x 3.75 x 3.6 inches; 11.22 Ounces', 'Item model number': '8246A', 'UPC': '818581019805', 'Manufacturer': 'Natural Solution'}\nThis body scrub is really nice.  It smells so good and it smooths the and nourishes the skin perfectly. When you rub this gently onto your skin then rinse it off you can instantly feel the difference. It feels as if all the dead skin has been removed and your pores have been opened. It leaves you soft and refreshed as well as incredibly relaxed.<br />This is a big jar as well that you get and it's worth it for the price. It's definitely worth giving a try if you are interested and able to. It's really good. I love it.\nReally good stuff!\nLilySilk Large Silk Scrunchies for Womens Girls Kids, Green, Pure 100 Real Natural Raw Mulberry Raw Silk, 6A Grade, Beautiful for Hair, Soft, Tie Scrunchies Silk Big Giant\nLilySilk\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.9 x 6.4 x 1.2 inches; 1.59 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'RDUS6111H-02A'}\n(3.5)<br />Beautiful scrunchies. These scrunchies are very nice. They are made from 100% real natural raw mulberry silk. What makes these special is that they are not supposed to pull your hair as much or get stuck like many others do. That is true of these! The scrunchie works great. It goes in nicely, holds the hair back, doesn't slide out, and when it's taken out there is little to no hair caught in it.<br />However, I can't really see that the price for one is a great one. This is something you have to sort of weigh the options out though for yourself. I have noticed less hair pulling and loss with this hair thing, but the cost is up there. It's a good scrunchie but it's truly up to you if you'd spend that much on one. Maybe the other options make the prices seem less daunting?\nGood scrunchies but...\nABOUT ME MediAnswer Collagen Firming Up Mask 4ea (1box) 25g - 77% Pure Collagen Extract Anti-Aging Total Care Facial Mask Sheet, Powerful Hydrating and Anti-Wrinkle Night Skin Care\nSamyang\n{'Brand': 'Samyang', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Anti-aging', 'Scent': 'Fresh', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.1 x 6.3 x 0.9 inches; 0.88 Ounces'}\nThis mask is very nice. I have never used a mask like this one before. It's heavier than the usual thin almost paper or gel like masks that a lot of them seem to be. This one definitely has a bit more to it. It's also a two piece mask which is great in some ways because sometimes I looks like a one person comedy routine trying to get the masks on right while they flip and flop all over.<br />With this mask you put the bottom part then the top by your eyes, it makes it a lot easier. Then you leave it on for at least 20 minutes ( though it says to leave it on for 30 so I did that). When you take it off you gently pat the left over into your skin.<br />It leaves your skin feeling so soft and really well moisturized. I feel like it did a very nice job with firming up the skin as well. I have only used two of these so far, one a week over two weeks, and have really liked the way my skin looked and felt after each use. I would recommend giving these a try if you can. Perhaps in summer as they have a nice cooling feel to them that I bet would feel great in the summer heat!\nThese work very well\nSplendora Sugar Lip Scrub - Peach - (20g / 0.7oz.)\nSplendora\n{'Brand': 'Splendora', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Product Benefits': 'Exfoliating', 'Material Feature': 'Certified Organic', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '1.73 x 1.73 x 1.34 inches; 0.7 Ounces', 'UPC': '736640550444'}\nUnfortunately I wasn't a fan of this one. It didn't do much to help my lips. Rather than exfoliate it actually just seemed to dry out my lips and not just a little bit. It wasn't fun. I tried it a few times, as directed. Just apply a small pea-sized amount to the lips using a finger-tip, scrub gently in a circular motion to remove the dead skin cells for about 30 seconds then rinse or eat off remaining sugar. All of that was done, rinsed not eaten though the one thing that was good was that it didn't taste half bad. Alas, my poor lips were left in worse shape than ever. Dry and roughed up. No matter how hard or gentle I used the stuff over a three week period. I finally gave up and had to admit defeat. Perhaps others had better luck?\nMy lips and this didn't have a lasting friendship\nTaya Beauty Inner Core Hair Strong Anti-Breakage Shampoo & Conditioner Duo - Strengthening and Repairing Formula - Free From Sulfates and Parabens - 8 fl oz Bottles\nTAYA I AM.\n['INNER CORE SHAMPOO: Ingredients: Water/Aqua/Eau, Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Acrylates Copolymer, Glycerin, Glycol Distearate, Bambusa Vulgaris Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Panthenol, Dimethicone, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Cetrimonium Chloride, Hydroxypropyl Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Cetyl Alcohol, Bis-Cetearyl Amodimethicone, Polyquaternium-11, Laureth-4, Laureth-23, Decylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Amodimethicone, Cocamide MIPA, Trideceth-12, Kaolin, Polysorbate 20, Fragrance/Parfum, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Coconut Acid, Sodium Methyltaurate, Isopropanolamine, Tocopherol, Salicylic Acid, Cyclotetrasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Amyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Salicylate, Linalool.

It smells nice, too, which is also a plus!<br />My hair is not that of a teen or even young adult anymore so it's been through a lot. When looking for shampoo and conditioning products I tend to look closer at those that claim to make hair stronger, reduce breakage, and things with words like \"restore\" and \"fortify\". These hit the mark so I decided to give them a shot.<br />I've been using them about three weeks and I think that they are definitely doing my hair some good. It looks healthy and feels very soft. The conditioner does a good job with tangles and knots. I do sometimes still use a leave in conditioner or separate type of moisture just because it's winter my hair is increasingly dry on any given day depending. I can't tell for sure about the breakage but it does seem stronger. I suppose in many ways they go hand in hand. It has more pull to it so it's not snapping and breaking as much.<br />I like this. A little goes a long way as well which is nice.\nWorks great\n9 Pack Headbands Set -Messen Fashion Velvet Wide Hairband with Pearl Knitted Floral Fabric Cute Elegant Vintage Cross Knot Turban Elastic Hair Hoop Headwrap for Women Girls Hair Accessories\nMessen\n{'Package Dimensions': '10.8 x 6.6 x 2.1 inches; 14.07 Ounces'}\nThese headbands are fantastic. There are 9 in this set and they come in a variety of colors and designs. You get three velvet headbands with pearls- pink, black, and beige, 3 fabric headbands- 2 have flower patterns and one is black with white stripes, and three knitted- green, grey, and black.<br />These are very well constructed. The only thing is that after a little while they did begin to dig in bit where they rest at the ends. Not too much but enough to make it uncomfortable after a long period of time. They still so nice it's worth the slight suffering.<br />These are very nice and worth it.\nVery pretty\nGentle Facial Cleanser w/Moroccan Rose Water, Calendula, Aloe| Great for Dry, Sensitive and Combination Skin.

It's one of the most gentle washes I've ever used. It has the lightest smell of cucumber which I don't like too much but at the same time it is a refreshing clean smell and it isn't overwhelmingly strong. It seems odd to give a five star to something with a scent that isn't quite one that is liked but this is a very good face wash and I absolutely love how clean it leaves my face feeling. It doesn't cause a red face or breakouts. It does seem to help prevent acne and even help to minimize it when it happens. It's definitely a new favorite.\nWorks perfectly\nMARLOWE.

M BLEND\n{'Package Dimensions': '10.24 x 5.24 x 4.76 inches; 2.62 Pounds', 'UPC': '859984007822'}\nMy husband put this kit to good use so I asked him if he'd mind letting me know what he thought about it. He didn't mind at all and this is what he had to say:<br /><br />\"Very comprehensive, quality kit for men. If you're like me you will find there are items in here that you likely won't really need. I personally don't use hair pomade or those light shave creams. I prefer foam and my hair just sort of keeps my head warm.<br />Aside from the items I can't use there are some great items in here for everyone. The body scrub soap like and feel a good bit more fresh after using it. But my preference, and where I really came to appreciate this, was with the facial moisturizer and lip balm. I don't usually buy those items and let the winter have its way with my face. I ride a bike everyday. But using the items in this kit really helped me keep my skin from drying, and my lips. The lip balm tastes and smells great, too.\"<br /><br />That's what he had to say about it. He did genuinely seem to enjoy using this kit.\nNice kit for men\nAZURE Hyaluronic & Retinol Anti Aging Under Eye Pads- Moisturizing & Rejuvenating Eye Mask Patches - Reduces Fine Lines, Wrinkles, Dark Circles & Puffiness - Skin Care Made in Korea - 5 Pairs\nAzure Cosmetics\n{'Brand': 'Azure Cosmetics', 'Item Form': 'Under eye Patch', 'Product Benefits': 'Moisturizing', 'Scent': 'Unscented', 'Material Type Free': 'Paraben Free', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '3.5 x 1 x 6 inches; 2.08 Ounces', 'Item model number': '689513260202', 'UPC': '689513260202', 'Manufacturer': 'Just Solutions!'}\nThese are terrific! I really like these hemp and rose under eye mask patches. If you have puffy tired eyes that crave some tender loving care then these just may be what you need. They work so well. You put them on under your eyes after washing and drying your face. Just leave them on for 10-15 minutes and when you remove them you gently massage the product into the skin. That's it!<br />The one thing that isn't so great is that they are so hard to separate when you first open the packet and take them out. They stick together and to themselves and it's very frustrating trying to get them without losing the liquid and getting yourself all covered in it. Other than that these are a definite win.\nMake your eyes feel delightful!\nBaasha 4 Pcs Paddle Brush Set, Detangling Brush and Hair Comb Set, Thick Hair Brush Set for Men & Women, No More Tangle Hairbrush Comb Set, Hair Care Gift Set Hair Brush Comb Set\nBaasha\n{'Brand': 'Baasha', 'Shape': 'Rectangular', 'Handle Material': 'Rubber, Plastic', 'Product Benefits': 'Detangle', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '10.2 x 3.43 x 2.01 inches; 7.34 Ounces'}\nThis is a very good set of brushes and combs, especially for the price.
