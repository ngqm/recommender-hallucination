I got this for myself since I recently cut my bangs. This gives the perfect blowout for your hair and gives my bangs that volume and curl that they need. It\u2019s extremely light which I love because it\u2019s not one of those huge & heavy blow drying brushes. This allows the perfect amount of airflow and it gets the job done nicely!\nReview Title: Extremely Light\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
