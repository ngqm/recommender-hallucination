They\u2019re great for traveling, it comes with three big silicone heads and six little silicone heads for smaller brushes like eyeshadow brushes. Going to be buying more.\nperfect for traveling\nEveryday Beauty Radiance Cleanser, Rejuvenating Antioxidant Gel Cleanser with Rose Hip Seed Oil, Vitamin A, C, and E for All Skin Types to Soothe and Nourish Dry Damaged Skin, 4fl oz.

I got this for myself since I recently cut my bangs. This gives the perfect blowout for your hair and gives my bangs that volume and curl that they need.
