But as you can see from the photo, when the lid is on you can\u2019t tell at all. I personally have no problem with them looking different when the lid is off.<br /><br />The images for the product do look a lot larger then what the product actually is. I consider this a mini size. I absolutely love the size and I am glad it isn\u2019t larger because it fits in my carry all perfectly.<br /><br />It holds the liquids well and is very easy to clean. I didn\u2019t have issues dipping my brushes into them or removing the access liquid.<br /><br />I feel like these can even be used to hold all your stud earrings or something small.<br /><br />Very satisfied with this product.\nReview Title: So cute\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
