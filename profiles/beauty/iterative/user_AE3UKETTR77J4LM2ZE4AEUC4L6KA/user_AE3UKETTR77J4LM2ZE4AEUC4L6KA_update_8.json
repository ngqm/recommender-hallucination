  "reference_summary": "LXIANGN Nail Glass Cup With Lid Cute Dappen Dishes 2PCS Heart Shaped Bowl Glass Mini Crystal Bowls for Nail Art Manicure Care Tools\nLXIANGN\n{}\nI personally love these dappen dishes!<br /><br />Many complaints I\u2019ve seen is that the lid doesn\u2019t match the base. But as you can see from the photo, when the lid is on you can\u2019t tell at all. I personally have no problem with them looking different when the lid is off.<br /><br />The images for the product do look a lot larger then what the product actually is. I consider this a mini size. I absolutely love the size and I am glad it isn\u2019t larger because it fits in my carry all perfectly.<br /><br />It holds the liquids well and is very easy to clean. I didn\u2019t have issues dipping my brushes into them or removing the access liquid.<br /><br />I feel like these can even be used to hold all your stud earrings or something small.<br /><br />Very satisfied with this product.\nSo cute\n6 Pack Hair Clips\nCobahom\n{'Brand': 'Cobahom', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material': 'Metal', 'Unit Count': '6.00 Count', 'Product Dimensions': '3.94 x 3.94 x 0.67 inches; 2.4 Ounces'}\nThese leopard print duckbill clips are so adorable! They are a very pretty yellowish gold type metal and are very sturdy. I personally chose them because my mother loves leopard print and I plan on sending her the 3 lighter ones and I know she\u2019ll love them.<br /><br />These clips are very easy to use and add so much flare to your hair. I personally like wearing leopard print when I wear solid colors. Cute trick, leopard print goes with ANY color \ud83d\ude09 just don\u2019t mix patterns and I promise it\u2019ll be cute especially if it\u2019s all solids !<br /><br />They are very well made and I do not see these breaking anytime soon.

I\u2019m not sure but it really did not look right. I did the upward strokes like my brow hairs but it really didn\u2019t work well. Even when it\u2019s overlapped like in my photo , it looks weird.
