  "reference_summary": "LXIANGN Nail Glass Cup With Lid Cute Dappen Dishes 2PCS Heart Shaped Bowl Glass Mini Crystal Bowls for Nail Art Manicure Care Tools\nLXIANGN\n{}\nI personally love these dappen dishes!<br /><br />Many complaints I\u2019ve seen is that the lid doesn\u2019t match the base. But as you can see from the photo, when the lid is on you can\u2019t tell at all. I personally have no problem with them looking different when the lid is off.<br /><br />The images for the product do look a lot larger then what the product actually is. I consider this a mini size. I absolutely love the size and I am glad it isn\u2019t larger because it fits in my carry all perfectly.<br /><br />It holds the liquids well and is very easy to clean. I didn\u2019t have issues dipping my brushes into them or removing the access liquid.<br /><br />I feel like these can even be used to hold all your stud earrings or something small.<br /><br />Very satisfied with this product.\nSo cute\n6 Pack Hair Clips\nCobahom\n{'Brand': 'Cobahom', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material': 'Metal', 'Unit Count': '6.00 Count', 'Product Dimensions': '3.94 x 3.94 x 0.67 inches; 2.4 Ounces'}\nThese leopard print duckbill clips are so adorable! They are a very pretty yellowish gold type metal and are very sturdy. I personally chose them because my mother loves leopard print and I plan on sending her the 3 lighter ones and I know she\u2019ll love them.<br /><br />These clips are very easy to use and add so much flare to your hair. I personally like wearing leopard print when I wear solid colors. Cute trick, leopard print goes with ANY color \ud83d\ude09 just don\u2019t mix patterns and I promise it\u2019ll be cute especially if it\u2019s all solids !<br /><br />They are very well made and I do not see these breaking anytime soon.

I\u2019m not sure but it really did not look right. I did the upward strokes like my brow hairs but it really didn\u2019t work well. Even when it\u2019s overlapped like in my photo , it looks weird. I would not purchase this product nor recommend.\nBig nope\nBQAN 2 Pieces Wax Pencil for Rhinestones, Dual-ended Rhinestone Picker Dotting Tool, Wax Pen for DIY Nail Art, Rhinestone Gems Crystals Studs Picker With Pink Acrylic Handle (Pink & Pink)\nBQAN\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.6 x 3.54 x 1.46 inches; 2.89 Ounces', 'UPC': '710050098918'}\nI received 2 not 1 like everyone else.

I decided to use the shorter set because at the time I needed my nails really short. I prepped my nails and used some glue and these held very well! They are well made and not flimsy like other sets I\u2019ve had but they\u2019re also not too thick. 10/10 would recommend.\nVery great set\nIvnil Nose Strips For Blackheads Remover, Nose Pore Strips, With Instant Blackhead Removal and Pore Unclogging Absorb Dirt And Oil(2-Pack, 16 Counts)For All Skin Type\nIvnil\n{'Brand': 'Ivnil', 'Item Form': 'Strips', 'Product Benefits': 'Cleansing', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Unit Count': '16.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '6.02 x 3.23 x 2.05 inches; 1.45 Ounces', 'UPC': '757158884746'}\nI was supposed to receive watermelon but received orange which was very upsetting. Then to my surprise these strips do not remove the blackheads like they claim to. It left behind so many that it was annoying. It was easy to use but however they don\u2019t work very well. Do not recommend.\nLeft too many behind\nRBA\u2019s Firming Serum to Reduce Fine Lines and Wrinkles - Improve Overall Tone With Yarrow, Neem, and Spirulina - Daily Vegan Serum - 1 fl oz\nRound Barn Apothecary\n{'Skin Type': 'All', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrates, nourishes, and firms skin', 'Use for': 'Whole Body', 'Scent': 'Yarrow / Spirulina', 'Brand': 'Round Barn Apothecary', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '1.7 x 1.6 x 0.6 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '019962727542'}\nI love Round Barn products so much and this serum is another amazing product I love.
