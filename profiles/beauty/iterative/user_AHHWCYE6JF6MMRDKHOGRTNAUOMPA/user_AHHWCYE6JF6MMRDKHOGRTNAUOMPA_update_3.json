This kit is about as close as you get to salon quality. The light worked well and cured the gel polish as expected. The instructions were top notch, giving you precise directions on exactly what to do. This particular kit comes with most the items you need. The items not included are - nail file, buffer, and most importantly the actual gel color. I wasn\u2019t able to test their polish out as I didn\u2019t realize this didn\u2019t come with a color. However I have other gel brands and the red I chose worked with this set. I followed the instructions using all the supplies from the kit except the color and I\u2019m very pleased with the result. I would recommend this over other brands offered at your local general stores.\nReview Title: Great instructions, don\u2019t forget to buy the gel color.\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "4D Silk Fiber Lash Mascara Black, Waterproof Natural Thick Fiber Mascara, Thick Thickening Lengthening, Dramatic Extension Voluminous Eyelashes Mascara, No Clumping, No Smudging Lasting All Day\nSIKEMAY\n{'Color': 'black', 'Special Feature': 'Water, Smudge Proof, Non Clumping', 'Brand': 'SIKEMAY', 'Specialty': 'Waterproof, hypoallergenic', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '7.2 x 4 x 1.1 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '764690676838', 'Manufacturer': 'SIKEMAY'}\nIn my photo, the left side has 2 applications of peacock mascara, the right side has none at all, the difference in length is dramatic. This mascara glides on smoothly and clump free... HOWEVER, it\u2019s stringy if that makes since, like the tiny fibers in it are extremely noticeable. (I attached a photo where even the wand itself is stringy.) The mascara doesn\u2019t dry in a timely manner either. Five minutes after applying the mascara and it\u2019s still not dry. I really wanted to love this mascara for the dramatic length it adds, however the quality is not what I expected.\nDramatic length. Long drying time. Stringy mess.\n[Marshique] Eyelash & Eyebrow Growth Serum 0.25 Fl Oz - Oil Free Formula Essence Conditioner for Extension & Perm Treatment Care\nMarshique\n{'Brand': 'Marshique', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Package Information': 'Tube', 'Package Type': 'Box', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.59 x 1.54 x 0.75 inches; 0.63 Ounces', 'Item model number': '0000'}\nThe serum seems nice and was easy to apply, however there were no instructions included in the box, the box itself had no English language. I really wanted to try this product, however I can\u2019t give you an honest review if it works because I don\u2019t know if the product should be applied once or twice a day, before makeup or at night. Directions need to be added to the product for an honest review.\nNo instructions on how to use the product.\nRed Carpet Manicure Starter Kits\n{'Color': 'RCM Essentials Starter Kit', 'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'RC Red Carpet Manicure', 'Finish Type': 'Glossy', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'UPC': '817248203854', 'Manufacturer': 'RC Red Carpet Manicure/ Zupishi'}\nThis will actually be my third gel kit, as the others have failed to meet my expectations.
