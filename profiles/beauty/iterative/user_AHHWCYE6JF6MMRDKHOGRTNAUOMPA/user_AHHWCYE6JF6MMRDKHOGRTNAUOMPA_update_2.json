I really wanted to try this product, however I can\u2019t give you an honest review if it works because I don\u2019t know if the product should be applied once or twice a day, before makeup or at night.

  "reference_summary": "4D Silk Fiber Lash Mascara Black, Waterproof Natural Thick Fiber Mascara, Thick Thickening Lengthening, Dramatic Extension Voluminous Eyelashes Mascara, No Clumping, No Smudging Lasting All Day\nSIKEMAY\n{'Color': 'black', 'Special Feature': 'Water, Smudge Proof, Non Clumping', 'Brand': 'SIKEMAY', 'Specialty': 'Waterproof, hypoallergenic', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '7.2 x 4 x 1.1 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '764690676838', 'Manufacturer': 'SIKEMAY'}\nIn my photo, the left side has 2 applications of peacock mascara, the right side has none at all, the difference in length is dramatic. This mascara glides on smoothly and clump free... HOWEVER, it\u2019s stringy if that makes since, like the tiny fibers in it are extremely noticeable. (I attached a photo where even the wand itself is stringy.) The mascara doesn\u2019t dry in a timely manner either. Five minutes after applying the mascara and it\u2019s still not dry. I really wanted to love this mascara for the dramatic length it adds, however the quality is not what I expected.\nDramatic length. Long drying time.
