Other active ingredients are derived from coconut oil and glycerin, excellent emollients and skin-repairing ingredients due to the medium chain fatty acids that skin can utilize to repair its surface and resist moisture loss; they also have an anti-inflammatory effect that reduces the risk of irritation.<br />- DOCUMENTED CLINICAL STUDIES - Studies based on the use of a 5% concentration of Argireline in volunteers showed that wrinkles around the eyes decreased up to 17% after 15 days of treatment and up to 27% after 30 days of treatment. Controlled studies have also demonstrated that wrinkle depth can also be reduced in the forehead. Our formula has 8%, the high end recommended for optimal results.<br />- NO HARMFUL INGREDIENTS - No parabens, bpa, phthlates, mineral oil, alcohol, sodium benzoate, propylene or any other toxic ingredients. All contents are compared to the EWG's Skin Deep Database for safety and compliance.<br />- MADE IN THE USA in our GMP (good manufacturing practices) and FDA certified facility; 100% fragrance free, 100% cruelty free, 100% manufacturer's money back guarantee.<br /> - Reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, reduce the appearance of under-eye bags, increase skin firmness and smoothness, repair and refresh skin surface, ideal for all skin types.<br />Paloma Perfect Peptide contains a highly concentrated 8% (by volume, not an 8% solution) of this ingredient, one of the highest available on the market, and recommended by the ingredient creator. Beware of deceptive and incomplete labeling. Ingredients should ALWAYS be listed from highest to lowest concentration, not by just the active ingredients!<br />The best of intelligent science and natural, responsibly sourced ingredients, our formulas are produced in small carefully controlled batches to preserve freshness, and bottled only in airless pumps to prevent the ingredient destabilization and contamination that occurs when products are opened and exposed to air or contact with fingers.<br />Indications<br />Designed to aid in the prevention and elimination of fine lines, wrinkles, and sagging skin.<br />Ingredients<br />Deionized Water, Glycerin, Coconut Oil Extract (suberb emollients as Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride), Argireline 8% (Acetyl Hexapeptide-8), Polyacrylamide (moisture binding agent), C 13-14 (emollient and thickener), Isoparaffin (thickener) Laureth-7 (emulsifier), Phenoxyethanol (cosmetic preservative) Caprylyl Glycol, Sorbic Acid (cosmetic preservatives).<br />Directions<br />Tap the bottle gently on the heel of your hand to settle contents after shipping and to dislodge any air bubbles from the airless pump. After cleansing and toning, apply one or two pumps as needed, each about the size of a pearl, to face, neck and decollete. A 30 ml bottle will last 45-60 days.<br />As I age I pay special attention to those fine lines around my eyes and keeping any forehead lines at bay by using the best of the best anti aging formulas available. I have also learned how critical it is to moisturize and care for the neck and decollete area. These areas are so often overlooked but they are two areas that can really reveal your age or make you look older than you really are. I also notice an increased firmness and smoothness in my skin. I am very impressed at how quickly this moisturizer has worked compared to other more expensive ones that I have tried. It has a pump action applicator making for easy dispensing.
