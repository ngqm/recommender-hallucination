Ironically number two was the only one that was smooth when applying and the other ones were so dry I couldn\u2019t get any color from them! I attached a picture showing that only a few sparkles managed to stick onto my left eye area. It looks sad.<br />My right eye was the one I used number two on and it looks better than the other eye but still not great. I imagine if I were to have gotten the correct pen (#1) it would have been just as dry as the other two because it was a glittery one like the #3 & #5\u2026. In my opinion this is not worth the money and I do not recommend.\nReview Title: Only one pen was semi good\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I got the beach scent for Christmas and liked the quality lathering \ud83e\uddfc so I was curious to try this one and it smells like just like the Sandals Resorts lotions/soaps which is very lemongrass like.

The directions are very thorough so I felt confident. There are a lot of warnings about this product so make sure you read the instructions carefully. Once I did a few hair sections it felt like I had been doing it for years and all my fears were gone. I did not burn myself and my hair came out super smooth and pretty. It\u2019s easy to do a little curl at the end if you rotate your wrist outwards which I like. I would recommend this product!
