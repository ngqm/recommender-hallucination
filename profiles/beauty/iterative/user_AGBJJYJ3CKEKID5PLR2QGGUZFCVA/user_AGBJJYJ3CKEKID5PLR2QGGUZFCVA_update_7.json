I got the beach scent for Christmas and liked the quality lathering \ud83e\uddfc so I was curious to try this one and it smells like just like the Sandals Resorts lotions/soaps which is very lemongrass like. Super pleased. Love the brand and the shipping was super fast.\nSo pleased with the smell and quick delivery\n[Upgrade] FUGACAL Hair Straightener Brush, 30s Fast Heating, 3 Temp Settings, Anti-Scald Design and 30mins Auto-Off, Bring You Ultra Straight Hair with Natural Shiny Look in Minutes\nFugacal\n{'Brand': 'Fugacal', 'Material': 'Ceramic', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Hair Type': 'Thick', 'Product Dimensions': '12.2 x 1.8 x 1.7 inches; 1.79 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'FG-HS01', 'Manufacturer': 'Fugacal'}\nI was very nervous to try this steaming straightener brush. The directions are very thorough so I felt confident. There are a lot of warnings about this product so make sure you read the instructions carefully. Once I did a few hair sections it felt like I had been doing it for years and all my fears were gone. I did not burn myself and my hair came out super smooth and pretty. It\u2019s easy to do a little curl at the end if you rotate your wrist outwards which I like. I would recommend this product! Quick shipping and great packaging\nI am impressed!\nINGRINC Lying Silkworm Eyeliner Pen Shiny Matte Rotatable Highlighter Makeup Eyeshadow Pencil Brighten Bottom-Eyelid Silkworm Makeup Eyeshadow Eyeliner Pen for Women Girls (2,3,5)\nINGRINC\n['1']\n{'Color': '2,3,5', 'Brand': 'INGRINC', 'Item Form': 'Pencil', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery, Matte', 'Number of Items': '1'}\nInstead of getting #1 I think I got #2 according to the boxes. Ironically number two was the only one that was smooth when applying and the other ones were so dry I couldn\u2019t get any color from them! I attached a picture showing that only a few sparkles managed to stick onto my left eye area. It looks sad.<br />My right eye was the one I used number two on and it looks better than the other eye but still not great. I imagine if I were to have gotten the correct pen (#1) it would have been just as dry as the other two because it was a glittery one like the #3 & #5\u2026. In my opinion this is not worth the money and I do not recommend.\nOnly one pen was semi good\nFolie for Women EDP - Eau De Parfum 100ml(3.4 oz) | Saffron, Red Fruits, Hedione, Jasmine, Moss, Amber | Perfume, Perfumes for women, Women's fragrances, Fragrance, Womens perfume | by Intense Elite\nINTENSE ELITE\n{'Brand': 'INTENSE ELITE', 'Item Volume': '100 Milliliters', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Item Weight': '3.4 Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '5.63 x 3.39 x 3.35 inches; 3.4 Ounces'}\nThe box is not as bougie as the other ones from this brand presentation wise. The scent is very strong. One squirt a day type strong. The best way to describe this in my opinion is floral /woodsy. I don\u2019t have the most educated nose though. The bottle is beautiful. Very nice but not my favorite from this brand.\nSmells very floral\nCrave Extreme For Men EDP - Eau De Parfum 100ml(3.4 oz) | Pepper, Calabrian Bergamot, Elemi, Vetiver, Pink Pepper, Sichuan Pepper, Patchouli, Lavender, Geranium, Cedar, Ambroxan & Labdanum | Perfume, Perfumes for men, Men's fragrances, Fragrance, Men's eau de parfum | by Intense Elite\nINTENSE ELITE\n{'Brand': 'INTENSE ELITE', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Item Volume': '100 Milliliters', 'Scent': 'Cedar,Floral,Lavender', 'Special Feature': 'Long Lasting', 'Package Dimensions': '6.18 x 2.95 x 2.76 inches; 3.4 Ounces'}\nWood scent undertones and isn\u2019t over powering. Presentation across the board is great, packaging A+ for gifts.\nMy husband\u2019s fav (he\u2019s tried 4 from this brand)\nLSxia 4PCS Braided Hair Clips for Braids, Four-Leaf Clover Chopped Hairpin Duckbill Clip with 3 Small Hair Clips for Styling, Sparkling Rhinestone Crystal Stone Braided Hair Clip for Women\nLSxia\n{'Brand': 'LSxia', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Embellishment': 'Rhinestone', 'Material': 'Plastic', 'Package Dimensions': '4.06 x 2.68 x 1.34 inches; 1.45 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'LX1117-1'}\n[[VIDEOID:9c72ea2572a53de4ffffdc95b5e81cc1]] I like that it\u2019s something different and it\u2019s not that hard to do. These are fairly well made, and I like the colors and they are functional. The sparkly flowers are hot glued on, so I worry a little bit about the longevity. There are also some white strings coming out from under the flowers like hot glue stings.\nCute\nNew Balance Unisex Grid Fleece Headband\nNew Balance\n['New Balance Unisex Grid Fleece Headband is engineered with comfort and performance in mind.
