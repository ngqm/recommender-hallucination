A bit intense when first sprayed on, but very mellow shortly afterwards. It reminds me of a lot of scents that say &#34;refreshing&#34; or &#34;water.&#34; I absolutely love the smell. Its not even super manly either and could almost be worn by a woman without much notice. I definitely love this smell on my fiance and I think it is my most favorite of all the polo inspired scents by Watermark Beauty. Of course like most of the other ones my biggest issue is that they not not last all day long. They start puttering out about halfway through the day and will need to be re-applied, and also like most others it comes in a large 3.0 Fl. Oz./ 90 ml bottle, so it should last a while even with a second application every day. It is inspired by Black Cologne but I have not had the chance to smell it so I cant tell you how close they are, nor do I care because this scent is amazing. Recommended! I received this product at a discounted rate<br /><br />Thanks &#60;3\nReview Title: Great smell, I only wish it lasted longer.\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

But lets face it, some of us women are so fascinated by them! We love to pop and pull and squeeze and get all the gunk out of not only our faces, but our spouses. Eeeewww. Until not long ago I did not realize how much popping pimples is so bad for your skin! Leaves holes and scarring and no wonder I have such big pores... So after learning that I was so excited to try out this Deluxe Premium Blackhead & Blemish Remover Kit by Mac Professional. This set comes with so many different tools its hard to know where to start. There is one tool in particular that is the coolest, though a bit dangerous. It has two heads that screw into each side for safety and can be removed and screwed on the sides, and has a lancet and another head. Its extremely sharp and you must be careful with it, this is a &#34;professional&#34; set so I really don't use more than the ones just to remove blackheads, very nice set, and I love that it comes with a case that has inserts to safely store every piece.

However, I can tell you that this Lady Passion perfume smells nice. It has a very distinct citrus smell, almost grapefruity type smell. Its nice on the nose but not really my favorite kind of scent when I want to wear a perfume. It comes in a very large 3.3 Fl. Oz./100 ml glass bottle that should last you a while, however I did notice that the scent dissipated quite dramatically from me as the day went on and if I wanted to keep the good smell to be continuously noticeable I would have to reapply, but its price is very affordable. It comes with an easy push squirt application nozzle. I received this product at a discounted rate<br /><br />Thanks &#60;3\nFruity\nDiva Scent For Women, Eau De Parfum 2.8 Fl.

It is supposed to be inspired by Juicy, however I have not ever tried Juicy before so I cant tell you how close it is unfortunately. I can tell you, however, that it smells very fruity with a milk floral scent. Very sweet and refreshing and very hip for the younger women. Almost like a fruity dryer sheet, but in a good way. It comes in a rectangular clear bottle and the perfume itself is pink and very girly, it even has a pink bow around the spray nozzle. I think this 2.8 Fl. Oz. / 80 ml bottle should last quite a while, and after 3 good sprays in the morning I cold still smell it on my shirt at the end of the night. The only thing I did not like was that the golden cap was on so tight that I actually pulled off the bottom piece when trying to get the lid off, other than that I really like this perfume.

This Super Star For Women, Eau de Toilette by Watermark Beauty is strong. Not my favorite by far, but lasts well throughout the day. That being said when I spray myself it is so strong I have the need to want to wave away some of the scent it really invades your nostrils. The first whiff is overwhelming of alcohol, and needs some time to disperse to make it smell better. One spray should do just fine, so this 2.7 Fl. Oz. / 80 ml will last for a long time. The bottle is very cute, and the pink liquid in the clear glass makes it look very feminine. It even has a plastic top that looks like crystal, very cute. Inspired By Juicy Couture Perfume, but I cant imagine Juicy would smell like this.Overwhelmingly floral, its okay, but its more like something my grandmother would wear.

Oz. / 100 ml - Cologne\nWatermark Beauty\n{'Package Dimensions': '4.5 x 3 x 1.5 inches; 9.59 Ounces'}\nThe biggest issue with all of the colognes by Watermark Beauty is the fact that they do not last strong or long. You need to reapply to make sure you still smell good by the end of the night. That being said this leopard For Men, Eau De Parfum smells amazing. Its very manly and I love the scent of it on my fiance! It reminds me of a water fresh shaving cream or aftershave and is very nice smelling, sort of aspin-like, light and not too strong. The bottle is relatively large and at 3.3 Fl. Oz. / 100 ml even if you have to reapply during the afternoon it should last a while. The bottle is sleek and modern looking with its flat black matte surface. The black clear lid does not snap on well however and comes off easily. The spray pump makes it easy to apply, and its definitely one of my top 5 scents that my fiance owns.
