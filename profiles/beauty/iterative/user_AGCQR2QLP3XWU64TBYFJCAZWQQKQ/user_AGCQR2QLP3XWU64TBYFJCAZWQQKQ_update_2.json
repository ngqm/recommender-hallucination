However, I can tell you that this Lady Passion perfume smells nice. It has a very distinct citrus smell, almost grapefruity type smell. Its nice on the nose but not really my favorite kind of scent when I want to wear a perfume. It comes in a very large 3.3 Fl. Oz./100 ml glass bottle that should last you a while, however I did notice that the scent dissipated quite dramatically from me as the day went on and if I wanted to keep the good smell to be continuously noticeable I would have to reapply, but its price is very affordable. It comes with an easy push squirt application nozzle. I received this product at a discounted rate<br /><br />Thanks &#60;3\nReview Title: Fruity\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

But lets face it, some of us women are so fascinated by them! We love to pop and pull and squeeze and get all the gunk out of not only our faces, but our spouses. Eeeewww. Until not long ago I did not realize how much popping pimples is so bad for your skin! Leaves holes and scarring and no wonder I have such big pores... So after learning that I was so excited to try out this Deluxe Premium Blackhead & Blemish Remover Kit by Mac Professional. This set comes with so many different tools its hard to know where to start. There is one tool in particular that is the coolest, though a bit dangerous. It has two heads that screw into each side for safety and can be removed and screwed on the sides, and has a lancet and another head. Its extremely sharp and you must be careful with it, this is a &#34;professional&#34; set so I really don't use more than the ones just to remove blackheads, very nice set, and I love that it comes with a case that has inserts to safely store every piece. I received this product at a discounted rate<br /><br />Thanks &#60;3\nBe careful with these tools if you dont know how to use them.\nWatermark Beauty Lady Passion Perfume 3.3 Fl Oz Inspired by Designer Brand Perfume\nWatermark Beauty\n['Sexy but casual, lady passion boasts classy notes like apple, freesia, peach, mimosa, jasmine, combined with some woody tones to bring a perfume that will become every Ladys Passion.
