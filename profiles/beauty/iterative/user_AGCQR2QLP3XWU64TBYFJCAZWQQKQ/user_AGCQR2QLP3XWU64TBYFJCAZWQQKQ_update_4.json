This Super Star For Women, Eau de Toilette by Watermark Beauty is strong. Not my favorite by far, but lasts well throughout the day. That being said when I spray myself it is so strong I have the need to want to wave away some of the scent it really invades your nostrils. The first whiff is overwhelming of alcohol, and needs some time to disperse to make it smell better. One spray should do just fine, so this 2.7 Fl. Oz. / 80 ml will last for a long time. The bottle is very cute, and the pink liquid in the clear glass makes it look very feminine. It even has a plastic top that looks like crystal, very cute. Inspired By Juicy Couture Perfume, but I cant imagine Juicy would smell like this.Overwhelmingly floral, its okay, but its more like something my grandmother would wear. I received this product at a discounted rate\nReview Title: Not for me.\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

But lets face it, some of us women are so fascinated by them! We love to pop and pull and squeeze and get all the gunk out of not only our faces, but our spouses. Eeeewww. Until not long ago I did not realize how much popping pimples is so bad for your skin! Leaves holes and scarring and no wonder I have such big pores... So after learning that I was so excited to try out this Deluxe Premium Blackhead & Blemish Remover Kit by Mac Professional. This set comes with so many different tools its hard to know where to start. There is one tool in particular that is the coolest, though a bit dangerous. It has two heads that screw into each side for safety and can be removed and screwed on the sides, and has a lancet and another head. Its extremely sharp and you must be careful with it, this is a &#34;professional&#34; set so I really don't use more than the ones just to remove blackheads, very nice set, and I love that it comes with a case that has inserts to safely store every piece.

However, I can tell you that this Lady Passion perfume smells nice. It has a very distinct citrus smell, almost grapefruity type smell. Its nice on the nose but not really my favorite kind of scent when I want to wear a perfume. It comes in a very large 3.3 Fl. Oz./100 ml glass bottle that should last you a while, however I did notice that the scent dissipated quite dramatically from me as the day went on and if I wanted to keep the good smell to be continuously noticeable I would have to reapply, but its price is very affordable. It comes with an easy push squirt application nozzle. I received this product at a discounted rate<br /><br />Thanks &#60;3\nFruity\nDiva Scent For Women, Eau De Parfum 2.8 Fl.

It is supposed to be inspired by Juicy, however I have not ever tried Juicy before so I cant tell you how close it is unfortunately. I can tell you, however, that it smells very fruity with a milk floral scent. Very sweet and refreshing and very hip for the younger women. Almost like a fruity dryer sheet, but in a good way. It comes in a rectangular clear bottle and the perfume itself is pink and very girly, it even has a pink bow around the spray nozzle. I think this 2.8 Fl. Oz. / 80 ml bottle should last quite a while, and after 3 good sprays in the morning I cold still smell it on my shirt at the end of the night. The only thing I did not like was that the golden cap was on so tight that I actually pulled off the bottom piece when trying to get the lid off, other than that I really like this perfume.
