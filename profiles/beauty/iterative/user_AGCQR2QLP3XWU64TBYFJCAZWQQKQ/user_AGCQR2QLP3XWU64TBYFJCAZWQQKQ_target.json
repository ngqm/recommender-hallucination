They are pretty easy to use too! The instructions are on the back of the box and they even have pictures for you to follow. To heat up the wax strips all you have to do is use your hands and rub them and the heat from your body allows the wax to warm up enough for you to pull the paper apart. You simply stick the wax strips on the area that you want the hair removal. It didn't really say how long you should leave it on before removing it but I feel like it needs to cool a bit to get a bit harder before you pull it off. One of my issues is that I didn't feel like it pulled off all the hair that I wanted to be gone within that area that I put the strip. If I am going to go through some pain for this hair removal I don't want to have to do it multiple times on the same area of skin. To finish up you are supposed to open the post cleaning wipes, however they left my skin oily and feeling kind of greasy and I didn't like those. I preferred to finish up with some of my own CBD lotion. Overall I think it worked, but not well enough for my liking.\nReview Title: Not for me\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

But lets face it, some of us women are so fascinated by them! We love to pop and pull and squeeze and get all the gunk out of not only our faces, but our spouses. Eeeewww. Until not long ago I did not realize how much popping pimples is so bad for your skin! Leaves holes and scarring and no wonder I have such big pores... So after learning that I was so excited to try out this Deluxe Premium Blackhead & Blemish Remover Kit by Mac Professional. This set comes with so many different tools its hard to know where to start. There is one tool in particular that is the coolest, though a bit dangerous. It has two heads that screw into each side for safety and can be removed and screwed on the sides, and has a lancet and another head. Its extremely sharp and you must be careful with it, this is a &#34;professional&#34; set so I really don't use more than the ones just to remove blackheads, very nice set, and I love that it comes with a case that has inserts to safely store every piece.

However, I can tell you that this Lady Passion perfume smells nice. It has a very distinct citrus smell, almost grapefruity type smell. Its nice on the nose but not really my favorite kind of scent when I want to wear a perfume. It comes in a very large 3.3 Fl. Oz./100 ml glass bottle that should last you a while, however I did notice that the scent dissipated quite dramatically from me as the day went on and if I wanted to keep the good smell to be continuously noticeable I would have to reapply, but its price is very affordable. It comes with an easy push squirt application nozzle. I received this product at a discounted rate<br /><br />Thanks &#60;3\nFruity\nDiva Scent For Women, Eau De Parfum 2.8 Fl.

It is supposed to be inspired by Juicy, however I have not ever tried Juicy before so I cant tell you how close it is unfortunately. I can tell you, however, that it smells very fruity with a milk floral scent. Very sweet and refreshing and very hip for the younger women. Almost like a fruity dryer sheet, but in a good way. It comes in a rectangular clear bottle and the perfume itself is pink and very girly, it even has a pink bow around the spray nozzle. I think this 2.8 Fl. Oz. / 80 ml bottle should last quite a while, and after 3 good sprays in the morning I cold still smell it on my shirt at the end of the night. The only thing I did not like was that the golden cap was on so tight that I actually pulled off the bottom piece when trying to get the lid off, other than that I really like this perfume.

This Super Star For Women, Eau de Toilette by Watermark Beauty is strong. Not my favorite by far, but lasts well throughout the day. That being said when I spray myself it is so strong I have the need to want to wave away some of the scent it really invades your nostrils. The first whiff is overwhelming of alcohol, and needs some time to disperse to make it smell better. One spray should do just fine, so this 2.7 Fl. Oz. / 80 ml will last for a long time. The bottle is very cute, and the pink liquid in the clear glass makes it look very feminine. It even has a plastic top that looks like crystal, very cute. Inspired By Juicy Couture Perfume, but I cant imagine Juicy would smell like this.Overwhelmingly floral, its okay, but its more like something my grandmother would wear.

Oz. / 100 ml - Cologne\nWatermark Beauty\n{'Package Dimensions': '4.5 x 3 x 1.5 inches; 9.59 Ounces'}\nThe biggest issue with all of the colognes by Watermark Beauty is the fact that they do not last strong or long. You need to reapply to make sure you still smell good by the end of the night. That being said this leopard For Men, Eau De Parfum smells amazing. Its very manly and I love the scent of it on my fiance! It reminds me of a water fresh shaving cream or aftershave and is very nice smelling, sort of aspin-like, light and not too strong. The bottle is relatively large and at 3.3 Fl. Oz. / 100 ml even if you have to reapply during the afternoon it should last a while. The bottle is sleek and modern looking with its flat black matte surface. The black clear lid does not snap on well however and comes off easily. The spray pump makes it easy to apply, and its definitely one of my top 5 scents that my fiance owns. I received this product at a discounted rate.<br /><br />Thanks &#60;3\nManly sexy scent!\nBlack Intense For Men, 3.0 Fl.

A bit intense when first sprayed on, but very mellow shortly afterwards. It reminds me of a lot of scents that say &#34;refreshing&#34; or &#34;water.&#34; I absolutely love the smell. Its not even super manly either and could almost be worn by a woman without much notice. I definitely love this smell on my fiance and I think it is my most favorite of all the polo inspired scents by Watermark Beauty. Of course like most of the other ones my biggest issue is that they not not last all day long. They start puttering out about halfway through the day and will need to be re-applied, and also like most others it comes in a large 3.0 Fl. Oz./ 90 ml bottle, so it should last a while even with a second application every day. It is inspired by Black Cologne but I have not had the chance to smell it so I cant tell you how close they are, nor do I care because this scent is amazing. Recommended! I received this product at a discounted rate<br /><br />Thanks &#60;3\nGreat smell, I only wish it lasted longer.\nShungHO Hairband Cap Woolen Braiding Knitted Headband Warm Hats\nShungHO\n{}\nThis ShungHO Hairband Cap Woolen Braiding Knitted Headband is much better quality than I was even expecting. It came in just a clear plastic cover. The braiding and knit of the yarn is very nice, with no frayed or loose hanging ends that I could see. The braiding looks super cute, and would go well with some braided boot socks. It does feel like wool, so it is a bit scratchy but not uncomfortably so. It was thicker than I expected it to be and keeps your head nice and warm. I did notice it seems to ride up on the back of my head a bit which I do not like, but that is no problem of the product, just the nature of the design. It looks a bit strange with your hair down but looks pretty cute with it up in a messy bun. I think I would have liked it a bit more if it was a bit less wide, because it covers so much that it looks a bit strange. I do however, like the fact that it covers pretty much half of my ears as well, to keep them nice and cozy during cold evenings and frosty mornings. Quality product.<br /><br />~Thanx~\nFit me well even though I am  plus size with a large head.\nBiotin Infused Zenlash Eyelash Growth Serum, Best Eyelash Serum Clinically Proven To Grow Visibly Thicker, Longer, Stronger, Fuller, Lashes And Brows In Weeks, Large 7ml Bottle\nZenith Skincare\n{'Brand': 'Zenith Skincare', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '5 x 0.75 x 0.75 inches', 'Package Information': 'Bottle', 'Package Type': 'Box', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '5 x 0.75 x 0.75 inches; 0.35 Ounces', 'UPC': '700461602019'}\nSo far I couldn't get this product in my routine for long enough to see how well it works at all. I don't want to give it a bad review because of my lack of ambition with it, but I don't want to lie and say that its an amazing product either. This Biotin Infused Zenlash Eyelash Growth Serum is definitely easy to use. It comes in a little wrapped bottle similar to a mascara bottle, except the brush looks more like a detail nail polish brush. The idea is simple, you brush it on your lash line everyday and wait and watch. It was a bit hard for me to get my lid closed all the way and brush this one, but I am not one who uses make up much either. If you do use make up it will probably come a lot faster for ya. I did accidentally get a bit in my eye before and I was happy to see, though it doesn't feel good, it didn't irritate me much either. I really wish I could say that I saw a huge transformation, but after only managing to use it for one straight week, I didn't see much difference.<br /><br />~Thanx~\nHonestly couldnt get it into my routine long enough to see if it truely works.\nBingirl Fashion Hair Styling Pomade Silver Ash Grandma Grey Hair Wax Men Temporary Disposable Hair Dye Coloring Mud Cream\nBingirl\n{'Hair Type': 'All Hair Types,Type', 'Item Form': 'Cream,Wax', 'Brand': 'Bingirl', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Unit Count': '4.2 Ounce', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '2.99 x 2.91 x 2.09 inches; 5.61 Ounces'}\nThis product is actually really cool and just as easy to use in real life as it seems like in the pictures. Comes with a silvery tone putty type substance in a little container all you have to do is put your hands in kind of rub it around your hands and then run it through your hair. It was really the easy to do on someone else but takes a little bit more time to do on yourself though if you get some on your skin or ears or wherever you can just take a wet damp towel or a white or something like that and wipe it right off. In the picture that shows you doing it too long hair but I tried it on my long hair and absolutely did not work I could not pull a comb through it and it was hard and strange and it definitely works better on men's hair that is short. When it was dry it got kind of hard like a gel or something like that. It's really easy to make it look nice you just have to continue working it through the hair until you get the desired color and style that you want. We tried it on a beard as well and it didn't look as good on the beard it kind of looked better on the medium to short hair but not super super short like a beard. We even used it and my boyfriend's hair who is African-American and it came out pretty cool. Kind of makes you look like you have silver gray hair. It was really easy to wash out renting it out just with water gets a lot of it off but a little bit of shampoo get it out in just a second. I don't recommend going to bed with this in your hair as it will leave silver glimmery stuff on your pillowcase to make sure you wash before going to sleep or laying down on anything.\nEasy to use and wash out, not for long hair\nBody Wax Strips, Hair Removal Waxing Strips for Face Legs Underarms Brazilian Bikini Women with 40 Count Cold Wax Strips and 5 Post Wipes\nCARETHYS\n{'Item Form': 'Strip', 'Brand': 'CARETHYS', 'Number of Items': '50', 'Unit Count': '80 Count', 'Use for': 'Legs, Face', 'Package Dimensions': '7.6 x 5.9 x 0.8 inches; 4.8 Ounces'}\nI hadn't had much experience with waxing, however I have tried wax pearls before and that definitely wasn't working for me, and though I usually just stick with good old fashioned razors but I thought I would try these easy to use wax strips.
