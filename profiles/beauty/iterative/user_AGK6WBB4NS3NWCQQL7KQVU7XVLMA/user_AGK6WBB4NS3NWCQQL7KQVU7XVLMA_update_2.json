So far both my husband and I are impressed with the quality of these brushes. They are firmer than the name brand brush but that is good because the brand brushes splay out the bristles long before the 3 month recommended change time. He tried this brush first and commented that his teeth felt so much cleaner, when I brushed later I agreed with his reaction. These come 4 in a package with color rings attached. The brushes are not individually wrapped so the extras went into a plastic bag for clean storage.\nReview Title: Terrific Value\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Osensia Silver Conditioner for Brassy Hair - Toning Purple Conditioner - Paraben Free Blonde Treatment for Highlights, Platinum, Bleached, and Gray Hair - Grape Seed Hydrates and Brightens Color\nOsensia\n{'Brand': 'Osensia', 'Item Form': 'conditioner', 'Material Feature': 'Paraben Free', 'Hair Type': 'Oily, Color Treated, bleached, Dry, Normal', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.5 x 2.2 x 2.2 inches; 9.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '039853185725'}\nMy hair is professionally colored monthly and I still have problems with oxidation resulting in brassiness. I began using this conditioner shortly after my hair was colored in November and I just went for a touch up and got feed back from my stylist. While I thought the color had less brassiness I wanted her professional opinion. Without prompting she said my hair looked great (except for the roots) and asked what I had been doing different. The silver conditioner was my response. My husband, who is totally white haired also has been using the conditioner once per week. To keep the yellow out of his hair he shampoos and conditions purple once a week and this has been a positive addition to his routine. Be careful not to over use this product because the results will be undesirable.\nReduces Oxidation and Brassiness\nReplacement Toothbrush Heads Compatible With Oral B Braun Electric Toothbrush, 4 Count\nHDY\n{'Brand': 'HDY', 'Size': '4 Count (Pack of 1)', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Item Firmness Description': 'Extra Soft', 'Number of Pieces': '4', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '0.43 x 0.39 x 2.76 inches; 0.81 Ounces', 'UPC': '632088377561', 'Manufacturer': 'HDY'}\nAfter buying name brand toothbrushes for years I was skeptical to try an off brand.
