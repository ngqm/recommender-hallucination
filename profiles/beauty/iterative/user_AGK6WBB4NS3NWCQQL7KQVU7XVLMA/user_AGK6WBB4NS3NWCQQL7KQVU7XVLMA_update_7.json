However, the kind of strong fragrance lessens  rather fast. After application my skin tingles from the mint for about 10 minutes. This is a lightweight moisturizer and it sinks in rather quickly. The cream is housed in a jar so you need to dig your fingers in to get the product. Not my favorite delivery system because it gets under my nails. As a long time body moisturizer user I think this is a terrific gift.\nReview Title: Fragrance is true to description\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Osensia Silver Conditioner for Brassy Hair - Toning Purple Conditioner - Paraben Free Blonde Treatment for Highlights, Platinum, Bleached, and Gray Hair - Grape Seed Hydrates and Brightens Color\nOsensia\n{'Brand': 'Osensia', 'Item Form': 'conditioner', 'Material Feature': 'Paraben Free', 'Hair Type': 'Oily, Color Treated, bleached, Dry, Normal', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.5 x 2.2 x 2.2 inches; 9.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '039853185725'}\nMy hair is professionally colored monthly and I still have problems with oxidation resulting in brassiness. I began using this conditioner shortly after my hair was colored in November and I just went for a touch up and got feed back from my stylist. While I thought the color had less brassiness I wanted her professional opinion. Without prompting she said my hair looked great (except for the roots) and asked what I had been doing different. The silver conditioner was my response. My husband, who is totally white haired also has been using the conditioner once per week. To keep the yellow out of his hair he shampoos and conditions purple once a week and this has been a positive addition to his routine. Be careful not to over use this product because the results will be undesirable.\nReduces Oxidation and Brassiness\nReplacement Toothbrush Heads Compatible With Oral B Braun Electric Toothbrush, 4 Count\nHDY\n{'Brand': 'HDY', 'Size': '4 Count (Pack of 1)', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Item Firmness Description': 'Extra Soft', 'Number of Pieces': '4', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '0.43 x 0.39 x 2.76 inches; 0.81 Ounces', 'UPC': '632088377561', 'Manufacturer': 'HDY'}\nAfter buying name brand toothbrushes for years I was skeptical to try an off brand. So far both my husband and I are impressed with the quality of these brushes. They are firmer than the name brand brush but that is good because the brand brushes splay out the bristles long before the 3 month recommended change time. He tried this brush first and commented that his teeth felt so much cleaner, when I brushed later I agreed with his reaction. These come 4 in a package with color rings attached. The brushes are not individually wrapped so the extras went into a plastic bag for clean storage.\nTerrific Value\nFAELBATY 2 Pack Shower Caps for Women Waterproof and Reusable Elastic Printed Shower Cap Beauty Salon Spa Shower Caps (leopard)\nFAELBATY\n{'Brand': 'FAELBATY', 'Material': 'Ethylene Vinyl Acetate (EVA)', 'Pattern': 'Leopard', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Number of Pieces': '2', 'Package Dimensions': '8.9 x 6.65 x 1.06 inches; 1.41 Ounces'}\nPersonally I like this shower cap better than a more expensive one I already had. It comes flat so if you plan to travel with it it is a good choice. I like it because it is not so bouffant that it gets wet and then drips down my back as I am toweling off. It dries fast too. This fits my average size head without drooping on to my forehead during a shower.\nFolds Flat\nMOSTORY Glitter Crystal Liquid Eyeshadow Set - 4 Pack Pigmented Liquid Eye shadows Matte Shimmer Metallic Quick Dry Crease Resistant Long Lasting Flake-Proof Blendable Non-Greasy Eye Makeup (4 Pack)\nMOSTORY\n{'Brand': 'MOSTORY', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Finish Type': 'Matte', 'Special Feature': 'Long last, Crease proof, Blendable', 'Product Benefits': 'Long Lasting', 'Package Dimensions': '4.84 x 4.49 x 0.87 inches; 5.11 Ounces'}\nFour glittering shades of eye shadow make up this affordable set. The applicator is easy to use and the product goes on smoothly and stays on for hours. For special events or if you are a dramatic personality these shadows will have you rocking the look.  These shadows scream creativity and fun. As an accent for a more discreet look or a full blown lid cover these are the glittery choice to make.\nBeautiful Shades\nTopwon 4.5Inch Makeup Remover Pads Washable Cotton Face Cleansing Pad for Sensitive Skin 3 Packs Facial Washing Puffs to Remove Mascara Foundation Lipstick\nTopwon\n['Make up removal pads are easily exfoliating and remove all makeup, creams, sunscreen & cosmetics when wet.It can be facial makeup cleansing towel, eye makeup remover cloths, foundation make-up remover wipes, lipstick removing cleaning puff.

These are a pretty pink and are so soft.  For makeup removal with no cleanser they cleaned my face and removed a lot of eye makeup but not all of it. I am removing eye makeup with cotton pads but face makeup can be totally removed with this little pad. These are softer than washcloths and feel great. I washed them with my towels and they came out perfect.\nSoft\nBirthday Gift, Yachyee hair removal device\nYachyee\n[\"What's in Yachyee Relaxing Gifts for Women:\", '--- 12 oz Rose Gold insulated stainless steel tumbler with a reusable straw and cleaning brush, with the words \"\"Beauty begins the moment you love yourself\"\". --- Flower Petal Bath Bombs, drop them into the tub to relax among the delicate aromas of vanilla and lavender petals. --- Scented Candle, made of 100% soy wax, luxurious and all-natural, can immediately turn your space into a little serene and peaceful flower garden. --- Rose Bar Soap, made with natural flower essential oil to bring you to a dreamland of lavender cloud. --- Beautiful Key Bottle Opener and heart shape Wine Bottle Stopper --- Greeting Card, you can write your special blessing to her. \ud83c\udf88 DON\\'T FORGET TO SELECT \"\"THIS ORDER CONTAINS A GIFT\"\" AT CHECKOUT TO ADD YOUR FREE PERSONALIZED MESSAGE THROUGH AMAZON.\ud83c\udf88 50th 60th 40th birthday gifts for women 30th birthday gifts for her get well soon gift basket gifts for women gift basket for women self care gifts for women sister birthday gifts from sister']\n{'Item Form': 'Variety', 'Material Feature': 'Organic Ingredients, Vegan', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'Yachyee', 'Number of Items': '4', 'Product Dimensions': '7.7 x 6.8 x 3.5 inches; 12 Ounces', 'UPC': '697478889727', 'Manufacturer': 'Yachyee'}\nThe sentiment on the tumbler sets the tone for this gift box. \"Beauty begins the moment you love yourself\" is artistically written in alternating script and uppercase print on the dishwasher safe tumbler. The lid is plastic with a shuffle opening. The gift box includes a reusable straw and a small brush for cleaning. A wine plug with a heart on top is thoughtfully provided too. Two nice size bath bombs alsopopulate the arrangement. A single wick scented candle is a nice size for a bathroom and it adds fragrance without being overpowering. A square rose soap wrapped in cellophane finishes the presentation. This all comes in a gift box with a pretty \"Best Wishes\" enclosure card with a blank inside to write a few words of your own. I like that the fragrance is not overpowering when the box is opened, as each scented item is unwrapped you can experience the pleasant aroma of the product. The inside cover of the box says \"Be Happy Forever.\" The outside of the box has the company name followed by Thinking of you. This is a perfect generic gift ready to affirm someone who needs it or to celebrate an occasion.\nImpressive Gift\nPrairie Rose Organics Cocoa Butter Cream Peppermint Body Butter - Mint Cocoa Whipped Body Cream\nPrairie Rose Organics\n{'Brand': 'Prairie Rose Organics', 'Scent': 'Mint,Peppermint', 'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Unit Count': '8.0 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '4.21 x 4.21 x 3.15 inches; 10.23 Ounces', 'UPC': '617270048740'}\nThis smells just like a peppermint mocha beverage.
