I've been using one for a couple of weeks and it doesn't show any signs of wear.  The aggressive side is not so aggressive as to tear up the skin - I've had some in the past that did. Ouch!  The smooth side is great for a final smoothing.  I've included a photo showing the exact size of the pads.  One slight negative, and I don't know whose fault it was, but one of the pads arrived broken.  Looked like it could have been packaged better.  Despite that, highly recommended.\nReview Title: Work Great, Nice that They're Two-Sided\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Boar Bristle Hair Brush Set With Wide Tooth Tail Comb Natural Soft Hair Brushes For Women Kids Mens Hair Brush For Straightening Styling Smoothing Brush Adds Shine Fine Hair Brush For Men\nSonvera\n{'Brand': 'Sonvera', 'Hair Type': 'Curly, Fine, Thick, Thin', 'Material': 'Boar', 'Package Dimensions': '9.53 x 3.23 x 1.89 inches; 5.68 Ounces', 'UPC': '353012722652'}\nI'm male with relatively short, somewhat thinning hair.  The brush works great for me.  The bristles are relatively soft and flexible so it doesn't feel like I'm trying to tear my scalp off. Comb is too stiff but I can see where someone else might like it.  Now the fun part.  I didn't know what that little metal-tined thing (photo 2) was for.  I figured it was a mustache comb and I have a mustache so I gave it a try.  Worked great!  The little tines penetrated the mustache hairs and felt great on the underlying skin.  Kinda like an exfoliater!  I loved it.  Couldn't find a description of it on the product's page so I reviewed a couple of similar products and discovered that it's actually for cleaning the brush.  Not for me - I'm using it on my mustache.  Nice product and seems to be high quality. Highly recommend.\nGood for Medium to Short Length Man's Hair\nBath Bombs, SAZEN Bath Bomb with Natural & Organic Essential Oils, Shea Coconut Butter for Skin Moisturize, Bubble Spa Bath, Birthday Mothers Day Christmas Handmade Gift Set for Women Kids Her Him\nSAZEN\n{'Brand': 'SAZEN', 'Scent': 'Coconut', 'Material Feature': 'Organic Ingredients', 'Unit Count': '24.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '24', 'Package Dimensions': '12.17 x 6.26 x 2.24 inches; 2.65 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'SAZEN 01', 'UPC': '745103723622', 'Manufacturer': 'SAZEN'}\nAll around a very nice set, especially for the price.  I've paid a lot more for a lot less.  The bombs themselves are very nice. Very good aroma and they actually do moisturize as opposed to most others.  The ones I've used so far colored the bath water.  Not a problem as it didn't cause any \"rings\" on the tub and I came out with skin the same color as when I went in, minus some dirt.  I'll be buying some as Christmas gifts.  Recipients will think I spent a lot more that I actually did!.  Highly recommended.\nNice Set, Great Gift\nNail Files 16 Pcs, Double Sided Emery Board Manicure Tools for Filing Natural Gel and Acrylic Nails for Home and Salon Use\nKeiby Citom\n{'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'Keiby Citom', 'Grit Number': '100', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '7.8 x 5.08 x 0.59 inches; 5.29 Ounces', 'UPC': '742025065137', 'Manufacturer': 'YHIT'}\nI have some other nail files that are very similar but are a bit stiffer and seem to last longer.  After one use I can see wear on these files whereas I can't see it on my other files.  And although they have the same grit they don't seem to cut as aggressively.  They're good but not the best.  Recommended for the price.\nGood, Not Best\nPumice Stone for Feet, 2 in 1 Double Sided Hard Skin Callus Remover for Feet,Hands and Body, Exfoliator Pedicure File Block Callus Remover Scrubber (Pack of 4)\nKSang\n{'Brand': 'KSang', 'Material': 'Volcanic Stone', 'Is Electric': 'No', 'Item Form': 'Scrubber, Filer', 'Unit Count': '4.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '6 x 5.6 x 2.7 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'UPC': '192242957393'}\nFour Pack should last a good long time.
