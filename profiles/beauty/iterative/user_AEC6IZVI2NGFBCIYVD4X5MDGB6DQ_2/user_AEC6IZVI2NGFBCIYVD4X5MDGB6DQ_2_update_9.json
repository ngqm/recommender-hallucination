When I was in the shower and squirted some shampoo into my hand, I was amazed to see that the shampoo really is a dark purple color. I asked myself if I could live with it if it actually turned my hair purple, decided I could, and lathered up. The shampoo did an excellent job of creating a strong lather, and my hair felt really clean when I rinsed it out. The shampoo has a soft floral fragrance that is very pleasant. I took a quick look in the mirror to see if my hair was purple, and it wasn't, so I then squirted out some conditioner into my hand. It was purple, too, although thicker and lighter in color than the shampoo. As I rubbed the conditioner into my hair, the wonderful floral scent of the conditioner filled my shower--what a delightful sensory treat! I checked my hair again when I got out of the shower and dried off--still no purple hair, thank goodness. However, when I squirted some shampoo into my hand to take a photo, there was a big purple stain on my hand when I washed the shampoo off. I squirted the conditioner in a different spot on my hand for that photo, and it did the same thing. I've washed my hands several times since then, and the purple stains are still there. So...even though the product information online says it works fine with gray and white hair, I look down at my purple stains on my hand and I have to wonder. Since I love the smell of this shampoo and conditioner and how incredibly soft it leaves my hair, I'm going to continue using it. If it turns my hair purple at some point in the future, I'll do an update and give everyone fair warning.\nReview Title: Not Just a Name, The Shampoo and Conditioner Really Are Purple\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Boar Bristle Hair Brush Set With Wide Tooth Tail Comb Natural Soft Hair Brushes For Women Kids Mens Hair Brush For Straightening Styling Smoothing Brush Adds Shine Fine Hair Brush For Men\nSonvera\n{'Brand': 'Sonvera', 'Hair Type': 'Curly, Fine, Thick, Thin', 'Material': 'Boar', 'Package Dimensions': '9.53 x 3.23 x 1.89 inches; 5.68 Ounces', 'UPC': '353012722652'}\nI'm male with relatively short, somewhat thinning hair.  The brush works great for me.  The bristles are relatively soft and flexible so it doesn't feel like I'm trying to tear my scalp off. Comb is too stiff but I can see where someone else might like it.  Now the fun part.  I didn't know what that little metal-tined thing (photo 2) was for.  I figured it was a mustache comb and I have a mustache so I gave it a try.  Worked great!  The little tines penetrated the mustache hairs and felt great on the underlying skin.  Kinda like an exfoliater!  I loved it.  Couldn't find a description of it on the product's page so I reviewed a couple of similar products and discovered that it's actually for cleaning the brush.  Not for me - I'm using it on my mustache.  Nice product and seems to be high quality. Highly recommend.\nGood for Medium to Short Length Man's Hair\nBath Bombs, SAZEN Bath Bomb with Natural & Organic Essential Oils, Shea Coconut Butter for Skin Moisturize, Bubble Spa Bath, Birthday Mothers Day Christmas Handmade Gift Set for Women Kids Her Him\nSAZEN\n{'Brand': 'SAZEN', 'Scent': 'Coconut', 'Material Feature': 'Organic Ingredients', 'Unit Count': '24.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '24', 'Package Dimensions': '12.17 x 6.26 x 2.24 inches; 2.65 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'SAZEN 01', 'UPC': '745103723622', 'Manufacturer': 'SAZEN'}\nAll around a very nice set, especially for the price.  I've paid a lot more for a lot less.  The bombs themselves are very nice. Very good aroma and they actually do moisturize as opposed to most others.  The ones I've used so far colored the bath water.  Not a problem as it didn't cause any \"rings\" on the tub and I came out with skin the same color as when I went in, minus some dirt.  I'll be buying some as Christmas gifts.  Recipients will think I spent a lot more that I actually did!.  Highly recommended.\nNice Set, Great Gift\nNail Files 16 Pcs, Double Sided Emery Board Manicure Tools for Filing Natural Gel and Acrylic Nails for Home and Salon Use\nKeiby Citom\n{'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'Keiby Citom', 'Grit Number': '100', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '7.8 x 5.08 x 0.59 inches; 5.29 Ounces', 'UPC': '742025065137', 'Manufacturer': 'YHIT'}\nI have some other nail files that are very similar but are a bit stiffer and seem to last longer.  After one use I can see wear on these files whereas I can't see it on my other files.  And although they have the same grit they don't seem to cut as aggressively.  They're good but not the best.  Recommended for the price.\nGood, Not Best\nPumice Stone for Feet, 2 in 1 Double Sided Hard Skin Callus Remover for Feet,Hands and Body, Exfoliator Pedicure File Block Callus Remover Scrubber (Pack of 4)\nKSang\n{'Brand': 'KSang', 'Material': 'Volcanic Stone', 'Is Electric': 'No', 'Item Form': 'Scrubber, Filer', 'Unit Count': '4.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '6 x 5.6 x 2.7 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'UPC': '192242957393'}\nFour Pack should last a good long time.  I've been using one for a couple of weeks and it doesn't show any signs of wear.  The aggressive side is not so aggressive as to tear up the skin - I've had some in the past that did. Ouch!  The smooth side is great for a final smoothing.  I've included a photo showing the exact size of the pads.  One slight negative, and I don't know whose fault it was, but one of the pads arrived broken.  Looked like it could have been packaged better.  Despite that, highly recommended.\nWork Great, Nice that They're Two-Sided\nTweezers for Eyebrows, MORGLES 5PCS Tweezers for Women Precision Tweezers Set with Eyebrow Brush Leather Case for Eyebrow Ingrown Hair Removal\nMORGLES\n{'Package Dimensions': '6.73 x 4.06 x 0.75 inches; 7.83 Ounces', 'UPC': '616010018807', 'Manufacturer': 'MORGLES'}\nVery nice set of tweezers along with an exceptionally sharp small pair of scissors.  The case looks good and is secured by a snap connector.  There are individual slide-in holders for each pair of tweezers and the scissors.  There isn't a slot for the brush but I just put it in with one of the tweezers.  The quality of the tweezers is outstanding.  They appear to be very well machined and they passed my \"grab a hair\" test.  What I do is try to grad a single fine hair off of my arm.  If the tweezers get it in one try and can hold on to it to pull it out, they pass.  Each pair of tweezers passed the test.  Another thing I like is that this set doesn't have a bunch of needless junk in it that just takes up room.  This set can fit in my shaving kit without taking up extra space.  Highly recommend.\nPassed the \"Grab a Hair\" Test\nPursoma Minerals Hot Tub Bath Treatment, 10.5 oz\nPursoma\n{'Brand': 'Pursoma', 'Scent': 'Ginger', 'Product Benefits': 'Detox,Rejuvenating', 'Unit Count': '10.5 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '8.82 x 5.67 x 1.93 inches; 10.86 Ounces', 'Item model number': '8880004', 'UPC': '082045397789', 'Manufacturer': 'Pursoma'}\nNasal congestion has been part of my life for the past 40 years or so.  Hate to say it but nasal sprays have been the one and only thing that tends to relieve the congestion.  Usually once a day before bedtime.  Ordered this product to give it a shot.  I followed the instructions and added the product (actually two products) to a hot bath and hopped in.  Sat soaking for about 15 minutes with no relief.  Then I put a muslin washcloth over my face and started pouring hot bath water over it.  After about five minutes of deep breathing (in through the nose, out through the mouth) the nasal congestion started breaking up somewhat.  Didn't completely break up but got better.  Drained the tub (tons of sandy debris left) and took a hot shower to rinse the clay, etc, off.  That's when the congestion broke loose.  I was able to blow my nose and breath through my nose with very little to no congestion.  Unfortunately the relief didn't last all that long, probably about three hours.  At 36 bucks a pop, that's 12 dollars per hour for three hours relief.  Pass, I can buy a lot of nasal spray for $36.\nCleared-Up Nasal Congestion But Only Temporarily\nRancco Dried Flower Buds Fragrant Petals Ball, 10 Kinds Natural Organic Flowers Ball, Premium Grade Dried Blooming Flower Tea Balls for Tea, Baking or Bath Bombs\nRancco\n{'Brand': 'Rancco', 'Scent': 'Honey, Rose, Lily', 'Material Feature': 'Vegan', 'Unit Count': '10.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '10', 'Package Dimensions': '9.49 x 6.26 x 1.1 inches; 3.88 Ounces'}\nThe pictures of these \"petal balls\" on the web page are bigger than the actual balls.  I was kind of expecting the opposite.  I followed the directions and put one of the balls in a dish and poured boiling water over it.  It was kind of fun to watch it re-hydrate but that was about the end of the enjoyment.  The \"fragrance\" given off by these petal balls was akin to a weak tea although I surely wouldn't drink it.  As for putting one in a tub, I suspect the \"bloom\" would clog up the drain and just create a mess.  Plus I don't want to take a bath in a pot of tea.  I'll have to pass on this one.\nIMHO Not Fragrant and They're Tiny\nPursoma Digital Detox Bath Treatment, 10 oz\nPursoma\n{'Brand': 'Pursoma', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Cleansing', 'Product Benefits': 'Detox,Rejuvenating', 'Material Feature': 'Phthalate Free,Paraben Free,Non GMO', 'Package Dimensions': '8.78 x 5.79 x 1.89 inches; 10 Ounces', 'Item model number': '8880002-AMZ', 'UPC': '082045397765', 'Manufacturer': 'Pursoma'}\nI've got a bad back and regularly do Epsom salt soaks in very warm to hot water.  I usually pay about $5 for a bag of Epsom salt that's good for 4-5 baths.  That's about $1 per soak.  The Pursoma Digital Detox Bath Soak did about as much to relax me and relief pain as the Epsom salt and with the Epsom salt I don't have to shower to remove the \"mud\" and rinse out the mud/dirt from the tub after using it.  I suspect more of the relaxation comes from the hot water and length of time a person soaks as it does from any additive put in the water.  With the Epsom salt baths I can also add in a bath bomb for a couple bucks more and enjoy the aroma and moisturizing effects of the bomb.  I'll stick with my routine.\nNot at $34 a pop\nPurple Shampoo and Conditioner Set - No, Orange, Yellow or Brassy Tones - Best Toner Treatment for Brassiness - Blonde, Grey, Bleached or Silver Hair - Sulfate Free\nPURE NATURE LUX SPA\n{'Product Benefits': 'Nourishing,Clean,Gentle', 'Material Type Free': 'Sulfate Free', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Brand': 'PURE NATURE LUX SPA', 'Hair Type': 'Color', 'Package Dimensions': '7.68 x 6.06 x 3.19 inches; 2.68 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'PURE NATURE LUX SPA', 'UPC': '765066671143'}\nI got this shampoo and conditioner for my wife--here is her review: I wanted this shampoo and conditioner because it said it worked really well for gray and white hair--as a senior I have plenty of both--and because it got good reviews re fragrance and how soft it left hair.
