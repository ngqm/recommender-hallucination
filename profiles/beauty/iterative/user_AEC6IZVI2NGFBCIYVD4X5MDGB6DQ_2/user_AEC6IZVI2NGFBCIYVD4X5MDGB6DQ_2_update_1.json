The brush works great for me.  The bristles are relatively soft and flexible so it doesn't feel like I'm trying to tear my scalp off. Comb is too stiff but I can see where someone else might like it.  Now the fun part.  I didn't know what that little metal-tined thing (photo 2) was for.  I figured it was a mustache comb and I have a mustache so I gave it a try.  Worked great!  The little tines penetrated the mustache hairs and felt great on the underlying skin.  Kinda like an exfoliater!  I loved it.  Couldn't find a description of it on the product's page so I reviewed a couple of similar products and discovered that it's actually for cleaning the brush.  Not for me - I'm using it on my mustache.  Nice product and seems to be high quality. Highly recommend.\nReview Title: Good for Medium to Short Length Man's Hair\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
