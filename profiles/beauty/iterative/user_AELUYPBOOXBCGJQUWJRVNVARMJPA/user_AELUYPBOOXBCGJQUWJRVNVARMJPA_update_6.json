While I\u2019m not noticing any less of the darkness under my eyes I do notice they don\u2019t seem as dry.<br />It\u2019s easy to use and does not have a scent that I can detect. It only takes a small amount under each eye. Blot it in and follow with an overall face moisturizer and your ready to go.<br />I like this product.\nReview Title: Like this\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

It's horrible. The shampoo does not lather and the conditioner does not condition. It does not smell good and it left my hair feeling like straw. Very dry straw. I do not recommend this. You will be sorry.<br />To be fair though this does cut down on that brassy or yellowish look.<br />I hate giving bad reviews but this product is no good.\nHorrid\nHair Curlers Spiral Curls Large Hair Rollers Wavy Hair Curler - Self Grip and No Heat Hair Styling Kit for Most Kinds Of Hairstyles With 2 Magic Wands (28 Pcs, 30cm)\nRIPPLE\n{'Hair Type': 'Wavy', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Size': '28 Count (Pack of 1)', 'Brand': 'RIPPLE', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '9.09 x 6.93 x 3.31 inches; 7.37 Ounces'}\nThese were easy to use after watching a YouTube video explaining how to use them. I had no idea until I watched that. They were so easy though. I washed my hair and let it get almost dry then used these. I have long hair and was afraid doing the end parts would leave the upper part of my hair frizzy but it didn't. They worked great. Next time I will leave them on overnight too. I have soft and bouncy hair and these made my very curly underneath part lay much better. No more. using heat on my hair.<br />It would have got 5 stars had it come with just a picture showing how to use these. Also I am wondering how to get the wand back apart to store it.<br />I very highly recommend this product.\nSo neat\nikoo Deep Caring Hair Mask, Hydrate & Shine, Great for Normal, Dry or Lackluster Hair, All Natural Ingredients, Effectively Hydrates, Moisturizes & Adds Shine - 6.8 Fl Oz\nikoo\n{'Brand': 'Ikoo', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Material Feature': 'Natural, Cruelty Free, Vegan', 'Hair Type': 'Dry,Normal', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '3.74 x 3.74 x 3.15 inches; 11.68 Ounces'}\nNot only is this product worthless, it stinks. I hated the smell. I can't tell if it is onion or garlic or a combo of the two. It didn't work out my tangles at all and I left it on a bit more than ten minutes.<br />I do not recommend this product. Save your money.<br />I received this as a Vine Reviewer and this is my honest opinion.\nSmells nice\nVeencys - Hair Straightening Treatment - Brazilian Keratin - Chocolate Treatment -Maximum Strength-Ideal for Moisturizing Eliminates Frizzy Hairs Smooth Hair 32oz (946 ml)\nVeencys\n{'Package Dimensions': '9.84 x 3.15 x 3.11 inches; 2.34 Pounds'}\nFirst listed ingredient is aqua formaldehyde. What\u2019s up with that. I will not use this until it\u2019s explained to me. That is a bit scary.<br />Don\u2019t buy this product until that is rectified. It\u2019s dangerous. You can google the effects of the formaldehyde and see for yourself.<br />In the picture, above the green line are the ingredients. The first one is formaldehyde.\nScary\nBlackhead Remover Pore Vacuum- Inface Blackhead Remover Suctioner, USB Electric Acne Comedone Whitehead Extractor Tool with 4 Different Type Replaceable Probes\nINFACE\n{'Brand': 'INFACE', 'Item Form': 'Pen', 'Material': 'Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene', 'Color': 'Pearl White', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Package Dimensions': '8.1 x 4 x 2 inches; 11.99 Ounces', 'Item model number': '01', 'UPC': '767136985860', 'Manufacturer': 'inFace', 'Country of Origin': 'China'}\nI have some blackheads on my nose and whiteheads on my chin and this helps get them out. I think with continued use it will keep them under control. I do recommend you using it. Be sure and read the instructions first though.\nI like this\nIvnil hair removal spray pack of 2\nIvnil\n{'Item Form': 'Spray', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Anti-aging', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Brand': 'Ivnil', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Fl Oz', 'Package Dimensions': '2.76 x 2.32 x 2.28 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'UPC': '752771042412'}\nThis product makes my under eyes feel great.
