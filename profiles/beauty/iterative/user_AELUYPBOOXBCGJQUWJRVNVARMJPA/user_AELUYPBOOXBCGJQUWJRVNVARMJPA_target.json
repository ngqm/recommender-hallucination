The problem is that some of them just didn\u2019t work. The couple that did though held my hair great. Whether in a full pony or just pulling part of my hair back out of my face. Some would not stay closed though and just fell. The colors are pretty. And they are pretty easy to use once you get the hang of it.<br />Nice product for the ones that worked.\nReview Title: Fair\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Purple Shampoo and Conditioner Set - No, Orange, Yellow or Brassy Tones - Best Toner Treatment for Brassiness - Blonde, Grey, Bleached or Silver Hair - Sulfate Free\nPURE NATURE LUX SPA\n{'Product Benefits': 'Nourishing,Clean,Gentle', 'Material Type Free': 'Sulfate Free', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Brand': 'PURE NATURE LUX SPA', 'Hair Type': 'Color', 'Package Dimensions': '7.68 x 6.06 x 3.19 inches; 2.68 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'PURE NATURE LUX SPA', 'UPC': '765066671143'}\nIf I could I would give this minus stars. It's horrible. The shampoo does not lather and the conditioner does not condition. It does not smell good and it left my hair feeling like straw. Very dry straw. I do not recommend this. You will be sorry.<br />To be fair though this does cut down on that brassy or yellowish look.<br />I hate giving bad reviews but this product is no good.\nHorrid\nHair Curlers Spiral Curls Large Hair Rollers Wavy Hair Curler - Self Grip and No Heat Hair Styling Kit for Most Kinds Of Hairstyles With 2 Magic Wands (28 Pcs, 30cm)\nRIPPLE\n{'Hair Type': 'Wavy', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Size': '28 Count (Pack of 1)', 'Brand': 'RIPPLE', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '9.09 x 6.93 x 3.31 inches; 7.37 Ounces'}\nThese were easy to use after watching a YouTube video explaining how to use them. I had no idea until I watched that. They were so easy though. I washed my hair and let it get almost dry then used these. I have long hair and was afraid doing the end parts would leave the upper part of my hair frizzy but it didn't. They worked great. Next time I will leave them on overnight too. I have soft and bouncy hair and these made my very curly underneath part lay much better. No more. using heat on my hair.<br />It would have got 5 stars had it come with just a picture showing how to use these. Also I am wondering how to get the wand back apart to store it.<br />I very highly recommend this product.\nSo neat\nikoo Deep Caring Hair Mask, Hydrate & Shine, Great for Normal, Dry or Lackluster Hair, All Natural Ingredients, Effectively Hydrates, Moisturizes & Adds Shine - 6.8 Fl Oz\nikoo\n{'Brand': 'Ikoo', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Material Feature': 'Natural, Cruelty Free, Vegan', 'Hair Type': 'Dry,Normal', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '3.74 x 3.74 x 3.15 inches; 11.68 Ounces'}\nNot only is this product worthless, it stinks. I hated the smell. I can't tell if it is onion or garlic or a combo of the two. It didn't work out my tangles at all and I left it on a bit more than ten minutes.<br />I do not recommend this product. Save your money.<br />I received this as a Vine Reviewer and this is my honest opinion.\nSmells nice\nVeencys - Hair Straightening Treatment - Brazilian Keratin - Chocolate Treatment -Maximum Strength-Ideal for Moisturizing Eliminates Frizzy Hairs Smooth Hair 32oz (946 ml)\nVeencys\n{'Package Dimensions': '9.84 x 3.15 x 3.11 inches; 2.34 Pounds'}\nFirst listed ingredient is aqua formaldehyde. What\u2019s up with that. I will not use this until it\u2019s explained to me. That is a bit scary.<br />Don\u2019t buy this product until that is rectified. It\u2019s dangerous. You can google the effects of the formaldehyde and see for yourself.<br />In the picture, above the green line are the ingredients. The first one is formaldehyde.\nScary\nBlackhead Remover Pore Vacuum- Inface Blackhead Remover Suctioner, USB Electric Acne Comedone Whitehead Extractor Tool with 4 Different Type Replaceable Probes\nINFACE\n{'Brand': 'INFACE', 'Item Form': 'Pen', 'Material': 'Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene', 'Color': 'Pearl White', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Package Dimensions': '8.1 x 4 x 2 inches; 11.99 Ounces', 'Item model number': '01', 'UPC': '767136985860', 'Manufacturer': 'inFace', 'Country of Origin': 'China'}\nI have some blackheads on my nose and whiteheads on my chin and this helps get them out. I think with continued use it will keep them under control. I do recommend you using it. Be sure and read the instructions first though.\nI like this\nIvnil hair removal spray pack of 2\nIvnil\n{'Item Form': 'Spray', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Anti-aging', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Brand': 'Ivnil', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Fl Oz', 'Package Dimensions': '2.76 x 2.32 x 2.28 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'UPC': '752771042412'}\nThis product makes my under eyes feel great. While I\u2019m not noticing any less of the darkness under my eyes I do notice they don\u2019t seem as dry.<br />It\u2019s easy to use and does not have a scent that I can detect. It only takes a small amount under each eye. Blot it in and follow with an overall face moisturizer and your ready to go.<br />I like this product.\nLike this\nRetinol Anti-aging Night Cream, Face Moisturizer for Anti-aging, Firming, Moisturizing With 3% Retinol, 2% Hyaluronic Acid, Polypeptides, Fullerenes, Vitamin C and E-American Brand\nGO MAY\n{'Brand': 'GO MAY', 'Scent': 'Fragrance free', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Active Ingredients': 'Retinol, Hyaluronic Acid, Polypeptides, Fullerenes, Vitamin C and Vitamin E', 'Unit Count': '1.0 Ounce', 'Product Dimensions': '2 x 2 x 3 inches; 6.74 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'GM-FC05', 'UPC': '734327009391', 'Manufacturer': 'Rixin'}\nThis product is very easy to use and does leave your face feeling soft once it absorbed in. I like the way the container is made. You get enough to cover your face with two pushes. I like using it at night when your face is more acceptable to moisturizers. It is kind of pricy but it\u2019s also pretty good.\nOk\nPremium Taza Natural Moroccan Argan Oil Peppermint & Tea Tree Conditioner, 16 fl oz (473 ml) \u2666 For Healthy, Smooth, Silky Hair \u2666 Contains: Moroccan Argan Oil, Broccoli Seed Oil, Pro Vitamin B5, Hydrol\nTaza\n{'Brand': 'Taza', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Hair Type': 'Frizzy', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2.48 x 2.48 x 8.27 inches; 1.06 Pounds', 'UPC': '628451263623'}\nThis is just ok for me. It gets out tangles but that is about all. It left my hair soft but did nothing for frizz.<br />It's decently priced and the scent is great.\nJust ok\n8PC Lazy Bird's Nest Plate Hairpin Velvet Bird Nest Shaped Hair Clips Expandable Ponytail Holder Hair Loops Nest Plate Hairpin Hair Claw Clip barrette\nAhkeaDirectly\n{'Brand': 'AhkeaDirectly', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Embellishment': 'Resin', 'Material': 'Plastic', 'Package Dimensions': '6.02 x 5.2 x 2.32 inches; 4.16 Ounces', 'UPC': '761312153890'}\nThese are way cute. The problem is that some of them just didn\u2019t work. The couple that did though held my hair great. Whether in a full pony or just pulling part of my hair back out of my face. Some would not stay closed though and just fell. The colors are pretty. And they are pretty easy to use once you get the hang of it.<br />Nice product for the ones that worked.\nFair",
