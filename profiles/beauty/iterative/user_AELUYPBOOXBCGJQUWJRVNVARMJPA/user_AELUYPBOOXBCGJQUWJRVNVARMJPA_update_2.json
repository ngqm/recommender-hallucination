I had no idea until I watched that. They were so easy though. I washed my hair and let it get almost dry then used these. I have long hair and was afraid doing the end parts would leave the upper part of my hair frizzy but it didn't. They worked great. Next time I will leave them on overnight too. I have soft and bouncy hair and these made my very curly underneath part lay much better. No more. using heat on my hair.<br />It would have got 5 stars had it come with just a picture showing how to use these. Also I am wondering how to get the wand back apart to store it.<br />I very highly recommend this product.\nReview Title: So neat\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

It's horrible. The shampoo does not lather and the conditioner does not condition. It does not smell good and it left my hair feeling like straw. Very dry straw. I do not recommend this. You will be sorry.<br />To be fair though this does cut down on that brassy or yellowish look.<br />I hate giving bad reviews but this product is no good.\nHorrid\nHair Curlers Spiral Curls Large Hair Rollers Wavy Hair Curler - Self Grip and No Heat Hair Styling Kit for Most Kinds Of Hairstyles With 2 Magic Wands (28 Pcs, 30cm)\nRIPPLE\n{'Hair Type': 'Wavy', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Size': '28 Count (Pack of 1)', 'Brand': 'RIPPLE', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '9.09 x 6.93 x 3.31 inches; 7.37 Ounces'}\nThese were easy to use after watching a YouTube video explaining how to use them.
