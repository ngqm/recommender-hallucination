  "reference_summary": "Purple Shampoo and Conditioner Set - No, Orange, Yellow or Brassy Tones - Best Toner Treatment for Brassiness - Blonde, Grey, Bleached or Silver Hair - Sulfate Free\nPURE NATURE LUX SPA\n{'Product Benefits': 'Nourishing,Clean,Gentle', 'Material Type Free': 'Sulfate Free', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Brand': 'PURE NATURE LUX SPA', 'Hair Type': 'Color', 'Package Dimensions': '7.68 x 6.06 x 3.19 inches; 2.68 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'PURE NATURE LUX SPA', 'UPC': '765066671143'}\nIf I could I would give this minus stars. It's horrible. The shampoo does not lather and the conditioner does not condition. It does not smell good and it left my hair feeling like straw. Very dry straw. I do not recommend this. You will be sorry.<br />To be fair though this does cut down on that brassy or yellowish look.<br />I hate giving bad reviews but this product is no good.\nHorrid\nHair Curlers Spiral Curls Large Hair Rollers Wavy Hair Curler - Self Grip and No Heat Hair Styling Kit for Most Kinds Of Hairstyles With 2 Magic Wands (28 Pcs, 30cm)\nRIPPLE\n{'Hair Type': 'Wavy', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Size': '28 Count (Pack of 1)', 'Brand': 'RIPPLE', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '9.09 x 6.93 x 3.31 inches; 7.37 Ounces'}\nThese were easy to use after watching a YouTube video explaining how to use them. I had no idea until I watched that. They were so easy though. I washed my hair and let it get almost dry then used these. I have long hair and was afraid doing the end parts would leave the upper part of my hair frizzy but it didn't. They worked great. Next time I will leave them on overnight too. I have soft and bouncy hair and these made my very curly underneath part lay much better. No more. using heat on my hair.<br />It would have got 5 stars had it come with just a picture showing how to use these. Also I am wondering how to get the wand back apart to store it.<br />I very highly recommend this product.\nSo neat\nikoo Deep Caring Hair Mask, Hydrate & Shine, Great for Normal, Dry or Lackluster Hair, All Natural Ingredients, Effectively Hydrates, Moisturizes & Adds Shine - 6.8 Fl Oz\nikoo\n{'Brand': 'Ikoo', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Material Feature': 'Natural, Cruelty Free, Vegan', 'Hair Type': 'Dry,Normal', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '3.74 x 3.74 x 3.15 inches; 11.68 Ounces'}\nNot only is this product worthless, it stinks.
