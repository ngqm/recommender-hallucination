A good soak is totally relaxing.  I was in a deep soak cycle when I was able to first use this product.  My old one uses replaceable batteries and not water proof.  This is water proof, and rechargeable---perfect for the bath.  Try not to let it submerge, I think that's common sense. Works just fine in the shower too.  Started out with a good exfoliate  which removes and loosens dry skin.  Next step was to use Dove liquid on the brushes----feels fabulous and clean.  That is how I enjoy my personal time.<br />All of the heads you will ever need are included with this luxury product from the very sensitive brush up to the massaging brush head, there are three.  It has three speeds, a very small footprint and lasts a long time on a single charge, a one minute timer allowing the right time per area.  It really isn't complicated at all---also comes with a patent carrying case, large enough to hold everything.  Excellent product!\nReview Title: Exfoliate And Clean\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
