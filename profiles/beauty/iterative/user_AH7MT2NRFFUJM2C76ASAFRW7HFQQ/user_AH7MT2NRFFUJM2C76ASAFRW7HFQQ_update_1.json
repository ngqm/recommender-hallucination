This small thing works great on my particular length, thickness and curliness of hair. You just twiddle the bobbles around each other, and it makes my hair look classier than i thought it would. It works very well because of my curls. I did used to used the bigger spiral hair ties from this brand when I had thicker, longer hair, but those are too big for the amount of hair i have now. This works perfectly though. It\u2019s just right.\nReview Title: Good for my thinning, but very curly hair\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
