They really do help with air flow when your are blow drying your hair. I wouldn\u2019t use any other kind of brush actually.<br /><br />But this is my first experience with an Argan Oil Infused Brush, and i am impressed. It\u2019s the perfect size to blow dry my bangs/fringe smooth and silky looking, and give it an impressive curl. I don\u2019t blow dry the rest of my hair with a brush as it\u2019s curly (i use a diffuser on it.) I have a longer section at the back that requires blow drying with a brush, to curl it under a little bit, and because I\u2019ve just recently freshly dyed my hair red, the shine is superb with this.<br /><br />It\u2019s excellent quality, and yes it may cost a little more than your average barrel brush with holes, but in my opinion, the results are worth it.<br /><br />It\u2019s such a pretty colour, and very ergonomic and lightweight in your hand, and comes in a nice box, that it would make a nice Gift.\nReview Title: Beautiful brush\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

This small thing works great on my particular length, thickness and curliness of hair. You just twiddle the bobbles around each other, and it makes my hair look classier than i thought it would. It works very well because of my curls. I did used to used the bigger spiral hair ties from this brand when I had thicker, longer hair, but those are too big for the amount of hair i have now. This works perfectly though. It\u2019s just right.\nGood for my thinning, but very curly hair\ninvisibobble Pink Ball Hair Ties with Coil, TWINS Prima Ballerina - Ponytail Holder - No Damage, Wrap and Twist - Pain-Free Hair Accessories for Girls and Women - Gentle for Girls Teens and Thick Hair\ninvisibobble\n{'Color': 'Prima Ballerina', 'Item Form': 'Spiral', 'Brand': 'Invisibobble', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '1.97 x 0.87 x 1.85 inches', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Language': 'Spanish', 'Product Dimensions': '1.97 x 0.87 x 1.85 inches; 0.32 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'IB-TW', 'Manufacturer': 'invisibobble'}\nMy hair is maybe shoulder length, layered, and thinning, and i can twiddle one these up into my hair with no issues. I feel like someone with thicker hair might struggle getting one in.<br /><br />I really like them, as they give me a messy, sort of updo kind of look, without it looking like a formal ponytail. Which is impossible for me anyway, with my layered curly thinning hair. In fact the only way for to achieve a smooth head of hair is to use a flatiron and a ton of product, and i just don\u2019t do that. It looks unnatural on me. I like these for the ability to look casual and unstructured. When i had longer thicker hair,i used the original invisibobble spirals, which were a game changer. These products do not tangle in your hair like a regular hair elastic often does. The products made by this company have revolutionized ponytails.\nPerfect for short to medium hair\nGrown Alchemist Anti-Pollution Primer (50ml / 1.69oz)\nGrown Alchemist\n['GROWN ALCHEMIST ANTI \u2013 POLLUTION PRIMER.

So i was somewhat surprised when i squeezed some out onto my hand and it\u2019s actually colourless.<br /><br />Upon application, it smooths instantly into my skin, and transforms to a perfectly powdery finish, silky almost. Pores are minimized definitely, and it makes applying make up afterward, an absolute breeze.<br /><br />I was using Tatcha Primers - i tried both their Liquid Silk Canvas, which is much lighter in texture than their Silk Canvas which i always found a little difficult spreading evenly.<br /><br />This Grown Alchemist Anti Pollution Primer reminds me of a favourite i used - Benefit Porefessional, with a similar texture to that.<br /><br />It does minimize my pores. It makes my skin feel great, and ml for ml works out cheaper than Benefit\u2019s, so that\u2019s a win win situation.<br /><br />And whether i apply foundation or just a powder on top, both go on super smoothly, and nothing settles into the cracks.<br /><br />I\u2019m very much enjoying this primer.\nGreat texture\nKopari Bubblegum Lip Gloss Kit | Strawberry, Grape, and Bubble Gum Flavors | Hydrating Blend of Shea Butter and Coconut Oil to Nourish and Soothe Chapped Lips | Vegan and Cruelty-Free\nKopari\n{'Brand': 'Kopari', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Sheer', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Smoothening,Soothing,Shine,Nourishing', 'Package Dimensions': '4.69 x 3.19 x 1.34 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '850036833345'}\nKopari, you have done it again.<br />Fabulous little set of Lip Glosses, super moisturizing and contain Coconut Oil, Shea Butter and Squalane for those dry peely cracked lips.<br /><br />They go on nice and smooth, just gently squeeze the tube, and a little bit comes out, but don\u2019t press too hard. They look great over a Matte Finish Lippy, or just on their own, of the three flavours (grape, bubblegum, and strawberry) my fave is the strawberry, which has a reddish pink tint, but isn\u2019t strongly coloured, and goes on sheer. It wouldn\u2019t affect the colour of any lippy you were wearing underneath.<br /><br />They aren\u2019t sticky, and i no longer have long hair that clings to such products, so i can wear them without that happening anymore.<br /><br />I like this set a lot, it\u2019s a beautiful presentation, as are all Kopari products I\u2019ve had, and could easily be gifted to any Lip Gloss lovers out there, of any age, in my humble opinion.\nMoisturizing ingredients\nOGC Cosmetics Hair Mask Anti Frizz 8.5 Fl Oz - 250 Milliliters\nOGC Cosmetics\n{'Brand': 'OGC Cosmetics', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Material Feature': 'Cruelty Free', 'Hair Type': 'Frizzy', 'Product Benefits': 'Frizz Control', 'Product Dimensions': '7.09 x 2.36 x 2.36 inches; 0.01 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'OGC Cosmetics'}\nI\u2019m going to go ahead and compare this to what most other people rave about as being a gold standard hair care product - Olaplex - which does nothing for my hair, and is expensive for what you get.<br /><br />This is much better value for money, works better than \u201cO\u201d and smells nicer.<br /><br />My hair looks soft, bouncy, voluminous, almost shiny (my hair never shines likes in the shampoo ads) and the frizzy back of it, is completely gone.<br />I must explain i have 2 textured hair - at the back it\u2019s very curly, and goes frizzy, at the front, it\u2019s limp and wavy, gets frizzy on the sides when I\u2019m asleep, so for me, this stuff is great. My Mother takes one look at me on FaceTime, and immediately criticizes my hair, tells me it looks dry - i have to explain to her, that what she is seeing is my frizzy hair from having just woken up, or maybe it is frizzy from being dry, i don\u2019t even know, I\u2019m not a trichologist for heaven\u2019s sake. But she did say that my hair was looking better when she spoke to me the other day.<br />It makes my curls defined, and my waves soft and silky. It fixes the frizz.<br />I\u2019d definitely get this again.\nGood hair mask\nAISI QUEENS Long Wavy Wigs for Women Dirty Blonde Wig Highlights Synthetic Middle Part Wig Natural Looking Heat Resistant Fiber Hair for Girls Daily Party Use 20 Inch\nAISI QUEENS\n{'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy', 'Special Feature': 'Heat Resistant', 'Brand': 'AISI QUEENS', 'Cartoon Character': 'Halloween', 'Package Dimensions': '11.73 x 9.25 x 2.56 inches; 10.3 Ounces'}\nI got this one for a bit of a glamour look, I\u2019m a redhead naturally, but i liked the look of this ones beachy waves, and natural styling.<br />It is pretty realistic looking, and better looking than a human hair wig that i recently got. In fact the human hair wig looked very synthetic, whereas this looks quite natural on.<br /><br />I always feel as though it looks noticeable at the front, but my neighbour told me it looked great, and not as noticeable as i was feeling it looked.<br /><br />The thing is, for the most part, 99% of a wig is the hair part, with 1% for the hairline, and what are most people looking at? I\u2019d say the hair.<br /><br />So, while you can successfully lay down and hide, the lace front on a human hair wig, if the hair on that wig looks fake and artificial, then it makes no difference that you\u2019ve successfully blended the hairline, if you\u2019ve got brassy yellow doll\u2019s hair on your head.<br /><br />On this wig, that 1% hairline that i felt was so noticeable, is overshadowed by the really pretty 99% hair. and you could wear a hat or scarf on the hairline if you\u2019re that bothered by it.<br /><br />I had my husband try it on lol, he looked like a rockstar, and that\u2019s when i noticed that the hairline is not nearly as noticeable as i thought, when it was on me.<br /><br />So, I\u2019m thrilled with this wig.\nBetter than some of the \u201chuman\u201d hair wigs\nYouClean 300 Antibacterial Travel Hand Soap Sheets - Pocket/Purse/Wallet/Backpack -Great for Outdoor Camping or Daily Use (Tea Party) (Tea Party)\nYouClean\n['Brand:', 'YouClean', 'Item Form:', 'Sheet', 'Formulation:', 'Concentrated plant-based soap', 'Scent:', 'Tea Party (Chamomile, Green Tea, Tea Tree)', 'Package Box Size:', '2 x 1 x 1.5 inch', 'www.shopyouclean.com', \"We are changing our packaging.

I\u2019ve paid $5 for one filled dispenser, with a generic scent one time, and i still thought that was a great thing to have. With this pack of 8 different scents, for less than $16, you\u2019re getting a package for less than $2.<br />To say they are handy is an understatement. They are a Godsend. I don\u2019t know how often I\u2019ve gone into a bathroom, and the soap dispenser is empty. I was recently camping, and their soap dispenser in the toilets was empty during our whole stay. One thoughtful camper, left a bar of soap in a clear plastic cup, but it was a bit grimy with hairs on it, and i didn\u2019t want to use that. With these handy pocket, or purse sized dispensers, you have a fresh sheet of soap each time. And they lather up very easily, as soon as they get wet.<br />They are small enough to put into the smallest purse, even your wallet, or pocket, and you\u2019ll never be caught it out the ability to wash your hands.<br />These will last a while, as I\u2019m not planning on giving any away. I might offer a sheet here and there, but not a whole dispenser for goodness sake. I\u2019ll tell them where they can get their own.<br />I\u2019m currently using the Tea Tree and it\u2019s very fresh. I do feel very clean after using these, and will continue to recommend them to my friends.<br />Great value pack.\nI\u2019d give these 10 \u2b50\ufe0f if i could\nBeauty Bakerie Lip Whip Liquid Metallic Lipstick, Long Lasting Lip Color, Smudge Proof Makeup, Berried, 3.5 mL\nBeauty Bakerie\n['Beauty Bakerie Berried metallic Lip whip is a metallic red liquid lipstick with hints of deep purple.

Normally i like a creme finish, because for lighter colours that have a frost or shimmer, it feels old fashioned to me. Still doesn\u2019t stop me hoarding them though lol.<br />I find this leans very golden on me, and less pink, and does look pretty metallic.<br />It stays on well, which is exactly why i got it. I hate re-applying lipstick.<br />This colour for me, is more of a summery colour, and goes well with the light golden and freckly look I\u2019ve managed to acquire this year.<br /><br />It\u2019s pretty, long lasting, looks good with a gloss on top, i do recommend it.\nVery pretty colour\nBeauty Bakerie Lip Whip Liquid Metallic Lipstick, Long Lasting Lip Color, Smudge Proof Makeup, Berried, 3.5 mL\nBeauty Bakerie\n['Beauty Bakerie Berried metallic Lip whip is a metallic red liquid lipstick with hints of deep purple.

(I love Jeffree Star\u2019s formula best) and I exclusively wear them because of the longevity, i do not like to have to keep putting lipstick on. If you\u2019ve tried a lot of liquid lipsticks, you\u2019ll know that formulas can be hit and miss. Some are very flaky when they dry, some smudge. Some are a perfect consistency, and i can\u2019t say I\u2019ve found many of those. But this is one of them.<br /><br />The colour is fantastic and looks amazing on my 56 year old freckly face. It\u2019s a doe foot applicator, and is fairly easy to apply if you're confident with liquid lipstick. It\u2019s richly pigmented, and one coat was enough.<br /><br />I did not find this to be flaky when it dried. It did take marginally longer than some other brands, but once it dried, it\u2019s properly smudge proof. It looks great as is, or with a gloss on top if you like that look. I have Beauty Bakerie\u2019s Enchanted Jelly gloss, which is shimmering with iridescent fine glitter, and it looks awesome.<br /><br />And now that Fall is coming, this is going to be worn a lot. I love it. I see more tubes of this colour coming my way. I\u2019ll get anxious when my tube starts to run low.<br />And as with all Beauty Bakerie products, it\u2019s beautifully presented, and makes your heart race just to receive it lol.\nProbably my new favourite lippie\nL\u2019ange Argan-Infused Round Brush | Lightweight & Ergonomic Design | 43MM Tourmaline Ceramic Barrel\nL'ANGE HAIR\n{'Brand': \"L'ANGE HAIR\", 'Color': 'Rose Gold, Black', 'Shape': 'Round', 'Product Benefits': 'Smoothing', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '10.51 x 2.64 x 2.56 inches; 3.84 Ounces', 'UPC': '810108191223'}\nI\u2019ve had many of these types of brush (with holes in the barrel) over the years.
