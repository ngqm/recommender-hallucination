So i was somewhat surprised when i squeezed some out onto my hand and it\u2019s actually colourless.<br /><br />Upon application, it smooths instantly into my skin, and transforms to a perfectly powdery finish, silky almost. Pores are minimized definitely, and it makes applying make up afterward, an absolute breeze.<br /><br />I was using Tatcha Primers - i tried both their Liquid Silk Canvas, which is much lighter in texture than their Silk Canvas which i always found a little difficult spreading evenly.<br /><br />This Grown Alchemist Anti Pollution Primer reminds me of a favourite i used - Benefit Porefessional, with a similar texture to that.<br /><br />It does minimize my pores. It makes my skin feel great, and ml for ml works out cheaper than Benefit\u2019s, so that\u2019s a win win situation.<br /><br />And whether i apply foundation or just a powder on top, both go on super smoothly, and nothing settles into the cracks.<br /><br />I\u2019m very much enjoying this primer.\nReview Title: Great texture\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

This small thing works great on my particular length, thickness and curliness of hair. You just twiddle the bobbles around each other, and it makes my hair look classier than i thought it would. It works very well because of my curls. I did used to used the bigger spiral hair ties from this brand when I had thicker, longer hair, but those are too big for the amount of hair i have now. This works perfectly though. It\u2019s just right.\nGood for my thinning, but very curly hair\ninvisibobble Pink Ball Hair Ties with Coil, TWINS Prima Ballerina - Ponytail Holder - No Damage, Wrap and Twist - Pain-Free Hair Accessories for Girls and Women - Gentle for Girls Teens and Thick Hair\ninvisibobble\n{'Color': 'Prima Ballerina', 'Item Form': 'Spiral', 'Brand': 'Invisibobble', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '1.97 x 0.87 x 1.85 inches', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Language': 'Spanish', 'Product Dimensions': '1.97 x 0.87 x 1.85 inches; 0.32 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'IB-TW', 'Manufacturer': 'invisibobble'}\nMy hair is maybe shoulder length, layered, and thinning, and i can twiddle one these up into my hair with no issues. I feel like someone with thicker hair might struggle getting one in.<br /><br />I really like them, as they give me a messy, sort of updo kind of look, without it looking like a formal ponytail. Which is impossible for me anyway, with my layered curly thinning hair. In fact the only way for to achieve a smooth head of hair is to use a flatiron and a ton of product, and i just don\u2019t do that. It looks unnatural on me. I like these for the ability to look casual and unstructured. When i had longer thicker hair,i used the original invisibobble spirals, which were a game changer. These products do not tangle in your hair like a regular hair elastic often does. The products made by this company have revolutionized ponytails.\nPerfect for short to medium hair\nGrown Alchemist Anti-Pollution Primer (50ml / 1.69oz)\nGrown Alchemist\n['GROWN ALCHEMIST ANTI \u2013 POLLUTION PRIMER.
