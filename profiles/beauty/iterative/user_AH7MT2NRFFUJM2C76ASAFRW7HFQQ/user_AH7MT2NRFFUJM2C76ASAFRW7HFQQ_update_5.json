My Mother takes one look at me on FaceTime, and immediately criticizes my hair, tells me it looks dry - i have to explain to her, that what she is seeing is my frizzy hair from having just woken up, or maybe it is frizzy from being dry, i don\u2019t even know, I\u2019m not a trichologist for heaven\u2019s sake. But she did say that my hair was looking better when she spoke to me the other day.<br />It makes my curls defined, and my waves soft and silky. It fixes the frizz.<br />I\u2019d definitely get this again.\nReview Title: Good hair mask\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "invisibobble Pink Ball Hair Ties with Coil, TWINS Prima Ballerina - Ponytail Holder - No Damage, Wrap and Twist - Pain-Free Hair Accessories for Girls and Women - Gentle for Girls Teens and Thick Hair\ninvisibobble\n{'Color': 'Prima Ballerina', 'Item Form': 'Spiral', 'Brand': 'Invisibobble', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '1.97 x 0.87 x 1.85 inches', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Language': 'Spanish', 'Product Dimensions': '1.97 x 0.87 x 1.85 inches; 0.32 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'IB-TW', 'Manufacturer': 'invisibobble'}\nMy hair isn\u2019t very thick, it\u2019s maybe shoulder length, and i sometimes wear it up, but i don\u2019t have too much hair so regular scrunchies and hair elastics are too much for my thinning hair. This small thing works great on my particular length, thickness and curliness of hair. You just twiddle the bobbles around each other, and it makes my hair look classier than i thought it would. It works very well because of my curls. I did used to used the bigger spiral hair ties from this brand when I had thicker, longer hair, but those are too big for the amount of hair i have now. This works perfectly though. It\u2019s just right.\nGood for my thinning, but very curly hair\ninvisibobble Pink Ball Hair Ties with Coil, TWINS Prima Ballerina - Ponytail Holder - No Damage, Wrap and Twist - Pain-Free Hair Accessories for Girls and Women - Gentle for Girls Teens and Thick Hair\ninvisibobble\n{'Color': 'Prima Ballerina', 'Item Form': 'Spiral', 'Brand': 'Invisibobble', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '1.97 x 0.87 x 1.85 inches', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Language': 'Spanish', 'Product Dimensions': '1.97 x 0.87 x 1.85 inches; 0.32 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'IB-TW', 'Manufacturer': 'invisibobble'}\nMy hair is maybe shoulder length, layered, and thinning, and i can twiddle one these up into my hair with no issues. I feel like someone with thicker hair might struggle getting one in.<br /><br />I really like them, as they give me a messy, sort of updo kind of look, without it looking like a formal ponytail. Which is impossible for me anyway, with my layered curly thinning hair. In fact the only way for to achieve a smooth head of hair is to use a flatiron and a ton of product, and i just don\u2019t do that. It looks unnatural on me. I like these for the ability to look casual and unstructured. When i had longer thicker hair,i used the original invisibobble spirals, which were a game changer. These products do not tangle in your hair like a regular hair elastic often does. The products made by this company have revolutionized ponytails.\nPerfect for short to medium hair\nGrown Alchemist Anti-Pollution Primer (50ml / 1.69oz)\nGrown Alchemist\n['GROWN ALCHEMIST ANTI \u2013 POLLUTION PRIMER.

So i was somewhat surprised when i squeezed some out onto my hand and it\u2019s actually colourless.<br /><br />Upon application, it smooths instantly into my skin, and transforms to a perfectly powdery finish, silky almost. Pores are minimized definitely, and it makes applying make up afterward, an absolute breeze.<br /><br />I was using Tatcha Primers - i tried both their Liquid Silk Canvas, which is much lighter in texture than their Silk Canvas which i always found a little difficult spreading evenly.<br /><br />This Grown Alchemist Anti Pollution Primer reminds me of a favourite i used - Benefit Porefessional, with a similar texture to that.<br /><br />It does minimize my pores. It makes my skin feel great, and ml for ml works out cheaper than Benefit\u2019s, so that\u2019s a win win situation.<br /><br />And whether i apply foundation or just a powder on top, both go on super smoothly, and nothing settles into the cracks.<br /><br />I\u2019m very much enjoying this primer.\nGreat texture\nKopari Bubblegum Lip Gloss Kit | Strawberry, Grape, and Bubble Gum Flavors | Hydrating Blend of Shea Butter and Coconut Oil to Nourish and Soothe Chapped Lips | Vegan and Cruelty-Free\nKopari\n{'Brand': 'Kopari', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Sheer', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Smoothening,Soothing,Shine,Nourishing', 'Package Dimensions': '4.69 x 3.19 x 1.34 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '850036833345'}\nKopari, you have done it again.<br />Fabulous little set of Lip Glosses, super moisturizing and contain Coconut Oil, Shea Butter and Squalane for those dry peely cracked lips.<br /><br />They go on nice and smooth, just gently squeeze the tube, and a little bit comes out, but don\u2019t press too hard. They look great over a Matte Finish Lippy, or just on their own, of the three flavours (grape, bubblegum, and strawberry) my fave is the strawberry, which has a reddish pink tint, but isn\u2019t strongly coloured, and goes on sheer. It wouldn\u2019t affect the colour of any lippy you were wearing underneath.<br /><br />They aren\u2019t sticky, and i no longer have long hair that clings to such products, so i can wear them without that happening anymore.<br /><br />I like this set a lot, it\u2019s a beautiful presentation, as are all Kopari products I\u2019ve had, and could easily be gifted to any Lip Gloss lovers out there, of any age, in my humble opinion.\nMoisturizing ingredients\nOGC Cosmetics Hair Mask Anti Frizz 8.5 Fl Oz - 250 Milliliters\nOGC Cosmetics\n{'Brand': 'OGC Cosmetics', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Material Feature': 'Cruelty Free', 'Hair Type': 'Frizzy', 'Product Benefits': 'Frizz Control', 'Product Dimensions': '7.09 x 2.36 x 2.36 inches; 0.01 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'OGC Cosmetics'}\nI\u2019m going to go ahead and compare this to what most other people rave about as being a gold standard hair care product - Olaplex - which does nothing for my hair, and is expensive for what you get.<br /><br />This is much better value for money, works better than \u201cO\u201d and smells nicer.<br /><br />My hair looks soft, bouncy, voluminous, almost shiny (my hair never shines likes in the shampoo ads) and the frizzy back of it, is completely gone.<br />I must explain i have 2 textured hair - at the back it\u2019s very curly, and goes frizzy, at the front, it\u2019s limp and wavy, gets frizzy on the sides when I\u2019m asleep, so for me, this stuff is great.
