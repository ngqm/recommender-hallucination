They are soothing and are perfectly suitable for my sensitive skin.  They are not stripping, and I've went through them without one single reaction to them (and my skin hates a lot of stuff).  I would definitely repurchase.<br /><br />Face wipes can't compare to truly washing your face with a cleanser; my skin (which needs it's exfoliation) is at it's best and most polished when I wash fully with a cleanser.  But life happens, and last nights happen, and face wipes are 1000% better than sleeping in your makeup.  They're also great for mornings when you don't really need the full cleansing routine, or as pre-wash makeup removed in the evening if you have on a lot of long wearing makeup.  So many uses, and wipes are a staple in my bathroom cabinet.  And these are some of the gentlest ones I've tried.<br /><br />I absolutely recommend for sensitive or dry skin.\nReview Title: Sensitive Skin Friendly!!!!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Ulta Eyeshadow Palette, Metals\nUlta\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '8.1 x 3.5 x 0.7 inches; 5.6 Ounces', 'UPC': '717897052646'}\nI really like this palette, but feel it should be noted that it is NOT as expected. Very nice colors, but more subdued than bold, more satin/shimmer than metallic.  This is my first Ulta palette and I am happy with the quality.  I only deducted one star because the colors are somewhat other than expected.  I paid $12.<br /><br />I specifically bought it for the green color, and I still like the green color, but it's not as bright or as metallic as the collection name caused me to expect.  The finish is something of a shimmering satin, not metallic.  The colors are somewhat subdued.  The package says &#34;jewel tones&#34; which may be more accurate than the &#34;metals&#34; description, but still (to me) implies more brightly colored shades, with fewer earth tones.  I would also expect a &#34;jewel toned&#34; palette to include a strong purple, and this only has the lilac (Dynasty). (The Royal looks purple but swatched brown with a hint of burgundy.) The colors are more woodsy than jeweled.  The green is more mossy than emerald, the purple more floral than jeweled, the blue more night sky than sapphire.<br /><br />The quality of the shadows is good.  Neither buttery nor powdery, it's a slightly dry formula that nevertheless doesn't kick up a lot of product or cause a lot of fall out.  I wear them over a primer, but I have been happy with their wear time.  As stated above, pigmentation is good in that you don't have to build heavily, but it's also not a bright coloring.<br /><br />A lovely bonus is that I actually love the brush that comes with this item!  How often do you say that about a brush in a palette?  It's not only soft and usable, it's unique among my brush collection.  It's flufflier and less flat that most brushes of it's size, and it's also smaller and more pinpointed that most brushes that have a bit of fluffiness to them.  Overall, I feel like it gives good control while still blending well.  It's quickly become a favorite brush.<br /><br />There may have been a naming crisis when creating this palette, lol.  As the palette name is Metals, the subtitle is Jewels, and every individual shade is named with a royalty/gentry theme.  The shares are: Noble (white), Lady (pale pink), Reign (earthy pink), Crown (gold), Dynasty (lilac), Royal (brown), Honor (platinum), Jester (silver), Armor (bronze),  Fortress (green), Duchess (navy), and Duke (off black).  No mattes, all satin/shimmer.  All smooth, no fall out, some apply more evenly than others (drier formula).  Swatched dry on dry skin in photo.  Will build to brighter, more shiny finish.<br /><br />I ordered this palette on a whim, and I've enjoyed it.  However, if you are wanted super metallic finishes or bright colors, you should manage your expectations.\nLovely palette, poorly named.\nReal Techniques Bold Metals: Diamond Sponge, Create Shadow or Highlighting, Multi Surfaced for Variety of Application, Synthetic Materials, Latex Free\nReal Techniques\n['Real Techniques Bold Metals: Diamond Sponge, Create Shadow or Highlighting, Multi Surfaced for Variety of Application, Synthetic Materials, Latex Free']\n{'Brand': 'Real Techniques', 'Color': 'Diamond', 'Material': 'Rubber', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '2.35 x 2 x 5.12 inches', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'For Highlighting', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2.35 x 2 x 5.12 inches; 0.48 Ounces', 'Item model number': '1552', 'UPC': '079625915525', 'Manufacturer': 'Paris Presents Incorporated'}\nI like this, but I don't love it.  It works well, but I don't think it really stands out as a revolutionary shape or as a favorite among my sponge collection.<br /><br />The feature of this sponge that I like best and used the most is the pointed tip (which has more point that is currently pictured).  The point is excellent at getting into little creviced on the face.<br /><br />The other sides a re a little gimmicky but usable (although I never use the smaller rectangular facets for anything!).  Overall I think I prefer using their brushes with rounded sides, and I think their shape feels more natural in the hand as well.  Still, I have no complaints about this one, and I really like the texture of it.  The pleasant point to this one probably renders this a tie.  Basically, I think you need a Real Techniques Face Sponge, but I don't think it matters which one; since the other is cheaper, I would probably go with it.<br /><br />It is a very soft sponge, pleasant feeling on the skin, and it seems made from quality material.  It washes clean and dries well.\nAnother good sponge from Real Techniques (I like their others equally well.)\nYes To Face Wipes for Women and Men, Sensitive Facial Cleansing Wipes for use as a Make Up Remover, Cleaning, Soothing, Cucumbers Aloe Vera (Pack of 2)\nYes To\n[\"Yes To Cucumbers Hypoallergenic Facial Wipes gently remove dirt, sweat and makeup (eye makeup too!) without the need to rinse.
