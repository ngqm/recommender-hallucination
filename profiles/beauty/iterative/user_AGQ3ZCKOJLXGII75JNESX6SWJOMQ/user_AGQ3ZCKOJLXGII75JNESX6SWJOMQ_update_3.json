My hair is very dark brown underneath it and it covers the hair beautifully and in this video, I didn't even fo as good of a job as I could have to put it on and it still looks amazing. The seam in the middle part is very subtle and if you part some of the hair to the side you can even hide the seam and it looks even more natural. I like that the top is dark and that it's ombre because it looks more natural than if it was all grey. It's beautiful grey color and the hair is very soft, long, and full, And the curls are gorgeous. I can't believe this wig costs $19.99! I've gotten other wigs that are much more expensive an dnot nearly as nice as this one. Great product!\nReview Title: Amazing - Beautiful and so soft\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

(included)', 'UPC': '616985543564', 'Manufacturer': 'FRLEDM'}\nI wish I was one of those girls that wake up looking rested and flawless. But some days I wake up looking like I cried my eyes out all night, even though I slept peacefully! Not fair. These under-eye patches have been helping you girl out. I don't know if this is how you're supposed to use them but I put them in the fridge overnight and then use them in the morning when my eyes are puffy. It feels amazing and brings down the puffiness.\nHelps puffy morning eyes\nKaruna Hit Refresh Eucalyptus Fiber-Infused Sheet Mask: Burst of Hydration & Refreshing Glow, 3 Count\nKaruna\n{'Brand': 'Karuna', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating', 'Scent': 'Eucalyptus', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Package Dimensions': '6.5 x 4.88 x 0.71 inches; 4.2 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'MSF1006 - CA', 'UPC': '857950007159'}\nThese masks were nice, felt refreshing to use, and the size fits my face well. I don't think they are that special though and there are many other masks of this type out there, so for the price of $18 for 3 sheet masks, I think it's a bit overpriced. Beautiful packaging though and goo product overall.\nRefreshing but pricey\nAltaba Long Wavy Wigs Ombre gray Wig Synthetic Wigs Middle Part Natural Looking Heat Resistant Party Cosplay Full Wig for Women\nAltaba\n{'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy', 'Brand': 'Altaba', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material Feature': 'Heat Resistant', 'UPC': '788436507620'}\n[[VIDEOID:bca26ab2386974e3c51190208f1d77a8]] I buy quite a few wigs and this is by far my favorite one I have gotten in a long time.
