Her previous favorite just had wire bristles and I was always afraid they'd be too harsh on her skin or accidentally poke her eye out.  This brush has little rounded plastic tips on each bristle.  She still gets the scratchy sensation she likes with less danger.  The \"fur eject\" button works flawlessly to remove the hair after each brushing.  AND it comes with a bristle cover to keep the bristles from getting bent in storage.

Known for its ability to strengthen hair and restore your strands to their original shine, AUTENPOO is a powerhouse nutrient in the field of hairstyling.

Packed with all sort of high-tech features and gizmos, AUTENPOO\u2019s hair flat iron brings salon-worthy results without the harsh damage of most styling devices for a natural, healthy shine with each use!

The other is the Furiden Professional Hair Straightener Titanium Flat Iron.  I'm going to write this review as a comparison between the two since they are in the same price range.  For starters, both heat up quickly, have variable temperature settings, automatic shut off and a swivel cord.  The Autenpoo (who comes up with these brand names???) brand has a mechanical on/off switch that also serves as the heat selector.  I prefer this over the Furiden which has on/off buttons and up/down buttons to set the temp on a digital screen.  If I want, I can leave the Autenpo's dial set on the temp I want (the lowest setting it has), unplug it when I'm done, plug it in the next day and it will just turn on and go to my favorite temp.  With the Furiden, I have to hold a button down to turn it on and then hit the down button 4 or 5 times to go to the lowest temp.  The Autenpoo also comes with a comb, some hair clips to section your hair during styling and a heat protective glove, and has a slide lock to keep it shut when not in use.  In all other aspects however, I prefer the Furiden.  Autenpoo's cord is super thick bulky, seriously like a vacuum cleaner cord.  It will probably last forever but adds unnecessary bulk and weight which would be especially problematic for traveling.  The main advantage Furiden has is the pointed end.  Not only is it better suited to tight areas close to your scalp or neckline but it can also help section your hair without needing a comb or your fingers.  Furthermore, the plates, which are longer overall, extend into the pointed tip to get the heat right where you need it.  Both of these irons do a perfectly fine job, but I just find the Furiden easier to use.\nNot bad but there are better choices\nAuroTrends Makeup Remover Towel,2 Pack Reusable Chemical-free Microfiber Makeup Remover Cloths,Magically and Gently Wipe Away Cosmetics,Sunscreen,Oil and Dirt,Set of 2 (Pink+Black)\nAuroTrends\n{'Brand': 'AuroTrends', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Material Feature': 'Reusable', 'Unit Count': '2.0 Count', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.52 x 2.72 x 1.42 inches; 6.4 Ounces'}\nThis is basically a long rectangle of fleece fabric with a finished edge.  How that cleans makeup without any soap, I couldn't tell you.  But it does!  I just barely dampen one small section with plain tap water and am able to wipe away liquid foundation, eye shadow and mascara.  I use a different section for the next day and toss the cloth in the wash at the end of the week.  I confess, that I don't normally wash my face at night.  I hate using those prepackaged make up remover wipes.  Single-use disposable products seem wasteful and environmentally unfriendly to me in general plus they are just like a cold slap on your face right before bed.  Even if I use cold water on this cloth, it didn't seem that cold on my face and there is no waste or ongoing cost other than washing.  My pillow case appreciates this product!\nDon't know how- but this works!\nTravel Bottles Keychain, 1.7oz/50ml Portable Hand Sanitizer Bottles, Fine Mist Spray Keychain Bottles, Empty Leakproof Refillable Containers with Flip/Spray Cap Plastic Travel Bottles (5PC)\nXITENBAO\n{'Brand': 'XITENBAO', 'Material': 'Silicone,Plastic', 'Capacity': '50 Milliliters, 1.7 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Special Feature': 'Portable, Mist Spray, Leakproof', 'Package Dimensions': '7 x 7 x 2.5 inches; 3.99 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'klp-001', 'UPC': '192408404112'}\nPros- carabiner to attach to purse or backpack, choice of spray or flip top<br />Cons- Flip top is hard to open<br /><br />It is likely that after repeated use, the flip top will become easier to open.  But when they are new, the plug that completes the seal has such a tight fit that I can barely flip it open at all.  I guess I will never have to worry about it leaking!  In addition to the obvious use for hand sanitizer, these can be used for sunscreen or travel toiletries like shampoo or non-aerosol hairspray.\nVersatile & handy\nHand Sanitizer Dearskin Alcohol 75% Based Gel Infused with Aloe Vera 2oz/60ml, Skin Care Natural Antibacterial, Refreshing Moisturizing, Pure Disinfection, Small Hand Sanitizer (3 Pack)\nDearskin\n['Dearskin Hand Sanitizer 60ml, 2oz', 'Dearskin Hand sanitizer Kills 99.9% of the most common germs!', '- Clean and Refreshing Moisturizing;', '- Long-Lasting Antibacterial;', '- Easy to use, hard to waste;', '- 75% Isopropyl Alcohol;', 'Drug Facts: Active ingredients: - Isopropyl Alcohol 75% v/v.

They are the perfect size to keep in a desk drawer or car.  The product is thick so I don't accidentally spill it and it does not seem to dry out my skin.  Even after they get the vaccine, I will probably keep these handy because colds and the flu  aren't any fun either.\nDon't leave home without it!\nAloe Vera Gel 100% Natural Moisturisers - Pure Organic Fresh Soothing Aloe-Vera Moisturizing Gel Skin Hair, Aloe Leaf Wash-free Clean After Sun Face Body (8.8 oz)\nCIMIY\n{'Brand': 'CIMIY', 'Scent': 'Aloe Vera', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Unit Count': '8.8 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Product Dimensions': '5.91 x 1.57 x 1.57 inches; 11.22 Ounces'}\nI got this hoping I'd be able to use it to soothe my skin post-radiation treatments.  Sadly, I did not notice that this is not 100% Aloe Vera gel as was recommended by my doctor.  It is \"100% organic and natural\", for whatever that's worth.  At least Aloe Vera is the first listed ingredient.  It also contains Vitamin C and E which might be OK but  Hyaluronic acid is hardly what I'd want to put on tender, inflamed skin from radiation.  I'm not even sure I'd want to use this on a sunburn.<br /><br />So anyway, I've used it on other parts of my body that weren't zapped by radiation instead.  I like the smell.  It moisturizes well and the pump dispenser is easy to use.  However, it leaves my skin feeling kind of sticky.  Couldn't wait to go wash my hands after rubbing it on my legs.\n100% \"natural\" not 100% Aloe Vera\nSasy n Savy, Citrus Souffl\u00e8 Hydrating and Nourishing Body Cr\u00e8me, Plant-Based Natural Ingredients For Daily Moisture, 6.08 fl oz(180mL)\nSasy n Savy\n{'Brand': 'Sasy n Savy', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '6.1 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Use for': 'Whole Body', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2.76 x 1.77 x 6.69 inches; 10.41 Ounces'}\nCitrus is my favorite scent when it comes to beauty products.  Or cleaning products for that matter....  It just brightens up my mood in a way that a floral scent can't do.  This lotion has a decent citrus smell to it with a touch of a sweet undertone.  It moisturized my winter-dry skin well without being sticky.  Sadly, the price puts it in the \"splurge\" category for my budget.\nI'm a sucker for anything citrus\nCMQC Self Cleaning Slicker Brush for Cats & Dogs Pet Grooming Brush Tool for Shedding Pets Hair Brush for Long Short Haired Dog Cat to Remove Tangles, Loose Fur, Mats (Blue)\nCMQC\n{'Brand': 'CMQC', 'Color': 'Blue', 'Shape': 'Oblong', 'Handle Material': 'Rubber', 'Special Feature': 'Self Cleaning', 'Product Dimensions': '6.3 x 4.3 x 3 inches; 5.61 Ounces'}\nMy cat loves this new brush.
