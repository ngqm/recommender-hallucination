The other is the Furiden Professional Hair Straightener Titanium Flat Iron.  I'm going to write this review as a comparison between the two since they are in the same price range.  For starters, both heat up quickly, have variable temperature settings, automatic shut off and a swivel cord.  The Autenpoo (who comes up with these brand names???) brand has a mechanical on/off switch that also serves as the heat selector.  I prefer this over the Furiden which has on/off buttons and up/down buttons to set the temp on a digital screen.  If I want, I can leave the Autenpo's dial set on the temp I want (the lowest setting it has), unplug it when I'm done, plug it in the next day and it will just turn on and go to my favorite temp.  With the Furiden, I have to hold a button down to turn it on and then hit the down button 4 or 5 times to go to the lowest temp.  The Autenpoo also comes with a comb, some hair clips to section your hair during styling and a heat protective glove, and has a slide lock to keep it shut when not in use.  In all other aspects however, I prefer the Furiden.  Autenpoo's cord is super thick bulky, seriously like a vacuum cleaner cord.  It will probably last forever but adds unnecessary bulk and weight which would be especially problematic for traveling.  The main advantage Furiden has is the pointed end.  Not only is it better suited to tight areas close to your scalp or neckline but it can also help section your hair without needing a comb or your fingers.  Furthermore, the plates, which are longer overall, extend into the pointed tip to get the heat right where you need it.  Both of these irons do a perfectly fine job, but I just find the Furiden easier to use.\nReview Title: Not bad but there are better choices\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
