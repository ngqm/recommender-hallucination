Known for its ability to strengthen hair and restore your strands to their original shine, AUTENPOO is a powerhouse nutrient in the field of hairstyling. When putting your hair under the intense heat of a flat iron or hair straightener, you\u2019ll probably find that breakage and damage are that much more common. Packed with all sort of high-tech features and gizmos, AUTENPOO\u2019s hair flat iron brings salon-worthy results without the harsh damage of most styling devices for a natural, healthy shine with each use! Top features of AUTENPOO hair straightener: Fast heating time&Sleep mode \u25cfFully heats up in 30 Seconds, Automatically switches off irons after 60 minutes. Gentle ceramic plate design \u25cfAdds shine to make the appearance of curls more polished and increase the overall look of straightened hair for a healthier gloss. Floating Plate Design \u25cfParticularly beneficial for users with naturally wavy or curly hair, which can have a tendency to easily snag in hair styling tools, also ensures that your gorgeous curls won\u2019t be damaged. Heats Between 300\u00b0 F And 450\u00b0 F \u25cfDepending on the thickness and texture of your hair, you may need to change it up from time to time. 360\u00b0 swivel cord for easy maneuverability \u25cf No more tangled messes or twisted cords, with this hair straightener you can easily reach delicate fly-aways and seemingly invisible back sections without the hassle of a tangled or knotted cord ever again.  What\u2018s in the package: 1 x Hair Straightener 1 x User\u2019s manual']\n{'Shape': 'Flat', 'Brand': 'COOQIN', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Material': 'Ceramic', 'Color': 'Gold', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '13.17 x 3.93 x 1.96 inches; 1 Pounds', 'UPC': '653437418216', 'Manufacturer': 'COOQIN'}\nThis is the 2nd hair straightener I've had the opportunity to try.  The other is the Furiden Professional Hair Straightener Titanium Flat Iron.  I'm going to write this review as a comparison between the two since they are in the same price range.  For starters, both heat up quickly, have variable temperature settings, automatic shut off and a swivel cord.  The Autenpoo (who comes up with these brand names???) brand has a mechanical on/off switch that also serves as the heat selector.  I prefer this over the Furiden which has on/off buttons and up/down buttons to set the temp on a digital screen.  If I want, I can leave the Autenpo's dial set on the temp I want (the lowest setting it has), unplug it when I'm done, plug it in the next day and it will just turn on and go to my favorite temp.  With the Furiden, I have to hold a button down to turn it on and then hit the down button 4 or 5 times to go to the lowest temp.  The Autenpoo also comes with a comb, some hair clips to section your hair during styling and a heat protective glove, and has a slide lock to keep it shut when not in use.  In all other aspects however, I prefer the Furiden.  Autenpoo's cord is super thick bulky, seriously like a vacuum cleaner cord.  It will probably last forever but adds unnecessary bulk and weight which would be especially problematic for traveling.  The main advantage Furiden has is the pointed end.  Not only is it better suited to tight areas close to your scalp or neckline but it can also help section your hair without needing a comb or your fingers.  Furthermore, the plates, which are longer overall, extend into the pointed tip to get the heat right where you need it.  Both of these irons do a perfectly fine job, but I just find the Furiden easier to use.\nNot bad but there are better choices\nAuroTrends Makeup Remover Towel,2 Pack Reusable Chemical-free Microfiber Makeup Remover Cloths,Magically and Gently Wipe Away Cosmetics,Sunscreen,Oil and Dirt,Set of 2 (Pink+Black)\nAuroTrends\n{'Brand': 'AuroTrends', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Material Feature': 'Reusable', 'Unit Count': '2.0 Count', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.52 x 2.72 x 1.42 inches; 6.4 Ounces'}\nThis is basically a long rectangle of fleece fabric with a finished edge.  How that cleans makeup without any soap, I couldn't tell you.  But it does!  I just barely dampen one small section with plain tap water and am able to wipe away liquid foundation, eye shadow and mascara.  I use a different section for the next day and toss the cloth in the wash at the end of the week.  I confess, that I don't normally wash my face at night.  I hate using those prepackaged make up remover wipes.  Single-use disposable products seem wasteful and environmentally unfriendly to me in general plus they are just like a cold slap on your face right before bed.  Even if I use cold water on this cloth, it didn't seem that cold on my face and there is no waste or ongoing cost other than washing.  My pillow case appreciates this product!\nDon't know how- but this works!\nTravel Bottles Keychain, 1.7oz/50ml Portable Hand Sanitizer Bottles, Fine Mist Spray Keychain Bottles, Empty Leakproof Refillable Containers with Flip/Spray Cap Plastic Travel Bottles (5PC)\nXITENBAO\n{'Brand': 'XITENBAO', 'Material': 'Silicone,Plastic', 'Capacity': '50 Milliliters, 1.7 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Special Feature': 'Portable, Mist Spray, Leakproof', 'Package Dimensions': '7 x 7 x 2.5 inches; 3.99 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'klp-001', 'UPC': '192408404112'}\nPros- carabiner to attach to purse or backpack, choice of spray or flip top<br />Cons- Flip top is hard to open<br /><br />It is likely that after repeated use, the flip top will become easier to open.
