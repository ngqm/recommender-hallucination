It was super easy to use and did the job as I expected it would.  The auto function was extremely handy, as was the ability to time it if I wanted.\nDid the job as expected\nPoly Nail Gel Kit, 7 Colors Nail Extension Gel with UV Lamp, Poly Extension Decoration Kit, Base Top Coat Set with Rhinestone, Nail Molds, Nail Art Gel Kits for Home DIY Manicure, Blue Nude Series\nAIFAIFA\n{'Color': 'Blue', 'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'AIFAIFA', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Product Dimensions': '5.9 x 5.9 x 5.9 inches; 1.48 Pounds'}\nI like that this unit is a fully functional nail kit. I already had a UV lamp, but I like this one better.  It is more compact and seems to work a little better. I love the polish, and all of the nail art. It is so much easier than normal polish.  I am by no means an expert, but the poly gel is the only thing that did not work for me.  I could not get it to cure.  Even after the full polish it still felt like it could crumble off at any moment.  I only did by thumbs, pinkies, and ring fingers, and the gel was broken on all of them in a couple of days.  It seemed to last a little longer on the nails I did polish as well (my thumbs).  For one day they might be okay.  But the rest of the kit makes it worth it.\nI like that this unit is a fully functional nail kit\n3D Mink Eyelashes Natural Long Lashes 2 in 1 Self-adhesive Eyeliner Instead of Adhesive 5 Different Styles Pairs Kits Sets with Tweezers , NO NEED GLUE\nPURELEOR\n{'Brand': 'PURELEOR', 'Material': 'Mink Fur', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Mounting Type': 'Eyelash Glue', 'Unit Count': '5.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '9 x 6 x 1 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '750810450143'}\nI have just started to delve into the world of false lashes.  I am by no means an expert, and still am not sure which look I prefer.  This brand, with the eyeliner, is one that I find among the easier to apply.  I think I may have to trim them, and I sometimes have issues on the outside corner with keeping it in place, but they flatter my eyes well.\nEyelash beginner\n20pcs Nail Tips Clips for Quick Building Polygel Nail Forms Nail Tips Clip for Finger Nail Extension DIY Manicure Nail Art Tool\ntiggell\n{'Size': '20 Count (Pack of 1)', 'Material': 'Plastic', 'Brand': 'Tiggell', 'Style': 'French', 'Coverage': 'Full Well Tips', 'Package Dimensions': '8.98 x 6.85 x 2.2 inches; 4.16 Ounces', 'UPC': '795853588163'}\nI use these to keep my polygel nails on the help cure them.
