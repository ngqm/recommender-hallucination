I am by no means an expert, and still am not sure which look I prefer.  This brand, with the eyeliner, is one that I find among the easier to apply.  I think I may have to trim them, and I sometimes have issues on the outside corner with keeping it in place, but they flatter my eyes well.\nReview Title: Eyelash beginner\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

It was super easy to use and did the job as I expected it would.  The auto function was extremely handy, as was the ability to time it if I wanted.\nDid the job as expected\nPoly Nail Gel Kit, 7 Colors Nail Extension Gel with UV Lamp, Poly Extension Decoration Kit, Base Top Coat Set with Rhinestone, Nail Molds, Nail Art Gel Kits for Home DIY Manicure, Blue Nude Series\nAIFAIFA\n{'Color': 'Blue', 'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'AIFAIFA', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Product Dimensions': '5.9 x 5.9 x 5.9 inches; 1.48 Pounds'}\nI like that this unit is a fully functional nail kit. I already had a UV lamp, but I like this one better.  It is more compact and seems to work a little better. I love the polish, and all of the nail art. It is so much easier than normal polish.  I am by no means an expert, but the poly gel is the only thing that did not work for me.  I could not get it to cure.  Even after the full polish it still felt like it could crumble off at any moment.  I only did by thumbs, pinkies, and ring fingers, and the gel was broken on all of them in a couple of days.  It seemed to last a little longer on the nails I did polish as well (my thumbs).  For one day they might be okay.  But the rest of the kit makes it worth it.\nI like that this unit is a fully functional nail kit\n3D Mink Eyelashes Natural Long Lashes 2 in 1 Self-adhesive Eyeliner Instead of Adhesive 5 Different Styles Pairs Kits Sets with Tweezers , NO NEED GLUE\nPURELEOR\n{'Brand': 'PURELEOR', 'Material': 'Mink Fur', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Mounting Type': 'Eyelash Glue', 'Unit Count': '5.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '9 x 6 x 1 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '750810450143'}\nI have just started to delve into the world of false lashes.
