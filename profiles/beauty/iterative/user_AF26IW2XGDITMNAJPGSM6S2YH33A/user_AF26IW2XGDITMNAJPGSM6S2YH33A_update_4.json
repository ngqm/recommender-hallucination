It cleans gently yet effectively without any harsh detergents. It does contain both physical and chemical exfoliators in the form of jojoba beads and AHAs (glycolic, malic and lactic acids) and BHAs (salicylic acid). The jojoba beads feel like tiny little balls which eventually melt into the cleanser as you massage it onto your face. As they break down, they provide moisture to the skin along with the aloe and the glycerin in the formulation. It's important to use both physical and chemical exfoliation to get rid of dead skin cells and clean pores and it's nice to have both in one preparation.<br /><br />I use it to clean my skin after makeup removal. I wet my face and use a quarter size amount and massage onto my face for about a minute. You can feel the beads start to get smaller/less numerous as you massage. I leave this on my face for another 1-2 minutes to allow the AHAs and BHAs to do their work, then rinse well with water. Skin feels very clean but not dry or stripped of natural oils. It has a pleasant, light citrus scent and the packaging it simple, yet elegant. Very happy I found this!\nReview Title: I love this cleanser\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "SKEDERM EXHYDRO Ceramide Complex Moisturizer, Intensive Repair and Hydration Daily Face Cream, 50ml\nBBInfinite\n{'Brand': 'BBInfinite', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '1.7 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Use for': 'Face', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.77 x 2.17 x 3.74 inches; 2.08 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'SKSF004-050'}\nThe Skederm ExHydro Ceramide Complex Moisturizer is great for facial skin that needs moisture but not necessarily a heavy duty cream. I found the consistency to be light and silky and almost undetectable on my skin after it absorbed. My skin just felt hydrated and bouncier. For my dry skin, I usually like more emollient creams for night time use. I found this cream perfect for daytime worn under an SPF cream and foundation or a BB cream. I use it in place of a serum and it acts like a makeup primer, blurring lines and pores and making skin appear smoother while adding a dose of hydration. Not a lot is needed. I use four small dots to cover my entire face. From what I can tell it is also color and fragrance free.<br /><br />The key ingredient that attracted me to this product is the Ceramide Complex consisting of Ceramides I, III, VI and natural ingredients (palm oil, algae extract, and fig extracts) that act to hydrate and firm skin. The Skederm ExHydro Ceramide Complex Moisturizer also has glycerin and silicone derivatives in it to increase water retention and give your skin a silky feel. I love that it is supplied in a tube. It's not fancy, but it is very convenient and hygienic. This Skederm product is made in Korea which has been at the forefront of cosmetics and skincare research in recent years.\nThe Skederm ExHydro Ceramide Complex Moisturizer is great for facial skin that needs moisture but not necessarily ...\nMyconos Magic BB CC Moist Air Cushion Compact Korean Cover Foundation SPF50+ with 1 Extra Refill Luminous Glow Shade 21\n{'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '1.0 Count', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Sun Protection': '50 SPF', 'Package Dimensions': '3.31 x 3.11 x 2.6 inches; 4.8 Ounces', 'UPC': '789655125510 763109545659'}\nWow! What a luxurious, well-made cushion compact. This rivals the high-end one I purchased from Lancome a few months ago. The product came boxed with the ingredients listed. You're also getting a sealed refill cushion compact included in the box which is amazing for the price. The compact is made of a high quality white plastic. It's easy to open using a push button in the front. There's a good size mirror in the upper lid and a hinged plastic cover to prevent the cushion from drying out. You can hear a soft click when it's closed, so you know it's not going to open inadvertently. There's a Myconos branded applicator that rests on top of the cover.<br /><br />The foundation I got (#2) works well with my NC20-25 skin. It's not a heavy foundation. I would consider it moderate coverage at best. It's very blendable and like most cushion compacts, feels very light on the skin. I included a picture which shows a heavy application on my cheek blended out towards the front of my face. Wear is very good. I haven't felt the need to reapply after using it in the morning. Like a lot of Korean cosmetics, the quality and cutting edge technology used is amazing. This is a fantastic deal especially since a refill was included.\nGorgeous Korean made cushion compact plus refill.\nNuPeptin Calming Facial Scrub exfoliating scrub that cleanses and immediately helps to give your skin a smoother and softer appearance.\nNupeptin\n{'Package Dimensions': '6 x 2 x 0.3 inches; 3.2 Ounces', 'UPC': '727510007168', 'Manufacturer': 'Supportiback'}\nThis is a really nicely balanced facial scrub. There are plenty of exfoliating beads so you actually feel like you are scrubbing your skin. However, they are contained in an emollient base with Jojoba oil, sunflower seed oil, and vitamin E  so that it doesn't feel very harsh at all. I did not detect much of a scent and the overall experience was calming yet effective. After rinsing, I felt my skin was prepared to receive skincare product. A little goes a long way. Highly recommend.\nThis is a really nicely balanced facial scrub\nEvarne Refining Jojoba Face Wash Cleanser For Even Complexion - Paraben Free, Sulfate Free.
