I found the consistency to be light and silky and almost undetectable on my skin after it absorbed. My skin just felt hydrated and bouncier. For my dry skin, I usually like more emollient creams for night time use. I found this cream perfect for daytime worn under an SPF cream and foundation or a BB cream. I use it in place of a serum and it acts like a makeup primer, blurring lines and pores and making skin appear smoother while adding a dose of hydration. Not a lot is needed. I use four small dots to cover my entire face. From what I can tell it is also color and fragrance free.<br /><br />The key ingredient that attracted me to this product is the Ceramide Complex consisting of Ceramides I, III, VI and natural ingredients (palm oil, algae extract, and fig extracts) that act to hydrate and firm skin. The Skederm ExHydro Ceramide Complex Moisturizer also has glycerin and silicone derivatives in it to increase water retention and give your skin a silky feel. I love that it is supplied in a tube. It's not fancy, but it is very convenient and hygienic. This Skederm product is made in Korea which has been at the forefront of cosmetics and skincare research in recent years.\nReview Title: The Skederm ExHydro Ceramide Complex Moisturizer is great for facial skin that needs moisture but not necessarily ...\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
