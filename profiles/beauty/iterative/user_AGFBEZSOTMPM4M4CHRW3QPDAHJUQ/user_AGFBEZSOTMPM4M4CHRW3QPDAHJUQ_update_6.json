  "reference_summary": "Hair Treatment Mask 120ml, 2019 PURC Magical Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner for Dry or Damaged Hair, 5 Seconds Repairs Damage Hair Root and Keratin\nGHEART\n{'Brand': 'GHEART', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Hair Type': 'Dull, Frizzy, Color Treated, Dry, Chemically Treated, Damaged', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '2.8 x 2.8 x 1.9 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'Hair Treatment Mask-411', 'UPC': '778299243728'}\nI bought two masks to try out. This one for dry and damaged hair and a keratin one. First, I want to say my hair is very damaged. The top of my hair seems oily but the bottom is super dry. I buy regular conditioner from just any store and they never detangle my hair. My niece told me I needed to try a \"hair mask.\" I had never heard of it but she swears by it. So I decided to give it a try. You guys, it really works. You have to follow the directions though and put it on your hair longer than what the bottle says. The more damaged your hair is, the longer you should keep it on. I left mine on for a long while.. I cant even remember how long. I think maybe 30 minutes? Anyhow, when I washed it off, my hair actually was actually easier to comb through. I wish I could find conditioners like this though b/c I don't want to spend so much washing my hair!\nleave on longer and it will be smoother\nPARWIN BEAUTY Curling Wand 5 in 1 Curling Iron Set with 5 Interchangeable Ceramic Barrels 0.5\u201d to 1.25\u201d Hair Curling Wand Set, Rose Gold\nPARWIN PRO BEAUTY\n{'Brand': 'PARWIN PRO BEAUTY', 'Hair Type': 'All, Curly, Fine, Normal', 'Material': 'Ceramic', 'Size': '1 Count (Pack of 1)', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Package Dimensions': '10.1 x 4.8 x 3.2 inches; 2.55 Pounds', 'UPC': '658709253601', 'Manufacturer': 'PARWIN BEAUTY'}\nI returned this.

When I use my regular bands. They are just too big and bulky and they tangle  up.<br /><br />So good thing about these are:<br />- they do not tangle my hair<br />- they stretch a bit but not too much<br />- they give you a ton of them so you don\u2019t feel bad losing them<br /><br />Con:<br />- they break fairly easy\nBreaks fairly easy but you can plenty of them\nLANGE HAIR Extend\u00e9 Conditioning Detangler Hair Spray - Paraben Free Leave-in Conditioner Spray, Detangles and Hydrates Hair, Moisture & Shine | 4OZ\n{'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Material Feature': 'Paraben Free', 'Hair Type': 'Curly, Dry', 'Product Benefits': 'Helps protect color and reinforces strands, leaving them strong and vibrant', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '6.5 x 1.4 x 1.4 inches; 4 Ounces', 'UPC': '793150592708'}\nI have the worst tangled hair ever from all the highlights and dying it I've done over the last 15 years. My hair is so damaged. And also because it is so long, it's almost impossible to manager. I also have a TON of hair. When I go to the salon, they usually have two people blow drying my hair. Anyhow, I have a detanger brush, I've bought hair mask, I've used leave in conditioner, and I've used different detanglers. (I've done the it's the 10 product also). I have to say I was very impressed with this bottle. Right off when I sprayed it, I noticed it came out different. It wasn't a spray, it was more of a mist spray so it sprayed more powerfully but evenly and wide. I used it right after I showered and towel dried my hair and then sprayed it and brushed. And it worked. i was able to detangle my hair. The only thing I wish was that this bottle was bigger. It's pretty small!\ndetangled my highlighted 15 year damaged hair\nJMOSTRG 4.2V Mini Battery Box Kit (Color)\nJMOSTRG\n{'Package Dimensions': '5 x 3.7 x 3.31 inches; 8.47 Ounces', 'UPC': '190731969162'}\nThis is so cute and perfect!
