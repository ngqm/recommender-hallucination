  "reference_summary": "Hair Treatment Mask 120ml, 2019 PURC Magical Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner for Dry or Damaged Hair, 5 Seconds Repairs Damage Hair Root and Keratin\nGHEART\n{'Brand': 'GHEART', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Hair Type': 'Dull, Frizzy, Color Treated, Dry, Chemically Treated, Damaged', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '2.8 x 2.8 x 1.9 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'Hair Treatment Mask-411', 'UPC': '778299243728'}\nI bought two masks to try out. This one for dry and damaged hair and a keratin one. First, I want to say my hair is very damaged. The top of my hair seems oily but the bottom is super dry. I buy regular conditioner from just any store and they never detangle my hair. My niece told me I needed to try a \"hair mask.\" I had never heard of it but she swears by it. So I decided to give it a try. You guys, it really works. You have to follow the directions though and put it on your hair longer than what the bottle says. The more damaged your hair is, the longer you should keep it on. I left mine on for a long while.. I cant even remember how long. I think maybe 30 minutes? Anyhow, when I washed it off, my hair actually was actually easier to comb through. I wish I could find conditioners like this though b/c I don't want to spend so much washing my hair!\nleave on longer and it will be smoother\nPARWIN BEAUTY Curling Wand 5 in 1 Curling Iron Set with 5 Interchangeable Ceramic Barrels 0.5\u201d to 1.25\u201d Hair Curling Wand Set, Rose Gold\nPARWIN PRO BEAUTY\n{'Brand': 'PARWIN PRO BEAUTY', 'Hair Type': 'All, Curly, Fine, Normal', 'Material': 'Ceramic', 'Size': '1 Count (Pack of 1)', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Package Dimensions': '10.1 x 4.8 x 3.2 inches; 2.55 Pounds', 'UPC': '658709253601', 'Manufacturer': 'PARWIN BEAUTY'}\nI returned this.

When I use my regular bands. They are just too big and bulky and they tangle  up.<br /><br />So good thing about these are:<br />- they do not tangle my hair<br />- they stretch a bit but not too much<br />- they give you a ton of them so you don\u2019t feel bad losing them<br /><br />Con:<br />- they break fairly easy\nBreaks fairly easy but you can plenty of them\nLANGE HAIR Extend\u00e9 Conditioning Detangler Hair Spray - Paraben Free Leave-in Conditioner Spray, Detangles and Hydrates Hair, Moisture & Shine | 4OZ\n{'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Material Feature': 'Paraben Free', 'Hair Type': 'Curly, Dry', 'Product Benefits': 'Helps protect color and reinforces strands, leaving them strong and vibrant', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '6.5 x 1.4 x 1.4 inches; 4 Ounces', 'UPC': '793150592708'}\nI have the worst tangled hair ever from all the highlights and dying it I've done over the last 15 years. My hair is so damaged. And also because it is so long, it's almost impossible to manager. I also have a TON of hair. When I go to the salon, they usually have two people blow drying my hair. Anyhow, I have a detanger brush, I've bought hair mask, I've used leave in conditioner, and I've used different detanglers. (I've done the it's the 10 product also). I have to say I was very impressed with this bottle. Right off when I sprayed it, I noticed it came out different. It wasn't a spray, it was more of a mist spray so it sprayed more powerfully but evenly and wide. I used it right after I showered and towel dried my hair and then sprayed it and brushed. And it worked. i was able to detangle my hair. The only thing I wish was that this bottle was bigger. It's pretty small!\ndetangled my highlighted 15 year damaged hair\nJMOSTRG 4.2V Mini Battery Box Kit (Color)\nJMOSTRG\n{'Package Dimensions': '5 x 3.7 x 3.31 inches; 8.47 Ounces', 'UPC': '190731969162'}\nThis is so cute and perfect! This will encourage kids to carry around their hand sanitizer and you can keep refilling it and save money! Definitely worth it.\nperfect to encourage kids to use hand sanitizer\nTravel Bottles for Toiletries, Silicone Travel Size Bottles And Squeezable Containers Holders with belt clip Keychain for Backpack, Shampoo, Liquid, Cosmetic Products(2 oz, 6 Pack)\nMACRAY\n{'Brand': 'MACRAY', 'Material': 'Silicone', 'Capacity': '2 Ounces', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '11.73 x 6.61 x 1.61 inches; 8.47 Ounces', 'UPC': '782938308006'}\nI customized and added vinyl stickers to it with teachers name and it was huge hit at the school! Now everyone has their own sanitizer clip to their pants! Super handy and definitely needed at this time.\nPerfect gift at this time\nCaudalie Vinosource SOS Intense Hydration Set: Hydrating Trio for Sensitive Skin including a Daily Foam Cleanser, Hydrating Serum, Facial Moisturizer\n{'Package Dimensions': '6.93 x 5.35 x 2.64 inches; 14.5 Ounces'}\nI originally got this thinking I\u2019ll give it as a gift. But I ended up keeping it for myself!! The moisturizer is so nice. In the cold season, I have real bad dry skin on my face. Ira horrible. Or gets flaky at this. I have used some moisturizer that felt too thin (but great for  summer).  It seemed like it was doing a good job then then the flakes came right  back so it was very surface  and didn\u2019t penetrate. Then I\u2019ve had very thick moisturizer  like the one you use at night. The problem with this is sometimes it made like little balls. I\u2019m not sure how to describe it but it kind of made a layer and then peeled  off. So I needed something in between. This wa a perfect. It is actually thick but liquidy. In other words it is very moisturizing. After you put it on, you need to let it soak in and dry a little. But it works great. Normally  I have combo skin. I use deep moisturizer only in the winter.\nNot too thick and not too thin\nNatwag Makeup Remover Pads,18 Pack 3.74 Inch Reusable Microfiber Cleansing Pad with Laundry Bag Suitable for All Skin Types,3 Color Facial Cleansing Pad Set.\nNatwag\n{'Brand': 'Natwag', 'Skin Type': 'All Skin,Dry', 'Material Feature': 'Reusable', 'Unit Count': '18.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '18', 'Package Dimensions': '4.4 x 4.37 x 2.59 inches; 3.84 Ounces', 'UPC': '745103569701'}\nThese pads are very soft. So I do like that about the pads. However, they are also thin. My concern is that I'm not sure how often I can use them. The good thing also is that you get a lot. So I don't think it really is intended to be used indefinitely. I love these to bring to travel. They are small and super handy. I used to bring some face wipes but I find that those dont actually take off all your makeup! I was watching a tutorial in which they said to actually used different type of remover so you would need a cloth. So this is ideal. Also it saves from wash if you use a cotton wipe instead!\nsoft, great for travel, and good for environment\nC'est Moi Gentle Cleansing Water | Gentle, Fragrance-Free Cleanser Removes Makeup and Refreshes Skin, Made with Cornflower Water, Aloe Vera, and Strawberry, Kiwi, and Apple Extracts | 5.9 fl oz.\nC'est Moi\n{'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Skin Type': 'Acne Prone,Sensitive', 'Brand': \"C'est Moi\", 'Scent': 'Kiwi, Strawberry, Unscented, Aloe Vera', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '1.84 x 1.84 x 6.06 inches; 7.69 Ounces', 'UPC': '039897626055'}\nI love that this product is make of a bunch of natural items. I've been concern lately of these items with ingredients that are bad for us and we don't even know! So I dont actually use this alone. I use a makeup remover wipe first and then I use this also to catch what is left. What i noticed is that this isn't the type of remover where you just used it and then can walk away. You do have to use water to clean off your face after. I also have sensitive skin and I will say it did not irritate my skin at all. I didn't think it had any smell to it really. I do like it but I wouldn't give it a full 5 star because of the fact that you do have to do an extra step to be clean after.\nremoves makeup well but have to wash aftewards\n[the SAEM] Derma Plan Cleansing Bubble Pad 15pcs - One Step Gentle Makeup Cleansing Wipes Produce Fine & Dense Bubbles, Hypoallergenic Formula, Pore Clean, Mild Exfoliation\nTHESAEM\n{'Brand': 'THESAEM', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Unit Count': '15.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '3.9 x 3.9 x 1.8 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nOverall, this is a pretty fair item depending on your need.
