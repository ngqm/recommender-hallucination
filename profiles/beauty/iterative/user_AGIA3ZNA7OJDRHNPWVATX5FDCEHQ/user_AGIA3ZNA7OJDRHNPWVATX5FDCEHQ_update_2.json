We use a lot of soap. That orange goop with pumice in it is our normal heavy duty hand cleaner, this soap is equivalent to that soap without the orange scent. You definitely do need water for it to be effective even though the bottle claims you don't. The hand cream is a great heavy duty healing lotion, similar to eucerin. I haven't noticed an appreciable difference in the ease of cleanymy hands after using the barrier cream however.\nReview Title: Helps dirty hands\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

The spice scent smells like patchouli and mint, the evergreen scent smells strongly of pine trees, and unscented smells like baby powder. I can't say we are particularly fond of any of the scents. My husband is planning to use this set up, but we will probably not reorder it.\nNot fond of the smells\nWorkman's Friend Ultimate Hand Care Bundle\nWORKMAN'S FRIEND\n{'Package Dimensions': '9 x 4.5 x 2.3 inches; 1.3 Pounds', 'UPC': '023857030709'}\nWe do a lot of house work, art, construction work, and gardening.
