The comb is cheap plastic that breaks if you look at it sideways. The tweezers aren't very good at gripping. The only good thing about this set are the little scissors.

  "reference_summary": "Type:A - Aluminum Free Deodorant for Men \u2013 Trailblazer- Unscented, Spice & Forest \u2013 Sweat Activated Technology, Natural Ingredients, Non-Toxic, Paraben Free, Non-Irritating, 2.8 Ounce (3 Pack)\ntype:A\n{'Brand': 'Type:A', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Scent': 'Unscented', 'Unit Count': '3.00 Count', 'Item Volume': '2.8 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '6.8 x 5 x 0.5 inches; 9.59 Ounces'}\nIt doesn't work as well as old spice to prevent odor and sweat, but it does leave less residue on shirts. The spice scent smells like patchouli and mint, the evergreen scent smells strongly of pine trees, and unscented smells like baby powder. I can't say we are particularly fond of any of the scents. My husband is planning to use this set up, but we will probably not reorder it.\nNot fond of the smells\nWorkman's Friend Ultimate Hand Care Bundle\nWORKMAN'S FRIEND\n{'Package Dimensions': '9 x 4.5 x 2.3 inches; 1.3 Pounds', 'UPC': '023857030709'}\nWe do a lot of house work, art, construction work, and gardening. We use a lot of soap. That orange goop with pumice in it is our normal heavy duty hand cleaner, this soap is equivalent to that soap without the orange scent. You definitely do need water for it to be effective even though the bottle claims you don't. The hand cream is a great heavy duty healing lotion, similar to eucerin. I haven't noticed an appreciable difference in the ease of cleanymy hands after using the barrier cream however.\nHelps dirty hands\nHIFAU Eyebrow Scissors 3 In 1 Kit, Eyebrow Razor and Comb Foldable Protection, Surgical Grade Stainless Steel Eyebrow Scissors and Tweezers, Mirror Polished, Easy to Carry, Travel Gift\nHIFAU\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '6.1 x 2.4 x 0.4 inches; 1.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '634923554380'}\nThe razor cuts your skin but not your hair.
