It is like a long rectangle with the corners of the short end joined behind the neck at a diagonal. It is better than nothing but the cut is just off. Maybe if you have an actual barbers chair it works better. I was using a towel as a cape when I cut my husband and kids hair, and this on top of a towel for the lower back (or two of these capes alternating directions so the long part can go in the front and the back) should do a better job than just the towel. The fabric is cheap thin polyester, which gets the job done but is definitely not \"ultra soft silk fiber\" as stated in the description. The neck is easy to adjust and fasten, so at least it has that going for it.\nReview Title: Strange cut\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Type:A - Aluminum Free Deodorant for Men \u2013 Trailblazer- Unscented, Spice & Forest \u2013 Sweat Activated Technology, Natural Ingredients, Non-Toxic, Paraben Free, Non-Irritating, 2.8 Ounce (3 Pack)\ntype:A\n{'Brand': 'Type:A', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Scent': 'Unscented', 'Unit Count': '3.00 Count', 'Item Volume': '2.8 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '6.8 x 5 x 0.5 inches; 9.59 Ounces'}\nIt doesn't work as well as old spice to prevent odor and sweat, but it does leave less residue on shirts. The spice scent smells like patchouli and mint, the evergreen scent smells strongly of pine trees, and unscented smells like baby powder. I can't say we are particularly fond of any of the scents. My husband is planning to use this set up, but we will probably not reorder it.\nNot fond of the smells\nWorkman's Friend Ultimate Hand Care Bundle\nWORKMAN'S FRIEND\n{'Package Dimensions': '9 x 4.5 x 2.3 inches; 1.3 Pounds', 'UPC': '023857030709'}\nWe do a lot of house work, art, construction work, and gardening. We use a lot of soap. That orange goop with pumice in it is our normal heavy duty hand cleaner, this soap is equivalent to that soap without the orange scent. You definitely do need water for it to be effective even though the bottle claims you don't. The hand cream is a great heavy duty healing lotion, similar to eucerin. I haven't noticed an appreciable difference in the ease of cleanymy hands after using the barrier cream however.\nHelps dirty hands\nHIFAU Eyebrow Scissors 3 In 1 Kit, Eyebrow Razor and Comb Foldable Protection, Surgical Grade Stainless Steel Eyebrow Scissors and Tweezers, Mirror Polished, Easy to Carry, Travel Gift\nHIFAU\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '6.1 x 2.4 x 0.4 inches; 1.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '634923554380'}\nThe razor cuts your skin but not your hair. The comb is cheap plastic that breaks if you look at it sideways. The tweezers aren't very good at gripping. The only good thing about this set are the little scissors. Those work well.\nThe scissors are the only things that work\n100pcs Premium Quality Hair Clips, 20 Glossy Colors Snap Hair Clips, 2 Inch Hair Barrettes with Perfect Grip, Durable Colorful Hair Clips with Smooth Edges for Kids, Girls, Women\nFagaci\n{'Brand': 'Fagaci', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Color': 'Assorted', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material': 'Alloy Steel', 'Package Dimensions': '4.7 x 3.1 x 1 inches; 4.8 Ounces'}\nThe colors are not as pictured. There is no bright orange or pale yellow, there are a lot of browns and many more muted pastel colors. The package arrived open with clips strewn about the box. That being said, they stay in my daughter's super fine hair better than the clips of this type we have used before. They have stayed in through a full school day and gymnastics class without falling out. They do have some rainbow colors, just not as many as we'd hoped for. We got 105 clips. So it the colors are important to you, know that they are on the more pastel side of what's pictured and that there is no true orange. They don't come in a giftable package. If staying in hair is what is important to you, these can't be beat.\nMuted colors, super staying power\nBarber Hair Cutting Cape for Men Women, Made with Ultra Soft Silk Fiber, 63\" x 57\"\nSmoTecQ\n{'Package Dimensions': '11.8 x 9.2 x 0.7 inches; 4.8 Ounces'}\nThe front of this cape is super long (almost too long) however the back is cut in a way such that no matter how you adjust the neck, only about the top 12\" of the back are covered, leaving the lower back exposed.
