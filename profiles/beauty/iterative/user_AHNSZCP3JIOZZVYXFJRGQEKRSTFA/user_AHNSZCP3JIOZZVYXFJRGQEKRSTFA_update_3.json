I am converted.  wet sponge application is perfect for the times when you have already flawless skin and want to apply a light foundation or concealer.  It works well for under eye application as well.  I reach for a brush when I have a blemish to cover, because I like the thicker coverage.  These work well, just need to be cleaned once a week or so, depending on how often you use them.  Very happy with this product.  the shape of this sponge allows you to get into small creases and angles of the face.

It is true what other say about the sensitivity. I would recommend using sensitivity toothpaste while you are using the strips, it helped for me. It made my teeth noticeably whiter. I would suggest you take a picture of yourself smiling before and after. I noticed the whiteness of my teeth when I saw a picture taken recently and I couldn't believe how nice they looked. I just had to dig up an old picture to compare and it was a big difference. After I have noticed this in the new picture, I love smiling for pictures now and showing my teeth. I was alway self conscious about it before.  That alone makes it worth the price.<br /><br />I was very satisfied with my results. Make sure to read all the instructions before using.<br /><br />It just became a part of my bedtime routine, not a bother at all. I just put one on while I was watching my evening TV programs and just kept an eye on the clock.<br /><br />Also, I recommend that after you have finished your pack that you use the Crest whitening toothpaste.  It really helps to keep your teeth staying white.<br /><br />Great product and it was recommended to me by my dentist.\nGreat product\nBraun Silk Epil Female Epilator Se7921spa 1 Count\nBraun\n['View larger', 'Braun Silk-\u00e9pil 7921 SkinSpa Epilator', \"It's the best 2-in-1 epilation and exfoliation system.

Epilators gently remove hair at the root, rather than at the surface like shaving, and can remove much shorter hair than waxing so you don't have to wait until hair becomes visible to remove it. After epilation, legs stay smooth for up to four weeks and hair grows back at different rates, meaning you will typically have less hair to remove each time you epilate.\", 'What is the benefit of epilation versus using a traditional razor, cream, or foam?', \"Unlike shaving, cream, or foam - which only cut or dissolve hair at the skin surface - epilators remove hair at the root. Because it takes a while for the hair to grow back to the skin surface, your skin will stay smooth for up to four weeks. As the hair grows back from the root, the tip of the hair will not be blunt, but instead look thinner and finer. As a result, you'll no longer have the feeling of coarse stubble.\", 'What is the benefit of epilation versus waxing (Agda or Halawa)?', \"Wax does remove hair from the root just like epilators. However, when it comes to removing shortest hair, wax performs quite poorly. As wax basically sticks on the hair to remove it, hair needs to be a certain length for this process to take place. Therefore, there is a hair-growth waiting period for those who use wax. With epilators, there is no such waiting and therefore no need to cover legs up. Using wax is also a hassle. The preparation process (for self-made wax, Adga, or Halawa) is long, messy, and tiresome. What's even worse, using wax (Agda or Halawa) is a more painful process compared to epilators.\", 'Does epilation hurt?', 'Most women trying epilation for the first time find the process much less painful than they had anticipated. As hair is removed at the root, however, there might be some discomfort. In the beginning, the pulling sensation is stronger, but this subsides as your skin adjusts to the process. Over time, after successive epilations, there is also less hair to be removed. Studies show that epilating more frequently can reduce pain significantly. Silk-\u00e9pil Xpressive also features three ways to help women minimize discomfort - Olay pre-epilation wipes prepare the skin for epilation, a new massage system stimulates the skin before epilation and helps reduce the pain, and a beginner cap helps new users get used to epilation.', 'How long does my hair have to be for epilation?', 'Silk-\u00e9pil can remove hair that is 0.5-mm in length. This hair length occurs after approximately two days of not shaving.', 'Will my hair grow back after epilation?', 'Yes. However, the hairs will grow back more tapered and fine than they do from shaving. Hair that is removed with a razor is cut at skin level, so that the edge grows back blunt and coarse, causing razor stubble.', 'Does hair grow back thicker and stronger after epilation?', 'No, dermatologists have confirmed that epilation has no negative impact on the thickness of regrowing hair. In addition, because hairs are removed at the root, the hairs that do grow back have softer, narrower tips than hairs removed with a razor, so they feel softer and finer to the touch. The reason why this question arises every now and then is that hair removal is more frequent (and also more in focus) in summer. And this is also the time when hair growth itself changes. Due to the higher ambient temperatures the blood circulation is better, leading to a better supply of nutrition to hair roots so that hair growth in general is stronger.']\n{'Brand': 'Braun', 'Water Resistance Level': 'Not Water Resistant', 'Included Components': 'Cleaning Brush', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '10.24 x 2.76 x 7.76 inches; 1.25 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'SE7921SPA', 'UPC': '069055866856 883207546034', 'Manufacturer': 'P & G'}\nI have owned several Braun Epilators and this new one, tops them all.  I was surprised that they could actually improve what they had, but the addition of the exfoliating brush is a great thing.<br /><br />PROS:<br />* Less pain than other brands<br />* Nice color<br />* Can be used wet/dry<br />* The light really makes a difference to see hairs<br />* exfoliating brush makes your legs really smooth.  It can also be used for rough heals, elbows, or dry winter skin.<br />* Epilating in general - Your hair grows back softer and with few hairs.  Over time, very little grows back.<br /><br />CONS:<br />* Not as gentle on underarms as other epilators I use<br />* Epilating in general can take some time, along with the exfoliating after to prevent ingrown hairs. (but with epilating, once you do it on a regular basis, you don't have to do it as often as shaving)<br /><br />Great job Braun!
