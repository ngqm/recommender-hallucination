In two weeks you will have noticeably whiter teeth. New clinical results prove whiter teeth for 12 months. Each box contains 56 strips: 28 for upper teeth, 28 for lower teeth. The secret to a whiter smile is in the strip - Guaranteed.']\nAverage Rating: 3.6\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Crest', 'Item Form': 'Strip', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Included Components': 'Whitening Strip', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '4.9 x 4.8 x 2 inches', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'Yes', 'Product Dimensions': '4.9 x 4.8 x 2 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': '36367', 'UPC': '037000416616 037000339472 037000404347 037000363675 037000394990', 'Manufacturer': 'Crest Whitestrips'}\nReview Text: I love this product. It is true what other say about the sensitivity. I would recommend using sensitivity toothpaste while you are using the strips, it helped for me. It made my teeth noticeably whiter. I would suggest you take a picture of yourself smiling before and after. I noticed the whiteness of my teeth when I saw a picture taken recently and I couldn't believe how nice they looked. I just had to dig up an old picture to compare and it was a big difference. After I have noticed this in the new picture, I love smiling for pictures now and showing my teeth. I was alway self conscious about it before.  That alone makes it worth the price.<br /><br />I was very satisfied with my results. Make sure to read all the instructions before using.<br /><br />It just became a part of my bedtime routine, not a bother at all. I just put one on while I was watching my evening TV programs and just kept an eye on the clock.<br /><br />Also, I recommend that after you have finished your pack that you use the Crest whitening toothpaste.  It really helps to keep your teeth staying white.<br /><br />Great product and it was recommended to me by my dentist.\nReview Title: Great product\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
