  "reference_summary": "lorelo 20 pieces Hair Curlers, Hair Rollers Spiral Curls Styling Kit No Heat Hair Curlers with Styling Hooks for Girls Woman\nlorelo\n{'Number of Items': '20', 'Material': 'Silicone', 'Brand': 'Lorelo', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '10.59 x 9.02 x 2.8 inches; 9.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '619156721396'}\nI choose these because I've seen these before product curls without the heat and it was as simple as applying them and letting your hair air dry. Well let me tell you it takes alot of practice and patience and knowing what your doing. Is it simple enough to understand, yes. However the sectioning hair, getting tangled, knotted or stuck was alot of the problems I ran into. If my husband had not been home I think I might have been in some real trouble. I'm not mild tempered and almost was pulling my hair out trying to get it unstuck at some points. I will say there were times when I got a rhythm going and I was getting my hair to go thru effortlessly but in the end once I was done I found pieces that weren't even in there and it was uncomfortable to wear unless maybe I was up doing stuff around the house. In the end I took it down and I'd had enough of the torture these provided. Overall would I suggest these yes to someone a little more familiar with there head and maybe to do in my daughter's hair but personally unless it's a day I'm bored and nothing else to do I may give it a go again. I will say my husband did see some curls in my hair when I ended up taking them out they didn't stay that way but he said he could see results and that was just in a matter of getting them all in. There may be potential there just not patience in my book.\nTakes time and patience\nMr. Pristine Organic Beard Shampoo with Natural Essential Oils for Moisturizing Skin & Hair, 8.5 oz.\nMr. Pristine\n{'Brand': 'Mr. Pristine', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Hair Type': 'Color Treated', 'Scent': 'Peppermint', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '5.21 x 2.8 x 2.3 inches; 7.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '627843801832', 'Manufacturer': 'Mr. Pristine'}\n\u2022 Lathers really well<br />\u2022 Has a light mint smell<br />\u2022 Leaves your beard feeling nice and clean afterwards<br /><br />Got for my husband as he is moving into grooming and managing his growing beard.
