To some that may seem like a nice trip to the spa but for me I am highly cautious about things so I havent yet decided if I am going to use this or not. This comes packaged as most bath salts that I buy and they look just like bath salts when you open the package. However your suppose to use the entire 10 oz bag in one bath and sit for 20-30 mins I usually will use about a cup at most of Dr Teals bath salts so that to me seemed excessive followed by a sweat and rest afterwards which no female is crazy about sweat let alone in your own bed. So overall I think the concept is there but for me it put me on the fence and I will update if I or my husband maybe tries this but this taught me to look into something a little more before clicking get just for the purpose of pain relief.\nReview Title: Was intimidated by the process\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "lorelo 20 pieces Hair Curlers, Hair Rollers Spiral Curls Styling Kit No Heat Hair Curlers with Styling Hooks for Girls Woman\nlorelo\n{'Number of Items': '20', 'Material': 'Silicone', 'Brand': 'Lorelo', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '10.59 x 9.02 x 2.8 inches; 9.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '619156721396'}\nI choose these because I've seen these before product curls without the heat and it was as simple as applying them and letting your hair air dry. Well let me tell you it takes alot of practice and patience and knowing what your doing. Is it simple enough to understand, yes. However the sectioning hair, getting tangled, knotted or stuck was alot of the problems I ran into. If my husband had not been home I think I might have been in some real trouble. I'm not mild tempered and almost was pulling my hair out trying to get it unstuck at some points. I will say there were times when I got a rhythm going and I was getting my hair to go thru effortlessly but in the end once I was done I found pieces that weren't even in there and it was uncomfortable to wear unless maybe I was up doing stuff around the house. In the end I took it down and I'd had enough of the torture these provided. Overall would I suggest these yes to someone a little more familiar with there head and maybe to do in my daughter's hair but personally unless it's a day I'm bored and nothing else to do I may give it a go again. I will say my husband did see some curls in my hair when I ended up taking them out they didn't stay that way but he said he could see results and that was just in a matter of getting them all in. There may be potential there just not patience in my book.\nTakes time and patience\nMr. Pristine Organic Beard Shampoo with Natural Essential Oils for Moisturizing Skin & Hair, 8.5 oz.\nMr. Pristine\n{'Brand': 'Mr. Pristine', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Hair Type': 'Color Treated', 'Scent': 'Peppermint', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '5.21 x 2.8 x 2.3 inches; 7.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '627843801832', 'Manufacturer': 'Mr. Pristine'}\n\u2022 Lathers really well<br />\u2022 Has a light mint smell<br />\u2022 Leaves your beard feeling nice and clean afterwards<br /><br />Got for my husband as he is moving into grooming and managing his growing beard. He has told me that he really likes the way this shampoo cleans his beard and the fact that it lathers well without having to apply much product which for me is a win cuz that means less money spent in the long run. Overall he has def enjoyed using this product and we're still gauging if this is something we would repurchase but if we did it would def be because it's long lasting.\nPretty decent shampoo\nMr. Pristine Organic Beard Conditioner to Grow, Thicken, Moisturize and Protect Your Beard, 8.5 oz.\nMr. Pristine\n{'Brand': 'Mr. Pristine', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Hair Type': 'Dry', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '8.5 Fl Oz', 'Package Dimensions': '3.1 x 2.5 x 2.36 inches; 7.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '627843801825', 'Manufacturer': 'Mr. Pristine'}\n\u2022 Light mint scent<br />\u2022 Thick formula but makes for great moisturizing<br />\u2022 A little difficult to get out the bottle<br /><br />Overall this was chosen for my husband who is on a journey of finding things he likes for his beard maintenance. He has enjoyed this product in reference to how well it pairs with the shampoo. It leaves his beard feeling nice and soft and in combination with the shampoo really clean. He all around was happy with this product.\nThick and minty\nR-NEU 200 Cotton Rounds, 100% Natural Turkish Cotton Makeup Remover and Facial Cleansing Cotton Round Pads, Waffle Textured Hypoallergenic Cotton Wipes, 2.25 Inch Diameter (200 Pack)\nR-NEU\n{'Size': '2.25 Inch (Pack of 200)', 'Brand': 'R-NEU', 'Material': 'Cotton', 'Product Benefits': 'Cleansing', 'Shape': 'Round', 'Package Dimensions': '9.17 x 4.8 x 2.28 inches; 3.77 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'yhua8a-654', 'UPC': '696292837730', 'Manufacturer': 'R-NEU'}\nFor reference: Comparing to an affordable drugstore version which is pictured on the right with this version on the left.<br /><br />Impressions upon unpackaging was that I didn't think I would like these they felt thin and the other brand is fluffier. So it made me think that they wouldn't hold up well. I was proven wrong I use these for toner twice a day and these don't feel as scratchy as the other ones and they have a smoothness about them during application as well as they don't leave any fuzzies behind them. I have to say I am glad I gave these a chance what drew me is the on sale price and how many you get I am big on stocking up always to make sure we always have a backup especially now. Overall I have to say if I catch these on sale more often I may be inclined to get more whenever we run out which I am not sure when that will actually be. Which is a good thing I promise.\nThin but not to thin perfect for toner, feels soft, and don't leave behind fuzzies\nUV LED Nail Lamp \u2013 128W Rapid-Curing Gel Nails Dryer for Manicures and Pedicures \u2013 Dual-Voltage with Extra-Long Cable, Multi-Language Manual \u2013 Professional Gel Lamp for Homes or Salons by OVLUX, Gold\nOVLUX\n{'Brand': 'OVLUX', 'Special Feature': 'Energy Efficient', 'Light Source Type': 'LED', 'Material': 'Gel', 'Connectivity Technology': 'USB', 'Package Dimensions': '9.4 x 8.3 x 4.3 inches; 1.55 Pounds', 'UPC': '765453999881'}\nI am totally new to the idea and concept when it comes to doing gel nails at home myself. This was the first time I have owed and used a UV lamp by myself to cure my nails. I def like the initial unpackaging the machine itself looks professional and well made. It plugs into the wall the cord could be a tad longer but it was workable. I didnt read over the instructions since I have seen this machine be used both in the nail salon on a number of ocassions not regularly but I am a quick study. I have also seen ppl I watch on youtube use machines like this as well so I was familar with the concept of what your suppose to do. Now I did pair this with gel polish that I had never used before so my review may not be the best since I am unfamilar with both the product and the products used but it is coming from a first time user as I am sure there are others out there like myself. So in use I will say the machine does get warm not hot but warm depending on how long your using it. The light is very bright and def caught me off guard. The buttons are extremely easy to use but I love that the machine also has a sensor so you dont have to push the button if you dont need to which I thought was a nice touch. The only downside of that is if you lift your palm up then it goes off so its extremely important to pay attention to the numbers you were on for curing sake. I will say thou using this machine at first with the base coat that I was using it came out tacky so my first thought is great I was excited about using this and it doesnt all the way work but once I thought to just go ahead and apply the first layer of polish, cure, and then do the top coat everything was fine. So overall this works great and I look forward to using again in the future as I begin experimenting with both gel polish and poly gel (I think its called). As stated I am a quick study and I dont think I did too bad of a job my first time around.\nEasy to use,works great and has a sensor inside so you dont have to push buttons\nEZ Detangler Brush, Morgles 2 Pack Detangling Brush for Curly Hair Ez Hair Detangling Brush for Afro America/ African Hair 3a to 4c Wavy Hair\nMORGLES\n{'Brand': 'MORGLES', 'Shape': 'Oblong', 'Handle Material': 'Rubber', 'Unit Count': '2.00 Count', 'Hair Type': 'Curly,Wavy,Thick', 'Product Dimensions': '9.69 x 2.99 x 1.38 inches; 6.38 Ounces'}\nThis is my second set of these brushes I originally got these for my middle daughter and we keep one in her bathroom and one in the kitchen for the times I put a hair mask in her hair and use these combs to get the tangles out and the product into each part of her hair up to her root. So when my oldest seen these and I used them in her hair she was like ok I want one now too and then I also thought these would be great for my son who also has tons of hair and curly hair at that. So now everyone has one and I think I may sadly be getting another set for my daughters when there at their dads house too. They love these brushes and I have to attest using these to comb thru their hair makes things a world easier and less of a hassle I do wish they had a grip on the handle for wet hands but really outside of that I dont have any complaints. These come in packs of 2 and even if you dont have kids using one in a purse and keeping one home is enough reasons to get these especially if you have thick hair these are amazing. My kids are mixed and range from hair length to neck length to butt length and I will tell you these are amazing at handling getting thru those thick tangles. The back has a piece that allows you to have the comb itself at different firmness I like the top one personally it is the firmest level. Overall if I am not a fan I dont know who is but I know for sure I have 4 and I will have 6 by the end of the year.\nGreat quality, works great for thick,long,curly hair, and works wonders\nSOFTACULOUS Foot Peeling Mask Booties \u2013 2 Pairs, Baby Soft Skin in 7 Days\nSuiteMade\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.87 x 5.91 x 1.14 inches; 4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'STM-FMP-LAV', 'UPC': '734038263785'}\nAlright so I got this for me and my husband to try on his vacation which we did this on 9/10/21 it is now 1/29/21. I will start from the beginning. This was the first time ever doing anything like this for me and my husband so we werent sure what to expect with the process. When you take these out I will caution you to watch how much you cute the parts that go on your feet as I cut my husband's too wide and some of the liquid that is inside did come out. So you know there is liquid inside each of the bags that go on your feet that feels weird on your feet and cold. We left on for the recommended time of an hour the process is explained in detail which I will give them kuddos for. Now after we let them stay on for an hour we then showered them off I placed lotion on my feet the first night again not sure what to expect and I didnt want this to dry my feet out too much as to where my husband didnt have a preference so he did not lotion his feet. He started seeing the peeling first. Now keep in mind I do get pedis and my last one was probably in March of 2020 and since then I have used a foot file and soak during that time. My peeling did not start until halfway thru the week so I thought that was important to mention. He does not get his feet done and never has. His peeling lasted about a week. We are about what a week and half in of peeling 2 weeks in since I did the foot mask my feet still look aweful and they are still peeling. I have started to apply lotion to the feet to see if this will help the process and only have seen minimal improvement. Now keep in mind I am an impatient person. Also to mention a burning and tingling sensation is expected its what we felt during the process once we were done. Overall I think I will stick to my parifan drips and doing my feet the way I have been doing I will say that it did wear down a few calluses I had on my feet its just the process I am not patient enough for I dont mind wearing socks too much but this is more of being forced to wear socks so I dont shed everywhere and even then I still find dead skin somewhere. This process was horrible to me and I think there are better ways to get these results. My husband didnt too much mind the process and his feet were in worse conditon than mind and his process didnt take as long and for me that was even more frustrating. This would not be something I would recommend unless you are a patient person and dont mind waiting like this for results I just want to let my feet breath again.<br /><br />Update: 2/2 My foot is still peeling this is def something I will not be doing again for me its about the fact that this is suppose to be something that takes time but really this amount of time for me is ridiculous and I can get the results its providing by using a foot file after soaking is that process more difficult yes but I get results within an hour not almost a month. My feet look nasty and dry even lotion isn't helping.\nDoes work but you have to be a patient person as this could take weeks to fully happen\nTOUCH IN SOL Best of No Pore Blem Travel Kit - Face Makeup Primer, Big Pores Perfect Cover, Inner-Glowing Skin with Moisture, Long Lasting Makeup's Staying Kit\nTouch in Sol\n{'Brand': 'Touch in Sol', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Package Information': 'Tube', 'Item Volume': '0.5 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '6.46 x 5.39 x 1.14 inches; 5.12 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'no pore blem kit'}\nFirst impressions I have to start with the packaging which I think was cute in a way. I have not ever heard of this brand or used it before now and since getting it have heard great things about certain products from this little kit. I will say from this kit my favorite is the primer in the squeeze tube that I add in with a matte primer and it does a great job at minimizing pores which is something I have a problem with on my nose,cheeks and chin and this does a great job at covering up those problem areas and looks great under makeup. I wasnt the biggest fan of the 2 other primers and havent really played with them a whole lot not in comparison to the one in the squeeze tube. Overall this would be the one I would repurchase and reuse time and time again.\nCute kit,love the variety but fell in love with the one in the tube\nPursoma Digital Detox Bath Treatment, 10 oz\nPursoma\n{'Brand': 'Pursoma', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Cleansing', 'Product Benefits': 'Detox,Rejuvenating', 'Material Feature': 'Phthalate Free,Paraben Free,Non GMO', 'Package Dimensions': '8.78 x 5.79 x 1.89 inches; 10 Ounces', 'Item model number': '8880002-AMZ', 'UPC': '082045397765', 'Manufacturer': 'Pursoma'}\nI got this for myself since I struggle alot with all over pain in my body everyday since having my son but honestly I got a little intimidated by it after reading the instructions and it talking about purging your inpurities from your body.
