This was the first time I have owed and used a UV lamp by myself to cure my nails. I def like the initial unpackaging the machine itself looks professional and well made. It plugs into the wall the cord could be a tad longer but it was workable. I didnt read over the instructions since I have seen this machine be used both in the nail salon on a number of ocassions not regularly but I am a quick study. I have also seen ppl I watch on youtube use machines like this as well so I was familar with the concept of what your suppose to do. Now I did pair this with gel polish that I had never used before so my review may not be the best since I am unfamilar with both the product and the products used but it is coming from a first time user as I am sure there are others out there like myself. So in use I will say the machine does get warm not hot but warm depending on how long your using it. The light is very bright and def caught me off guard. The buttons are extremely easy to use but I love that the machine also has a sensor so you dont have to push the button if you dont need to which I thought was a nice touch. The only downside of that is if you lift your palm up then it goes off so its extremely important to pay attention to the numbers you were on for curing sake. I will say thou using this machine at first with the base coat that I was using it came out tacky so my first thought is great I was excited about using this and it doesnt all the way work but once I thought to just go ahead and apply the first layer of polish, cure, and then do the top coat everything was fine. So overall this works great and I look forward to using again in the future as I begin experimenting with both gel polish and poly gel (I think its called). As stated I am a quick study and I dont think I did too bad of a job my first time around.\nReview Title: Easy to use,works great and has a sensor inside so you dont have to push buttons\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "lorelo 20 pieces Hair Curlers, Hair Rollers Spiral Curls Styling Kit No Heat Hair Curlers with Styling Hooks for Girls Woman\nlorelo\n{'Number of Items': '20', 'Material': 'Silicone', 'Brand': 'Lorelo', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '10.59 x 9.02 x 2.8 inches; 9.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '619156721396'}\nI choose these because I've seen these before product curls without the heat and it was as simple as applying them and letting your hair air dry. Well let me tell you it takes alot of practice and patience and knowing what your doing. Is it simple enough to understand, yes. However the sectioning hair, getting tangled, knotted or stuck was alot of the problems I ran into. If my husband had not been home I think I might have been in some real trouble. I'm not mild tempered and almost was pulling my hair out trying to get it unstuck at some points. I will say there were times when I got a rhythm going and I was getting my hair to go thru effortlessly but in the end once I was done I found pieces that weren't even in there and it was uncomfortable to wear unless maybe I was up doing stuff around the house. In the end I took it down and I'd had enough of the torture these provided. Overall would I suggest these yes to someone a little more familiar with there head and maybe to do in my daughter's hair but personally unless it's a day I'm bored and nothing else to do I may give it a go again. I will say my husband did see some curls in my hair when I ended up taking them out they didn't stay that way but he said he could see results and that was just in a matter of getting them all in. There may be potential there just not patience in my book.\nTakes time and patience\nMr. Pristine Organic Beard Shampoo with Natural Essential Oils for Moisturizing Skin & Hair, 8.5 oz.\nMr. Pristine\n{'Brand': 'Mr. Pristine', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Hair Type': 'Color Treated', 'Scent': 'Peppermint', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '5.21 x 2.8 x 2.3 inches; 7.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '627843801832', 'Manufacturer': 'Mr. Pristine'}\n\u2022 Lathers really well<br />\u2022 Has a light mint smell<br />\u2022 Leaves your beard feeling nice and clean afterwards<br /><br />Got for my husband as he is moving into grooming and managing his growing beard. He has told me that he really likes the way this shampoo cleans his beard and the fact that it lathers well without having to apply much product which for me is a win cuz that means less money spent in the long run. Overall he has def enjoyed using this product and we're still gauging if this is something we would repurchase but if we did it would def be because it's long lasting.\nPretty decent shampoo\nMr. Pristine Organic Beard Conditioner to Grow, Thicken, Moisturize and Protect Your Beard, 8.5 oz.\nMr. Pristine\n{'Brand': 'Mr. Pristine', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Hair Type': 'Dry', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '8.5 Fl Oz', 'Package Dimensions': '3.1 x 2.5 x 2.36 inches; 7.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '627843801825', 'Manufacturer': 'Mr. Pristine'}\n\u2022 Light mint scent<br />\u2022 Thick formula but makes for great moisturizing<br />\u2022 A little difficult to get out the bottle<br /><br />Overall this was chosen for my husband who is on a journey of finding things he likes for his beard maintenance. He has enjoyed this product in reference to how well it pairs with the shampoo. It leaves his beard feeling nice and soft and in combination with the shampoo really clean. He all around was happy with this product.\nThick and minty\nR-NEU 200 Cotton Rounds, 100% Natural Turkish Cotton Makeup Remover and Facial Cleansing Cotton Round Pads, Waffle Textured Hypoallergenic Cotton Wipes, 2.25 Inch Diameter (200 Pack)\nR-NEU\n{'Size': '2.25 Inch (Pack of 200)', 'Brand': 'R-NEU', 'Material': 'Cotton', 'Product Benefits': 'Cleansing', 'Shape': 'Round', 'Package Dimensions': '9.17 x 4.8 x 2.28 inches; 3.77 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'yhua8a-654', 'UPC': '696292837730', 'Manufacturer': 'R-NEU'}\nFor reference: Comparing to an affordable drugstore version which is pictured on the right with this version on the left.<br /><br />Impressions upon unpackaging was that I didn't think I would like these they felt thin and the other brand is fluffier. So it made me think that they wouldn't hold up well. I was proven wrong I use these for toner twice a day and these don't feel as scratchy as the other ones and they have a smoothness about them during application as well as they don't leave any fuzzies behind them. I have to say I am glad I gave these a chance what drew me is the on sale price and how many you get I am big on stocking up always to make sure we always have a backup especially now. Overall I have to say if I catch these on sale more often I may be inclined to get more whenever we run out which I am not sure when that will actually be. Which is a good thing I promise.\nThin but not to thin perfect for toner, feels soft, and don't leave behind fuzzies\nUV LED Nail Lamp \u2013 128W Rapid-Curing Gel Nails Dryer for Manicures and Pedicures \u2013 Dual-Voltage with Extra-Long Cable, Multi-Language Manual \u2013 Professional Gel Lamp for Homes or Salons by OVLUX, Gold\nOVLUX\n{'Brand': 'OVLUX', 'Special Feature': 'Energy Efficient', 'Light Source Type': 'LED', 'Material': 'Gel', 'Connectivity Technology': 'USB', 'Package Dimensions': '9.4 x 8.3 x 4.3 inches; 1.55 Pounds', 'UPC': '765453999881'}\nI am totally new to the idea and concept when it comes to doing gel nails at home myself.
