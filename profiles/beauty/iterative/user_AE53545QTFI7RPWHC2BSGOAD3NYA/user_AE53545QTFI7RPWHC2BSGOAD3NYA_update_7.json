As far as a body wash goes this one has a very light scent. While it definitely  cleans  the skin it is a low lather soap. You do not  get a lot of bubbles. There are three  different  types  of  oils  in this body wash  coconut, argan, and tea tree. They work  well in terms  of moisturization. One of my favorite  features  is the pump that is included  to dispense the soap. It is really  well  made. It doesn't  allow  for any drips and dispenses  accurately. I  received  a  discounted  sample  of  this  product  in  exchange  for  an  unbiased  and  honest  review.\nReview Title: Moisturizing\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I love  the fact that  this  lotion  features  key ingredients  such  as Shea Butter, avocado  oil, and kukui nut oil. I applied  it every  night  before  bed. This butter  is super  rich  and  moisturizing. My legs were starting  to have  that  alligator  look and now they don't. I wish  this  scent was way stronger. It's to faint for me. Also this  butter absorbs  at a slower rate. That's why  I  choose  to apply  at night.

It can  be  applied  all  over  your  body  as well  as worn like  foundation  or under your  makeup. This sunscreen  has a brownish  tint to it and it blends  with  ease. I do wish  it was a little  darker. The consistency  is creamy  but not oily. I wish  the scent  was a bit stronger. I find  this  product  to  be  really  moisturizing.

I buy them all of the time. I have tried different  brands  from your dollar ones all the way to paying  $200 for one in a spa. So when  I  got  the  opportunity  to  review  this  product  for  free  in  exchange  for  an  honest  review  I was in. Let me say that  I liked the scent  which  is kind  of important  because  you  have  to  leave  this  mask on for at least 7 minutes. Next the color is dark  and the consistency  is lighter than what is typical. This means that a little  will go along way. It didn't  get too tight and was easy to remove. I used it both on my face and my cellulite  areas. It felt good  and I had no irritation. It definitely  made my face soft and bright. My makeup  also laid nicely. As far  as  the  cellulite  it didn't  melt  away. I am going  to continue  regulated use and see what  happens.\nDead Sea Delight\nEyelash Serum 3.5ml\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4 x 1.7 x 1 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '646437061599'}\nI have the shortest, thinnest  eyelashes  ever. I constantly  use gobs of mascara to make  them thicker and longer. So when  I was  offered  to  review  this  product  for a  discount  in  exchange  for  an  honest  review  I jumped on it. This serum comes packaged  nicely and the bottle  seemed on the small side. I opened and tested  it on the back of my knee. No irritation  at all. So before  I went to sleep  I put it on my eye lashes  and brows. When I woke  up I didn't  see a difference. I decided  to try it in the morning  under my makeup. It made my eyebrows  super defined and they laid perfectly  through the day. It also made  my mascara  lay well and my eye lashes  appeared longer. I will continue  to  use  it  and see what happens.\nDecent  day time  solution\nFungus Nail Treatment,Sky-shop Fungus Nail Repair Oil, Fungal Nail Eliminator for Fingernails and Toenails, Repairs & Protects from Discoloration, Brittle and Cracked Nails (35ml)\nPei Mei\n{'Brand': 'Pei Mei', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Item Weight': '0.25 Pounds', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Unit Count': '1.0582 Ounce', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2 x 2 x 5 inches; 4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'Natural Nail Polish Remover', 'UPC': '646437736213'}\nThis nail polish  remover is a fascinating  product. First  of all the biggest  positive  for me is that this product  has no scent at all. It literally  smells  like water. Second biggest  positive  is that this nail  polish  remover is all natural  plant based as opposed  to pure chemical. This product  had no problems  removing  my old nail polish and worked well. This nail  polish  remover really  surprised  me by its quality  I am impressed.

I take my showers in the morning  and find this scent  to invigorate  me. I was concerned  at first  because  the color of the scrub is bright  orange  and I didn't  know  if it would  tint my skin...it didn't. This scrub is medium sized in exfoliating crystal. It is a drier consistency  and is easy to apply. I just dumped  some in my hand and gently  massaged it into my skin. It leaves your skin hydrated  and soft.
