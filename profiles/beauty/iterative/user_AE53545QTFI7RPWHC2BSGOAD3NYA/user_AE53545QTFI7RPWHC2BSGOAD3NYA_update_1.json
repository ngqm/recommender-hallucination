I love  the fact that  this  lotion  features  key ingredients  such  as Shea Butter, avocado  oil, and kukui nut oil. I applied  it every  night  before  bed. This butter  is super  rich  and  moisturizing. My legs were starting  to have  that  alligator  look and now they don't. I wish  this  scent was way stronger. It's to faint for me. Also this  butter absorbs  at a slower rate. That's why  I  choose  to apply  at night. I received  this  product  for  free  in  exchange  for  an  honest  review.\nReview Title: Super  rich!!\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
