This serum comes packaged  nicely and the bottle  seemed on the small side. I opened and tested  it on the back of my knee. No irritation  at all. So before  I went to sleep  I put it on my eye lashes  and brows. When I woke  up I didn't  see a difference. I decided  to try it in the morning  under my makeup. It made my eyebrows  super defined and they laid perfectly  through the day. It also made  my mascara  lay well and my eye lashes  appeared longer.

I love  the fact that  this  lotion  features  key ingredients  such  as Shea Butter, avocado  oil, and kukui nut oil. I applied  it every  night  before  bed. This butter  is super  rich  and  moisturizing. My legs were starting  to have  that  alligator  look and now they don't. I wish  this  scent was way stronger. It's to faint for me. Also this  butter absorbs  at a slower rate. That's why  I  choose  to apply  at night. I received  this  product  for  free  in  exchange  for  an  honest  review.\nSuper  rich!!\nOZNaturals Tinted Moisturizer, SPF 30 Sunscreen. Broad Spectrum Protection.

It can  be  applied  all  over  your  body  as well  as worn like  foundation  or under your  makeup. This sunscreen  has a brownish  tint to it and it blends  with  ease. I do wish  it was a little  darker. The consistency  is creamy  but not oily. I wish  the scent  was a bit stronger. I find  this  product  to  be  really  moisturizing.

I buy them all of the time. I have tried different  brands  from your dollar ones all the way to paying  $200 for one in a spa. So when  I  got  the  opportunity  to  review  this  product  for  free  in  exchange  for  an  honest  review  I was in. Let me say that  I liked the scent  which  is kind  of important  because  you  have  to  leave  this  mask on for at least 7 minutes. Next the color is dark  and the consistency  is lighter than what is typical. This means that a little  will go along way. It didn't  get too tight and was easy to remove. I used it both on my face and my cellulite  areas. It felt good  and I had no irritation. It definitely  made my face soft and bright. My makeup  also laid nicely. As far  as  the  cellulite  it didn't  melt  away. I am going  to continue  regulated use and see what  happens.\nDead Sea Delight\nEyelash Serum 3.5ml\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4 x 1.7 x 1 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '646437061599'}\nI have the shortest, thinnest  eyelashes  ever.
