It can  be  applied  all  over  your  body  as well  as worn like  foundation  or under your  makeup. This sunscreen  has a brownish  tint to it and it blends  with  ease. I do wish  it was a little  darker. The consistency  is creamy  but not oily. I wish  the scent  was a bit stronger. I find  this  product  to  be  really  moisturizing.

I love  the fact that  this  lotion  features  key ingredients  such  as Shea Butter, avocado  oil, and kukui nut oil. I applied  it every  night  before  bed. This butter  is super  rich  and  moisturizing. My legs were starting  to have  that  alligator  look and now they don't. I wish  this  scent was way stronger. It's to faint for me.
