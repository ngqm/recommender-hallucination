The length on this hair is nice, but it's definitely thin like others have mentioned. And I'm not just talking about the bangs. The bangs are ridiculously thin \u2014\u00a0to the point where you would rather they hadn't given it bangs. It doesn't look at all like the product description photo. I have yet to color and layer this wig, but it would definitely be a backup option rather than a daily go to choice.\nReview Title: Cute but way too thin\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

In particular, he always tries to take my cuticle nippers and nail clippers \u2014\u00a0and then doesn't put them back. So, then when I need them, I can't find them...not cool. So I'm giving him this as one of his many Christmas gifts because I'm tired of chasing him for my stuff. He'll say he doesn't need it...but he does!\nGreat essentials for guys\nJPNK 10PCS Makeup tool set, Blender Sponges& Air cushion puff&Sponge Holder for Blending Liquid, Cream or Flawless Powder Cosmetics\nJPNK\n{'Brand': 'JPNK', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Foundation,Concealer,Blender', 'Package Dimensions': '8.5 x 5.4 x 2.3 inches; 5.61 Ounces'}\nThese are great sponges. Sometimes when you buy knockoff versions of a Beauty Blender, they can be hard or don't work like you would expect. But these sponges are soft and work great wet or dry.\nGreat for blending and texture is soft\nshort bob human hair wigs lace front human hair wigs straight bob wigs natural color\naibasi\n{'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Brand': 'Aibasi', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '10.8 x 6.8 x 3 inches; 11.99 Ounces', 'UPC': '733810686330'}\nI'm always nervous about ordering human hair wigs through Amazon because you never know what you're going to get but this one was nice. I've been thinking about cutting my actual hair into an angled bob but wanted to test run the length first. So I got this wig and I love how it looks. I also love that I was able to lightly bleach highlights into the wig and the hair took it easily. So the quality on this wig is great.\nGreat quality wig with very soft hair\nDyson Hair Dryer Wall Mount Holder, Aluminum Alloy Wall Bracket Holder for Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryer (Style 2)\nYeegfeycc\n{'Product Dimensions': '15.8 x 3.1 x 6.7 inches; 5.36 Pounds', 'UPC': '763231060839'}\nThis is a great piece to keep your Dyson accessories organized in one place.

I don't use them solo \u2014\u00a0only with a makeup remover or micellar water. But these things are great because they're gentle on your skin and are far more economical and environmentally friendly than using disposable wipes.\nYou can never have too many makeup removing cloths\n20 PCS Zoostliss Nail Polish Remover Clips\nZoostliss\n{'Brand': 'Zoostliss', 'Number of Items': '20', 'Unit Count': '20 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '6.6 x 5.1 x 1.8 inches; 3.99 Ounces'}\nI recently started doing dip nails and they're definitely more work to remove than normal polish. But I like these clips to ensure that the acetone is really working into the polish and isn't sliding.\nGreat for removing stubborn polish\nAMAJULIE Non Slip Flexible Silicon Wigs Fix Strong Hold Comfort Silicone Lace Wig Grip Transparent Headband Hair Band Adjustable for Lace Wigs (Light Brown)\nAMAJULIE\n{'Material': 'Silicone', 'Fabric Type': 'Silicone,Silicon,Lace', 'Brand': 'AMAJULIE', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '3.98 x 2.28 x 0.55 inches; 0.88 Ounces', 'UPC': '192389741275'}\nThis is a great option for full or frontal lace wigs.
