I've been thinking about cutting my actual hair into an angled bob but wanted to test run the length first. So I got this wig and I love how it looks. I also love that I was able to lightly bleach highlights into the wig and the hair took it easily. So the quality on this wig is great.\nReview Title: Great quality wig with very soft hair\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
