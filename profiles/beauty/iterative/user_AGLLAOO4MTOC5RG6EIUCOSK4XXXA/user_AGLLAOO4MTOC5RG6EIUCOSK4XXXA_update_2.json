  "reference_summary": "JOYYUM 1000W 2-in-1 Hot Air Spin Brush Styler Auto-rotating Negative Ionic Hair Curler Dryer Brush, 1 1/2 Inch and 2 Inch Brush Attachments, Lavander Fog\nJOYYUM\n{'Brand': 'JOYYUM', 'Material': 'Titanium', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Special Feature': 'Comb, Portable, Massage, Hot', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Curling', 'Package Dimensions': '16.3 x 5.4 x 3.2 inches; 1.85 Pounds', 'UPC': '787414814279', 'Manufacturer': 'JOYYUM'}\nI have mixed feelings about this dryer.  It does a nice job over all but has some problems.  It takes a bit for it to heat up and would take forever to actually dry wet hair. It works well on lightly damp hair.  It has a button that spins the barrel different direction and it\u2019s quite easy to use, but the motor to turn the barrel isn\u2019t very strong and it take a bit to get going.  My biggest complaint is the sound.  It is very loud with a high pitched wail this is especially problematic because you use it right next to your ear.\nVery loud.\nEmbryolisse Eau de Beaute Rosamelis Face Toner, 6.76 Fl Oz\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.85 x 2.76 x 7.44 inches; 8.11 Ounces', 'Item model number': '501000', 'Manufacturer': 'Embryolisse'}\nThis is great toner.
