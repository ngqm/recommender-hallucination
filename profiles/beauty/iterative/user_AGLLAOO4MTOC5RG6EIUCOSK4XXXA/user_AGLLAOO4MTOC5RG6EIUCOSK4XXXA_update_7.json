It does a nice job over all but has some problems.  It takes a bit for it to heat up and would take forever to actually dry wet hair. It works well on lightly damp hair.  It has a button that spins the barrel different direction and it\u2019s quite easy to use, but the motor to turn the barrel isn\u2019t very strong and it take a bit to get going.  My biggest complaint is the sound.  It is very loud with a high pitched wail this is especially problematic because you use it right next to your ear.\nVery loud.\nEmbryolisse Eau de Beaute Rosamelis Face Toner, 6.76 Fl Oz\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.85 x 2.76 x 7.44 inches; 8.11 Ounces', 'Item model number': '501000', 'Manufacturer': 'Embryolisse'}\nThis is great toner.
