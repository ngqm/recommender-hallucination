Even though I don\u2019t need 6 of them.<br />They are well made, very stretchy, so I guess they fit a wide range of head sizes!<br />Super super soft. The fabric is thick.<br />Comfortable to use, it does not squeeze the head. But it holds all the hair back.<br />I use it when washing my face. It keeps my hair dry too.<br />I love the bow! Very 50\u2019s!!!<br />Great colors. Like it a lot.\nFun and works great!\nBior\u00e9 J-Beauty Makeup Removing Moisturizing Cleansing Jelly, Top Japanese Makeup Remover, Gentle Skin Cleanser, Mild Floral Fragrance, Non-Greasy, 7.8 Ounce\nBior\u00e9\n['Bior\u00e9 J-Beauty Makeup Removing Moisturizing Cleansing Jelly is a non-greasy makeup remover that removes dirt and impurities from deep below the surface of your skin.

Just some primer, concealer, eyes and mouth.<br />For me, they worked perfectly! They are pretty wet, so they took off all my makeup easily.<br />They are small, so if you use more layers of make up you maybe are going to need more than one.<br />They are soft and have a nice scent.<br />I have mixed skin and delicate. They did not hurt me, burn me, or leave my skin red.<br />After using them, my skin feels clean and moisturized. Not greasy or dry.<br />And they come in a super handy little box, perfect to carry around on your bag.\nWorks great!!\nlilah b. - Bronzed Beauty Bronzer Duo - b. sunkissed - Multipurpose Bronzer Duo to Highlight + Contour and Blend\nLILAH B\n{'Brand': 'LILAH B', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Style': 'Compact', 'Package Dimensions': '3.8 x 3.5 x 1 inches; 0.32 Ounces', 'UPC': '851078006100'}\nThis is beautiful. Not only the box is very nice, but the case is stunning! Looks like a smooth shell. Very luxurious. Perfect as a gift!<br />It is however, because of the material, like a ceramic or something, very heavy. I think it will not be good as a pret a porter kind of makeup. But perfect for the one you leave on your makeup vanities.<br />The colors are perfect for my skin tone, I\u2019m like a light brown tone. But I\u2019ve found myself using it more as a eye shadow than bronzer.<br />The highlighter gives a pop of glow.<br />No scent on it and it stays perfectly during my days.<br />Like it.
