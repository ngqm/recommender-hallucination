It is not a simple or fast process.<br />The liquid has a very strong chocolate scent which I prefer over any more chemical scent.<br />You need to follow the instructions very well.<br />I have very thin, short natural wavy hair and I think we did something wrong along the way\u2026 hahaha\u2026<br />Although my hair does feel softer and shinier. But I don\u2019t have a \u201cBrazilian straight\u201d.<br />The liquid is chocolate also in color but I did not see any difference in my own hair. So it did not dye it.<br />Is a good product, and if you are like me, not super handy with brush and hair dryer, you better ask for help so you can follow through the steps.\nReview Title: Chocolate scent\u2026 huge bottle\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Even though I don\u2019t need 6 of them.<br />They are well made, very stretchy, so I guess they fit a wide range of head sizes!<br />Super super soft. The fabric is thick.<br />Comfortable to use, it does not squeeze the head. But it holds all the hair back.<br />I use it when washing my face. It keeps my hair dry too.<br />I love the bow! Very 50\u2019s!!!<br />Great colors. Like it a lot.\nFun and works great!\nBior\u00e9 J-Beauty Makeup Removing Moisturizing Cleansing Jelly, Top Japanese Makeup Remover, Gentle Skin Cleanser, Mild Floral Fragrance, Non-Greasy, 7.8 Ounce\nBior\u00e9\n['Bior\u00e9 J-Beauty Makeup Removing Moisturizing Cleansing Jelly is a non-greasy makeup remover that removes dirt and impurities from deep below the surface of your skin.

Just some primer, concealer, eyes and mouth.<br />For me, they worked perfectly! They are pretty wet, so they took off all my makeup easily.<br />They are small, so if you use more layers of make up you maybe are going to need more than one.<br />They are soft and have a nice scent.<br />I have mixed skin and delicate. They did not hurt me, burn me, or leave my skin red.<br />After using them, my skin feels clean and moisturized. Not greasy or dry.<br />And they come in a super handy little box, perfect to carry around on your bag.\nWorks great!!\nlilah b. - Bronzed Beauty Bronzer Duo - b. sunkissed - Multipurpose Bronzer Duo to Highlight + Contour and Blend\nLILAH B\n{'Brand': 'LILAH B', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Style': 'Compact', 'Package Dimensions': '3.8 x 3.5 x 1 inches; 0.32 Ounces', 'UPC': '851078006100'}\nThis is beautiful. Not only the box is very nice, but the case is stunning! Looks like a smooth shell. Very luxurious. Perfect as a gift!<br />It is however, because of the material, like a ceramic or something, very heavy. I think it will not be good as a pret a porter kind of makeup. But perfect for the one you leave on your makeup vanities.<br />The colors are perfect for my skin tone, I\u2019m like a light brown tone. But I\u2019ve found myself using it more as a eye shadow than bronzer.<br />The highlighter gives a pop of glow.<br />No scent on it and it stays perfectly during my days.<br />Like it. Beautiful!\nBeautiful case!\nMagnetic Eyelashes and Magnetic Eyeliner Kit, Magnetic Eyelashes with Eyeliner, 5 Pairs Reusable Magnetic Eyelashes with Tweezer, False Lashes\nEyenjoy\n{'Brand': 'Eyenjoy', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '5.71 x 5.39 x 0.71 inches', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Mounting Type': 'Magnet', 'Product Dimensions': '5.71 x 5.39 x 0.71 inches; 2.12 Ounces', 'UPC': '736067423758'}\nThis was my first attempt to do faux eye lashes. I can not compare to other systems, but I love it! I use the 3 pair from the top. The look was pretty normal. I had to cut a little of them because it was too long for me.<br />The set comes with 2 eye liner, tweezer and 5 pairs of lashes.<br />The liner was easy to apply and then the lashes were stuck on it fast and easy.<br />I went to a barbecue with them and they stay in the entire time.<br />After, they go out without any pain. The eye liner was a little hard to take off. I use my makeup wipes in a hard way. Haha.<br />It did not make my sensitive skin hurt or burn.<br />I love it!\nBig difference!\nArgan Magic 100% Pure Argan Oil \u2013 Moisturizing Oil that Infuses Skin with Enriched Hydration | Leaves Skin Restored & Refreshed | Non-Greasy | Rich in Vitamin E | Made in USA | Cruelty Free (2 oz)\nArgan Magic\n{'Brand': 'Argan Magic', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Active Ingredients': 'Vitamin e', 'Unit Count': '2 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.2 x 1.1 x 1.1 inches; 2 Ounces', 'UPC': '605923474046'}\nI was hoping more of this oil.<br />First it does not have any \u00e1rgan type of scent... on the contrary it smells like fried oil. Not good. It is not super strong scent, but definitely you can smell it.<br />Second, it does not absorbe fast. I was oily until I fell asleep.<br />It was lightweight.<br />I did felt my skin hidrates the next day, but not quite sure if this is better than other oils that I use.<br />Definitely, I won\u2019t use it, because mainly of the French fries smell.\nMmmmm Im not sure...\nClaw Hair Clips, IKOCO 6 Pack Jaw Clips Stylish Matte Plastic Strong Hold Hair Clamps Box Packaged for Thin Fine Hair with 10Pcs Black Hair ties (2.4Inch)\nIKOCO\n{'Brand': 'IKOCO', 'Hair Type': 'Fine', 'Color': 'Green,Grey', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material': 'Plastic, Metal, Acrylic', 'Product Dimensions': '6.25 x 4.25 x 2 inches; 5.89 Ounces'}\nThis set comes in a plastic box, nice detail because you can use it for storage.<br />The clips are bigger than I was expecting, but they are perfect. I have very thin hair and medium length.<br />I like that they lie flat on my head. So they don\u2019t hurt me if I\u2019m using them for long periods of time.<br />Lightweight and well made. They feel sturdy.<br />The set also comes with hair ties, love them! Very soft. They are made on 1 piece of fabric which helps on the hair.<br />I really like this set.<br />Recommended.\nGreat set!\nSOFTACULOUS Foot Peeling Mask Booties \u2013 2 Pairs, Baby Soft Skin in 7 Days\nSuiteMade\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.87 x 5.91 x 1.14 inches; 4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'STM-FMP-LAV', 'UPC': '734038263785'}\nA couple of times during the year I get my heels very very dry.<br />I ordered this mask and it was great!<br />It start peeling around day 5-6.. and it was soo relaxing!!! Just like when I was little and we use glue on our hands! Haha..<br />Well, my feet are soft and almost all the dryness got out.<br />Easy to use.<br />No strong scent.<br />It did not make my skin red or itchy.<br />Love it!

You don\u2019t need too much of it for the entire face. My skin did feel moisturized after using it BUT i just can\u2019t stand the stickiness!!!! I tried with several amounts of it and i could not sleep at all because of the sticky feeling. It was too much. It did not absorb into my skin. Obviously every skin is different, mine is sensitive and dry.<br />The consistency is like a heavy gel.<br />So, for me is a BIG no, but i will use it during summer after sun tanning, before shower. I can see that would be best for me....i even think it will work great if i storage it in the fridge before using it... just like a cooling gel.\nDefinitely not for every night\nVeencys - Hair Straightening Treatment - Brazilian Keratin - Chocolate Treatment -Maximum Strength-Ideal for Moisturizing Eliminates Frizzy Hairs Smooth Hair 32oz (946 ml)\nVeencys\n{'Package Dimensions': '9.84 x 3.15 x 3.11 inches; 2.34 Pounds'}\nFirst, this treatment is profesional use\u2026 I can seee that because definitely I couldn\u2019t do it by myself!
