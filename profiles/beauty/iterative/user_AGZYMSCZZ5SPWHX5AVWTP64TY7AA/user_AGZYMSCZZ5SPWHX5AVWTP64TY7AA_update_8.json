  "reference_summary": "Travel Bottles for Toiletries, Silicone Travel Size Bottles And Squeezable Containers Holders with belt clip Keychain for Backpack, Shampoo, Liquid, Cosmetic Products(2 oz, 6 Pack)\nMACRAY\n{'Brand': 'MACRAY', 'Material': 'Silicone', 'Capacity': '2 Ounces', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '11.73 x 6.61 x 1.61 inches; 8.47 Ounces', 'UPC': '782938308006'}\nI am very happy when I got this one coz it looks super nice and made of quality material. I got this mostly to hold hand sanitizers for my whole family so we have our own when we are out.<br /><br />PROS:<br />* perfect size! If you will travel for a week, this will be enough to hold your stuff.<br />* the silicone material is very nice, I am very impressed!<br />* wide mouth<br />* easy to refill and get your stuff out<br />* the carabiners are made of high quality metal.<br />* easy to squeeze (but be careful if it\u2019s a hand sanitizer or water like liquid it will come out very fast so squeeze with caution)<br /><br />CONS<br />* The scent of whatever you put leaks out. You will need a a few ziplock bags to contain the scent if you are traveling or else it will be all over your luggage. If you happen to mix it with food items, expect it to taste whatever you put on this bottles.<br />* don\u2019t use for hand sanitizers or anything with alcohol base on it. I got it mainly for holding hand sanitizers for my whole family but the scent leaks so bad that I have to not use it for the purpose. It is also not good when squeezing coz it will not give you little amount.<br />* some liquid leaks too.<br /><br />This product will be good for lotion, toothpaste or shampoo/conditioner coz they have thicker consistency. But be aware that scents leaks. The reason why I gave it 3 stars is because I can\u2019t use it for the purpose I got it for (hand sanitizers)<br />If you plan to use it thicker liquids and don\u2019t mind the scent leaks then this is perfect coz the silicone material is very nice.\nBEWARE! Scent Leaks!\nRose Quartz Roller with Derma Roller 0.25mm, Facial Kit with Microneedle and Pink Jade Rollers\nLOLYSENTA\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.1 x 5.1 x 1.6 inches; 8.78 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'LS17', 'UPC': '850002524062', 'Manufacturer': 'LOLYSENTA, LLC'}\nIf you have never tried this, you will love it! I use to use the micro needle to my face and love the effects but mine got older and glad I find this set.<br />PROS<br />* nice set to gift to your friend/family<br />* micro needles are sharp and easy to roll on my face<br />* i love that the micro needle roller is packed in a sterilized bag<br />* easy to hold and glide on my face<br />* the pink jade roller rolls softly on my face. The smaller roller feels perfect on my eye areas. I love how it relaxes me. I like to put mine on the fridge for awhile so it feels colder on my skin and after I use it it feels good.<br /><br />NO CONS YET! I know this kind of stuff takes awhile before you can really see a difference on your skin. If you have never use anything like this give it at least 3 months to see a difference (6 months to really see how much your skin have improved). Make sure you read the instructions to know exactly what to do and not to do.\nLove how it feels on my face\nBirthday Gift, Yachyee hair removal device\nYachyee\n[\"What's in Yachyee Relaxing Gifts for Women:\", '--- 12 oz Rose Gold insulated stainless steel tumbler with a reusable straw and cleaning brush, with the words \"\"Beauty begins the moment you love yourself\"\". --- Flower Petal Bath Bombs, drop them into the tub to relax among the delicate aromas of vanilla and lavender petals. --- Scented Candle, made of 100% soy wax, luxurious and all-natural, can immediately turn your space into a little serene and peaceful flower garden. --- Rose Bar Soap, made with natural flower essential oil to bring you to a dreamland of lavender cloud. --- Beautiful Key Bottle Opener and heart shape Wine Bottle Stopper --- Greeting Card, you can write your special blessing to her. \ud83c\udf88 DON\\'T FORGET TO SELECT \"\"THIS ORDER CONTAINS A GIFT\"\" AT CHECKOUT TO ADD YOUR FREE PERSONALIZED MESSAGE THROUGH AMAZON.\ud83c\udf88 50th 60th 40th birthday gifts for women 30th birthday gifts for her get well soon gift basket gifts for women gift basket for women self care gifts for women sister birthday gifts from sister']\n{'Item Form': 'Variety', 'Material Feature': 'Organic Ingredients, Vegan', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'Yachyee', 'Number of Items': '4', 'Product Dimensions': '7.7 x 6.8 x 3.5 inches; 12 Ounces', 'UPC': '697478889727', 'Manufacturer': 'Yachyee'}\nThis is a nice gift set! The packaging is really nice that it looks like it is wrapped already, so if you\u2019re thinking of sending this to someone, you can skip the gift wrapping and just mail it as it is!<br />The tumbler looks exactly as advertised. The letterings are good and no smudges. The lid closes nicely and the straw fits perfectly. My only wish is the bottom of the tumbler have nonskid bottom but even without this stays in place without issues.<br />The soap, bath bombs and the candle smells really good and doesn\u2019t irritate my skin and nose.<br />The wine topper and the key is cheap looking but I guess it\u2019s the thought that counts.<br />It maybe a bit pricey, but the convenience it gives you pays for it.\nRelaxing indeed!\nOULAC Shine to Shine Velvet Matte Lipstick, Long Lasting Creamy Formula, Opaque Finish, Vegan Friendly, 3.6 grams / 0.12 ounces, Super Girl (Y04)\nOulac\n{'Brand': 'Oulac', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Finish Type': 'Matte,Velvet', 'Product Benefits': 'Long Lasting,Shine', 'Product Dimensions': '3.9 x 0.68 x 0.68 inches; 1.23 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'velvet-matte-Y04'}\nI was excited to get it and use it for my Halloween costume. The color looks nice BUT it is not exactly as advertised. The color is much lighter than what I expected and it dries my lips so bad. I only wore it for 2 hours and the color is already fading. I didn\u2019t even eat or drink and I also not like how my lips felt. I know it\u2019s matte, it\u2019s my 1st time trying a matte lipstick so not sure if that is common side effects but I\u2019m definitely not happy coz my lips are dried for a very long time I have to use lip balm to moisturize it.\nNot true to color and dries my lips so bad\nZURO Black Wig With Bangs Cosplay Short Wigs for Women Hot Pink Dark Brown Blonde Wavy Colorful Wigs for Girls Soft Cute Costume Wigs Shoulder Length Wave Bob Wigs for Women (black)\nZURO\n{'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Brand': 'ZURO', 'Package Dimensions': '10.67 x 7.72 x 2.44 inches; 8.47 Ounces'}\nThis is exactly as advertised! Looks natural, minimal shedding and the curls/wave is exactly what I wanted.<br />I needed this look for my video and pictures and this turn out really well. Easy to use and I brush it slowly to avoid shedding.<br />No funky smell and I can see myself wearing this in real life and not just for my vlog.<br />For the price, it is a very good value!\nLove it!\nGirlz Squad Foot Spa Sets for Girls Ages 7-12 with Nail Kit for Kids - DIY Manicure and Pedicure Set with Foot Care Kit Perfect for Sleepovers and Slumber Party. Helps Develop Self-Care and Creativity\nGirlz Squad\n{'Product Dimensions': '10 x 8 x 1.5 inches; 3 Pounds', 'UPC': '850026487275', 'Manufacturer': 'Girlz Squad'}\nI honestly didn\u2019t know this I battery operated when I requested this through Vine, have I known that I will not get it. The product is good and is fun to use with my niece when I have them with me.<br />The foot spa is easy to operate and makes your little girl feel extra special.<br />The items that comes with it is cute BUT the slippers are super thin/flimsy and slippery so be very careful if you plan to use them around wet areas/tile floors.<br />This uses a battery and will cost you more than the unit over time, if you use the rechargeable kind then you may not be able to use it longer (spa time wise)<br />Overall the product is good and exactly as described!\nBattery Operated! Fun but limited!\nTODAYADAY\u2019s Baby Foot Peel Mask for Dry Cracked Feet (3 Pairs) - Removes & Repairs Rough Heels - Moisturizing Feet Peeling Mask for Callus and Dead Skin\nTODAYADAY\n{'Brand': 'TODAYADAY', 'Scent': 'Fresh', 'Unit Count': '3.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '6', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Product Dimensions': '7.95 x 6.1 x 1.18 inches; 7.05 Ounces'}\nThis is a product that I\u2019m surprisingly impressed. Winter seems to be hard on my feet and I\u2019m glad I get to take care of it using this product. Application is easy. The box have illustrations as well as translated English version of the Korean wordings.<br />I have size 7.5 wide feet and I have no issues using this. I think if you have a bigger feet 10.5+ it maybe an issue.<br />The scent is a bit strong for my preference when I first open the packet BUT it gets better after I apply it.<br />It is well moisten so my feet feels good after I put it on.<br />If you have hick calluses you may need to use another one after the 1st peel.<br />Over all I\u2019m very happy with my experience and will definitely get this once my 3 packets are used.\nTakes time but it works!\nBeautiful Girl You Can Do Amazing Things, Inspirational Gifts for Women, Christmas Gifts, Amazing Gifts for Teen Girls, Beautiful Gift Makeup Bag, Inspirational Jewelry Dish, Amazing Mirror\nVeryMerryMakering\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.1 x 5.31 x 2.52 inches; 11.68 Ounces', 'Item model number': '8R-EFX1-UF4C', 'Department': 'girls', 'UPC': '733420649831', 'Manufacturer': 'VeryMerryMakering'}\nThis took more than a month to arrived but I\u2019m glad I waited.
