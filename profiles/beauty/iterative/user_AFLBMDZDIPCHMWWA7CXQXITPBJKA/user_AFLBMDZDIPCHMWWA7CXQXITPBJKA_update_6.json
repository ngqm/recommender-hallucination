This mirror comes fully assembled and is quite simple to use.  It has a touch button to turn on the light.  It has multiple magnifications.  The ability to fold it up so it takes less space is also beneficial making it easier to store or take up less space on your counter top.  The mirrors are clear without scratches or flaws.  The stand is plastic, so it may not be as durable as a mirror with a metal base or stand.  The price point does seem a little high for the quality, but my wife really likes this mirror and uses it everyday.  Overall, this is a well made mirror with great magnification.<br /><br />I hope this review is helpful!\nReview Title: Works well\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Portable Travel Bottles Set, 3oz Silicone Travel Size Toiletries Containers, Leakproof, Foldable, Squeezable, Refillable, TSA Carry On for Shampoo Lotion Soap cosmetic (Pack of 2)\nINNERNEED\n{'Brand': 'INNERNEED', 'Capacity': '3 Ounces', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Care Instructions': 'Hand Wash Only', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Travel', 'Package Dimensions': '7 x 6.7 x 1.2 inches; 3.99 Ounces'}\nI ordered the 'Portable Travel Bottles Set, 3oz Leakproof Foldable Squeezable Silicone Travel Size Toiletries Containers, TSA Carry On for Shampoo Lotion Soap (Pack of 2)' for review. My daughter has her favorite hair products that she has to pack when we travel and it's never fun packing those large bottles and other travel containers are just to small and or hard to fill. This set is so nice with the wide mouth openings which make them easy to fill and as you use the product, up they collapse to take up less space plus make it much easier to get every last drop of that precious product out haha. We have tried other compact TSA approved toiletry containers and I will say that these are so much more functional than the others, and most definitely of greater value.\nGreat for traveling with your favorite product.\nVeta \u2013 Lash and Eyebrow Serum \u2013 2-in-1 Lash & Brow Pen \u2013 Produces Longer, Healthier, Denser Lashes and Thicker Brows \u2013 Eyelash Serum \u2013 Boosts Skin Collagen \u2013 Drug-Free Formula - 1 fl oz.\nVeta\n{'Color': 'Silver, Black', 'Brand': 'Veta', 'Item Form': 'lotion', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Package Information': 'Tube', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.2 x 1.61 x 1.57 inches; 1.13 Ounces', 'UPC': '861121002645'}\nI ordered this Veta \u2013 Lash and Eyebrow Serum \u2013 2-in-1 Lash & Brow Pen for review.  My teenage daughter was willing to try it out for me and these are her thoughts.  \"The pen application is not difficult.  However, if you accidentally get it in your eyes it stings really badly.  I had used it a couple of times before that happened. But, now I don't want to use it again.\"<br /> Unfortunately she did not use it long enough to see if there was any lash growth.  If my wife is brave enough to try it I will update my review.\nStings your eyes\nBeast Blue Beard Oil with Organic Argan & Jojoba Oils, 1 fl oz\nTame the Beast\n{'Liquid Volume': '1 Fluid Ounces', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Brand': 'Tame the Beast', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Unit Count': '1 FL OZ', 'Package Dimensions': '7.05 x 3.54 x 1.54 inches; 2.89 Ounces', 'UPC': '817662018546'}\nI ordered the 'Beast Blue Beard Oil with Organic Argan & Jojoba Oils, 1 fl oz' for review.<br />I love to try different beard oils. This one is a medium weight oil that initially smells very lightly scented. It's a very \"cologne\" type scent which I really don't care for. I am more into the woodsy, tea tree, sandalwood type scents. At first smell, this beard oil had a very light scent however once applied, this scent lasts a very long time. This is where I had a hard time with it. I like to put my beard oil on in the morning and night after brushing my teeth and I was still able to smell this beard oil into the next morning, which might have been a good thing had I enjoyed the scent. The beard oil itself as I said earlier, is a medium weight, and has a decent hold and is actually a nice overall beard oil but I ended up giving it to my son, as I personally didn't like the scent at all.\nNice quality but the cologne scent is not my favorite.\nBoar Bristle Hair Brush with Nylon Pins for Thick Curly Long Wet Hair - Anti Static Brush Oval - Wooden Paddle\nWillkem accessories\n{'Brand': 'Willkem accessories', 'Shape': 'Oval', 'Handle Material': 'Wood', 'Special Feature': 'Ionic', 'Product Benefits': 'Detangle', 'Product Dimensions': '8.86 x 2.36 x 1.46 inches; 2.82 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Willkem'}\nI ordered a \u2018Boar Bristle Hair Brush with Nylon Pins for Thick Curly Long Wet Hair - Anti Static Brush Oval - Wooden Paddle\u2019 for review.  My wife has curly hair that can be difficult to tame.  When this brush arrived, my younger daughter who has very long curly hair wanted to try it out.  When she brushed through her hair, she felt it reduced the static and made her hair feel softer.  So much so that my wife never got the chance to use as my daughter claimed it as hers.  The brush handle is made with a thick, durable feeling wood.  The bristles are much more durable and pull through the hair better than those with plastic or silicone bristles.  Overall, this is a nicely made brush, that works well, and worth its price point.\nNicely made brush\nNative Deodorant - Natural Deodorant For Women and Men - 3 Pack - Aluminum Free, Free of Parabens and Sulfates - Vegan, Contains Probiotics - Linen & Cotton Flower, Peony & Jasmine Tea, Sweet Almond & Honey\nNative\n{'Brand': 'Native', 'Item Form': 'Balm', 'Scent': 'Jasmine', 'Number of Items': '3', 'Unit Count': '7.95 Ounce', 'Package Dimensions': '8.4 x 6.7 x 1.6 inches; 15.2 Ounces', 'UPC': '812154032857'}\nI ordered 'Native Deodorant - Natural Deodorant - 3 Pack Seasonal' for review.  this set comes with three different scents  Each scent is light and not overpowering.  The deodorant is soft and goes on smoothly.  My wife, who has to use an extra strength deodorant has been pleased with the odor control.  Her sensitive skin has no issues with this deodorant.  Overall a great natural product.<br /><br />I hope this review was helpful!\nWorks well to control odor\nPadgene Makeup Vanity Mirror with Lights,1x 2X 3X 5X 7X Magnification 360\u00b0Adjustable Rotation 4-Fold 34 LED Lighted Mirror with Touch Screen,Stand Height & Brightness Adjustable (White)\nPadgene\n{'Package Dimensions': '15.87 x 9.29 x 4.88 inches; 2.66 Pounds'}\nI ordered the 'Padgene Makeup Vanity Mirror with Lights,1x 2X 3X 5X 7X Magnification 360\u00b0Adjustable Rotation 4-Fold 34 LED Lighted Mirror with Touch Screen,Stand Height & Brightness Adjustable (White)' for review.
