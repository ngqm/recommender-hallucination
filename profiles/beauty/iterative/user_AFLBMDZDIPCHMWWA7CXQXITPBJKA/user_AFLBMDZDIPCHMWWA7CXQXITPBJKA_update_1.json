My daughter has her favorite hair products that she has to pack when we travel and it's never fun packing those large bottles and other travel containers are just to small and or hard to fill. This set is so nice with the wide mouth openings which make them easy to fill and as you use the product, up they collapse to take up less space plus make it much easier to get every last drop of that precious product out haha. We have tried other compact TSA approved toiletry containers and I will say that these are so much more functional than the others, and most definitely of greater value.\nReview Title: Great for traveling with your favorite product.\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
