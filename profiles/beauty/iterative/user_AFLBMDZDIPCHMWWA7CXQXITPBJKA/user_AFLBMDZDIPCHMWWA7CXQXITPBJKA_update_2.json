  "reference_summary": "Portable Travel Bottles Set, 3oz Silicone Travel Size Toiletries Containers, Leakproof, Foldable, Squeezable, Refillable, TSA Carry On for Shampoo Lotion Soap cosmetic (Pack of 2)\nINNERNEED\n{'Brand': 'INNERNEED', 'Capacity': '3 Ounces', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Care Instructions': 'Hand Wash Only', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Travel', 'Package Dimensions': '7 x 6.7 x 1.2 inches; 3.99 Ounces'}\nI ordered the 'Portable Travel Bottles Set, 3oz Leakproof Foldable Squeezable Silicone Travel Size Toiletries Containers, TSA Carry On for Shampoo Lotion Soap (Pack of 2)' for review. My daughter has her favorite hair products that she has to pack when we travel and it's never fun packing those large bottles and other travel containers are just to small and or hard to fill. This set is so nice with the wide mouth openings which make them easy to fill and as you use the product, up they collapse to take up less space plus make it much easier to get every last drop of that precious product out haha. We have tried other compact TSA approved toiletry containers and I will say that these are so much more functional than the others, and most definitely of greater value.\nGreat for traveling with your favorite product.\nVeta \u2013 Lash and Eyebrow Serum \u2013 2-in-1 Lash & Brow Pen \u2013 Produces Longer, Healthier, Denser Lashes and Thicker Brows \u2013 Eyelash Serum \u2013 Boosts Skin Collagen \u2013 Drug-Free Formula - 1 fl oz.\nVeta\n{'Color': 'Silver, Black', 'Brand': 'Veta', 'Item Form': 'lotion', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Package Information': 'Tube', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.2 x 1.61 x 1.57 inches; 1.13 Ounces', 'UPC': '861121002645'}\nI ordered this Veta \u2013 Lash and Eyebrow Serum \u2013 2-in-1 Lash & Brow Pen for review.
