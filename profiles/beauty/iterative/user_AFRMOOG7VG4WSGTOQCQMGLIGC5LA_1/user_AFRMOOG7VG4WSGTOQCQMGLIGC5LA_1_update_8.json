And this is basically it with this kit.  There may be one set that had some extra fluff to them,  but that's it.  The length of the glue tube is nice,  it's long and the brush is thick, but not to thick.  They go on easy and come off well.  No issues so far\nReview Title: Love the lengths offered\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
