He has very long hair, and he works manual labor. Every morning, I slick his hair back in a braid. It is important I use nice hair elastics, so the braid stays on all day. I have tried ones from a local dollar store that weren\u2019t very sturdy; they kept breaking off during the day.<br />I decided to give these a try. I am impressed by the quality. The elastics are sturdy. The elastic stayed put in his hair for 24 hours through work and sleep.<br />This product comes with a lot of hair bands! It comes with a convenient and cute little pouch to store the bands in. The pouch has a bird on a floaty and says \u201cI can\u2019t swim\u201d\nReview Title: Nice sturdy elastics in fun colors\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I don\u2019t stream or use the microphone much. I mostly wanted these for the headphones for sound.<br /><br />I think they are great for what I needed. I\u2019m not sure if I would recommend them for serious gamers/streamers.<br /><br />The cups are very big on the ears, but it feels very comfortable. You can control volume on the cord, which is nice.<br /><br />I feel like they are a good value for the price.\nGood value for the price\nlilah b. - Bronzed Beauty Bronzer Duo - b. sunkissed - Multipurpose Bronzer Duo to Highlight + Contour and Blend\nLILAH B\n{'Brand': 'LILAH B', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Style': 'Compact', 'Package Dimensions': '3.8 x 3.5 x 1 inches; 0.32 Ounces', 'UPC': '851078006100'}\nThe best part of this bronzer duo is the packaging. The container holding the bronzer and highlighter is very heavy. It is either made of ceramic or metal. It took me a minute to figure out how to open the compartment. The top part slides to the right to show the bronzer/highlight duo.<br /><br />The bronzer does a good job. It goes on my skin very smoothly. It is a naturally bronze color. This shade is for light shaded skin tones. I don\u2019t think the bronzer is dark enough for medium/dark skin tones.<br /><br />The highlight isn\u2019t shimmery enough for me. In the picture I posted with this review, I used the bronzer from this product and a different highlight.<br /><br />The bronzer and packaging were a hit for me, but the highlighter was a miss. I am not sure if I feel the quality is worth the price. If it was a lower, price I would think of ordering again.\nNice bronzer and packaging\nOLEWELL Valentine's Day Mini Rubber Bands Soft Elastic Bands for Kids Hair Non-slip Rubber Hair Bands Soft Hair Elastics Ties Bands Braids Hair for Girls - STRONG - REUSEABLE (Total 1 Pack, Pack of 1000, BlackColorful1000)\nOLEWELL\n{'Material': 'Rubber', 'Item Form': 'Elastic', 'Brand': 'OLEWELL', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Number of Pieces': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '8 x 5.02 x 0.8 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'SML'}\nI use little hair bands like these every day for my husband\u2019s hair.
