Here are my pros and cons.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-The BB cream is moisturizing. I have super dry skin, and it felt replenishing.<br />-This cream provided great coverage despite it being a thinner consistency.<br />-I put it on my face to even skin tone on \u201cno make up days\u201d and I also use it with my normal make up routine.<br />-The price is very fair for the quality.<br />-This cream has high SPF, so it is perfect for summer days.

I don\u2019t stream or use the microphone much. I mostly wanted these for the headphones for sound.<br /><br />I think they are great for what I needed. I\u2019m not sure if I would recommend them for serious gamers/streamers.<br /><br />The cups are very big on the ears, but it feels very comfortable. You can control volume on the cord, which is nice.<br /><br />I feel like they are a good value for the price.\nGood value for the price\nlilah b. - Bronzed Beauty Bronzer Duo - b. sunkissed - Multipurpose Bronzer Duo to Highlight + Contour and Blend\nLILAH B\n{'Brand': 'LILAH B', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Style': 'Compact', 'Package Dimensions': '3.8 x 3.5 x 1 inches; 0.32 Ounces', 'UPC': '851078006100'}\nThe best part of this bronzer duo is the packaging. The container holding the bronzer and highlighter is very heavy. It is either made of ceramic or metal. It took me a minute to figure out how to open the compartment. The top part slides to the right to show the bronzer/highlight duo.<br /><br />The bronzer does a good job. It goes on my skin very smoothly. It is a naturally bronze color. This shade is for light shaded skin tones. I don\u2019t think the bronzer is dark enough for medium/dark skin tones.<br /><br />The highlight isn\u2019t shimmery enough for me. In the picture I posted with this review, I used the bronzer from this product and a different highlight.<br /><br />The bronzer and packaging were a hit for me, but the highlighter was a miss. I am not sure if I feel the quality is worth the price. If it was a lower, price I would think of ordering again.\nNice bronzer and packaging\nOLEWELL Valentine's Day Mini Rubber Bands Soft Elastic Bands for Kids Hair Non-slip Rubber Hair Bands Soft Hair Elastics Ties Bands Braids Hair for Girls - STRONG - REUSEABLE (Total 1 Pack, Pack of 1000, BlackColorful1000)\nOLEWELL\n{'Material': 'Rubber', 'Item Form': 'Elastic', 'Brand': 'OLEWELL', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Number of Pieces': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '8 x 5.02 x 0.8 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'SML'}\nI use little hair bands like these every day for my husband\u2019s hair. He has very long hair, and he works manual labor. Every morning, I slick his hair back in a braid. It is important I use nice hair elastics, so the braid stays on all day. I have tried ones from a local dollar store that weren\u2019t very sturdy; they kept breaking off during the day.<br />I decided to give these a try. I am impressed by the quality. The elastics are sturdy. The elastic stayed put in his hair for 24 hours through work and sleep.<br />This product comes with a lot of hair bands! It comes with a convenient and cute little pouch to store the bands in. The pouch has a bird on a floaty and says \u201cI can\u2019t swim\u201d\nNice sturdy elastics in fun colors\nLAPCOS Good Morning Fresh Quick Masks (30 Count) Daily Sheet Masks for Beauty & Skin Care - Hydrating and Moisturizing Korean Face Mask with Witch Hazel, Aloe Vera & Cucumber\nLAPCOS\n{'Brand': 'LAPCOS', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Moisturizing', 'Scent': 'Cucumber', 'Skin Type': 'Normal', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5 x 4 x 3 inches; 1 Pounds', 'UPC': '818929024478'}\nDid you skip your skin case routine before bed? Did you then proceed to wake up too late to do it in the morning? Look no further for your solution!<br />I really enjoy these quick morning masks. Sometimes my face needs refreshing before I put my makeup on in the morning, but I rarely wake up early enough to wait for a 15-20 min mask to set in. This mask is perfect, because you only need 5 minutes. I put mine on and I make my coffee and feed my cats. By the time I\u2019m done with that, it\u2019s about time to take off the mask and start getting ready.<br />The mask moisturized and refreshed my skin. My face felt ready to put my makeup on. It didn\u2019t make my face too oily for my makeup or anything. My makeup set in nicely.<br />The packaging is nice. It is similar to a tissue box. There are little tweezers to help you grab out a mask.<br />I have tried some other types of masks from this brand, and this is my favorite I have tried from Lapcos. I would use this product again.\nQuick morning mask!\nCaudalie Vinosource SOS Intense Hydration Set: Hydrating Trio for Sensitive Skin including a Daily Foam Cleanser, Hydrating Serum, Facial Moisturizer\n{'Package Dimensions': '6.93 x 5.35 x 2.64 inches; 14.5 Ounces'}\nPerfect gift for your skin-care loving friend!<br />I have loved this skin care set. I have been using all 3 products almost every day for the past 3 weeks. The gift/value set comes with a instant-foaming face wash, serum, and face moisturizer. This is my first time trying this brand, and I am very impressed.<br /><br />The instant-foaming face wash:<br />I have never tried an instant-foaming wash before. It still produced a nice lather on my face. It is great for a daily moisturizer, but I still like to use an exfoliant every few days.<br /><br />The serum:<br />The serum had a more creamy texture. It soaked into my skin quick. It created a nice based for the moisturizer.<br /><br />The moisturizer:<br />The moisturizer was thick and creamy. I have VERY dry skin, and my skin soaked it right up. It felt really nice on my skin. My skin stayed moisturized throughout the day after using in the morning.<br /><br />None of the products irritated my skin. I have dry skin with some rosacea. All products had a similar light floral scent. The sizes are great. I still have plenty of product after using a few weeks.<br /><br />I recommend this set! The packaging is nice and aesthetically pleasing. It is readily giftable.\nPerfect gift for skin-care lovers!\nCOSMOCOS FromNature Perfect Cover BB Cream - Light Beighe/Natural Beige SPF 50+ / PA+++ Sun Protection, Natural Skin Tone, High Coverage Korean Cosmetic K Beauty - 50g (1.76 fl oz) (Natural Beige)\nCOSMOCOS\n{'Brand': 'COSMOCOS', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '1.72 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Use for': 'Skin', 'Product Dimensions': '6 x 1.5 x 1 inches; 2.89 Ounces', 'UPC': '364597179557'}\nOverall, I do really like this BB cream.
