Especially for the price point!  There were very similar items for twice as much, but I'm so glad I chose to purchase this one for our bathroom.  My husband is starting to get more gray in his beard than not, and has been having trouble seeing it all while shaving.  I got this for him (and for myself, but don't tell him) and he has been thrilled with it.  The three lighting choices are gorgeous and very useful, as is the 10x magnification side of the swivel mirror head.  I'm thinking of getting one for my mom and sister, as well.  Great buy!\nExactly as promised!  Love it!\nBenton Aloe Propolis Soothing Gel & Benton Cleansing Foam with 2 Benton Masks ( Bundle )\nMUDSHI\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.85 x 3.94 x 2.2 inches; 11.22 Ounces', 'UPC': '608119365302'}\nThis kit is a great deal!  I've been a devoted user of Korean skin care products.  For a while, I have preferred, out of several brands and types of sheet mask, the Benton Bee and Snail sheet mask.  Fantastic product!!!!  Firms, smooths, soothes.  It's great.  However, that's not why I purchased this set.  I have combo skin that leans towards oily in the heat.  Super oily T-zone.  After doing a ton of research, I decided to give the Benton Aloe Gel moisturizer a try.  I'd also heard great things about this foam cleanser.  I'm really enjoying the cleanser so far.  I wet my hands and face, use only a pea sized amount, rub my hands together to create the foam (not a soapy lather, but a thick and creamy foam), and work over my face.  I do this after oil cleansing.  This does a great job of picking up any oil residue and dirt, while leaving my face soft and refreshed.  Never tight and dry, which is the sign of an awful cleanser.  The gel moisturizer is okay.  Just okay.  I don't get as oily as I did with lotion moisturizers, which is great.  However, I don't have that supple, smooth feel that I'm used to and prefer.  I've actually noticed flaking around my nose, which is something I never dealt with after moisturizing.  A pea sized amount covers my entire face, it leaves a slightly tacky finish until absorbed ( I always let each of my products absorb for around 90 seconds before applying the next step), and is completely colorless.  Will I repurchase?  No, but I do suggest that you give this a try if your research and needs point you this direction.  Everyone's skin care needs can vary on several levels.  There are universal musts for good skin health, like cleansing daily, moisturizing, and using a good sunscreen.  There a a ton a variations of those products, though.  Finding the right routine and products can be a trial and error process.  The main thing is to stick to it.  The results are worth it!\nWorth a try!\n[Leaders Labotica] Argan Oil Deep Cleansing Tissue 50Ct 1 Pk (Makeup Remover Cleansing Towelettes & Wipes)\nLeaders Insolution\n{'Brand': 'Leaders Insolution', 'Unit Count': '50.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Item Form': 'Wipes', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '4.25 x 8.5 x 1.5 inches; 13.44 Ounces'}\nThese are good for those late nights when you\u2019re too exhausted to do your whole routine, although I HIGHLY recommend doing a quick double cleansing regardless.  They seem to remove dirt but don\u2019t work well for removing oil-based makeup.  Make sure to understand that this has to be rinsed off, or you\u2019re falling asleep with soap on your face.  I won\u2019t be repurchasing.\nMeh product...\nMARMARA Premium Stitched Cotton Rounds (540 Count) | 100% All-Natural Cotton Pads for Face Care & Makeup Removal\nMARMARA Essentials\n{'Brand': 'MARMARA Essentials', 'Shape': 'Round', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Unit Count': '540.00 Count', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '13.6 x 10.1 x 2.6 inches; 2.1 Pounds', 'UPC': '868670000467'}\nThese are great cotton rounds!  I used to get the CVS 360 brand but they were getting expensive because I used a few each day.  Luckily, I found this huge pack of awesome rounds.  They are super soft but not so soft that they don't hold up when wet.  They are fantastic when you don't want to waste product because they absorb just the right amount and actually extend the life of my products.  The price is low and the amount of cotton rounds in this big pack can't be beat!\nYou can't beat this price!\nUV Light for Nails,LKE Curing Lamp for Gel Nail Polish 54W UV Led Light Gel Nail Starter Kit Nail Dryer Accessories\nLKE\n{'Brand': 'LKE', 'Light Source Type': 'LED', 'Number of Light Sources': '2', 'Wattage': '54 watts', 'Control Method': 'App', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '9.45 x 8.7 x 5.08 inches; 2 Pounds', 'Batteries': '1 Lithium Ion batteries required.'}\nI really enjoy this UV lamp.
