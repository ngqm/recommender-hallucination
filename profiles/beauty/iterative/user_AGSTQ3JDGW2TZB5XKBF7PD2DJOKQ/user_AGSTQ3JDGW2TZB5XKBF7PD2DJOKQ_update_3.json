Especially for the price point!  There were very similar items for twice as much, but I'm so glad I chose to purchase this one for our bathroom.  My husband is starting to get more gray in his beard than not, and has been having trouble seeing it all while shaving.  I got this for him (and for myself, but don't tell him) and he has been thrilled with it.  The three lighting choices are gorgeous and very useful, as is the 10x magnification side of the swivel mirror head.  I'm thinking of getting one for my mom and sister, as well.  Great buy!\nExactly as promised!  Love it!\nBenton Aloe Propolis Soothing Gel & Benton Cleansing Foam with 2 Benton Masks ( Bundle )\nMUDSHI\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.85 x 3.94 x 2.2 inches; 11.22 Ounces', 'UPC': '608119365302'}\nThis kit is a great deal!  I've been a devoted user of Korean skin care products.  For a while, I have preferred, out of several brands and types of sheet mask, the Benton Bee and Snail sheet mask.  Fantastic product!!!!  Firms, smooths, soothes.  It's great.  However, that's not why I purchased this set.  I have combo skin that leans towards oily in the heat.  Super oily T-zone.  After doing a ton of research, I decided to give the Benton Aloe Gel moisturizer a try.  I'd also heard great things about this foam cleanser.  I'm really enjoying the cleanser so far.  I wet my hands and face, use only a pea sized amount, rub my hands together to create the foam (not a soapy lather, but a thick and creamy foam), and work over my face.  I do this after oil cleansing.  This does a great job of picking up any oil residue and dirt, while leaving my face soft and refreshed.  Never tight and dry, which is the sign of an awful cleanser.  The gel moisturizer is okay.  Just okay.  I don't get as oily as I did with lotion moisturizers, which is great.  However, I don't have that supple, smooth feel that I'm used to and prefer.  I've actually noticed flaking around my nose, which is something I never dealt with after moisturizing.  A pea sized amount covers my entire face, it leaves a slightly tacky finish until absorbed ( I always let each of my products absorb for around 90 seconds before applying the next step), and is completely colorless.  Will I repurchase?  No, but I do suggest that you give this a try if your research and needs point you this direction.  Everyone's skin care needs can vary on several levels.  There are universal musts for good skin health, like cleansing daily, moisturizing, and using a good sunscreen.  There a a ton a variations of those products, though.  Finding the right routine and products can be a trial and error process.  The main thing is to stick to it.  The results are worth it!\nWorth a try!\n[Leaders Labotica] Argan Oil Deep Cleansing Tissue 50Ct 1 Pk (Makeup Remover Cleansing Towelettes & Wipes)\nLeaders Insolution\n{'Brand': 'Leaders Insolution', 'Unit Count': '50.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Item Form': 'Wipes', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '4.25 x 8.5 x 1.5 inches; 13.44 Ounces'}\nThese are good for those late nights when you\u2019re too exhausted to do your whole routine, although I HIGHLY recommend doing a quick double cleansing regardless.
