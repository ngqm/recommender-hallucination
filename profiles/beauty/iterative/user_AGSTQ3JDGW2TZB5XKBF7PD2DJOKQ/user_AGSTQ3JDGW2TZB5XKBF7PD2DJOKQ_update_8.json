It looks sleek and pretty but does it actually work?  My answer to that question is a resounding YES.  You wouldn't think a little buzzing device could make your skincare products do their best job but boy, oh, boy does it ever.  The three settings are for Cleansing (also used for extractions), Moisturizing, and Lifting.  Each setting causes the device to vibrate at different speeds and achieve different goals.  Using it is fairly easy.  Hold the button until you hear it turn on and then give the button a quick press to choose between functions.  There are lights above each mode and they will light up when you are on said mode.  The included instructions are very easy to follow and explain how to use it in a simple way.  It's all about keeping very light pressure, while holding the side bars, which add the effective charge to the device, allowing the ionization process to take place.  I have seen a difference in my skin already and I have only used it in each mode 3-4 times.  It could be easy to overdo it after seeing the results you do, but the instructions specifically advice you on how often each function should be used so the skin isn't having reverse effects from what you want it to.  I think the price for this item is fantastic!  I have a reduction in blackheads, my skin seems to glow after use, and my products are sinking into my skin better and faster.

Especially for the price point!  There were very similar items for twice as much, but I'm so glad I chose to purchase this one for our bathroom.  My husband is starting to get more gray in his beard than not, and has been having trouble seeing it all while shaving.  I got this for him (and for myself, but don't tell him) and he has been thrilled with it.  The three lighting choices are gorgeous and very useful, as is the 10x magnification side of the swivel mirror head.  I'm thinking of getting one for my mom and sister, as well.  Great buy!\nExactly as promised!  Love it!\nBenton Aloe Propolis Soothing Gel & Benton Cleansing Foam with 2 Benton Masks ( Bundle )\nMUDSHI\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.85 x 3.94 x 2.2 inches; 11.22 Ounces', 'UPC': '608119365302'}\nThis kit is a great deal!  I've been a devoted user of Korean skin care products.  For a while, I have preferred, out of several brands and types of sheet mask, the Benton Bee and Snail sheet mask.  Fantastic product!!!!  Firms, smooths, soothes.  It's great.  However, that's not why I purchased this set.  I have combo skin that leans towards oily in the heat.  Super oily T-zone.  After doing a ton of research, I decided to give the Benton Aloe Gel moisturizer a try.  I'd also heard great things about this foam cleanser.  I'm really enjoying the cleanser so far.  I wet my hands and face, use only a pea sized amount, rub my hands together to create the foam (not a soapy lather, but a thick and creamy foam), and work over my face.  I do this after oil cleansing.  This does a great job of picking up any oil residue and dirt, while leaving my face soft and refreshed.  Never tight and dry, which is the sign of an awful cleanser.  The gel moisturizer is okay.  Just okay.  I don't get as oily as I did with lotion moisturizers, which is great.  However, I don't have that supple, smooth feel that I'm used to and prefer.  I've actually noticed flaking around my nose, which is something I never dealt with after moisturizing.  A pea sized amount covers my entire face, it leaves a slightly tacky finish until absorbed ( I always let each of my products absorb for around 90 seconds before applying the next step), and is completely colorless.  Will I repurchase?  No, but I do suggest that you give this a try if your research and needs point you this direction.  Everyone's skin care needs can vary on several levels.  There are universal musts for good skin health, like cleansing daily, moisturizing, and using a good sunscreen.  There a a ton a variations of those products, though.  Finding the right routine and products can be a trial and error process.  The main thing is to stick to it.  The results are worth it!\nWorth a try!\n[Leaders Labotica] Argan Oil Deep Cleansing Tissue 50Ct 1 Pk (Makeup Remover Cleansing Towelettes & Wipes)\nLeaders Insolution\n{'Brand': 'Leaders Insolution', 'Unit Count': '50.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Item Form': 'Wipes', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '4.25 x 8.5 x 1.5 inches; 13.44 Ounces'}\nThese are good for those late nights when you\u2019re too exhausted to do your whole routine, although I HIGHLY recommend doing a quick double cleansing regardless.  They seem to remove dirt but don\u2019t work well for removing oil-based makeup.  Make sure to understand that this has to be rinsed off, or you\u2019re falling asleep with soap on your face.  I won\u2019t be repurchasing.\nMeh product...\nMARMARA Premium Stitched Cotton Rounds (540 Count) | 100% All-Natural Cotton Pads for Face Care & Makeup Removal\nMARMARA Essentials\n{'Brand': 'MARMARA Essentials', 'Shape': 'Round', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Unit Count': '540.00 Count', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '13.6 x 10.1 x 2.6 inches; 2.1 Pounds', 'UPC': '868670000467'}\nThese are great cotton rounds!  I used to get the CVS 360 brand but they were getting expensive because I used a few each day.  Luckily, I found this huge pack of awesome rounds.  They are super soft but not so soft that they don't hold up when wet.  They are fantastic when you don't want to waste product because they absorb just the right amount and actually extend the life of my products.  The price is low and the amount of cotton rounds in this big pack can't be beat!\nYou can't beat this price!\nUV Light for Nails,LKE Curing Lamp for Gel Nail Polish 54W UV Led Light Gel Nail Starter Kit Nail Dryer Accessories\nLKE\n{'Brand': 'LKE', 'Light Source Type': 'LED', 'Number of Light Sources': '2', 'Wattage': '54 watts', 'Control Method': 'App', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '9.45 x 8.7 x 5.08 inches; 2 Pounds', 'Batteries': '1 Lithium Ion batteries required.'}\nI really enjoy this UV lamp.  It's sleek design and concept make it easy to use.  I like the buttons designated for each separate drying time and the LED display is easy to read and understand.  It works like a champ and does a great job!  I truly think this lamp is worth the price, and I think you'll like it as much as I do.\nGreat lamp!\nELEVEN EVER Electric Nail Drill, Professional Portable Nail File Drill Grinder Manicure Pedicure Tools for Polishing, Sanding, Removing Gel and Acrylic Nails (silver) \u2026 (silver) (ND-02black)\nELEVEN EVER\n{'Brand': 'ELEVEN EVER', 'Material': 'Aluminum', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Maximum Rotational Speed': '30000 RPM', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '9.17 x 6.22 x 2.91 inches; 1.06 Pounds', 'UPC': '722943850534'}\nI've always wanted to get into the art of doing my own acrylics so when I saw this drill set, I knew I had to review it.  Firstly, it comes with numerous accessories- a fluffy brush for removing dust from the nail and work area, a set of to separaters for painting, a nail board, and the drill bits themselves.  The entire set is nicely packaged and comes nestled in a velvety foam materials.  The bits are held in their own clear container within the box.  The set comes with a detachable adapter that plugs into the end of the drill and then into the wall outlet.  The drill itself is small enough to handle pretty easily, although I can see where it would be difficult for someone with smaller hands than myself (I have large hands.)  Inserting and removing the bits can be a challenge.  The mechanism isn't well made so I have to fight with it.  The power cord is much too short and I had to use an extension cord to give myself some wiggle room away from the wall outlet.  Some of the bits' textures do a better job than the others, while some don't do anything at all.  The over all look and feel of the set isn't worth the price, in my opinion.  It works a bit too awkwardly to be something I'd use that often.\nI'm not sure this is worth the price asked...\nThe Beachwaver Co. Dual Voltage, S1, White\n{'Product Benefits': 'This ceramic, rotating curling iron provides easy, quality waves in minutes!', 'Shape': 'Barrel', 'Brand': 'The Beachwaver Co.', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Material': 'Ceramic', 'Product Dimensions': '15.75 x 1.75 x 2 inches; 14.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': '1', 'UPC': '817741020613', 'Manufacturer': 'AmazonUs/SB10T', 'Country of Origin': 'China'}\nI'm someone with extremely thick and stick straight hair.  My hair loses curl within an hour of me fixing it.  I've tried other rotating curling irons and haven't had much success with them, so I didn't have very high expectations for this beach waver.  I have been pleasantly surprised.  Once I got the hang of it, I found it to be pretty easy to use.  It features buttons that allow you to chooses which direction you would like to curl each section of hair, and a Home button that after each use, and after the previous section of hair is no longer attached, allows the barrel to return to a neutral starting point.  I ran into an issue the first few times I used it, which was accidentally hitting the home button while my hair was still around the barrel.  This caused the hair to get very tight and the barrel to press up against the scalp.  This is very easy to do and I definitely think a design change should take place to correct this issue.  The barrel is long enough for my medium-long hair and I can see it needing to be used more than once up and down the length of long hair.  The curling iron gets up to 410 degrees max, which works pretty well on my thick hair.  I've tried fixing my hair in different ways after using it, to see which method holds the curls longer.  I still have an issue with my hair losing the curls a bit to quickly but it's remedied by using styling products before and after curling it.  To be honest, I think this beach waver is very overpriced.  Maybe the results would be better for someone with thinner hair but I don't think I'd pay more than $50 for this curling iron.  Nice results, but the design flaws make this a product I won't reach for that often.\nCool once you get the hang of it....but the price...\nUltrasonic Skin Scrubber aka Facial Spatula by YOOVE | Face & Body Exfoliator Scrub, Comedone Extractor & Blackhead Remover | 2019 Premium Beauty Tool\nYoove\n{'Package Dimensions': '8.2 x 3.8 x 1.9 inches; 8.78 Ounces', 'Batteries': '1 Lithium Ion batteries required.
