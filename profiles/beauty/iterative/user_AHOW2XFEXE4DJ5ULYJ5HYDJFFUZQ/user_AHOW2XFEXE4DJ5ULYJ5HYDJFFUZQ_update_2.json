A base, 2 thin coats, and a topcoat. UV light and was perfect. The bottles are small and come in 6 colors.  I think it would be good for the girl that has a kit already started or a shop. Great stocking stuffer. Oh, I didn't pick up on the \"light\" pine scent.  I'd order again.\nReview Title: beautiful colors\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Beuaty Star 3PCS Poly Nail Gel Kit 30ml, Extension Gel Trial Kit Nail Enhancement Builder Gel Professional Nail Gel All-in One with with Base Top Coat\nBeauty Star\n{'Brand': 'Beauty Star', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Unit Count': '144.0 Ounce', 'Package Dimensions': '10.7 x 9.2 x 1.7 inches; 1.15 Pounds'}\nThe product took a bit of extra time to finally get to me. In general, together is a good set.  A couple of things annoyed me. First, the nails - the poly forms, were fine but the case they're in not numbered and the nail themselves are numbered but so tiny it's very hard to make out. Also, the container be VERY careful it doesn't close well if dropped with the way their numbered it was hard to put them back in their home slots. The poly gel- very very tacky, I get it supposed to be but it made it a bit messy from the tube to the spatula, to the nail. The company did warm about the gel in the turn and working with it in cooler temperatures.  In the few kits I've received from the Vine program it was the only one with a tool/brush so yay!! overall a good product and kit to use.\ngood for beginners\nPine Gel Nail Polish Set 6 Colors Purple Blue Cat Eye Glitter Gel Polish 7.5 ml Soak Off UV LED Cure Home Salon Manicure\npine\n{'Brand': 'Pine', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '9.524 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '6', 'Liquid Volume': '0.25 Fluid Ounces', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '4.84 x 2.87 x 3.58 inches', 'Product Dimensions': '4.84 x 2.87 x 3.58 inches; 9.77 Ounces', 'UPC': '738628890955'}\nI used the darker cat's eye recently on a family member's hands, she loved it.
