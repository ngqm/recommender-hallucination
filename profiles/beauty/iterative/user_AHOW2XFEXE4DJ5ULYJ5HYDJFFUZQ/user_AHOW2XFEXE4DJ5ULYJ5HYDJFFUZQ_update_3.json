In general, together is a good set.  A couple of things annoyed me. First, the nails - the poly forms, were fine but the case they're in not numbered and the nail themselves are numbered but so tiny it's very hard to make out. Also, the container be VERY careful it doesn't close well if dropped with the way their numbered it was hard to put them back in their home slots. The poly gel- very very tacky, I get it supposed to be but it made it a bit messy from the tube to the spatula, to the nail. The company did warm about the gel in the turn and working with it in cooler temperatures.  In the few kits I've received from the Vine program it was the only one with a tool/brush so yay!! overall a good product and kit to use.\ngood for beginners\nPine Gel Nail Polish Set 6 Colors Purple Blue Cat Eye Glitter Gel Polish 7.5 ml Soak Off UV LED Cure Home Salon Manicure\npine\n{'Brand': 'Pine', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '9.524 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '6', 'Liquid Volume': '0.25 Fluid Ounces', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '4.84 x 2.87 x 3.58 inches', 'Product Dimensions': '4.84 x 2.87 x 3.58 inches; 9.77 Ounces', 'UPC': '738628890955'}\nI used the darker cat's eye recently on a family member's hands, she loved it. A base, 2 thin coats, and a topcoat. UV light and was perfect. The bottles are small and come in 6 colors.  I think it would be good for the girl that has a kit already started or a shop. Great stocking stuffer. Oh, I didn't pick up on the \"light\" pine scent.  I'd order again.\nbeautiful colors\nBELLA MODA Sponges Blender Puff for Powder, Liquid and Cream Makeup 4PCS Purple Beauty Blending Sponge Foundations Powders Wet and Dry Used\nBELLA MODA\n{'Brand': 'BELLA MODA', 'Color': 'Purple', 'Material': 'Sponge', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Face Makeup', 'Package Dimensions': '5.8 x 2.9 x 2.9 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '823544676230'}\nI used these a couple of different ways to take makeup off and put a moisturizer on my face, kinda soaked up into the sponge but if yeah it worked, and then just rinse out in warm soapy water.
