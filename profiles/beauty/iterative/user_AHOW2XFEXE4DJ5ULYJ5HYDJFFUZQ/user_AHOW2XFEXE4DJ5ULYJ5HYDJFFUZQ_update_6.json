It is small and compact doesn't take up a lot of room. Good for your purse or desk drawer. It went on smooth, of course, wet it didn't \"dry\" as quick as liked but then I've never been good at putting liquid eyeliner on. I gave the set to my daughter and she loved it and wears it I'm sure every day. She said it was easy to remove and she really liked the ease of the applicator.\nReview Title: wet and don't blink\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Beuaty Star 3PCS Poly Nail Gel Kit 30ml, Extension Gel Trial Kit Nail Enhancement Builder Gel Professional Nail Gel All-in One with with Base Top Coat\nBeauty Star\n{'Brand': 'Beauty Star', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Unit Count': '144.0 Ounce', 'Package Dimensions': '10.7 x 9.2 x 1.7 inches; 1.15 Pounds'}\nThe product took a bit of extra time to finally get to me. In general, together is a good set.  A couple of things annoyed me. First, the nails - the poly forms, were fine but the case they're in not numbered and the nail themselves are numbered but so tiny it's very hard to make out. Also, the container be VERY careful it doesn't close well if dropped with the way their numbered it was hard to put them back in their home slots. The poly gel- very very tacky, I get it supposed to be but it made it a bit messy from the tube to the spatula, to the nail. The company did warm about the gel in the turn and working with it in cooler temperatures.  In the few kits I've received from the Vine program it was the only one with a tool/brush so yay!! overall a good product and kit to use.\ngood for beginners\nPine Gel Nail Polish Set 6 Colors Purple Blue Cat Eye Glitter Gel Polish 7.5 ml Soak Off UV LED Cure Home Salon Manicure\npine\n{'Brand': 'Pine', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '9.524 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '6', 'Liquid Volume': '0.25 Fluid Ounces', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '4.84 x 2.87 x 3.58 inches', 'Product Dimensions': '4.84 x 2.87 x 3.58 inches; 9.77 Ounces', 'UPC': '738628890955'}\nI used the darker cat's eye recently on a family member's hands, she loved it. A base, 2 thin coats, and a topcoat. UV light and was perfect. The bottles are small and come in 6 colors.  I think it would be good for the girl that has a kit already started or a shop. Great stocking stuffer. Oh, I didn't pick up on the \"light\" pine scent.  I'd order again.\nbeautiful colors\nBELLA MODA Sponges Blender Puff for Powder, Liquid and Cream Makeup 4PCS Purple Beauty Blending Sponge Foundations Powders Wet and Dry Used\nBELLA MODA\n{'Brand': 'BELLA MODA', 'Color': 'Purple', 'Material': 'Sponge', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Face Makeup', 'Package Dimensions': '5.8 x 2.9 x 2.9 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '823544676230'}\nI used these a couple of different ways to take makeup off and put a moisturizer on my face, kinda soaked up into the sponge but if yeah it worked, and then just rinse out in warm soapy water. I also used it to blot polish on my nails, it gives it a cool effect. (didn't use the whole sponge) of course, came in a few different colors. Yeah I liked it enough to order again.\nmany uses\nYolife Acrylic Nail Brush with100% Pure Kolinsky Sable, Nail Art Brush With Brilliant crystal Handle, for Manicure Pedicure (6#, Silver)\nYOLIFE\n{'Color': 'Silver', 'Brand': 'YOLIFE', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.75 x 2 x 0.3 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nIf you do nails at home or professionally you can never have enough brushes and this comes in a set of four. Each has a different tip and one of the four has a tiny ball on the end. All of them can be used for various things, polishing drawing ect... very pretty with crystal handles that is easy to hold. I like this and see myself reordering.\nwonderful tools\nAtmos Skin Deep Cleansing Mask   All Natural Peel Off Face Mask for Blackheads & Whiteheads, Acne & Pore Remover, Blackhead Mask Remover for Face\nAtmos Skin\n{'Brand': 'Atmos Skin', 'Product Benefits': 'Cleansing', 'Scent': 'Peel Off', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Unit Count': '2.00 Fl Oz', 'Package Dimensions': '5.43 x 3.35 x 1.73 inches; 2.89 Ounces', 'UPC': '812280016097', 'Manufacturer': 'ATMOS SKIN'}\nI always like trying out new products. I'm usually leery trying products for my face, this cleansing mask worked, but dried out my face more than I liked, almost an itchy dry. I put on moisturizer right after rinsing the mask off with warm water. It was fine, just not sure I'd order it again.\nnot a fav of mine\n8 Color Colored Liquid Eyeliner Colorful Pen Set,Neon Green Purple White Blue Black Rainbow Colorful Matte Liquid Eyeliner Set Eye Liners for Women Waterproof Pencil delineadores de colores para ojos\nevpct\n{'Product Dimensions': '6.85 x 5.28 x 0.63 inches; 4.66 Ounces'}\nI loved the colors and the bottle the liner was in.
