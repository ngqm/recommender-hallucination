In general, together is a good set.  A couple of things annoyed me. First, the nails - the poly forms, were fine but the case they're in not numbered and the nail themselves are numbered but so tiny it's very hard to make out. Also, the container be VERY careful it doesn't close well if dropped with the way their numbered it was hard to put them back in their home slots. The poly gel- very very tacky, I get it supposed to be but it made it a bit messy from the tube to the spatula, to the nail. The company did warm about the gel in the turn and working with it in cooler temperatures.  In the few kits I've received from the Vine program it was the only one with a tool/brush so yay!! overall a good product and kit to use.\nReview Title: good for beginners\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
