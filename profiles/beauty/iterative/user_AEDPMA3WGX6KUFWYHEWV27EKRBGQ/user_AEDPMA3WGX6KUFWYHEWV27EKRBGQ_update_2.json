I already have a regular side led lamp at home so it wasn\u2019t a deal breaker for this is why I still gave them 5\u2b50\ufe0f\u2018S\nAmazing set minus the LED lamp\nVeda Tinda Gel Nail Polish Kit 20 Colors Fall Winter Modern Stage Soak off UV/LED Lamp Nail Polish Set with Glossy & Matte Top Coat and Base Coat Christmas\nveda Tinda\n{'Brand': 'veda Tinda', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'base', 'Finish Type': 'Glossy, Matte', 'Material Feature': 'Cruelty Free', 'Unit Count': '3.50 Fl Oz', 'Liquid Volume': '0.25 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '10.63 x 3.98 x 3.94 inches; 1.81 Pounds'}\n[[VIDEOID:a85cb1993222ab6477f64f176b1d9758]] Such pretty colors, I love them all!\nGorgeous colors",
