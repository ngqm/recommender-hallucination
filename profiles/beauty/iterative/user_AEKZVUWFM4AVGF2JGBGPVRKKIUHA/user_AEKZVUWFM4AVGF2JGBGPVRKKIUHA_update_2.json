I\u2019ve actually had a tube put in my right tear duct to clear a blockage and that is dreadful to go through. It has been recommended that I use warm/hot (not scolding) compress to help keep my tear ducts draining. I\u2019m trying this mask to save time. It\u2019s easier than standing at the sink and constantly warming up a wash cloths with the faucet. It\u2019s definitely relaxing and I can feel how it is going to help me.

There\u2019s something about them that is super absorbent, yet extremely moisturizing. This particular cream/gel is exactly the same way. Did not leave a sticky/greasy feel/look at all on my face, it actually absorbed very quickly. It has a slight fragrant smell, nothing too extreme and it is did not irritate my skin at all. I have very sensitive skin and have to be careful about which products I use. It\u2019s kept my face completely moisturized & glowing throughout the day.<br />My ONLY Issue with this product is the price.
