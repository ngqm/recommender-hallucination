There\u2019s something about them that is super absorbent, yet extremely moisturizing. This particular cream/gel is exactly the same way. Did not leave a sticky/greasy feel/look at all on my face, it actually absorbed very quickly. It has a slight fragrant smell, nothing too extreme and it is did not irritate my skin at all. I have very sensitive skin and have to be careful about which products I use. It\u2019s kept my face completely moisturized & glowing throughout the day.<br />My ONLY Issue with this product is the price. It\u2019s a bit much for something that I need to use twice daily.<br />DISCLAIMER:<br />\ud83d\udcddYes, I am a VINE \ud83d\udde3VOICE member.
