I am a particular person that does not like to have dry skin or calluses on my \ud83d\udc63 feet. It\u2019s important that I have a lotion that makes my feet \ud83d\udc63 soft and smooth. This also has a somewhat cooling feeling to it which is nice. Occasionally in the middle of the night my feet \ud83d\udc63 will start getting very warm/hot and it\u2019s very uncomfortable.

There\u2019s something about them that is super absorbent, yet extremely moisturizing. This particular cream/gel is exactly the same way. Did not leave a sticky/greasy feel/look at all on my face, it actually absorbed very quickly. It has a slight fragrant smell, nothing too extreme and it is did not irritate my skin at all. I have very sensitive skin and have to be careful about which products I use. It\u2019s kept my face completely moisturized & glowing throughout the day.<br />My ONLY Issue with this product is the price. It\u2019s a bit much for something that I need to use twice daily.<br />DISCLAIMER:<br />\ud83d\udcddYes, I am a VINE \ud83d\udde3VOICE member.

If you\u2019ve ever had them clogged before than you know the discomfort that comes with it. I\u2019ve actually had a tube put in my right tear duct to clear a blockage and that is dreadful to go through. It has been recommended that I use warm/hot (not scolding) compress to help keep my tear ducts draining. I\u2019m trying this mask to save time. It\u2019s easier than standing at the sink and constantly warming up a wash cloths with the faucet. It\u2019s definitely relaxing and I can feel how it is going to help me. I wear eye mask when I sleep so I\u2019m already used to having a cover over my eyes.\nRecommended to prevent my tear ducts clogging again\ud83d\udc4d\u2b50\ufe0f\nSummer's Eve Spa Set for Women | Gift Box | Women's Post Shave Hydrating Serum, 1oz Tube | Cleansing Feminine Wash, 12oz Bottle\nSummer's Eve\n[\"Give a special someone or pamper yourself and experience Daily Intimate Beauty with the Summer's Eve Spa gift set containing a Luxurious Cleansing Wash and an Intimate Serum.
