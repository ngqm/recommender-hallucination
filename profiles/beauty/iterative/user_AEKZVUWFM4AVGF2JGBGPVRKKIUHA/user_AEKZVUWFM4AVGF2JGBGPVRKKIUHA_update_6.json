The protective glasses \ud83d\udc53 even come in a very nice case. The directions are quite detailed so there is no need for me to discuss that in this review. If you purchase this device you\u2019ll see.<br /><br />Operating an IPL device is pretty simple if you follow the directions. It\u2019s choosing the level, making sure you don\u2019t miss a spot and having the patience/commitment to follow through with it to get the results you want.<br /><br />I have seen reviews under many IPL hair removal devices that says they used it for a month and they didn\u2019t see any results. Well, it does take time. Like I said, if you are committed, patience and consistent, then any IPL device will work. This particular device recommends using ONCE a week for 12 weeks, and then once a month there after for maintenance. Most people want to see results by snapping their fingers, and that just isn\u2019t going to happen, even if you do go to a professional, and have it done, it takes time. My advice, if you are not in the mood to take the time, don\u2019t have the patience and or not going to be committed, then don\u2019t get one of these devices because you would be wasting your money.<br /><br />It took about 4 weeks or 4 treatments before I really started to notice results. First noticed the hair on the underarms because it had become finer, thinner, softer hair that was growing. My bikini \ud83d\udc59 area had spots that the hair didn\u2019t grow back but other spots where it was finer, thinner & softer hair. Even though I had spots with NO HAIR growing back, I still go over all the areas regardless. My left armpit has no hair growing at this time, but I still do a treatment. Once I get to the proper weeks since I first started the treatments, then and only then I will \ud83d\uded1 treating areas where no hair grows.<br /><br />My legs \ud83e\uddb5\ud83c\udffc have been frustrating but it\u2019s definitely working. The problem is that I miss areas each time I do a treatment. There\u2019s no way of getting the entire leg each time. I have come up with a pattern I do that helps me the best. I start at my ankle and go around my leg \ud83e\uddb5\ud83c\udffc in a circle \u2b55\ufe0f while spiraling \ud83c\udf00 up my leg. I found that going up and down is when I was missing the most. Doing a spiral has helped me tremendously.<br /><br />On the days I am scheduled to do another treatment, I shave \ud83e\ude92 the areas that I\u2019m going to treat. I also exfoliate the areas using  [[ASIN:B099HDG45M Revealer Skin Exfoliator]]. Then about an half hour after I shave \ud83e\ude92, I start me treatments. KEEP YOUR LEGS DRY, CLEAN AND NO LOTIONS/OILS ETC. NOTHING.<br />ALWAYS WEAR THE PROTECTIVE \ud83d\udc53 GLASSES!<br />Since I shave my underarms first, I start there. Underarms takes about 2 minutes each. Then I do my bikini \ud83d\udc59 area and then onto my legs. If I think I forgot a spot I do go back and do it, but I really try to pay attention so I don\u2019t. Once complete I either apply [[ASIN:B0B1N8Z7BR Reviver Skin Soothing Gel]] or [[ASIN:B073WVKRBN USDA Certified Jojoba Oil]]. Both are soothing, but sometimes I feel I need a decent moisturizer and Jojoba Oil is my go to for that.<br /><br />Well, that\u2019s how I do each treatment. I also put in my schedule/calendar\ud83d\udcc5 when I\u2019m supposed to do my next treatment. It is time consuming, but the results are so worth it. Think off all the money you are going to save by NOT having to buy EXPENSIVE RAZORS \ud83e\ude92 anymore. Not to mention the time saved in the shower \ud83d\udebf.<br /><br />HOPE THIS HELPS others understand a little of how it works. \ud83d\udc4dI feel very comfortable using this device and knew going into it, this is a commitment and requires patience.\nReview Title: I\u2764\ufe0fthe cooling tip on this device\ud83d\udc4d\u2b50\ufe0f\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

There\u2019s something about them that is super absorbent, yet extremely moisturizing. This particular cream/gel is exactly the same way. Did not leave a sticky/greasy feel/look at all on my face, it actually absorbed very quickly. It has a slight fragrant smell, nothing too extreme and it is did not irritate my skin at all. I have very sensitive skin and have to be careful about which products I use. It\u2019s kept my face completely moisturized & glowing throughout the day.<br />My ONLY Issue with this product is the price. It\u2019s a bit much for something that I need to use twice daily.<br />DISCLAIMER:<br />\ud83d\udcddYes, I am a VINE \ud83d\udde3VOICE member.

If you\u2019ve ever had them clogged before than you know the discomfort that comes with it. I\u2019ve actually had a tube put in my right tear duct to clear a blockage and that is dreadful to go through. It has been recommended that I use warm/hot (not scolding) compress to help keep my tear ducts draining. I\u2019m trying this mask to save time. It\u2019s easier than standing at the sink and constantly warming up a wash cloths with the faucet. It\u2019s definitely relaxing and I can feel how it is going to help me. I wear eye mask when I sleep so I\u2019m already used to having a cover over my eyes.\nRecommended to prevent my tear ducts clogging again\ud83d\udc4d\u2b50\ufe0f\nSummer's Eve Spa Set for Women | Gift Box | Women's Post Shave Hydrating Serum, 1oz Tube | Cleansing Feminine Wash, 12oz Bottle\nSummer's Eve\n[\"Give a special someone or pamper yourself and experience Daily Intimate Beauty with the Summer's Eve Spa gift set containing a Luxurious Cleansing Wash and an Intimate Serum.

They have never caused me any irritation and always kept me feeling clean and refreshed. With this being a new product of theirs, of course I needed to try it right away.<br />Minimal scent with the Wash and Fragrance FREE for the serum. I use the wash I as I always have with the other Summer\u2019s Eve I have. I like that this is PH-Balanced. I use the serum on my bikini area after I\u2019ve \ud83e\ude92 shaved.<br /><br />I have nothing but positive things to say about all Summer\u2019s Eve products.

I am a particular person that does not like to have dry skin or calluses on my \ud83d\udc63 feet. It\u2019s important that I have a lotion that makes my feet \ud83d\udc63 soft and smooth. This also has a somewhat cooling feeling to it which is nice. Occasionally in the middle of the night my feet \ud83d\udc63 will start getting very warm/hot and it\u2019s very uncomfortable. Twice now I\u2019ve been able to apply this cream and it soothes and cools my feet \ud83d\udc63 making them comfortable enough to be able to sleep.<br /><br />EXPIRATION DATE: 06/11/2024<br />I always check for expiration dates prior to using.

A gentle shampoo that thoroughly cleans my hair. Usually shampoos that throughly clean away build up will strip my hair of the natural oils and this definitely does not. It is for \u201cCOLOR TREATED\u201d hair.<br />I also use this shampoo in combination with [[ASIN:B09TQ29M5H AIIR Diamond Hair Conditioner]]. The combination of both together leaves my hair feeling cleaning, smooth and soft. No frizzing at all.<br />It is a bit pricey, however, for a professional brand product, is does as described, and they are all priced around the same for 8oz.<br /><br />THOROUGHLY SEALED: \u2705<br />One thing that is important to me is how manufacturers seal & ship their products.
