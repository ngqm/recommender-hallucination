The ingredient list is impressive and I definitely need help with my oily, acne-prone skin.<br /><br />I've used this 3 times now and have noticed two things: After using at night, I'm waking with what seems to be some kind of reaction to it as it's causing prominent red blotches on my forehead that aren't there unless I've used this. Secondly, the listing says this has the \"Delicate scent of rosewater,\" but mine smells old...you know, that kind of smell when a lotion hasn't been used in a long time. I immediately checked the box and saw that my bottle doesn't expire until 5/s022, so I'm not sure if I just got a questionable batch.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can't recommend this. Again, maybe I just got a bum batch, but it's causing blotchiness that isn't usually there and smells old.\nReview Title: Wanted to love it\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Segbeauty empty bottle 290\nTruuMe\n{'Brand': 'Segbeauty', 'Color': 'Clear', 'Material Type Free': 'Dairy Free', 'Item Weight': '3.4 Ounces', 'Bottle Nipple Type': 'Vented', 'Package Dimensions': '7.99 x 3.19 x 2.24 inches; 3.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'AM-160083-03', 'UPC': '701822757553 701822760621'}\nI've kept a squirt bottle of water under my sink for years. I cut my own hair, so I spray it down before doing so. With a regular spray bottle, I always end up getting a lot of water on the floor when spraying my hair, then have a problem cleaning up the floor after cutting my hair as my hair is stuck to the wet floor.<br /><br />This bottle has solved my problem. The mist from this bottle is consistently super-fine. No rogue giant droplets. I can spray my hair down and not get water everywhere. The bottle is easy to hold, is a great weight and is balanced well. The trigger is easy to pull.<br /><br />This bottle is perfect to use for homemade wrinkle reducer for clothing as well. I just mix one cup of water and a tablespoon of fabric softener, shake well, then spray on fabric while pulling down on the fabric. The micro-fine mist dispenses a perfect light spray, so the fabric dries quickly.<br /><br />This bottle is very easy to clean so I can use it for several things, but I'd like to get more so I can stop switching the contents out.<br /><br />Definitely recommend.\nA must-have for me (with a tip for you)\n2020 UPGRADED Exfoliating Loofah Sponge Pads, Natural Luffa Material Loofah Pads Shower Body Scruber for Men/Women Bath Spa and Shower (3 Pack)\nMarsheepy\n{'Material': 'Loofah', 'Brand': 'Marsheepy', 'Style': 'Pad', 'Item Form': 'Pad', 'Number of Pieces': '3', 'Package Dimensions': '8 x 6 x 2 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'UPC': '780317215334', 'Manufacturer': 'Anthone Amo'}\nThese are some high-quality loofahs! They're very thick and a good overall size. The handle makes it very easy to hold and I find the loofah part plenty scrubby for my skin.<br /><br />With anything like this, it's critical it be allowed to dry completely to cut down on bacterial growth. I've included a picture of how I rigged mine to dry. I took one of those suction hook thingies, wedged it between two metal pieces of my shower caddy, and hang my loofah to dry. The important part of this is that in doing it this way, no part of the loofah itself touches anything. I read years ago that wherever something like this touches something else while drying, bacteria can collect there. I'm no scientist, but it makes sense to me, so that's how I've hung stuff like this for years. Works like a charm. I also love that I can throw these in the washing machine.<br /><br />These are very nice loofahs and I recommend them.\nI rigged mine to dry completely\nFollain Mattifying Moisturizer: Oil Control | Hydrating, Daily Facial Lotion, Oil-Free, Smooth Fine Lines, Supports Anti-Aging, Oil Control, Combination to Oily Skin, Peptide Complex, Cruelty Free, 1.7 fl oz\nFollain\n{'Package Dimensions': '4 x 2 x 2 inches; 3.99 Ounces', 'UPC': '850016280022'}\nI was really excited to see this become available in the Vine program as I'm a skincare junkie.
