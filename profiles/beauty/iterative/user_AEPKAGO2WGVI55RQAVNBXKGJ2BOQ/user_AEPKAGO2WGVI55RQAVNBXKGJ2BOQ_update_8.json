It smells a little medicinal and comes in a jar. I get it out with a cotton swab to try to keep it from getting germy from my fingers. My skin is dry/combo, aging, dehydrated and acne-prone. I mostly need help on my cheeks this time of year, so that's where I've been using it.<br /><br />I spread this on my cheeks and it immediately leaves a slight cooling sensation. It takes a while for it to soak in/dry down completely and it feels a bit tacky until then. Once the tackiness is gone, my skin feels very soft to the touch, however, when looking in my makeup mirror, my skin doesn't look hydrated at all. It looks just like it did before using this moisturizer.<br /><br />I think this might be more suited to someone younger and with oilier skin. The ingredients are nice, just not for my skin, unfortunately.\nReview Title: Not enough for me\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Segbeauty empty bottle 290\nTruuMe\n{'Brand': 'Segbeauty', 'Color': 'Clear', 'Material Type Free': 'Dairy Free', 'Item Weight': '3.4 Ounces', 'Bottle Nipple Type': 'Vented', 'Package Dimensions': '7.99 x 3.19 x 2.24 inches; 3.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'AM-160083-03', 'UPC': '701822757553 701822760621'}\nI've kept a squirt bottle of water under my sink for years. I cut my own hair, so I spray it down before doing so. With a regular spray bottle, I always end up getting a lot of water on the floor when spraying my hair, then have a problem cleaning up the floor after cutting my hair as my hair is stuck to the wet floor.<br /><br />This bottle has solved my problem. The mist from this bottle is consistently super-fine. No rogue giant droplets. I can spray my hair down and not get water everywhere. The bottle is easy to hold, is a great weight and is balanced well. The trigger is easy to pull.<br /><br />This bottle is perfect to use for homemade wrinkle reducer for clothing as well. I just mix one cup of water and a tablespoon of fabric softener, shake well, then spray on fabric while pulling down on the fabric. The micro-fine mist dispenses a perfect light spray, so the fabric dries quickly.<br /><br />This bottle is very easy to clean so I can use it for several things, but I'd like to get more so I can stop switching the contents out.<br /><br />Definitely recommend.\nA must-have for me (with a tip for you)\n2020 UPGRADED Exfoliating Loofah Sponge Pads, Natural Luffa Material Loofah Pads Shower Body Scruber for Men/Women Bath Spa and Shower (3 Pack)\nMarsheepy\n{'Material': 'Loofah', 'Brand': 'Marsheepy', 'Style': 'Pad', 'Item Form': 'Pad', 'Number of Pieces': '3', 'Package Dimensions': '8 x 6 x 2 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'UPC': '780317215334', 'Manufacturer': 'Anthone Amo'}\nThese are some high-quality loofahs! They're very thick and a good overall size. The handle makes it very easy to hold and I find the loofah part plenty scrubby for my skin.<br /><br />With anything like this, it's critical it be allowed to dry completely to cut down on bacterial growth. I've included a picture of how I rigged mine to dry. I took one of those suction hook thingies, wedged it between two metal pieces of my shower caddy, and hang my loofah to dry. The important part of this is that in doing it this way, no part of the loofah itself touches anything. I read years ago that wherever something like this touches something else while drying, bacteria can collect there. I'm no scientist, but it makes sense to me, so that's how I've hung stuff like this for years. Works like a charm. I also love that I can throw these in the washing machine.<br /><br />These are very nice loofahs and I recommend them.\nI rigged mine to dry completely\nFollain Mattifying Moisturizer: Oil Control | Hydrating, Daily Facial Lotion, Oil-Free, Smooth Fine Lines, Supports Anti-Aging, Oil Control, Combination to Oily Skin, Peptide Complex, Cruelty Free, 1.7 fl oz\nFollain\n{'Package Dimensions': '4 x 2 x 2 inches; 3.99 Ounces', 'UPC': '850016280022'}\nI was really excited to see this become available in the Vine program as I'm a skincare junkie. The ingredient list is impressive and I definitely need help with my oily, acne-prone skin.<br /><br />I've used this 3 times now and have noticed two things: After using at night, I'm waking with what seems to be some kind of reaction to it as it's causing prominent red blotches on my forehead that aren't there unless I've used this. Secondly, the listing says this has the \"Delicate scent of rosewater,\" but mine smells old...you know, that kind of smell when a lotion hasn't been used in a long time. I immediately checked the box and saw that my bottle doesn't expire until 5/s022, so I'm not sure if I just got a questionable batch.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can't recommend this. Again, maybe I just got a bum batch, but it's causing blotchiness that isn't usually there and smells old.\nWanted to love it\nRui Smiths Pro Stainless Steel 8-Piece Manicure Kit For Home And Salon With Professional Precision Cuticle Nipper And Metal Pusher Style No. 105\nRui Smiths\n{'Product Dimensions': '6.69 x 4.33 x 1.08 inches; 11.46 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'SK-02', 'UPC': '728614665797', 'Manufacturer': 'Rui Smiths', 'Country of Origin': 'China'}\nI've been doing my own nails for years and have had many manicure sets along the way. This one is exceptional. The tools are made of thick enough steel that they don't bend when using them like other sets I've used. Each tool works as it should and it heavyweight. I'm not finding this lacking any good nail tool I need. I like this set a lot and highly recommend it.\nGreat for DIYers\nLeiCare Tweezers Precision 2-Pack - Stainless Steel Slant Tweezers for Ingrown Hair \u2013 Professional Tweezer Set with Slanted Tips for Eyebrows and Splinter Removal - Eyebrow Plucker Kit\nLeiCare\n{'Product Dimensions': '3.74 x 0.39 x 0.18 inches; 3.17 Ounces'}\nI've needed new tweezers for my fine-haired brows so I was happy to give these a shot.<br /><br />The case closes with a decent snap, but once you remove the bands holding the tweezers closed, you can't close the case with the tweezers inside. That's not a big deal to me as I'm leaving the tweezers out of the case, but you should know that in case you wish to keep these in a makeup bag.<br /><br />These tweezers do a lovely job grabbing onto the fine, thin hairs of my brows. They're \"sharp\" without being pokey and I like the colors.<br /><br />They work for me, and it's nice to keep the small ones in my purse.\nCase if iffy\nHyaluronic Acid & Caffeine Eye Roller Serum for Men with Vitamin C \u2013 Made in USA \u2013 Depuffing Eye Roller Ball for Dark Circles & Puffiness \u2013 Mens Day & Night Anti-Aging Under Eye Serum Roller \u2013 10ml (0.68 Fl Oz (Pack of 2))\nGentlehomme\n{'Skin Type': 'All', 'Product Benefits': 'Eye-Bag Depuffer', 'Use for': 'Eyes', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'Gentlehomme', 'Package Dimensions': '5.67 x 2.68 x 1.14 inches; 2.89 Ounces', 'UPC': '850030774026', 'Manufacturer': 'Gentlehomme', 'Country of Origin': 'USA'}\nI've been using this roller for a couple of weeks. I got it as I've heard that caffeine in eye products helps to tighten the under-eye area, but I haven't experienced that with this roller. It feels nice and cooling going on, but I suspect that's mostly the metal roller ball. It dries down quickly and wears well without flaking or peeling. Here's hoping longer-term use yields results.\nUm...\nCell Fusion C Pore Tox Toner Pad(60 pads) | Resurfacing Pads,Daily exfoliating, PHA facial peeling\nCell Fusion C\n{'Brand': 'Cell Fusion C', 'Item Form': 'Pads', 'Product Benefits': 'Exfoliating', 'Scent': 'Fresh', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Product Dimensions': '3.1 x 3.1 x 4.3 inches; 9.17 Ounces'}\nThese pads come in a double-sealed container. There's the screw top lid you open to find a pop top lid with a little tweezer on top to get the pads.<br /><br />The pads are very thin and flimsy...I have a hard time sliding them around on my face unless I use 2 or more. One side is textured and the other is smooth. The pads are extremely wet, as in dripping, so there's plenty of essence on them. It takes a while for my face to dry because of this. I don't detect a scent, nor is there any tingling or anything when I apply.<br /><br />These dry out my combo-oily/acne-prone/aging skin, so I must use a moisturizer after my face dries or I get that tight feeling and \"pull\" marks on my cheeks. These add no moisturization at all to my skin. The good news is these pads do tighten up the looks of my pores and are helping to keep acne at bay.<br /><br />As long as moisturizer is used after this step, I like these.\nLike, but don't love\nPerfect Reflection Face Brightening Moisturizer-Organic-Kojic acid-Alpha-arbutin-Niacinamide-Mulberry\nPerfect Reflection\n{'Brand': 'Perfect Reflection', 'Unit Count': '2.0 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Use for': 'Face', 'Skin Type': 'Acne Prone', 'Package Dimensions': '3.94 x 2.36 x 2.32 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nThis moisturizer is a light tan color and has a kind of gel texture.
