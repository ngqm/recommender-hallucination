But not all of the ingredients are listed in the product information. I am allergic to beeswax, which is the second ingredient in the lip balm. So I was unable to use it.<br /><br />I\u2019m including a picture of the tube, but for reference, here are the ingredients: helianthus annuus (sunflower) oil, beeswax/cire d\u2019abeille, olea europaea (extra virgin olive) oil, aroma (flavor), cannabis sativa (hemp) seed oil, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, tocopherol (vitamin E), aloe barbadensis.\nReview Title: Pharmacopia Tangerine-Flavored Lip Balm\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Water Flosser Cordless Oral Irrigator Portable Rechargeable Dental Flossers with 5 Modes & 6 Tips Water Flossing with 300ml Water Tank for Home and Travel, Braces & Bridges Care (Blue)\nDuomishu\n{'Brand': 'Duomishu', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Special Feature': 'Por, Multiple Operation Modes, Multiple Tips', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Tank Volume': '300 Milliliters', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '9.9 x 5 x 3.1 inches; 1.2 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'hf-6', 'Batteries': '1 Lithium Ion batteries required. (included)', 'UPC': '786738939194', 'Manufacturer': 'Duomishu'}\nIf you\u2019ve never used a water flosser before, there\u2019s a definite learning curve. Expect to get wet the first few times, if not more. The learning curve and mess is worth it -- my mouth generally feels cleaner after using one -- but I don\u2019t love this particular model.<br /><br />I wanted a water flosser that wouldn\u2019t take up a lot of space on my bathroom counter. This one is a sort of all-in-one, with the reservoir built into the handle, but I kept getting water bubbles in the tank/tip, which made flossing take a lot longer.<br /><br />There\u2019s only 3 speeds: low, medium, and high. The low is quite low. And because of where the speed switch button is, it\u2019s really easy to accidentally switch speeds while using the flosser.<br /><br />The flosser charges via USB, but with a proprietary end (not A or C or anything like that).\nCordless Water Flosser\nPharmacopia Tangerine-Flavored Lip Balm - Set of 2, 0.25oz - Nourishing Herbal Lip Elixir with 100% Natural and Certified Organic Ingredients\nPharmacopia\n{'Brand': 'Pharmacopia', 'Item Form': 'Balm', 'Finish Type': 'Natural', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Soothing,Nourishing', 'Package Dimensions': '3.6 x 1.7 x 0.7 inches; 0.25 Ounces', 'UPC': '087819800366'}\nI spend 99% of my life with chapped lips, so I\u2019m always looking for a chapstick or lip balm that will actually work.<br /><br />I was intrigued by the hemp oil in the Pharmacopia Tangerine-Flavored Lip Balm.
