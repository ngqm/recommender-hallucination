The cleanser is brown with a jelly-like consistency. It does have a scent, a mix of green tea and tea tree oil. I do notice the scent when using the cleanser but the scent doesn\u2019t linger.<br /><br />A small drop is enough to wash my face and neck. It doesn\u2019t make a lot of lather but does feel silky going on the skin. I really like the consistency of it.<br /><br />And I really like how well the cleanser works! It cleaned two layers of sunscreen grime and sweat off my face. Some face washes don\u2019t remove all the sunscreen residue, and I have to keep washing my face or use an exfoliating scrub. This cleanser? One wash and done. I was amazed by how well it worked.<br /><br />I\u2019m in my 30s, white, with sensitive combination skin. The cleanser did not irritate my face at all.\nReview Title: Gentle effectie cleanser, made in Korea\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Water Flosser Cordless Oral Irrigator Portable Rechargeable Dental Flossers with 5 Modes & 6 Tips Water Flossing with 300ml Water Tank for Home and Travel, Braces & Bridges Care (Blue)\nDuomishu\n{'Brand': 'Duomishu', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Special Feature': 'Por, Multiple Operation Modes, Multiple Tips', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Tank Volume': '300 Milliliters', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '9.9 x 5 x 3.1 inches; 1.2 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'hf-6', 'Batteries': '1 Lithium Ion batteries required. (included)', 'UPC': '786738939194', 'Manufacturer': 'Duomishu'}\nIf you\u2019ve never used a water flosser before, there\u2019s a definite learning curve. Expect to get wet the first few times, if not more. The learning curve and mess is worth it -- my mouth generally feels cleaner after using one -- but I don\u2019t love this particular model.<br /><br />I wanted a water flosser that wouldn\u2019t take up a lot of space on my bathroom counter. This one is a sort of all-in-one, with the reservoir built into the handle, but I kept getting water bubbles in the tank/tip, which made flossing take a lot longer.<br /><br />There\u2019s only 3 speeds: low, medium, and high. The low is quite low. And because of where the speed switch button is, it\u2019s really easy to accidentally switch speeds while using the flosser.<br /><br />The flosser charges via USB, but with a proprietary end (not A or C or anything like that).\nCordless Water Flosser\nPharmacopia Tangerine-Flavored Lip Balm - Set of 2, 0.25oz - Nourishing Herbal Lip Elixir with 100% Natural and Certified Organic Ingredients\nPharmacopia\n{'Brand': 'Pharmacopia', 'Item Form': 'Balm', 'Finish Type': 'Natural', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Soothing,Nourishing', 'Package Dimensions': '3.6 x 1.7 x 0.7 inches; 0.25 Ounces', 'UPC': '087819800366'}\nI spend 99% of my life with chapped lips, so I\u2019m always looking for a chapstick or lip balm that will actually work.<br /><br />I was intrigued by the hemp oil in the Pharmacopia Tangerine-Flavored Lip Balm. But not all of the ingredients are listed in the product information. I am allergic to beeswax, which is the second ingredient in the lip balm. So I was unable to use it.<br /><br />I\u2019m including a picture of the tube, but for reference, here are the ingredients: helianthus annuus (sunflower) oil, beeswax/cire d\u2019abeille, olea europaea (extra virgin olive) oil, aroma (flavor), cannabis sativa (hemp) seed oil, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, tocopherol (vitamin E), aloe barbadensis.\nPharmacopia Tangerine-Flavored Lip Balm\nKale Firm & Smooth Body Lotion - Superfood Infused Firming Body Lotion with Kale. 6.8 fl.oz, Anti-Aging Moisturizing Lotion For All Skin Types\nCancun Collection\n{'Brand': 'Cancun Collection', 'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Unit Count': '6.8 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Use for': 'Whole Body', 'Package Dimensions': '7.5 x 4 x 1.1 inches; 8.01 Ounces', 'UPC': '659436986671'}\nKale Leaf Extract (Brassica Oleracea Acephala) is the 14th ingredient listed out of 23 for the Cancun Collection Kale Firm & Smooth Body Lotion. This lotion is made in Canada.<br /><br />The lotion absorbed quickly into my skin, but did leave behind a slightly tacky feel for about 5 minutes after application.<br /><br />It\u2019s currently the middle of winter where I am, so I was able to see just how moisturizing the lotion is for me when I already had dry skin. The lotion has a medium-weight consistency and gets the job done for about half the day.<br /><br />What I don\u2019t like about this lotion is the scent. The scent is subtle, sort of like vanilla coconut, and it\u2019s fine at first. But the scent lingers for several hours, and after that time, I\u2019ve had enough of it.\nCancun Collection Kale Firm & Smooth Body Lotion\nWorkman's Friend Ultimate Hand Care Bundle\nWORKMAN'S FRIEND\n{'Package Dimensions': '9 x 4.5 x 2.3 inches; 1.3 Pounds', 'UPC': '023857030709'}\nFor me, I like the Hand Cleaner and Barrier Cream the most in this bundle. I found that the Superior Healing Hand Cream was just average. These products might seem dude oriented, but they work for anyone.<br /><br />Superior Hand Cleaner with Activated Charcoal (individually 4/5 stars):<br />--Works great to remove grease and odors. I like the pumice in the cleanser, as it gives me a real clean, scrubby feeling.<br /><br />Superior Barrier Skin Cream (individually 4/5 stars):<br />--Actually does help prevent grease or oil from staining my hands. Also helps keep my fingernails from becoming a dirt mess when I weed without gloves. But doesn\u2019t provide much of a moisturizing effect.<br /><br />Superior Healing Hand Cream (individually 3/5 stars):<br />--Truly unscented hand lotion. But it\u2019s just average as a lotion -- it took a few days of 2-3x per day applications to help heal my cracked hands.\nWorkman's Friend Ultimate Hand Care Bundle\nBeast Blue Ultra Cooling Body Wash, 6 oz -Beast\nTame the Beast\n{'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Brand': 'Tame the Beast', 'Scent': 'Green Tea', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '7 x 3 x 2 inches; 7.2 Ounces', 'UPC': '817662018539'}\nA friendly word of warning: don\u2019t use Beast Blue Cooling Body Wash down south unless you like tingly body parts.<br /><br />The consistency of the body wash is a little watery, so it\u2019s easy to squeeze out more than you might want. It lathers well and rinses clean without leaving behind a residue.<br /><br />I really like the smell of the body wash. It\u2019s a strong, crisp scent that really does wake you up. My nose tingled the first time I smelled it. The scent is hard to describe. I can\u2019t pick out any individual notes, just a crisp smell that made me go \u201cWow, this smells cool and different.\u201d\nBeast Blue Cooling Body Wash\nAloe Vera Gel 100% Natural Moisturisers - Pure Organic Fresh Soothing Aloe-Vera Moisturizing Gel Skin Hair, Aloe Leaf Wash-free Clean After Sun Face Body (8.8 oz)\nCIMIY\n{'Brand': 'CIMIY', 'Scent': 'Aloe Vera', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Unit Count': '8.8 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Product Dimensions': '5.91 x 1.57 x 1.57 inches; 11.22 Ounces'}\nThe description for this Aloe Vera Gel by CIMIY Skin Care confuses me a little. One of the uses suggested by the manufacturer is to put the gel on before going outside, \u201cwhich can protect skin from sunburns.\u201d This gel has hyaluronic acid listed as an ingredient, which can actually make skin even more sensitive to UV rays.<br /><br />Aloe Vera is great for soothing sunburns *after* exposure. This gel absorbed into my skin after about a minute, without leaving behind a sticky or tacky feeling. I\u2019ve used some aloe vera gels that have left me a sticky mess, but not this one. So I like the quick absorption.<br /><br />The gel does have a slight scent to it. It\u2019s a fresh-smelling scent that sticks around for a while.<br /><br />This Aloe Vera gel would also be great for homemade hand sanitizer.<br /><br />This gel is manufactured in China.\nAloe Vera Gel\nSdara Aloe Vera Gel For Face and Body - Organic & Natural, Soothing & Cooling For Sunburn Relief, Restorative For Dry Skin - Made In USA\nSdara Skincare\n{'Brand': 'Sdara Skincare', 'Scent': 'Aloe Vera', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '4.9 x 2.3 x 1.3 inches; 9.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '707486993085'}\nThis Aloe Vera Gel by Sdara Skincare takes a few minutes to fully absorb into my skin. I worried it would leave behind a sticky feeling, since I could feel it on my arm the whole time it took to dry. But once the gel finally absorbed, I couldn\u2019t feel any residue left behind. I didn\u2019t notice much of any scent either, which is another positive for me.<br /><br />The gel is clear; the plastic bottle is amber colored to help keep light out. I wish the bottle had a flip top or squeeze lid instead of a screw off cap.<br /><br />The list of ingredients is what gives me pause. I\u2019m not sure why sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) would need to be added to the organic aloe leaf juice. The product description mentions \u201cwe perfected our serum by enriching with Vitamin E, & Citric Acid for improved nutrient absorption.\u201d I don\u2019t see Vitamin E listed in the ingredients.<br /><br />I will probably end up using this aloe vera gel to make hand sanitizer. The gel is thick, so it should be good for that use.\nAloe Vera Gel\n10ML Cedarwood Essential Oil 100% Pure Natural Undiluted Therapeutic Grade Perfect for Aromatherapy, Relaxation, Skin Therapy Cleaning\nSWEETVALLY\n{'Brand': 'SWEETVALLY', 'Scent': 'Cedarwood', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Item Form': 'Drop', 'Package Dimensions': '2.6 x 1 x 1 inches; 1.59 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'VR00032968'}\nI tried the Cedarwood Essential Oil from Sweetvally. The oil is so strong that I smelled it even before removing it from the box or breaking the seal on the bottle. The bottle is tiny but mighty, I guess!<br /><br />The oil almost pours out from the bottle, so be careful when adding this to a diffuser or anything else. I accidentally added too much to my diffuser the first time I tried it, because the oil dripped out so quickly.<br /><br />The cedarwood scent is very woodsy. I personally find the scent calming. I read it can also help keep insects away.<br /><br />The bottle says the extraction method is steam distilled, but does not say where the oil was distilled or anything regarding the country of origin.\nVery strong\n1800 Watt Hair Dryer with Diffuser Hot and Cool Settings 2 Speed Adjustable Negative Ionic Hair Blow Dryer 2 Smoothing Concentrators and 1 Hair Scalp Massager Shampoo Brush for Curly Hair,Woman,Kids\nLassie\n{'Brand': 'Lassie', 'Wattage': '2000 watts', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Special Feature': 'Comb, Massage, Hot, Blow', 'Included Components': 'Diffuser, Concentrator', 'Product Dimensions': '11.4 x 9.4 x 3.7 inches; 2.43 Pounds', 'Manufacturer': 'Lassie'}\nThe look of the Lassie hair dryer is what caught my eye first. It just looks cool! I have the PinkGray color. The gray is a medium shade with a smooth finish that won\u2019t pick up hairs and dust. The pink is a metallic magenta that really pops.<br /><br />The speed controls are on the handle. The slide button doesn\u2019t move easily, so there\u2019s not a big chance of accidentally changing the speed/temperature without meaning to. On the back of the handle is the option for either cool or hot temperature.<br /><br />The hair dryer doesn\u2019t dry my hair any faster than any other hair dryer I\u2019ve used. But I like that I can set the temperature to cool to lessen damage and not have to hold in a cool shot button.<br /><br />The hair dryer isn\u2019t as lightweight as some plastic models I\u2019ve used, but it\u2019s weighted pretty well. The weight of it is distributed evenly on both sides of the handle.<br /><br />The attachments have little tabs that line up with notches on the nozzle, and then you twist them to lock them in place. I like it -- there\u2019s less chance of them popping off while I use the hair dryer.<br /><br />The bottom of the hair dryer says the rated power is 1800 watt, which is contrary to the description which says it is 2000 watt.\nLooks cool and works well\nNail Files 16 Pcs, Double Sided Emery Board Manicure Tools for Filing Natural Gel and Acrylic Nails for Home and Salon Use\nKeiby Citom\n{'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'Keiby Citom', 'Grit Number': '100', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '7.8 x 5.08 x 0.59 inches; 5.29 Ounces', 'UPC': '742025065137', 'Manufacturer': 'YHIT'}\nThis pack of 16 nail files from Keiby Citom is a great value.<br /><br />I started doing dip nails at home, and the worst part is getting off the old manicure. I have to file off the layers of top coat, which can take a while if I don\u2019t have a good file. I prefer a glass file for actually shaping my nails, but they\u2019re not good for removing layers of polish.<br /><br />Using one of these files, I had the top coat filed off all my nails in less than ten minutes. The 100 grit side is perfect. I actually asked a nail tech friend what I should use, and she told me 100 grit.<br /><br />The files come in a zipper seal plastic bag that can be used to store them.<br /><br />The edges of the files aren\u2019t sharp. I\u2019m talking about the edges that touch your skin; sometimes these can be sharp, especially on pro files, and need to be seasoned to prevent cuts. No problems with that here.\nGreat files\nLnlofen Silicone Back Scrubber for Shower, Exfoliating Long Silicone Body Back Brush, Handle Scrubbing Pad, Easy to Clean, Lathers Well, Comfortable Massage for Shower(Green)\nLnlofen\n{'Package Dimensions': '9.37 x 7.44 x 1.93 inches; 7.05 Ounces', 'UPC': '768894803786'}\nI like one side of this Silicone Back Scrubber from Lnlofen. The \u201csoft brush\u201d side, the one with the longer bristles, works great for scrubbing my back. I can actually feel the bristles move against my skin, and so I feel like I\u2019m getting clean.<br /><br />The other side, the \u201cstiff brush\u201d side, just slid right over my skin. I didn\u2019t feel the bumps at all.<br /><br />I\u2019m 5\u20195\u201d and slender, the back scrubber is long enough for me.<br /><br />The package includes a hook to hang the brush in the shower, but I just loop it over the shower rail and it dries quickly. The brush can roll up into a compact bundle for storage.\nOne side works, but that's all I need\nMakeup Headband - 3PCS Spa Headband For Washing Face Skincare Towel Headbands Shower Hair Band\nTinpin\n{'Color': 'Pink,Silver', 'Material': 'Foam', 'Number of Items': '3', 'Brand': 'Tinpin', 'Size': '3 piece Set', 'Package Dimensions': '8.35 x 7.17 x 2.13 inches; 3.99 Ounces'}\nIf I have a choice between a plain headband and a unicorn headband, well, I\u2019m picking the unicorn headband every time!<br /><br />These headbands are super cute and colorful. The faux fur is soft and doesn\u2019t shed, and really adds to the unicorn aspect. The horns stand up from the headband, and are sparkly silver. The ears don\u2019t stand up as well, they\u2019re a bit floppy, and also have sparkly silver on the backs.<br /><br />The headbands are on the smaller side. I measured approximately 6 inches across the opening with a headband unstretched, and about 9 inches when fully stretched. I like that the headbands are tight, they stay on my head and hold my hair back. I don\u2019t have to keep fussing with them, they stay in place. They are about 2\u00bd inches wide, which helps with comfort.\nCute and functional\nVitamasques Cica Green Tea Jelly Facial Cleanser Gentle pH Cleanser is Refreshing, Cleansing & Exfoliating for Smooth, Clean & Radiant Skin - Vegan, Free from Parabens & Gluten\nVitamasques\n{'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'Vitamasques', 'Scent': 'Tea Tree', 'Material Feature': 'Vegan', 'Package Dimensions': '5.24 x 1.81 x 1.38 inches; 2.89 Ounces', 'UPC': '750258969917'}\nThis jelly facial cleanser from Vitamasques is made in Korea.<br /><br />The tube has a foil safety seal under the white cap. The cleanser is brown with a jelly-like consistency. It does have a scent, a mix of green tea and tea tree oil. I do notice the scent when using the cleanser but the scent doesn\u2019t linger.<br /><br />A small drop is enough to wash my face and neck. It doesn\u2019t make a lot of lather but does feel silky going on the skin. I really like the consistency of it.<br /><br />And I really like how well the cleanser works! It cleaned two layers of sunscreen grime and sweat off my face. Some face washes don\u2019t remove all the sunscreen residue, and I have to keep washing my face or use an exfoliating scrub. This cleanser? One wash and done. I was amazed by how well it worked.<br /><br />I\u2019m in my 30s, white, with sensitive combination skin. The cleanser did not irritate my face at all.\nGentle effectie cleanser, made in Korea",
