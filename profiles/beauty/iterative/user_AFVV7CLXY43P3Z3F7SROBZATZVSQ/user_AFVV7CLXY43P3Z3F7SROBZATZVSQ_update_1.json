(included)', 'UPC': '786738939194', 'Manufacturer': 'Duomishu'}\nReview Text: If you\u2019ve never used a water flosser before, there\u2019s a definite learning curve. Expect to get wet the first few times, if not more. The learning curve and mess is worth it -- my mouth generally feels cleaner after using one -- but I don\u2019t love this particular model.<br /><br />I wanted a water flosser that wouldn\u2019t take up a lot of space on my bathroom counter. This one is a sort of all-in-one, with the reservoir built into the handle, but I kept getting water bubbles in the tank/tip, which made flossing take a lot longer.<br /><br />There\u2019s only 3 speeds: low, medium, and high. The low is quite low. And because of where the speed switch button is, it\u2019s really easy to accidentally switch speeds while using the flosser.<br /><br />The flosser charges via USB, but with a proprietary end (not A or C or anything like that).\nReview Title: Cordless Water Flosser\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
