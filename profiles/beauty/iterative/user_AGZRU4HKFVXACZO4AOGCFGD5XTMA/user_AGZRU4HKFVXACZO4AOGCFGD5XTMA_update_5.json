The sleep mask helps greatly keeping sunlight out. I will say that the gel mask has a strong plastic smell to it which I do not enjoy. It actually makes it unbearable to wear so I\u2019ve only been using the sleep mask. If the mask did not have a scent to it it would be great. The gel when frozen feels great around your eyes and helps relieve any puffiness or it\u2019s just relaxing if I have a headache.\nReview Title: Gel mask has a plastic smell\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

No one could even tell there was a hairpiece in. The hair is nice and thick. It does advertise that heat products can be used on it.
