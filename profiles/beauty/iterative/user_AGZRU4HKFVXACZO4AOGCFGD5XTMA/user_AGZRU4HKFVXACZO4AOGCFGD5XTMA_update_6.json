  "reference_summary": "Stamped Glorious Short Hair Extensions Halo Wire Sercet Crown Synthetic Wavy Curly Brown Blonde Bayalage Hairpieces For Women Invisible (16 inch, 16H613)\nStamped Glorious\n{'Brand': 'Stamped Glorious', 'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '9.76 x 7.05 x 1.69 inches; 6.74 Ounces'}\nThe quality of this hair is great! No one could even tell there was a hairpiece in. The hair is nice and thick. It does advertise that heat products can be used on it. When trying to curl for tighter curls, it didn\u2019t really hold well, but none the less the curls it came with have held up well.\nWow! Can you even tell this is fake!!!\nScrunchie Holder Stands with 8 Pack Large Size Scrunchies - Acrylic Hair Ties Organizer for Teenage Girls and VSCO Girls Gift Stuff\nBeeager\n{'Color': 'Yellow,Gray,White', 'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Item Form': 'Scrunchie', 'Brand': 'Beeager', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Package Dimensions': '10.55 x 3.98 x 3.7 inches; 10.86 Ounces'}\nThis is such a cute idea/ makes for a cute display in my vanity room. The scrunchies are great quality and several color options for any outfit. I would recommend this to any fellow scrunchie lover!\nJust as advertised!\nBold Men, Mens Hair Brush For Head and Beard, Thick and Thin Hair Types\nBOLD MEN\n{'Brand': 'BOLD MEN', 'Shape': 'Oblong', 'Handle Material': 'Wood', 'Product Benefits': 'Smoothing', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Product Dimensions': '2.36 x 2.36 x 1.97 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '793611800557'}\nThis brush is a decent option for a beard brush, but it is pretty soft bristled. It\u2019s not a very dense brush. The bristles are kinda cheap looking but it has held up.\nSoft bristles\nShakira Perfumes - Dance for Women - Long Lasting - Femenine, Charming and Modern Perfume - Fruity Floral Notes - Ideal for Day Wear - 1.7 Fl Oz\nShakira\n{'Brand': 'Shakira', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Item Volume': '50 Milliliters', 'Scent': 'Dance', 'Special Feature': 'Long Lasting', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Language': 'English', 'Product Dimensions': '2.64 x 2.05 x 5.63 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'Item model number': '8411061823033'}\nI really love the smell of this scent. It\u2019s a nice warm seductive smell. It stays around for a long period of time and I\u2019m always so excited to spritz it on. It has a fun bottle and makes for cute display.\nSmells great!\nGel Beads Eye Mask, Cooling Eye Mask Reduce Puffy Dark Circles Migraines Headaches Stress Relief (Gel Eye Mask(Blue)+3D Sleep Mask)\nCONSGIJI\n{'Package Dimensions': '11.66 x 4.37 x 1.22 inches; 3.99 Ounces', 'UPC': '046432534324'}\nUltimately this site is a great option. The sleep mask helps greatly keeping sunlight out. I will say that the gel mask has a strong plastic smell to it which I do not enjoy. It actually makes it unbearable to wear so I\u2019ve only been using the sleep mask. If the mask did not have a scent to it it would be great. The gel when frozen feels great around your eyes and helps relieve any puffiness or it\u2019s just relaxing if I have a headache.\nGel mask has a plastic smell\nHeatless Hair Rollers Curling Rod Headband No Heat Hair Curlers Curls Silk Curling Ribbon Headband Wave Formers Hair Curlers DIY Hair Styling Tools for Long Medium Hair\nVOOA\n{'Hair Type': 'Wavy, Curly, Straight', 'Material': 'Polyester', 'Size': '3 Piece Set', 'Brand': 'VOOA', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '9 x 4.25 x 2.5 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '749652888061 749652887460'}\nI personally feel using a robe string is much easier than this method.
