Then when I mentioned it they refunded me for one instead of sending it. The hair also arrived several days after it was supposed to. I waited until I had the hair installed for at least 2 weeks before leaving this review. The hair is super thin. It thankfully feels thicker once you wash it but I have only washed it twice and it\u2019s already a horrible mess. I don\u2019t use heat on it AT ALL!!! I have slept with it in braids on a silk pillow case since day one.I only use hair extensions approved shampoo and conditioner as well as special leave in oils for moisture. It feels more like heat safe synthetic than human hair.  In my opinion it is not worth the.money at all. The only good thing about the hair is that the tapes have held up beautifully. Other than that I would say a big No to purchasing again. I would return them if I could. Very disappointed. Now I have to celebrate Christmas with a ratty nest on my head because my hair dresser is out of town until after New Years. Save your troubles and money. Go with a different brand.\nDon\u2019t do it.
