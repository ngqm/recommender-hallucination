I didn't know what it would really do but I gave it a chance and tried this stuff. Holy cow does this stuff actually work and it looks awesome and natural. Key word, natural. I used it just like the instructions said and it smoothed out the small lines at the corner of my eyes and under the eyes. It completely reduced the size of my pores on my nose, which are usually very large. I mean, it made my face look great but the real test was how did my make up look over this stuff. Well, it looked wonderful. It made my make up go on smoother than ever before and the real test was the fact it not only lasted all day but even all night until I washed my face. I couldn't believe how well Mistiq actually worked and how great it worked under my make up. This is one product that I completely recommend and suggest it be a staple in every woman's make up bag.\nRefreshing and Smoother Looking Skin\nElegant Black Quality Plastic Shark Tooth / Comb Design Head Band / Hair Holder By VAGA\nVAGA\n['Shark Tooth Shaped Black Plastic Headband', 'If you would like to see more high quality VAGA products, click on our brand name under the title of this listing.Strong headband will effectively hold straight, smooth hair as well as curly and fuzzy.Headband is 3.5cm wide.']\n{'Color': 'Black', 'Material': 'Plastic', 'Brand': 'VAGA', 'Size': 'One Size', 'Item Form': 'Elastic', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'UPC': '661799009348', 'Manufacturer': 'VAGA'}\nI am totally disappointed with this headband. One it is super cheap and easily bendable which means it will break easily. I have very fine hair so this headband is just horrible with my hair. It sticks up at the top and doesn't hold any hair back because my hair just slides out of it. Now, if someone has very thick hair then this would work perfect for them but for someone like me with very fine hair, this headband just isn't right for me.\nMade for people with thick hair!\nGot Glamour Cuticle Pusher, Stainless Steel, Professional Series\nGot Glamour\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.3 x 4.8 x 0.5 inches; 0.35 Ounces', 'UPC': '794168154841'}\nI'll admit that I do have a nail addiction and I do my nails all of the time. Honestly, it's much cheaper that way. Anyway, normally I don't fool with pushing my cuticles because I'm always loosing the wooden pushers and they always go so dull after using them for a while. Well, now I don't have to keep buying those because this cuticle pusher is awesome and made out of stainless steal. It has a really awesome design, a very nice weight so that it stays in the hand and also can be used to clean out from under the nails too.<br /><br />I really do love using this though. I always give it a little wipe with an alcohol pad and then do what I need to do. I use the curved ended down to push my cuticles back and then use it face up to clean out from under my nails, because lets face it. It doesn't matter what you do, stuff is still gonna get up in there and you have to clean it out every so often.<br /><br />Anyway, works great and totally worth the price. Couldn't recommend this enough to everyone.\nGreat Product\nAGPtEK Handmade Natural Fashion Long False Eyelashes For Makeup (10 Pairs)\nAGPTEK\n{'Brand': 'AGPTEK', 'Material Feature': 'Cruelty Free', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Mounting Type': 'Eyelash Glue', 'Unit Count': '10 count', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.8 x 3.5 x 0.75 inches; 0.8 Ounces', 'UPC': '848454074686'}\nThese are very much for the more experienced eyelash wearer as they only have a tiny string to work with and not a strip. So I have to say that if you can't work with just string lashes then do not get these. However, if you don't mind then these are great. They look beautiful and blend in so well that people honestly can't tell they are false lashes.<br /><br />I honestly love them and they look very natural and beautiful. Would be happy to buy more later on.\nBeautiful but isn't strip but instead string.\nTOUCH IN SOL Best of No Pore Blem Travel Kit - Face Makeup Primer, Big Pores Perfect Cover, Inner-Glowing Skin with Moisture, Long Lasting Makeup's Staying Kit\nTouch in Sol\n{'Brand': 'Touch in Sol', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Package Information': 'Tube', 'Item Volume': '0.5 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '6.46 x 5.39 x 1.14 inches; 5.12 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'no pore blem kit'}\nI love using this set when I am wanting to really go all out for my makeup. It makes everything last so much longer and looks so beautiful. It works great with my foundation and all of my makeup. It feels great on the skin and makes my skin so soft and smooth. It also does a great job hydrating my skin and getting it ready for makeup. Everything just works great together and love using it.\nGreat Priming Set\nMagnetic Eyelashes with Eyeliner, Invisible Magnetic Mink Magnetic Lashes Kits with 2 Liquid Eyeliner 6 Reusable Waterproof False Eyelashes, Eyelash Tweezers, Best Magnetic Eyeliner for Daily, Party\nSISILILY\n{'Color': 'Black', 'Brand': 'SISILILY', 'Material': 'Mink Fur', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '6.61 x 0.98 x 7.4 inches', 'Material Feature': 'Gluten Free', 'Product Dimensions': '6.61 x 0.98 x 7.4 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'Magnetic Eyelashes-01', 'UPC': '763043958041', 'Manufacturer': 'Viciley Cosmetic'}\nBeautiful lashes and great magnetic eyeliner. The eyeliner is totally waterproof and lasts all day without problems. Doesn't irritate my sensitive eyes and these lashes are lightweight and totally beautiful. I have worn them a few different times and they still look beautiful. I am able to clean them gently in makeup remover and then let them dry and I can wear the lashes over and over again.\nGreat Lashes and Liner\nLIGHT RAIN Press On Nails Medium - Fantasy Forest, Reusable Seven Layers UV Finish Fake Nails Short, Handmade by Licensed Nail Technician, Squoval Shape, Medium Size\nLIGHT RAIN\n{}\nThese nails are super cute and wear beautifully.
