The petals floating in the bottle are absolutely beautiful. This serum blends out nicely on my skin, it feels slightly sticky/tacky to the touch after applying but doesn't feel uncomfortable at all. The petals dissolve as you rub it around. This does a great job of moisturizing my very dry skin.\nReview Title: Hydrating but slightly sticky serum\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "N3 No Name Necessary Mattifying Shine and Oil Control Long Lasting Anti-aging Makeup Setting Spray (200ml)\nNo Name Necessary\n{'Product Dimensions': '1.7 x 1.7 x 7.5 inches; 0.81 Ounces'}\nThis spray feels slightly like hairspray when you spritz it on. It helps makeup last all day and stay matte. I personally like a dewy finish so I spray this first for longevity, then when it dries I\u2019ll spray a little dewy spray. Love the combo! Comes in a huge bottle that will last forever.\nGood spray for oily skin\nCatrice | SUNGASM Luminizing Bronzer 01 | For A Sun-Kissed Shimmery Finish | Highly Pigmented & Blendable | Vegan, Paraben Free, Oil Free | Cruelty Free\nCatrice\n{'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Brand': 'Catrice', 'Color': 'C01 Golden Ecstasy', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Product Dimensions': '2.72 x 2.72 x 0.51 inches; 1.27 Ounces'}\nThis bronzer is really pretty, it's not matte but not glittery. It has the perfect amount of shimmer/sheen that makes your skin look healthy and glowy. Perfect for summer. It blends out beautifully on my skin and looks like I have a natural tan. I have fair skin and the 01 shade doesn't pull too orange or too red on me.\nSo beautiful!\nBouquet Garni Body Shower White Musk - Unique Fragrance Decanting Engineering Method gives Long Lasting Rich Fragrance - Gentle and Mild Cleansing Scented Body Wash with Natural Surfactant 17.85 Fl Oz\nBouquet Garni\n{'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Skin Type': 'All, Dry', 'Brand': 'Bouquet Garni', 'Scent': 'Garni', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '8.23 x 6.34 x 3.66 inches; 1.34 Pounds'}\nThis body wash lathers nicely and has a pleasant, musky scent. I find I need about 3-4 pumps to wash my whole body. It came in a really nice box that would make a cute gift. I wish it had a little bit more vanilla scent to it.\nLathers nice!\nSweat Cosmetics Foundation Powder Jar SPF 30 Water + Sweat Resistant (Shade 100: light)\nSWEAT FOR ACTIVE BEAUTY\n{'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Finish Type': 'Natural', 'Package Information': 'Jar', 'Brand': 'SWEAT FOR ACTIVE BEAUTY', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '2.8 x 2.8 x 1.4 inches; 0.63 Ounces'}\nThis powder is nice enough, but it doesn't blow me away so much that I can justify spending almost $50 for a jar of powder. I have dry skin and powder often makes me look cakey, this sits on my skin nicely and doesn't look too thick or powdery. I would say this has light to medium coverage. The shade I received is 100 light, it pulls too yellow/orange on me, I wish it had a more neutral undertone. I like that it has SPF 30 and is water/sweat resistant, I will probably get a lot more use out of this in the summer than in the winter. Overall, this is a decent product but I have several other loose powder foundations that I like just as much that are a fraction of this price.\nExpensive powder\nWinky Lux Orchid Gelee Serum | Skin Brightening Serum | Hydrating Serum with Hyaluronic Acid & Ogliopeptide (30 mL / 1 fl. oz)\nWinky Lux\n{'Skin Type': 'All', 'Product Benefits': 'Anti-Aging', 'Use for': 'Face', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'Winky Lux', 'Package Dimensions': '6.34 x 1.26 x 1.18 inches; 2.89 Ounces', 'UPC': '818324025131'}\nThe packaging on this serum is stunning!
