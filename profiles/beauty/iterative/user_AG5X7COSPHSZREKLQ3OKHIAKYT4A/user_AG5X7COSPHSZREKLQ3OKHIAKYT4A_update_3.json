It helps makeup last all day and stay matte. I personally like a dewy finish so I spray this first for longevity, then when it dries I\u2019ll spray a little dewy spray. Love the combo! Comes in a huge bottle that will last forever.\nGood spray for oily skin\nCatrice | SUNGASM Luminizing Bronzer 01 | For A Sun-Kissed Shimmery Finish | Highly Pigmented & Blendable | Vegan, Paraben Free, Oil Free | Cruelty Free\nCatrice\n{'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Brand': 'Catrice', 'Color': 'C01 Golden Ecstasy', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Product Dimensions': '2.72 x 2.72 x 0.51 inches; 1.27 Ounces'}\nThis bronzer is really pretty, it's not matte but not glittery. It has the perfect amount of shimmer/sheen that makes your skin look healthy and glowy. Perfect for summer. It blends out beautifully on my skin and looks like I have a natural tan. I have fair skin and the 01 shade doesn't pull too orange or too red on me.\nSo beautiful!\nBouquet Garni Body Shower White Musk - Unique Fragrance Decanting Engineering Method gives Long Lasting Rich Fragrance - Gentle and Mild Cleansing Scented Body Wash with Natural Surfactant 17.85 Fl Oz\nBouquet Garni\n{'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Skin Type': 'All, Dry', 'Brand': 'Bouquet Garni', 'Scent': 'Garni', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '8.23 x 6.34 x 3.66 inches; 1.34 Pounds'}\nThis body wash lathers nicely and has a pleasant, musky scent.
