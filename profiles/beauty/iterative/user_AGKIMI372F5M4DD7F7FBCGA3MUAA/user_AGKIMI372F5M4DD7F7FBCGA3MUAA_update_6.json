I did not and there were huge dye stains on my pillows. I ended up washing it... there was so much dye in the sink..the water was darker than this... like, Black when I started washing it. I was running water the whole time I was washing it so the water looks like a light purple but it didn.t start that way, the water was nearly jet black at first.<br />With that said,..I like the band around it..it.s big and spacious as well.<br /><br />Update...i.ve had to wash it again and again as the stains were still getting on my white pillowcases. The dye for this thing is really strong as it doesn't wash out easily.  It can.t be all that safe having that dye seep into your scalp which, seeps into your body/system.<br />I don.t sleep in it anymore...I just wear it during the day at home when I want my hair out of the way. I ended up buying a white one and that 1 works better for me.\nReview Title: Wash It Before Wearing!\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
