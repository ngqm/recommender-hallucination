It works really well on the beard area and preps the skin for a nice, super smooth shave. It doesn\u2019t seem to strip the face of natural oils, which is great. Overall, it just leaves a really soft, clean, oil-free (the bad oils) look and feel. I would definitely recommend this for a nice clean face, especially for men with bushy beards.\nReview Title: Great for a soft clean face & beard\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
