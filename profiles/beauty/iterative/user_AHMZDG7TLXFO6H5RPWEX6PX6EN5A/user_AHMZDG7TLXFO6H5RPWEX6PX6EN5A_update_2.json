They look extremely false when on, and are very clunky. The magnetic eyeliner makes it harder to apply and keep these on. Also, if you get the eyeliner in your eye, you better have an eyewash station nearby. These are almost like toy false lashes for kids to play dress up with if the eyeliner wasn\u2019t so toxic. The lashes (3 sets) come stacked in a compact that just feels breakable and not well made. The lashes themselves are very synthetic, and not natural looking at all. I like that the kit includes an eyelash tweezer applicator, but honestly that will be the only thing getting use from this kit. It\u2019s a great concept, just poorly executed. The liner goes on and you have to quickly get the lashes placed, or you\u2019ll lose adhesiveness by the second. Even when done in a timely manner, the magnetic components in the eyeliner don\u2019t work well with the magnetic strip on the lashes, so they won\u2019t stay on long. They are large and clunky and just look very unnatural, even when trimmed. The lashes themselves have a wire look and consistency to them, and look very similar to the lashes on a toy doll, only thicker and heavier looking. Would not recommend these, even for the low price.\nReview Title: Very synthetic look and feel\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "SELF/ish Men's Face Scrub | Exfoliating Facial Cleanser | Deep Cleansing | Effective Shave Prep & Beard Exfoliator for Men | Natural Ingredients | 3.4fl oz\nMELARQT\n{'Brand': 'MELARQT', 'Item Form': 'Scrub', 'Skin Type': 'Acne Prone', 'Product Benefits': 'Exfoliating', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '6.26 x 2.09 x 2.01 inches; 4.73 Ounces', 'Department': 'Men', 'UPC': '810042384002'}\nThis face wash is so exfoliating and smells great. It works really well on the beard area and preps the skin for a nice, super smooth shave. It doesn\u2019t seem to strip the face of natural oils, which is great. Overall, it just leaves a really soft, clean, oil-free (the bad oils) look and feel. I would definitely recommend this for a nice clean face, especially for men with bushy beards.\nGreat for a soft clean face & beard\nMagnetic Eyelashes by UJM\uff0c3 Pairs Reusable Magnetic Eyelash and Eyeliner Kit Natural Look False Lashes with Mirror and Tweezers No Glue Needed Waterproof Magnetic Lashes Set\nUJM\n{'Brand': 'UJM', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '4 x 4 x 0.3 inches', 'Material Feature': 'Gluten Free', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Mounting Type': 'Eyelash Glue', 'Product Dimensions': '4 x 4 x 0.3 inches; 3.53 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'UJM-004'}\nOh these are rough.
