I spray a few pumps on my hair and smooth it in with a comb, and then let my hair air dry overnight and I\u2019ve noticed a significant difference in frizz control. My hair kinda feels/ looks poofy and frizzy after I wash it and this product tames my hair without weighing it down at all. My hair just feels softer and smoother when I use it, but I don\u2019t feel it in my hair at all, it quickly absorbs. I have long hair and this size is more of a travel size bottle for me, even using just a few pumps every few nights, I\u2019m down to the last bit of product. I will likely order it again because it\u2019s seamless for frizz, and I like how weightless it is.\nReview Title: Controls frizz w/o adding weight to hair\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "SELF/ish Men's Face Scrub | Exfoliating Facial Cleanser | Deep Cleansing | Effective Shave Prep & Beard Exfoliator for Men | Natural Ingredients | 3.4fl oz\nMELARQT\n{'Brand': 'MELARQT', 'Item Form': 'Scrub', 'Skin Type': 'Acne Prone', 'Product Benefits': 'Exfoliating', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '6.26 x 2.09 x 2.01 inches; 4.73 Ounces', 'Department': 'Men', 'UPC': '810042384002'}\nThis face wash is so exfoliating and smells great. It works really well on the beard area and preps the skin for a nice, super smooth shave. It doesn\u2019t seem to strip the face of natural oils, which is great. Overall, it just leaves a really soft, clean, oil-free (the bad oils) look and feel. I would definitely recommend this for a nice clean face, especially for men with bushy beards.\nGreat for a soft clean face & beard\nMagnetic Eyelashes by UJM\uff0c3 Pairs Reusable Magnetic Eyelash and Eyeliner Kit Natural Look False Lashes with Mirror and Tweezers No Glue Needed Waterproof Magnetic Lashes Set\nUJM\n{'Brand': 'UJM', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '4 x 4 x 0.3 inches', 'Material Feature': 'Gluten Free', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Mounting Type': 'Eyelash Glue', 'Product Dimensions': '4 x 4 x 0.3 inches; 3.53 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'UJM-004'}\nOh these are rough. They look extremely false when on, and are very clunky. The magnetic eyeliner makes it harder to apply and keep these on. Also, if you get the eyeliner in your eye, you better have an eyewash station nearby. These are almost like toy false lashes for kids to play dress up with if the eyeliner wasn\u2019t so toxic. The lashes (3 sets) come stacked in a compact that just feels breakable and not well made. The lashes themselves are very synthetic, and not natural looking at all. I like that the kit includes an eyelash tweezer applicator, but honestly that will be the only thing getting use from this kit. It\u2019s a great concept, just poorly executed. The liner goes on and you have to quickly get the lashes placed, or you\u2019ll lose adhesiveness by the second. Even when done in a timely manner, the magnetic components in the eyeliner don\u2019t work well with the magnetic strip on the lashes, so they won\u2019t stay on long. They are large and clunky and just look very unnatural, even when trimmed. The lashes themselves have a wire look and consistency to them, and look very similar to the lashes on a toy doll, only thicker and heavier looking. Would not recommend these, even for the low price.\nVery synthetic look and feel\nminihope Women's Elastic Hair Tiea, Black, 120 Count (Pack of 1), 4MM for Medium Hair.Value pack.\nminihope\n{'Material': 'Metal', 'Item Form': 'elastic', 'Brand': 'minihope', 'Hair Type': 'Medium, Thick', 'Number of Pieces': '120', 'Package Dimensions': '6.3 x 2.9 x 2.2 inches; 7.2 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'ET-SET-200703', 'UPC': '725683672763 661757097431'}\nThese are very good quality! The price point and value for your money is great. The hair ties are strong and don\u2019t break like normal ones, and you get four packs of 30 bands and two beret clips for the price of one pack of normal hair ties. The brand is very user friendly and they left a cute little note in the package.\nStrong\u2014 good quality\u2014 great value\nMD Complete Bright & Healthy Vitamin C+ Vitalizing Face Serum| with Vitamin C, Vitamin E and Herbal Extracts | Potent Antioxidant Protection, Nourishes, Brightens and Evens Skin 0.5 fl oz\nMD Complete by Dr. Brian Zelickson\n{'Skin Type': 'Acne Prone, Sensitive', 'Use for': 'Face', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'MD Complete by Dr. Brian Zelickson', 'Item Form': 'Serum', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.05 x 1.63 x 3.75 inches; 4.97 Ounces', 'UPC': '850458005573'}\nI\u2019m not a huge fan of face oils but this product is great! It goes on light and makes your skin feel moisturized while also giving it a natural glow and radiance. The smell is subtle but good, it smells vaguely like an orange, and goes on sheer and not greasy. I love that it\u2019s giving my skin the extra vitamin C that it needs.\nGreat sheerness and vitamin C content\nGel UV Nail Lamp, AsperX 150W LED Nail Dryer Gel Nail Polish Light Curing Lamp Kit Smart Auto-sensing with 10/30/60/99s Timer\nAsperX\n{'Brand': 'AsperX', 'Material': 'Gel', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '8.9 x 8.03 x 4.33 inches', 'Product Dimensions': '8.9\"D x 8.03\"W x 4.33\"H'}\nThis is a decent portable nail lamp. It\u2019s affordable, very lightweight, easy to use, and comes with some accessories and the settings on the lamp are convenient. It takes a bit longer than I was hoping to fully dry, but after about 10 minutes, you\u2019re good to go. I like this because it\u2019s small and light so I can pack it with me anywhere. It is easy to use, and a child could use it (with supervision so they don\u2019t look into the light) because you just slide your hand under the light and it will detect your hand and start the light/ drying process. I have noticed that the lag time seems to be getting longer on the motion detecting light, but it\u2019s not extremely bothersome. Sometimes it takes a few swipes, but it generally works. It\u2019s a great thing to have if you enjoy doing your nails at home, or even just a fun \u201cspa\u201d thing to do with your friends, or kids during winter and/ or quarantine. This is by no means a professional style nail lamp but for the price, it gets the job done.\nLightweight, compact, easy/ fun to use\nLANGE HAIR Extend\u00e9 Conditioning Detangler Hair Spray - Paraben Free Leave-in Conditioner Spray, Detangles and Hydrates Hair, Moisture & Shine | 4OZ\n{'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Material Feature': 'Paraben Free', 'Hair Type': 'Curly, Dry', 'Product Benefits': 'Helps protect color and reinforces strands, leaving them strong and vibrant', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '6.5 x 1.4 x 1.4 inches; 4 Ounces', 'UPC': '793150592708'}\nThe scent is very refreshing and mild, it almost just blends with your shampoo/ conditioner.
