This cream does indeed absorb into the skin.  It feels refreshing & it doesn't have a scent to me.  I've been using a lot of various serums & having an actual cream to use is a nice change!

I'm getting my granddaughter one because she uses a brush on her wet long hair.  She really needs to quit pulling & breaking her hair.
