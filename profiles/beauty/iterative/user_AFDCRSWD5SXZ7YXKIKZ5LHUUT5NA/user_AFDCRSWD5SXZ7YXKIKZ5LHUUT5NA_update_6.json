Well, not fun-fun, but interesting.  I can't believe how much dead skin comes off while you are &#34;sanding&#34; your feet!  It is amazing!<br />  No amount of foot scrubs or using the little egg with blades could do better.  This Callus Remover is so easy to use.  When I am finished using this remover, I admire & touch my feet - then I put lotion or vaseline on & then some white socks.  I wear the socks overnight.  In the morning, my feet are so soft & free of dead skin & any beginnings of calluses.  Easy!  I don't use the remover every night, just maybe once or twice a week.  Maybe, skip a week.  So it doesn't feel like just another chore.<br />  This Callus Remover comes nicely packaged & you get a cleaning brush & 2 rollers.  I just wish I knew where I could get some extra rollers.  I feel the machine itself might outlast the 2 rollers.  If I find some rollers that fit - I'll update my review.<br />  I did receive my remover for a reduced cost for an honest opinion.  Thank You!!\nReview Title: ... from Smooth N Clear How can this actually be fun? Well\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
