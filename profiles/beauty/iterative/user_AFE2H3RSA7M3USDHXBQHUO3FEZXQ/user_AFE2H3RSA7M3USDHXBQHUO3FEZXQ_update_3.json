  "profile": "**Updated User Profile Summary:**\n\n- **Purchase Preference:** The user continues to prefer human hair extensions, particularly curly textures. However, their recent purchase from a new brand has led to disappointment due to false advertisement of the product's material, indicating that they may be more cautious in exploring new brands in the future.\n- **Quality Expectation:** They maintain high expectations for softness and a natural look in hair products. The latest experience highlights a significant deviation from their quality standards, as they received a blend of synthetic hair instead of the promised human hair.\n- **Rating Trend:** The user has expressed dissatisfaction for the first time, rating the recent product poorly due to issues with quality and accuracy of advertisement. This suggests an important shift in their previously consistently positive rating pattern.\n- **Brand Affinity:** Although still open to new brands, the user's recent negative experience with a specific brand may lead to increased scrutiny when considering alternatives in the future.\n- **Hair Color Preference:** Remains focused on natural colors, consistent with previous purchases.\n- **Length Preference:** Continues to seek 18-inch extensions, but their recent purchase also included longer lengths, indicating some flexibility.\n- **Interaction Style:** Their review reflected frustration and disappointment, contrasting sharply with earlier positive expressions of satisfaction.\n\nOverall, while the user values high-quality, natural-looking curly hair extensions, recent experiences have prompted a more discerning approach to brand exploration, emphasizing the need for honest marketing and product quality.",
