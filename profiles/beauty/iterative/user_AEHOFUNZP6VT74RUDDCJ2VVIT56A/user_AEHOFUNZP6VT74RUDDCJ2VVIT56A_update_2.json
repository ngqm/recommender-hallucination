Flowbee was my trusted hair-management solution for all these years until I had the opportunity to try Norelco's 'Power Hair Clipper', model QC5055.<br /><br />I am unlikely to ever return to Flowbee now because the QC5055 does the job much faster, it's less noisy and delivers a much better quality haircut.<br /><br />Operation:<br /><br />Once charged, all you need to do is attach the proper comb (see below), select the desired hair length and proceed with cutting.<br /><br />Hair-cutting tends to be a borderline traumatic experience for me - I'm a long hair type person - but this was a near-painless experience. I am looking forward to more future haircuts. It goes fast, smooth and easy. From time to time, you may have to clean the comb and/or the clipping attachment but that can be done quickly and easily. My wife gave me a near-professional-quality haircut in about 10-15 minutes and finished me with sufficient momentum to place our 12 yr. son under the cutter and 'even him out' as well.<br /><br />What you get:<br /><br />- The hair clipper body hosting the rechargeable batteries.<br />- The clipping attachment<br />- Stainless steel, self-sharpening cutting blades<br />- Large comb<br />- Small comb<br />- Stubble comb<br />- Charger<br />- Cleaning brush<br />- English/Spanish instructions<br />- Registration card with $20 coupon offer<br /><br />Some specs:<br /><br />- Battery life is rated at about 35 minutes.<br />- Charge time is 10 hours.<br />- Cuts hair from .12 in./3 mm to 1.61 in./41 mm.<br />- 15 length settings between the 3 combs (seven on each of the large and small combs plus the stubble comb)<br /><br />Returns and warranties:<br /><br />There's a 45-day money back guarantee promise if the customer can provide proof of purchase and ships the item, insured, to Norelco at own expense.<br /><br />The 2-year warranty promises to replace defective products for as long as the customer didn't do anything 'unreasonable' and he/she paid for shipping the item to Norelco, preferably insured.

A couple of years ago, I bought 2 of these for my 2 boys. One of them stopped working after a couple of weeks - was able to return it to Amazon and get a replacement - and the other stopped after a little over one month. The replacement stopped working after about one month as well.<br /><br />The big problem with this toothbrush is the battery compartment. Since it's using 'throw away' batteries, a bad thing by itself, there is a need for a lid to allow removal/insertion of batteries. At this price, the lid does not close tightly and water creeps in. Eventually, the entire thing stops working.<br /><br />Pros for this toothbrush:<br />- low price.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- short life due to almost inevitable water damage<br />- use of 'throw away' batteries<br /><br />My recommendation: avoid.<br /><br />Spend a few more and get a true Sonicare. You won't regret it. I've been using Sonicare tooth brushes for almost 10 years now. My first one was replaced after more than 5 years, mostly because I wanted a new one. My current is alive and kicking and it's likely to last for many more years if I don't choose to replace it.\nAvoid.
