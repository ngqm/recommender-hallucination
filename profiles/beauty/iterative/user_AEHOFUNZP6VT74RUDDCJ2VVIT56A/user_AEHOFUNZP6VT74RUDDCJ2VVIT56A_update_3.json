After several weeks of using it I can say that the Arcitec is 'better' that the 8140XL and I am therefore pleased with my purchase. While the end result of shaving is basically the same which is not surprising because the Arcitec implements the same 'lift and cut' technology, it appears to be much gentler to my skin, the more flexible shaving heads better follow my face and neck, has a better grip, comes with a more protective storage/charger pod and, of course, is prettier.<br /><br />But, let's go into some details:<br /><br />PACKAGING, CONTENTS AND PRESENTATION<br /><br />The shaver comes to you inside a triple-layered protective/defensive enclosure, hard plastic over cardboard over another clamshell (but easy to open) protective plastic layer. It's not totally bullet-proof but it probably ensures that most units don't suffer any damage while in transit.<br /><br />Inside I found:<br /><br />- The shaver itself<br />- Super-protective (for travel mostly) charging pod<br />- Cleaning brush<br />- Charging stand<br />- Sliding razor head cap<br />- 100/240V power cord<br />- User manual and warranty statement (English/Spanish)<br />- Quick start guide card<br /><br />Taking the shaver out of its packaging, understanding its operation and making it work was relatively easy.<br /><br />The manual, covering FOUR separate models is surprisingly well written to the extent that you are not annoyed by having to find the paragraph that applies to your specific model so, know thy model number (it's a 1050). It covers everything, from features, charging options, shaving tips and techniques, cleaning, storage and replacement of the razor head. I've actually read it and I am better off for it.<br /><br />FEATURES AND OPERATION<br /><br />Charging<br />--------<br />This is one of Arcitec's better features. The manual claims (verified) that it can take a full charge in about one hour and, once charged. I didn't count shaving minutes but, at least with a brand-new battery you won't need to recharge it very often. In 'emergencies', just 3 minutes of charging should give you 3 minutes of shave time.<br /><br />There is no way to replace the battery inside the shaver but, based on my experience with Architec's precursor, my 2.5 year old 8140XL, this should not be an issue. After all these years the battery still allows me to shave several times before a recharge is needed.<br /><br />You charge your shaver by either placing it on the charging stand or inside the charging pod. Philips recommends that you do not keep the charging stand continuously connected to the power outlet and I have no problem with that. One one-hour charge session keeps my shaver going for several weeks (I only shave 2-3 times per week).<br /><br />Shaving<br />--------<br />The feature most of us buy a shaver for :)... It's okay, for an electric shaver. I won't say that \"it's as close as a blade\" because it isn't but that's not why I switched from blade shaving to electric some 7 years ago. I am using an electric shaver because shaving with a blade had my skin irritated, especially on my neck. The 8140XL was okay but my neck still felt uncomfortable. The Architec does NOT irritate my neck at all and this is a very good thing.<br /><br />The above comes with a price. Shaving takes a lot longer. You need to go over the same area several times before all the hairs are 'lifted and cut' but that was a tradeoff I understood and I accepted. Norleco claim that the Arcitec has \"50% more shaving surface\" (compare with the old 8140XL claim of \"up to 50% more shaving surface\") is just marketing hype and always left me ask myself \"50% more than what?\". The reality is that the 3 heads together add up to a decent shaving surface, and the Arcitec's are not larger than the 8140XL's but I would not call them 'humongously large\". And, again, contrary to marketing claims, shaving with the Arcitec or with just about any other electric shaver is not 'fast'.<br /><br />As I noted before, the Arcitec is very gentle to my skin and this is the main reason, other than good looks, that I prefer it over the older model. Sometimes you need to go several times over the same neck spot because 'lift and cut' is good but not perfect but my experience with the Arcitec is that my skin tolerates it pretty well.<br /><br />Trimmer<br />--------<br />A small trimmer can be pulled out when needed. I am not going to use it that much but I was able to successfully and quickly trim my mustache. It's a useful feature.<br /><br />Other bells and whistles<br />-----------------------<br />When needed, a number of indicators/warnings discretely light up on shaver's body: low battery, charing indicator, needs cleaning indicator, travel lock and shaving head replacement indicator.<br /><br />MAINTENANCE<br /><br />I don't like spending a lot of time taking care of my shaving tools and the Arcitec does not need a lot of maintenance. Each of the 3 individual heads can be opened and the hair fragments stored inside are washed away in seconds. Any that don't go can be removed with the providing brush. It's possible to also use liquid soap or degreasing liquid (alcohol) solutions for cleaning but I haven't yet.<br /><br />The trimmer, if used extensively, could use a couple of drops of mineral oil once or twice per year.<br /><br />Norelco recommends that the full shaving head assembly is replaced once a year and an 'replace head' indicator should light up on the shaver when that time comes but we are not there yet and I will be making that decision when the time comes.<br /><br />SUPPORT AND WARRANTY<br /><br />There is a 45-day money back guarantee. Philips Norelco promise to fully refund your purchase price if you ship them back the product within 45 days of your purchase date. You will be paying for shipping and insurance and they are not responsible for lost items - therefore the need for insurance.<br /><br />In addition, there is a 2-year limited warranty and warrants against defects and, of course, you lose coverage if you abuse your shaver or you try to fix it your self or through unauthorized repairers.<br /><br />The 800 numbers you need to call for support or warranty service are printed on several locations on the box and on the manual.<br /><br />Made in Holland.<br /><br />DESIGN AND ERGONOMICS<br /><br />'The looks' is clearly Arcitec's distinguishing feature. I like it but I'm not going to say more because everyone can see the images posted on Amazon's page. As I noted above, all indicators and warnings light up when only when needed and are invisible at any other time. The Arcitec's body shape makes for a very comfortable grip while shaving. I also appreciated the little suction cups at the bottom of the charging stand that add to its stability.<br /><br />The charging pod, on the other hand, is a little too bulky and it's not easy to close/open and it can't store then shaver while the heads cap is on. I didn't take it on the road yet but, when I do I may appreciate how it protects my shaver but, on the other hand, I don't believe any of my shavers was ever damaged while travelling so I'm not so sure the bulkiness is justified.<br /><br />Finally, I wish there was some 'case' to carry or store everything. The way the shaver comes, it's possibly to store it inside the pod but then the heads cap, the cleaning brush and the charging cord are 'outside' and they are easy to lose, especially the first two.<br /><br />MY RATING<br /><br />I am pleased with my purchase and Arcitec is now my 'regular' shaver. Losing the occasional red spots on my neck was very much worth it. Besides the comfortable shave the Arcitec comes with pretty good support (money back promise, 800 support number), looks good and, based on my prior experience with an earlier Philips Norelco shaver, is likely to last for a long, long time. Some of the marketing claims: quick shave, 50% larger (than what???) are a little bit exaggerated but... that's what our reviews are for.<br /><br />I hesitated between 4 (I like it) and 5 (I love it) stars. If you expect the Arcitec to fulfill all the marketing claims, you may be slightly disappointed but if you know what to expect from an electric shaver and understand that real-world miracles are very rare, then a 5 star may be the fair rating. I will do a 4 stars at this time for a good quality, well designed electric shaver that appears to be an incremental improvement over previous generations but whose capabilities may be a little over-hyped.<br /><br />--<br />>> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;\nReview Title: Above average shaver, doesn't irritate my skin, pretty\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

A couple of years ago, I bought 2 of these for my 2 boys. One of them stopped working after a couple of weeks - was able to return it to Amazon and get a replacement - and the other stopped after a little over one month. The replacement stopped working after about one month as well.<br /><br />The big problem with this toothbrush is the battery compartment. Since it's using 'throw away' batteries, a bad thing by itself, there is a need for a lid to allow removal/insertion of batteries. At this price, the lid does not close tightly and water creeps in. Eventually, the entire thing stops working.<br /><br />Pros for this toothbrush:<br />- low price.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- short life due to almost inevitable water damage<br />- use of 'throw away' batteries<br /><br />My recommendation: avoid.<br /><br />Spend a few more and get a true Sonicare. You won't regret it. I've been using Sonicare tooth brushes for almost 10 years now. My first one was replaced after more than 5 years, mostly because I wanted a new one. My current is alive and kicking and it's likely to last for many more years if I don't choose to replace it.\nAvoid.

Flowbee was my trusted hair-management solution for all these years until I had the opportunity to try Norelco's 'Power Hair Clipper', model QC5055.<br /><br />I am unlikely to ever return to Flowbee now because the QC5055 does the job much faster, it's less noisy and delivers a much better quality haircut.<br /><br />Operation:<br /><br />Once charged, all you need to do is attach the proper comb (see below), select the desired hair length and proceed with cutting.<br /><br />Hair-cutting tends to be a borderline traumatic experience for me - I'm a long hair type person - but this was a near-painless experience. I am looking forward to more future haircuts. It goes fast, smooth and easy. From time to time, you may have to clean the comb and/or the clipping attachment but that can be done quickly and easily. My wife gave me a near-professional-quality haircut in about 10-15 minutes and finished me with sufficient momentum to place our 12 yr. son under the cutter and 'even him out' as well.<br /><br />What you get:<br /><br />- The hair clipper body hosting the rechargeable batteries.<br />- The clipping attachment<br />- Stainless steel, self-sharpening cutting blades<br />- Large comb<br />- Small comb<br />- Stubble comb<br />- Charger<br />- Cleaning brush<br />- English/Spanish instructions<br />- Registration card with $20 coupon offer<br /><br />Some specs:<br /><br />- Battery life is rated at about 35 minutes.<br />- Charge time is 10 hours.<br />- Cuts hair from .12 in./3 mm to 1.61 in./41 mm.<br />- 15 length settings between the 3 combs (seven on each of the large and small combs plus the stubble comb)<br /><br />Returns and warranties:<br /><br />There's a 45-day money back guarantee promise if the customer can provide proof of purchase and ships the item, insured, to Norelco at own expense.<br /><br />The 2-year warranty promises to replace defective products for as long as the customer didn't do anything 'unreasonable' and he/she paid for shipping the item to Norelco, preferably insured. Proof of purchase, of course, is a must.<br /><br />What I liked:<br /><br />Other than the surprising ease of use and operation and the quality of the haircut, I liked the easy cleaning and maintenance and the fact that, if needed, it can operate in a 'corded' mode. The comfortable, rubberized grip makes hair cutting, even self-cutting easy and efficient.<br /><br />The brief manual is written in good English and is very good at illustrating cleaning and assembly and has very good advice on maintenance, preserving battery life and even some haircutting tips.<br /><br />Issues:<br /><br />My big problem and the only one so far is the lack of some case or storage box. With so many parts of which some are small and/or fragile, not providing some way to store them, protect them and keeping them organized is inexcusable.<br /><br />Rating:<br /><br />This would have been an easy 5-star if it came with a case. Since it doesn't, it gets 4.<br /><br />I still recommend the QC5055 most highly but be prepared to supply your own box or pouch - I did - or risk losing combs or the cleaning tools or maybe misplace the essential charger.\nHello QC5055, Goodbye Flowbee :)\nPhilips Norelco arcitec 1050 Men's Shaver\nPHILIPS\n['From the Manufacturer', 'Select the right shaving head for you!Renew for better results series shaving head', 'arc', 'itec', '1050CC', ',', '1060', '1050/1050X', ',', '1090', 'Smart-Touch XL', '9199XL', 'Speed-XL', '8240XL', ',', '8260XLCC', '7310XL', ',', '7340XL', '7810XL', '7400 - 7800', '6940LC', '5400 - 5800', '4000', 'NIVEA FOR MEN Razor', '8020X/33', '8040X/18', '8060X/25', 'HS 800Nivea Shaving conditioner for NIVEA FOR MEN razor 7700', 'HQ 170Shaving lotion for Cool Skin HQ 171Shaving gel for Cool Skin 6700', 'HQ 170Shaving lotion for Cool Skin HQ 171Shaving gel for Cool Skin Cleaningaccessory', 'HQ 200', 'Cleaning solution for JetClean System']\n{'Brand': 'PHILIPS', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Included Components': 'Battery', 'Item Weight': '0.01 Ounces', 'Color': 'Black/Gray', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2.4 x 2.2 x 6.2 inches; 0.01 Ounces', 'Item model number': '1050/1050X', 'Department': 'Shaving and Hair Removal', 'UPC': '075020000958', 'Manufacturer': 'Philips Norelco'}\nThe Arcitec is replacing my almost 3 year old [[ASIN:B0012TLPBQ Philips Norelco Speedxl Men's Shave]] which served me well for all this time but, when the time came to replace the old 8140XL's heads I happened to notice that a brand-new Arcitec was available as a 'lightning deal' for some $35 more so I took advantage of the opportunity.

I didn't take it on the road yet but, when I do I may appreciate how it protects my shaver but, on the other hand, I don't believe any of my shavers was ever damaged while travelling so I'm not so sure the bulkiness is justified.<br /><br />Finally, I wish there was some 'case' to carry or store everything. The way the shaver comes, it's possibly to store it inside the pod but then the heads cap, the cleaning brush and the charging cord are 'outside' and they are easy to lose, especially the first two.<br /><br />MY RATING<br /><br />I am pleased with my purchase and Arcitec is now my 'regular' shaver. Losing the occasional red spots on my neck was very much worth it. Besides the comfortable shave the Arcitec comes with pretty good support (money back promise, 800 support number), looks good and, based on my prior experience with an earlier Philips Norelco shaver, is likely to last for a long, long time. Some of the marketing claims: quick shave, 50% larger (than what???) are a little bit exaggerated but... that's what our reviews are for.<br /><br />I hesitated between 4 (I like it) and 5 (I love it) stars. If you expect the Arcitec to fulfill all the marketing claims, you may be slightly disappointed but if you know what to expect from an electric shaver and understand that real-world miracles are very rare, then a 5 star may be the fair rating. I will do a 4 stars at this time for a good quality, well designed electric shaver that appears to be an incremental improvement over previous generations but whose capabilities may be a little over-hyped.<br /><br />--<br />>> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;\nAbove average shaver, doesn't irritate my skin, pretty",
