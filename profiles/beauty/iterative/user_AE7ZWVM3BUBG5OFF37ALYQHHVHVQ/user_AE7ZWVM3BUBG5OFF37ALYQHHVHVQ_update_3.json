It comes in a flip case with a mirror.  They are very pigmented, and were fun to play with.  I went all out on the shimmery dark pink and gold, as I've always wanted to try bright shimmery shadow. The colors are very buildable and there was minimal fallout.  I loved how bright these are and how well they show up on my skin tone. Great for a wow look!\nReview Title: Fun bright colors!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Precious LUXURY CAVIAR GEL CREAM-sheer and weightless,rich with precious caviar extract,full of vitamins and minerals.Smooth skin.Light texture,quickly absorbed. 1.7fl.oz(50Ml)\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2.56 x 2.56 x 2.24 inches; 4.8 Ounces'}\nI really want to give this product 5 stars, but the heavy perfumey smell is what downgrades it to a 4 star review.<br /><br />Other than that, this product is GREAT for the face.  It is chock full of great ingredients of the skin, and looks like a super high end spa face cream.  I love that it has caviar extract in it, which makes it not run-of-the-mill.  It absorbs so quicky into the skin and leaves my face feeling soft and supple for days afterward.<br /><br />If only it didn't have such a strong perfume smell, then I'd wear it more often.  If you are sensitive or allergic to perfumed creams, then I would skip this.  The smell lingers heavily all day.\nNice facial cream, but heavy on the perfumes.\nJUNG SAEM MOOL OFFICIAL] JUNGSAEMMOOL Minifying Cica Mist Balm\nJUNG SAEM MOOL\n{'Brand': 'JUNG SAEM MOOL', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Country/Region Of Origin': 'Republic of Korea', 'Package Dimensions': '3.23 x 3.07 x 1.14 inches; 2.08 Ounces'}\nThis is a Korean face balm, that is supposed to sooth sensitive skin and cover up redness on the skin. The instructions and all the ads on Amazon are in Korean, and I HIGHLY recommend that the sellers switch this to include English instructions. I had to go to their website in order to find out the ingredients and what it was supposed to do for the skin, and most people aren't going to do that.<br />To continue, the balm contains 2 plant ingredientspine sprouts and centella asiatica roots.  The cica pine water helps sooth and moisturize sensitive skin.  The color in the balm comes from calamine powder, which helps cover red areas of the skin.  It is a 100% vegan formula.  The balm comes in a compact with a puff applicator.  The puff is eco-friendly and anti-bacterial.  This is meant to be applied as the last step during the skincare routine and before you apply your makeup.<br /><br />Overall, I found this product easy to apply.  You dip the poof into the cream balm, and then apply it to the skin. It has an almost creamy texture on the skin, and absorbs in quickly.  It has a slight white cast when I used it but that went away as it absorbed in.  I was hoping to use this as a color corrective on red areas on my skin before I applied concealer (I currently do not use foundation).  Overall I think it is nice, but it really hasn't gotten rid of any redness on my skin.  I do like the way it feels though and I think it helps my makeup go on smoother, so I plan to keep using it.\nCalming face balm\nessence | Welcome to Miami Eyeshadow Palette | 12 Highly Pigmented, Blendable Shades | Matte & Metallic | Vegan & Cruelty Free | Made Without Oil, Fragrance, Parabens, Alcohol, & Microplastic Particles\nessence cosmetics\n[\"\u00a1BIENVENIDOS A MIAMI!
