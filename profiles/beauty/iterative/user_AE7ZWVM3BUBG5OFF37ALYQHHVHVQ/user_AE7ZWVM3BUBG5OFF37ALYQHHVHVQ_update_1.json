It is chock full of great ingredients of the skin, and looks like a super high end spa face cream.  I love that it has caviar extract in it, which makes it not run-of-the-mill.  It absorbs so quicky into the skin and leaves my face feeling soft and supple for days afterward.<br /><br />If only it didn't have such a strong perfume smell, then I'd wear it more often.  If you are sensitive or allergic to perfumed creams, then I would skip this.  The smell lingers heavily all day.\nReview Title: Nice facial cream, but heavy on the perfumes.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
