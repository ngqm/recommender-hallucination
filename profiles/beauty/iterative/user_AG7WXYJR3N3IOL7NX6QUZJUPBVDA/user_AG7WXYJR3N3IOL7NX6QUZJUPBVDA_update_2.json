It begain with a very roomy pair of applicator gloves (man-sized) and an easy to pour solution into the applicator bottle containing the developer. I have been coloring my hair for most of my life and I applied the product and left to sit at my computer while the color did its thing. I was pleased that it didn't have a terrible odor and that it didn't drip. Those were two great positives. I did not look in the mirror until I renetered the bathroom and was shocked to see that the stuff on my head had turned a dark reddish shade.  I was hopeful that it would wash off in the shower and that my hair would appear a light golden blond as advertised and it did. While the change from my former product results gave me a surprise, it actually flatters my skin tone and I am glad I gave it a try. Will continue using it because I love the new shade on me. I added it to my Subscribe and Save products.<br /><br />My hair is mow varigated strawberry blond, but my hair was always varigated because some parts are white, some parts are grey, some parts I really can't see (the back of my head);  it is more strawberry blond than golden blond.<br /><br />I suspect that one's results will depend upon your own hair. I actually find the change refreshing.\nReview Title: Natural Light Golden Blond  Results on My Hair\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
