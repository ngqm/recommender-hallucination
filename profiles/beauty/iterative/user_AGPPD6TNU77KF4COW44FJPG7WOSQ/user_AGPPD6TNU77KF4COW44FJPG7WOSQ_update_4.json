Had to get this to go with my palette! It's a peachy / gold, and arrived in pretty good shape... the pan, as  as the mirror is HUGE! It's really light weight too,  which is why I took off a star.. it was also slightly cracked on the edge,too, but I am going to use it, so that's fine... Great Formula!
