I got the gold and the silver and by themselves they don\u2019t pop but I made a design with other colors and it looked good. It takes a few more dries under the light to cure. One bottle did come with the label upside down. It\u2019s inexpensive and kinda feels it.\nOk\nLenaqueen Wig Caps for Making Wigs Open Wig Caps with PVC Paper for DIY Wigs Swiss Lace Wig Cap with Adjustable Strap for Weave Wig (Medium, Black)\nLenaqueen\n{'Product Dimensions': '2.36 x 1.18 x 0.39 inches; 0.42 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'LNWIGCAP'}\nThis is a good quality wig cap that comes with 3 combs. It\u2019s easy to fit on to the head and it feels comfortable. I plan to use this to make a weave and think it\u2019s good quality for that.\nGood quality\nLenaqueen Velvet Wig Grip Band Adjustable No Slip Wig Grip Headbands for Women Keep Wigs in Place Grip Wig Bands (Black)\nLenaqueen\n{'Material': 'Velvet', 'Fabric Type': 'Velvet', 'Brand': 'Lenaqueen', 'Product Dimensions': '2.36 x 1.18 x 0.39 inches; 0.32 Ounces'}\nI\u2019m new to wig grips but I really like them. I use this one on my headband wig in order to keep it from shifting on my head. It\u2019s easy to put on and does not add a bulge to the wig.\nWig grip\nO.M.CHIC Mannequin Head with shoulders for wig, Display wigs Eyeglasses Necklaces and Earrings\nO.M.CHIC\n{'Package Dimensions': '18.3 x 15.7 x 9 inches; 5.1 Pounds', 'UPC': '714676502699 714676502675'}\nI really like this mannequin. It\u2019s different to others that I\u2019ve had. It is able to stand alone without the use of a tripod thanks to its base. Her make up is great for accentuating wigs or jewelry I want to display for sale. Her lips give a bit of attitude which I like.

My first time with different color eyeliners and I really like them. It\u2019s waterproof and lasts a hood few hours. I unintentionally fell i asleep in the blue and it was a mess the day after but that\u2019s to be expected. I wore to work (in a kitchen/chef duties) and it lasted, so it pretty good in my books.\nGreat combination and a fantastic price\nAuban Sleep Hair Wrap Bonnet Eye Cover Large Black Satin Cap for Sleeping Silk Cap Double Layer for Long Hair Curl Women Sleeping Protection Hair Beanie Block Light\nAuban\n['Thanks for your interest in', 'Auban Sleep Bonnet Eye Cover Cap', 'FEATURES  1.
