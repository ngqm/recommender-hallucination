It\u2019s different to others that I\u2019ve had. It is able to stand alone without the use of a tripod thanks to its base. Her make up is great for accentuating wigs or jewelry I want to display for sale. Her lips give a bit of attitude which I like. It\u2019s good quality and I think well price.\nReview Title: Excellent quality\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I got the gold and the silver and by themselves they don\u2019t pop but I made a design with other colors and it looked good. It takes a few more dries under the light to cure.
