I have been using this for about 3 weeks and notice longer lashes and thicker eyebrows.  I use it twice a day.  UPDATE:  I am on my second tube and I hope they do not stop making this stuff.  I have tried other serums but they burned my eyes.  This ones does not burn unless I actually drop it into my eye.  It has improved the length and health of my lashes and I seem to have more lashes when I curl them.  I am happy with this product and do not feel the need to purchase anything more expensive or that might work faster.\nNotice a difference after about 3 weeks.\nEyebrow Makeup Gel, Eyebrow Tint Gel, Eyebrow Dye Cream, 2Pcs Natural Color Eyebrow Gel, Waterproof Long Lasting Eyebrow Dye Gel for Eyebrow Makeup\nCidBestOfficial\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.84 x 2.32 x 0.75 inches; 1.62 Ounces'}\nWorks really well on my greying brows.
