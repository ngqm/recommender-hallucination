  "reference_summary": "Cutting Scissors Set 10 Pcs Professional Hairdressing Scissors Kit, Hair Cutting Scissors, Thinning Shears, Hair Razor Comb, Clips, Cape, Shears Kit for Home, Salon, Barber\nP.travel\n{'Brand': 'P.travel', 'Included Components': 'Scissors', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Blade Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Package Dimensions': '11.2 x 5.5 x 1.5 inches; 11.22 Ounces', 'UPC': '740646020214', 'Manufacturer': 'P.travel'}\n[[VIDEOID:e63684315904fe3d7cd3092a12671e7d]] This is a great kit for my household. We do touch ups in between our appointments. The cape is thin and has small ties in the back but works perfect for both my husband and I. The scissors are a little bigger so for my smaller hands I could use a little bit smaller pair but it does the trick. I also have used the cape when I dye my roots and it works great to keep me protected.\nPerfect kit for my touch ups\nRevitalizing N.M.F Intensive Hydrating Serum that treats Dull, Tired, Dry and Sensitive Skin from Manilla Natural Skincare\nManilla Natural Skincare\n{'Skin Type': 'mature', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydration', 'Brand': 'Manilla Natural Skincare', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Hydrating,Wrinkles', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.38 x 1.38 x 3.54 inches; 3.99 Ounces'}\nI am a lover of high quality face serums because they soak into your skin without leaving you greasy like oils or lotions but unfortunately not all serums Are created equal. Some are packed with cheap oils and don\u2019t truly work, well Not this one!!! This one is everything! I put it on all over my face, neck and especially under my eyes (which is my trouble spot because of little wrinkles) and this soaks in so beautiful. It hydrated that area so my makeup goes on like butter! It is a very light fresh smell- I almost don\u2019t smell anything- which is perfect because my eyes can water so easy but not with this serum!<br />It\u2019s vegan friendly too!<br />Manila serum is a must have in my morning routine.\nObsessed with this serum\nHylunia Hydrate Body Wash - Energizing Blend With Mango 8.5 oz\nHylunia\n{'Product Dimensions': '2 x 2 x 5 inches; 11.22 Ounces', 'Item model number': '059ENM-250-R', 'UPC': '185449000313'}\nThis lathers up so nice and is beyond moisturizing to my skin. My skin felt fresh and so hydrated! The mango body wash smells so good that my husband even commented how yummy I smell.\nObsessed with this mango body wash\nAibilye Shower Cap, 3Pcs Shower Cap For Women,Shower Cap For Kids, Double Waterproof,Hair Care Cap,Salon Shower Cap,Reusable, Medium Size(STYLE-1)\nAibilye\n{'Brand': 'Aibilye', 'Material': 'Polyester', 'Pattern': 'Floral', 'Number of Items': '3', 'Size': 'Medium', 'Package Dimensions': '8.9 x 8.5 x 0.3 inches; 3.99 Ounces'}\nWhat amazing quality for this price!
