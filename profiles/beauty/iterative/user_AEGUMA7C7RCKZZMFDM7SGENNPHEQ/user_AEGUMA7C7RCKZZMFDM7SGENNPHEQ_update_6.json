The device leaves your skin feeling softer after a few uses, so it may take more than your first use to see effects.\nNoticeable difference\nBold Men, Mens Hair Brush For Head and Beard, Thick and Thin Hair Types\nBOLD MEN\n{'Brand': 'BOLD MEN', 'Shape': 'Oblong', 'Handle Material': 'Wood', 'Product Benefits': 'Smoothing', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Product Dimensions': '2.36 x 2.36 x 1.97 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '793611800557'}\nI like that this brush is small enough to fit comfortably in my palm, but I expected the bristles to be more dense like other hair/beard brushes I've used in the past. However, it works well and I have not had any issue with it at all.\nBristles are not densely packed\nSpanature Olive Hand & Body Lotion Travel Size Selection, 4 Pack, Revitalizing Moisturizer for Rough and Dry Skin, Nourishing and Gentle for All Skin Types, Made In Korea - 75 ml/2.53oz\nSpanature\n{'Brand': 'Spanature', 'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '4', 'Use for': 'Hands', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.1 x 1.89 x 1.5 inches; 2.4 Ounces'}\nI really liked that each lotion was individually boxed in a gift box. I kept one for myself and gifted the others and I'm kind of starting to regret it since I'm really liking how it leaves my hands feeling. The lotion left my skin feeling soft and rehydrated without that film like feeling that other lotions tend to leave\nGreat gift idea\nFace Scrub by Disco for Men, Exfoliating and Cleansing, Removes Dead Skin and Build Up, All Natural and Paraben Free, Eucalyptus Scent, 2 Ounces\nDisco\n{'Brand': 'Disco', 'Product Benefits': 'Exfoliating', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Scent': 'Eucalyptus', 'Package Dimensions': '6.1 x 1.81 x 1.81 inches; 2 Ounces', 'UPC': '860001694727'}\nDisco face scrub left my skin feeling soft and the smell was a plus. I have used it over the last week and have liked that it isn't too rough of a scrub.\nSo far it has been working great\nSpanature Aloe Vera Hand & Body Lotion Travel Size Selection, 4 Pack, Relaxing and Revitalizing Moisturizer for Rough and Dry Skin, Nourishing and Gentle for All Skin Types, Made In Korea - 75 ml/2.53oz\nSpanature\n{'Brand': 'Spanature', 'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Unit Count': '10.1 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '4', 'Use for': 'Hands', 'Package Dimensions': '4.21 x 3.62 x 2.8 inches; 1.05 Pounds', 'UPC': '088234470585'}\nThis is the second lotion from Spanature I have received and I like just as much as the previous one. It leaves my skin feeling soft and refreshed without having a weird slimey feeling that other lotions leave. They also come in gift boxes, so you can gift them with little effort.\nAnother great lotion from Spanature\n3-piece makeup sponge set with Powder Brush\uff0c makeup sponges sponge makeup Mixed sponge foundation sponge make up blender Wet and dry makeup sponge (Red black pink + brush pen)\nQiaohanbao\n{'Brand': 'Qiaohanbao', 'Material': 'Sponge,Polyurethane', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '1.57 x 1.57 x 2.36 inches', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.57 x 1.57 x 2.36 inches; 4.16 Ounces', 'UPC': '746581290361'}\nI don't like the way the brush opens and closes but it does work fine.
