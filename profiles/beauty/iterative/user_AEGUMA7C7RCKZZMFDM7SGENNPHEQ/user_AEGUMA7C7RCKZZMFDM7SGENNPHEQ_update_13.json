The device leaves your skin feeling softer after a few uses, so it may take more than your first use to see effects.\nNoticeable difference\nBold Men, Mens Hair Brush For Head and Beard, Thick and Thin Hair Types\nBOLD MEN\n{'Brand': 'BOLD MEN', 'Shape': 'Oblong', 'Handle Material': 'Wood', 'Product Benefits': 'Smoothing', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Product Dimensions': '2.36 x 2.36 x 1.97 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '793611800557'}\nI like that this brush is small enough to fit comfortably in my palm, but I expected the bristles to be more dense like other hair/beard brushes I've used in the past. However, it works well and I have not had any issue with it at all.\nBristles are not densely packed\nSpanature Olive Hand & Body Lotion Travel Size Selection, 4 Pack, Revitalizing Moisturizer for Rough and Dry Skin, Nourishing and Gentle for All Skin Types, Made In Korea - 75 ml/2.53oz\nSpanature\n{'Brand': 'Spanature', 'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '4', 'Use for': 'Hands', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.1 x 1.89 x 1.5 inches; 2.4 Ounces'}\nI really liked that each lotion was individually boxed in a gift box. I kept one for myself and gifted the others and I'm kind of starting to regret it since I'm really liking how it leaves my hands feeling. The lotion left my skin feeling soft and rehydrated without that film like feeling that other lotions tend to leave\nGreat gift idea\nFace Scrub by Disco for Men, Exfoliating and Cleansing, Removes Dead Skin and Build Up, All Natural and Paraben Free, Eucalyptus Scent, 2 Ounces\nDisco\n{'Brand': 'Disco', 'Product Benefits': 'Exfoliating', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Scent': 'Eucalyptus', 'Package Dimensions': '6.1 x 1.81 x 1.81 inches; 2 Ounces', 'UPC': '860001694727'}\nDisco face scrub left my skin feeling soft and the smell was a plus. I have used it over the last week and have liked that it isn't too rough of a scrub.\nSo far it has been working great\nSpanature Aloe Vera Hand & Body Lotion Travel Size Selection, 4 Pack, Relaxing and Revitalizing Moisturizer for Rough and Dry Skin, Nourishing and Gentle for All Skin Types, Made In Korea - 75 ml/2.53oz\nSpanature\n{'Brand': 'Spanature', 'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Unit Count': '10.1 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '4', 'Use for': 'Hands', 'Package Dimensions': '4.21 x 3.62 x 2.8 inches; 1.05 Pounds', 'UPC': '088234470585'}\nThis is the second lotion from Spanature I have received and I like just as much as the previous one. It leaves my skin feeling soft and refreshed without having a weird slimey feeling that other lotions leave. They also come in gift boxes, so you can gift them with little effort.\nAnother great lotion from Spanature\n3-piece makeup sponge set with Powder Brush\uff0c makeup sponges sponge makeup Mixed sponge foundation sponge make up blender Wet and dry makeup sponge (Red black pink + brush pen)\nQiaohanbao\n{'Brand': 'Qiaohanbao', 'Material': 'Sponge,Polyurethane', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '1.57 x 1.57 x 2.36 inches', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.57 x 1.57 x 2.36 inches; 4.16 Ounces', 'UPC': '746581290361'}\nI don't like the way the brush opens and closes but it does work fine. I do however love the sponges it came with. The sponges are really soft and blend my makeup. The sponges provide ease for foundation application as well.\nNot a fan of the brush but love the sponges\n45PCS Hair Elastic Ties, Big Durable Rubber Bands with High Elasticity-56mm diameter for Women Girls with Long Heavy Thick Curly Hair, Strong ponytail Hairband holders, by XieNie(Black)\nXieNie\n{'Material': 'Plastic, Rubber', 'Item Form': 'Elastic', 'Brand': 'XieNie', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Item Weight': '1.5 Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '5.47 x 3.94 x 1.18 inches; 1.5 Ounces', 'Item model number': '210406BTB', 'UPC': '628094759446'}\nThese hair ties are awesome. They are a bit different than what I'm used to using. I have thick hair and my hair ties usually break or become stretched out after using for a short time. These seem like they will last longer and do an amazing job of keeping my pony tail up all day\nkeeps hair up all day\nTaaji Large Hair Clips for Women(3 PACK), Metal Hair Claw Clips,Hair Catch Barrette Jaw Clamp for Women Half Bun Hairpins for Thick Hair (Silver + Gold + Rose Gold)\nTaaji\n{'Brand': 'Taaji', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Color': 'Silver', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Embellishment': 'Nozzle', 'Product Dimensions': '2.99 x 1.65 x 0.79 inches; 3 Ounces', 'UPC': '727448938701'}\nI have really thick hear which is sometimes unmanageable and these hair clips have been some of the best I have ever tried. They really hold my hair in place and get a nice grip for extended periods of time. The colors are also beautiful and go with just about everything.\ngreat for hard to clip hair\nMineral Sun Block by Disco for Men, Moisturizing, SPF 30, All Natural and Paraben Free, 2 Ounces\nDisco\n{'Item Weight': '2 Ounces', 'Unit Count': '2.0 Ounce', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '2 x 1 x 5 inches', 'Brand': 'Disco', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Product Dimensions': '2 x 1 x 5 inches; 2 Ounces', 'UPC': '860006771652'}\nI wish this product came in a bigger size but I also do love the 2 ounce size because I can take it with me everywhere which enables me to be better at remembering to apply sunblock every time I go out and makes it easily accessible. The Disco mineral sunblock is very lightweight and smells great. I really like that it is free of harmful ingredients\nDisco mineral sunblock is the way to go\nilapothecary Express Lip Balm 15g\nilapothecary\n{'Brand': 'Ilapothecary', 'Item Form': 'Balm', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Color': 'Rose', 'Product Benefits': 'Nourishing'}\nThis Ilapothecary express lip balm delivers instant softness to dry and chapped lips and that is my favorite part of the product. It's great for every day use. My not so favorite part is the overpowering smell and sometimes taste of the balm. If you love the strong smell of roses this is definitely for you.\nstrong scent and taste\nMISS ROSE M 12 PCS Long-lasting Matte Lipstick Set, Soft Texture With a Smooth Touch,Featuring full-pigment lip Matte color\nMISS ROSE M\n{'Brand': 'MISS ROSE M', 'Item Form': 'Stick', 'Finish Type': 'Matte', 'Product Benefits': 'Smoothening,Long-lasting', 'Coverage': 'full', 'Package Dimensions': '7.24 x 7.17 x 1.18 inches; 8.57 Ounces', 'UPC': '765779800687'}\nIf you want to find a few great shades of lipstick for your skin tone, this 12 piece Miss Rose lipstick set is a great start. It provides an incredible variety of shades to choose from and try out. It's great for experimenting with different colors. However, I did not find the quality of the lipstick to be that great. It goes on pretty well but does not stay on for long periods of time and does smear at times.\ngreat variety of colors, meh quality\nCOSYOO Fashion Boho Headbands for Women 12PCS Hair Band Elastic Vintage Button Knotted Headbands Head Wrap Floral Bandeau Headbands\nCOSYOO\n{'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material': 'Spandex', 'Fabric Type': 'Spandex', 'Number of Items': '12', 'Brand': 'COSYOO', 'Package Dimensions': '13.23 x 10.24 x 2.09 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'UPC': '755420988130'}\nI definitely appreciate the variety of the designs of these headbands as they come in 12 different and cute designs which will fit perfectly with any look or outfit. However, I have a pretty average sized head and held like the headbands were a little too loose for me. I find myself having to adjust a few times while wearing. These are great for gifting to others as well to fit anyone's unique style and personality.\ngreat assortment of designs\n21pcs with storage box for girls big bow hairpin ribbon full cover flower hairpin baby toddler hair accessories\nHavtyyise\n{'Brand': 'Havtyyise', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Babies', 'Material': 'Linen', 'Unit Count': '1.0 Ounce', 'Product Dimensions': '3.55 x 1.57 x 1.57 inches; 0.53 Ounces'}\n21 pieces of pure joy.
