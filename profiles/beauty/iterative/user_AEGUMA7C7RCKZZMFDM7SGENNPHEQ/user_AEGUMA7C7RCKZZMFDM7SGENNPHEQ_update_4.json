I kept one for myself and gifted the others and I'm kind of starting to regret it since I'm really liking how it leaves my hands feeling. The lotion left my skin feeling soft and rehydrated without that film like feeling that other lotions tend to leave\nGreat gift idea\nFace Scrub by Disco for Men, Exfoliating and Cleansing, Removes Dead Skin and Build Up, All Natural and Paraben Free, Eucalyptus Scent, 2 Ounces\nDisco\n{'Brand': 'Disco', 'Product Benefits': 'Exfoliating', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Scent': 'Eucalyptus', 'Package Dimensions': '6.1 x 1.81 x 1.81 inches; 2 Ounces', 'UPC': '860001694727'}\nDisco face scrub left my skin feeling soft and the smell was a plus.
