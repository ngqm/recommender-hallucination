The device leaves your skin feeling softer after a few uses, so it may take more than your first use to see effects.\nNoticeable difference\nBold Men, Mens Hair Brush For Head and Beard, Thick and Thin Hair Types\nBOLD MEN\n{'Brand': 'BOLD MEN', 'Shape': 'Oblong', 'Handle Material': 'Wood', 'Product Benefits': 'Smoothing', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Product Dimensions': '2.36 x 2.36 x 1.97 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '793611800557'}\nI like that this brush is small enough to fit comfortably in my palm, but I expected the bristles to be more dense like other hair/beard brushes I've used in the past. However, it works well and I have not had any issue with it at all.\nBristles are not densely packed\nSpanature Olive Hand & Body Lotion Travel Size Selection, 4 Pack, Revitalizing Moisturizer for Rough and Dry Skin, Nourishing and Gentle for All Skin Types, Made In Korea - 75 ml/2.53oz\nSpanature\n{'Brand': 'Spanature', 'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '4', 'Use for': 'Hands', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.1 x 1.89 x 1.5 inches; 2.4 Ounces'}\nI really liked that each lotion was individually boxed in a gift box. I kept one for myself and gifted the others and I'm kind of starting to regret it since I'm really liking how it leaves my hands feeling. The lotion left my skin feeling soft and rehydrated without that film like feeling that other lotions tend to leave\nGreat gift idea\nFace Scrub by Disco for Men, Exfoliating and Cleansing, Removes Dead Skin and Build Up, All Natural and Paraben Free, Eucalyptus Scent, 2 Ounces\nDisco\n{'Brand': 'Disco', 'Product Benefits': 'Exfoliating', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Scent': 'Eucalyptus', 'Package Dimensions': '6.1 x 1.81 x 1.81 inches; 2 Ounces', 'UPC': '860001694727'}\nDisco face scrub left my skin feeling soft and the smell was a plus.

The sponges provide ease for foundation application as well.\nNot a fan of the brush but love the sponges\n45PCS Hair Elastic Ties, Big Durable Rubber Bands with High Elasticity-56mm diameter for Women Girls with Long Heavy Thick Curly Hair, Strong ponytail Hairband holders, by XieNie(Black)\nXieNie\n{'Material': 'Plastic, Rubber', 'Item Form': 'Elastic', 'Brand': 'XieNie', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Item Weight': '1.5 Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '5.47 x 3.94 x 1.18 inches; 1.5 Ounces', 'Item model number': '210406BTB', 'UPC': '628094759446'}\nThese hair ties are awesome. They are a bit different than what I'm used to using. I have thick hair and my hair ties usually break or become stretched out after using for a short time.

The Disco mineral sunblock is very lightweight and smells great. I really like that it is free of harmful ingredients\nDisco mineral sunblock is the way to go\nilapothecary Express Lip Balm 15g\nilapothecary\n{'Brand': 'Ilapothecary', 'Item Form': 'Balm', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Color': 'Rose', 'Product Benefits': 'Nourishing'}\nThis Ilapothecary express lip balm delivers instant softness to dry and chapped lips and that is my favorite part of the product.

However, I have a pretty average sized head and held like the headbands were a little too loose for me. I find myself having to adjust a few times while wearing.
