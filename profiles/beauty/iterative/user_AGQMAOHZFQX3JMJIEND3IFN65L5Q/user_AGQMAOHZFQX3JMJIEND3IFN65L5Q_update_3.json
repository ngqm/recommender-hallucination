But I think that\u2019s what makes this work so great.<br /><br />Now when you put the pink gel on your face, don\u2019t rub it too much. Just try to gently spread the gel fast. Then just wait without re-touching them. You will feel a bit of tingling sensation and can see it turns to lots of foams.<br />Then you can wash them off with warm water, and feel a soft and clean face of yours!<br />I might be biased as I love foaming cleansers to begin with, and this one has no unpleasant smell with a pretty pink color.<br />If you have never tried foaming cleanser like this, please give this a try and follow instructions closely to see the desired effect!\nReview Title: My absolute favorite!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

However, once I tried it on, I realized it might be actually better for an intended use as it could be comfortably worn while sleeping even down to cover the eyes.<br /><br />Personally, I ordered this to wear to keep my hair warm to enhance benefit of leave in conditioner (after I take a shower, put leave in conditioners and dry hair. )<br /><br />The best thing about this one is that it is such light weight that I even forgot I was wearing one while working on my computer (like you don't really feel it every second like some other thick bonnet with a tight band).<br /><br />To wear it for a long period of time, comfortableness is the most important thing to consider in my opinion and for such regard, this one gets 5 from me.<br /><br />For its durability, I will update my review accordingly if this bonnet gets torn apart easily.\nLightweight, comfortable to wear and even a bit stylish ? to wear around home.\nVegan Face Foaming Cleanser by ATH\u00c9 Authentic Pink Vita Foaming Cleanser 6.08oz, 180ml | Athe Foaming Cleanser | Energy of Pink Vitamin and the Peeling Effect of Konjac Jelly | Vegan Face Foaming Cleanser | Vegan Deep Cleansing | Kbeauty\nATH\u00c9\n{'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Brand': 'ATH\u00c9', 'Material Feature': 'Natural, Vegan', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult'}\nFoam is my favorite type of cleanser for all face/hand/body.<br />I especially love a gel to foam type as I feel that cleans deep into the skin.<br />So now, this is a bit different from others in that you have to invest at least 3-5 mins to use it properly.
