I think this is about the 5th different oils I have tried and one thing I like about this oil is that it smells like something from my facial at spa. While I don't like any fragrance for my skin care products, this one didn't bother me ( probably because this reminds me of being at spa I guess.)<br />This oil isn't too light so it's good to massage in that if oil is too light and dry out too quickly, it's hard to use as massage oil in my case.<br />Overall, a decent one in my opinion but again I haven't had much experience with facial oils so I cannot confidently say this one is better than others in all aspects.\nReview Title: Good weight oil that makes skin barrier.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

However, once I tried it on, I realized it might be actually better for an intended use as it could be comfortably worn while sleeping even down to cover the eyes.<br /><br />Personally, I ordered this to wear to keep my hair warm to enhance benefit of leave in conditioner (after I take a shower, put leave in conditioners and dry hair. )<br /><br />The best thing about this one is that it is such light weight that I even forgot I was wearing one while working on my computer (like you don't really feel it every second like some other thick bonnet with a tight band).<br /><br />To wear it for a long period of time, comfortableness is the most important thing to consider in my opinion and for such regard, this one gets 5 from me.<br /><br />For its durability, I will update my review accordingly if this bonnet gets torn apart easily.\nLightweight, comfortable to wear and even a bit stylish ? to wear around home.\nVegan Face Foaming Cleanser by ATH\u00c9 Authentic Pink Vita Foaming Cleanser 6.08oz, 180ml | Athe Foaming Cleanser | Energy of Pink Vitamin and the Peeling Effect of Konjac Jelly | Vegan Face Foaming Cleanser | Vegan Deep Cleansing | Kbeauty\nATH\u00c9\n{'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Brand': 'ATH\u00c9', 'Material Feature': 'Natural, Vegan', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult'}\nFoam is my favorite type of cleanser for all face/hand/body.<br />I especially love a gel to foam type as I feel that cleans deep into the skin.<br />So now, this is a bit different from others in that you have to invest at least 3-5 mins to use it properly. But I think that\u2019s what makes this work so great.<br /><br />Now when you put the pink gel on your face, don\u2019t rub it too much. Just try to gently spread the gel fast. Then just wait without re-touching them. You will feel a bit of tingling sensation and can see it turns to lots of foams.<br />Then you can wash them off with warm water, and feel a soft and clean face of yours!<br />I might be biased as I love foaming cleansers to begin with, and this one has no unpleasant smell with a pretty pink color.<br />If you have never tried foaming cleanser like this, please give this a try and follow instructions closely to see the desired effect!\nMy absolute favorite!\nTerre De Mars Resonance Facial Oil, Certified Organic, Plumping and Nourishing Oil for Men and Women, Infused With Coffee and Evening Primrose Oil to Protect and Illuminate Skin, Perfect for All Skin Types, Made in France, Vegan and Cruelty Free (1 FL Oz)\n{'Brand': 'TERRE DE MARS', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Active Ingredients': 'caffeine,squalane', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Product Dimensions': '1.34 x 1.34 x 4.25 inches; 2.89 Ounces'}\nAs I have oily combination skin, I don't usually use oil on my face and only use them to massage my neck or sometimes face (when it's drier condition depending on my hormonal cycle.)<br />Thus, I am not that expert on facial oil.
