I don\u2019t always get a good night\u2019s sleep and in the morning, the puffiness shows and sometimes dark circles accompany the puffiness.<br /><br />This Eye Firming Serum works unbelievably fast. The puffiness goes away within an hour. As for dark circles, they do fade out with daily use- you will notice a difference within a week. The main thing I noticed is a tighter, firmer feel of my under eye area. This tightening and firming of the delicate eye area actually does make fine lines disappear. Age spots don\u2019t disappear, but your skin will brighten up.<br /><br />This Eye Firming Serum is so easy to use. You simply apply a drop or two with the dropper and lightly dab into your skin with a finger. If you do this at night, you will wake up to a firmer skin and it looks brighter, but it\u2019s the feeling of firmness and tightness you will love. Applying a good moisturizer after the Eye Serum really makes your under eye skin look fabulous and feeling hydrated. Keeping the dropper clean after use will result in always having the serum perfect and moist with no dried out particles. Any Eye Serum that can immediately get rid of puffiness from a bad night\u2019s sleep and leave your skin around your eyes feeling firmer and tighter gets 5 STARS from me.\nReview Title: Instantly Removes Puffiness, But It\u2019s The Firmness & Tightness You Will Love\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Harmony (1) will relieve a multitude of irritations caused by many different issues. One of the main irritations are pads or tampons. Every month, especially for a heavy period, menstrual pads can cause painful irritations, dryness, rashes, pain and itching. Then when you are into menopause, the irritations, dryness, rashes, pain and itching are a hundred times worse, due to heavy periods that can last forever.<br /><br />There are many other issues that can cause constant irritations besides pads and tampons- if you\u2019ve ever had a bad Urinary Tract Infection, where you are urinating frequently in pain, the rashes are unbearable. Having a weak bladder at times where you need a heavier pad or diaper causes more unpleasant rashes. It is so difficult to find a cream that will actually help with severe chafing, dryness, pain, itching and irritations. This V. Harmony Vaginal Moisturizer helps immensely with chafing and dryness. But when it comes to helping with severe rashes, itching and pain- make sure you refrigerate this first before applying, because you will be happy you did. Applying this cold is the best relief ever- the pain goes away immediately.
