This is especially nice for younger people who hate the pain of a tight headband, but want to wear one for that special occasion. And this headband is so beautiful, you will want one for that special occasion.<br /><br />The headband itself feels like a very thin, light metal underneath soft gold fabric. The ends are wrapped yet again with a soft, silky black fabric to sit like a feather behind your ears. The stones are firmly set on a thin metal band which are attached to the gold fabric. What surprises me is this headband doesn\u2019t slip at all on my medium size head. I can also wear it like a crown which looks stunningly beautiful with all the \u201cdiamonds\u201d sparkling. It\u2019s the loveliest headband that is beyond soft and comfortable and will make everyone feel like royalty when wearing it for a most special occasion. 5 STARS.\nReview Title: Most Comfortable, Beautiful Headband That Doubles As A Crown\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Harmony (1) will relieve a multitude of irritations caused by many different issues. One of the main irritations are pads or tampons. Every month, especially for a heavy period, menstrual pads can cause painful irritations, dryness, rashes, pain and itching. Then when you are into menopause, the irritations, dryness, rashes, pain and itching are a hundred times worse, due to heavy periods that can last forever.<br /><br />There are many other issues that can cause constant irritations besides pads and tampons- if you\u2019ve ever had a bad Urinary Tract Infection, where you are urinating frequently in pain, the rashes are unbearable. Having a weak bladder at times where you need a heavier pad or diaper causes more unpleasant rashes. It is so difficult to find a cream that will actually help with severe chafing, dryness, pain, itching and irritations. This V. Harmony Vaginal Moisturizer helps immensely with chafing and dryness. But when it comes to helping with severe rashes, itching and pain- make sure you refrigerate this first before applying, because you will be happy you did. Applying this cold is the best relief ever- the pain goes away immediately. Take the time to refrigerate the jar for maximum, instant relief! 5 STARS.\nRefrigerate For Maximum, Instant Relief\nLaClaire Eye Firming Serum with Caffeine, Peptides, Botanicals - Best Treatment for Puffy Eyes, Wrinkles, Fine Lines (5 ml/0.5 oz)\nLaClaire\n{'Skin Type': 'Oily, Combination, Dry, Normal', 'Use for': 'Face', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'LaClaire', 'Item Form': 'Serum', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.43 x 5.35 x 5.28 inches; 6.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'SG_B07DXG9LDT_US', 'UPC': '891040000569', 'Manufacturer': 'LaClaire'}\nLaClaire Eye Firming Serum with Caffeine, Peptides, Botanicals - Best Treatment for Puffy Eyes, Wrinkles, Fine Lines (5 ml/0.5 oz) gave me immediate results in reducing puffiness from not sleeping well. I don\u2019t always get a good night\u2019s sleep and in the morning, the puffiness shows and sometimes dark circles accompany the puffiness.<br /><br />This Eye Firming Serum works unbelievably fast. The puffiness goes away within an hour. As for dark circles, they do fade out with daily use- you will notice a difference within a week. The main thing I noticed is a tighter, firmer feel of my under eye area. This tightening and firming of the delicate eye area actually does make fine lines disappear. Age spots don\u2019t disappear, but your skin will brighten up.<br /><br />This Eye Firming Serum is so easy to use. You simply apply a drop or two with the dropper and lightly dab into your skin with a finger. If you do this at night, you will wake up to a firmer skin and it looks brighter, but it\u2019s the feeling of firmness and tightness you will love. Applying a good moisturizer after the Eye Serum really makes your under eye skin look fabulous and feeling hydrated. Keeping the dropper clean after use will result in always having the serum perfect and moist with no dried out particles. Any Eye Serum that can immediately get rid of puffiness from a bad night\u2019s sleep and leave your skin around your eyes feeling firmer and tighter gets 5 STARS from me.\nInstantly Removes Puffiness, But It\u2019s The Firmness & Tightness You Will Love\nEnglish Laundry Men's 4 Piece Coffret\n{'Brand': 'English Laundry', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Item Volume': '0.67 Fluid Ounces', 'Scent': 'Coriander,Lemon,Sandalwood,Vanilla', 'Special Feature': 'The small sizes make these bottles perfect for traveling.', 'Product Dimensions': '11.2 x 2.3 x 4.5 inches; 0.71 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'CF004', 'UPC': '819029013041', 'Manufacturer': '3B International', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Domestic Shipping': 'Currently, item can be shipped only within the U.S. and to APO/FPO addresses.

This is not for every man, but for a man who likes a more vibrant scent. These scents are very noticeable and not light, being a very woodsy, earthy, warm fragrance with a touch of zest. 4 STARS.<br /><br />NOTTING HILL- The top notes begin with bergamot, lemon and lime for a clean, natural scent. Then the middle notes have bolder peppercorn and jasmine bringing a rose/herbal scent. At the bottom are cedarwood, sandalwood, amber and a powdery musk for a very potent woodsy, animal musky scent.

I have combination skin- some parts dry, regular and oily. I also have aging skin, so I really didn\u2019t think this primer spray would help me, but it surprisingly did. This comes in a spray bottle and you have to shake the bottle well before spraying, keeping your eyes tightly shut.<br /><br />It sprays with a fine mist, but has a foaming in it. After spraying, I gently rubbed it more evenly on my face. It dries instantly and wow, my face felt like velvet. If anyone knows about aging skin- your make-up shows the fine lines and wrinkles more exaggerated. This primer spray somehow smooths your skin more, leaving it like a smooth slate for make-up. I am very impressed with this spray, as nothing helps aging skin like this does for make-up, powder, even  touch up concealers.
