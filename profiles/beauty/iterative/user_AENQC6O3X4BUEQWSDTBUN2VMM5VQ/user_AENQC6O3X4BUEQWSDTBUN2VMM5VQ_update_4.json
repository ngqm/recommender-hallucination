If your head circumference is between 20 to 25 inches, you will get a soft and snug fit. This headband is great as it is totally adjustable. The included invisible nylon hair net with elastic keeps every hair in place. The mesh in this cap is woven with nylon/spandex and keeps your head cool as it\u2019s mesh design is wide enough to breathe.<br /><br />The velvety soft headband is on the thick side, but it holds so well. It has stretchability and velcro to adjust it tightly to your head. Both the net cap and headband are so easy to apply. I love the fact that the net cap holds your hair in place, no matter how thick your hair, it holds it all in nice and flat,  while allowing your head to breathe. Then the stretchy headband holds tight to keep your wig from moving or slipping. No more hair pins, tape or glue, just pure comfort with a secure, soft and snug fit. 5 STARS.\nReview Title: Pure Comfort & Confidence With A Secure, Soft & Snug Fit\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Harmony (1) will relieve a multitude of irritations caused by many different issues. One of the main irritations are pads or tampons. Every month, especially for a heavy period, menstrual pads can cause painful irritations, dryness, rashes, pain and itching. Then when you are into menopause, the irritations, dryness, rashes, pain and itching are a hundred times worse, due to heavy periods that can last forever.<br /><br />There are many other issues that can cause constant irritations besides pads and tampons- if you\u2019ve ever had a bad Urinary Tract Infection, where you are urinating frequently in pain, the rashes are unbearable. Having a weak bladder at times where you need a heavier pad or diaper causes more unpleasant rashes. It is so difficult to find a cream that will actually help with severe chafing, dryness, pain, itching and irritations. This V. Harmony Vaginal Moisturizer helps immensely with chafing and dryness. But when it comes to helping with severe rashes, itching and pain- make sure you refrigerate this first before applying, because you will be happy you did. Applying this cold is the best relief ever- the pain goes away immediately. Take the time to refrigerate the jar for maximum, instant relief! 5 STARS.\nRefrigerate For Maximum, Instant Relief\nLaClaire Eye Firming Serum with Caffeine, Peptides, Botanicals - Best Treatment for Puffy Eyes, Wrinkles, Fine Lines (5 ml/0.5 oz)\nLaClaire\n{'Skin Type': 'Oily, Combination, Dry, Normal', 'Use for': 'Face', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'LaClaire', 'Item Form': 'Serum', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.43 x 5.35 x 5.28 inches; 6.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'SG_B07DXG9LDT_US', 'UPC': '891040000569', 'Manufacturer': 'LaClaire'}\nLaClaire Eye Firming Serum with Caffeine, Peptides, Botanicals - Best Treatment for Puffy Eyes, Wrinkles, Fine Lines (5 ml/0.5 oz) gave me immediate results in reducing puffiness from not sleeping well. I don\u2019t always get a good night\u2019s sleep and in the morning, the puffiness shows and sometimes dark circles accompany the puffiness.<br /><br />This Eye Firming Serum works unbelievably fast. The puffiness goes away within an hour. As for dark circles, they do fade out with daily use- you will notice a difference within a week. The main thing I noticed is a tighter, firmer feel of my under eye area. This tightening and firming of the delicate eye area actually does make fine lines disappear. Age spots don\u2019t disappear, but your skin will brighten up.<br /><br />This Eye Firming Serum is so easy to use. You simply apply a drop or two with the dropper and lightly dab into your skin with a finger. If you do this at night, you will wake up to a firmer skin and it looks brighter, but it\u2019s the feeling of firmness and tightness you will love. Applying a good moisturizer after the Eye Serum really makes your under eye skin look fabulous and feeling hydrated. Keeping the dropper clean after use will result in always having the serum perfect and moist with no dried out particles. Any Eye Serum that can immediately get rid of puffiness from a bad night\u2019s sleep and leave your skin around your eyes feeling firmer and tighter gets 5 STARS from me.\nInstantly Removes Puffiness, But It\u2019s The Firmness & Tightness You Will Love\nEnglish Laundry Men's 4 Piece Coffret\n{'Brand': 'English Laundry', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Item Volume': '0.67 Fluid Ounces', 'Scent': 'Coriander,Lemon,Sandalwood,Vanilla', 'Special Feature': 'The small sizes make these bottles perfect for traveling.', 'Product Dimensions': '11.2 x 2.3 x 4.5 inches; 0.71 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'CF004', 'UPC': '819029013041', 'Manufacturer': '3B International', 'Country of Origin': 'USA', 'Domestic Shipping': 'Currently, item can be shipped only within the U.S. and to APO/FPO addresses.

The fragrances rated by me are based on my years spent working in a cosmetic factory. I will list each fragrance separately.<br /><br />ARROGANT- With top notes of bergamot and cedar you get a woodsy freshness to the scent. The middle notes of coriander and lavender bring a warm, clean freshness. At the base are sandalwood, amber and musk bringing a warm, sensual, spicy scent. All together, you get a spicy, warm, woodsy scent with a distinctive freshness to it. This light, sensual scent lasts all day and smells wonderful on almost every man, so 5 STARS.<br /><br />OXFORD BLEU- The top notes of mint and lemon add a citrus freshness. The middle notes of iris and geranium bring a very light floral scent. The base adds sandalwood and vanilla for a woodsy delicious scent. All together, this scent is light, with an undertone bit of floral and clean citrus and a nice light woodsy smell.

In the middle are jasmine, patchouli, vetiver, lavender and mandarin- most of these were used in the 60's sexy, warm, earthy scents. At the base notes are nutmeg and coumarin to add some spice. This is not for every man, but for a man who likes a more vibrant scent. These scents are very noticeable and not light, being a very woodsy, earthy, warm fragrance with a touch of zest. 4 STARS.<br /><br />NOTTING HILL- The top notes begin with bergamot, lemon and lime for a clean, natural scent. Then the middle notes have bolder peppercorn and jasmine bringing a rose/herbal scent. At the bottom are cedarwood, sandalwood, amber and a powdery musk for a very potent woodsy, animal musky scent. This is definitely not for every man being very heavy scents. There is nothing light about this fragrance. 4 STARS.<br /><br />With four interesting fragrances, two being light and two being heavy, every man is sure to find one he will like.
