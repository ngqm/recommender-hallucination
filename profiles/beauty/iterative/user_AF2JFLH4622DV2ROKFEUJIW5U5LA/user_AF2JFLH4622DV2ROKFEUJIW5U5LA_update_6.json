Argan oil is great for hair, skin, and nails, and I love using it for all of those purposes. But when you find a brand that takes Argan oil up a notch, it makes Argan oil even better. This brand, Gio, is a wonderful brand because it keeps my dry skin tamed all day long, even in the areas that seem to be the worst. I also love using this brand for my hair too! A little while back I had gotten sick and I remember being in bed for days. During that time I was in bed, I did not comb my hair. Totally not good for the hair. When I finally felt better, I decided to moisturize the knot in my hair with this Gio Argan Oil. I left it on that area for about 15-20 minutes and let it soak into the knot. When I went back to pick the knot, it had magically loosened up so much and came right out with ease! I was so relieved!! I have even started using this oil on my husband's beard. He loves how soft and silky his beard feels when he uses it. Great product that is a must have for me! Will most certainly replace this oil when the need arises.

Thanks in advance!\nReview Title: Gio Naturals is one of the best oil brands I have used........hands down! Very potent formula!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Vktech Hair Buns Accessories 2pcs Sponge Swelling Curvature Volume Hair Base\nVktech\n{}\nI was excited when I ordered these because I like to make a high poof ponytail from time to time. Unfortunately, these are not going to give me the kind of poof I am looking for because both of them are way too small. They do not compare to Bumpits, which I currently use. The reason I wanted to get these is because I thought it would not show as much as the plastic Bumpits and I thought it would give the same effect. These are not even big enough to give the effect the picture shows. A little disappointed with these! Will have to keep searching for sponges that are big enough. :(\nToo small, not exactly like the picture shows!\nVktech Hair Buns Accessories 2pcs Sponge Swelling Curvature Volume Hair Base\nVktech\n{}\nI was excited when I ordered these because I like to make a high poof ponytail from time to time.

I am very pleased to report that it really does work! My daughter is bi-racial, and her hair is very unruly sometimes. Most days it is a job in itself just to get her hair brushed. The wonderful feature of this brush is that you can use it directly after a blow dry to straighten the hair even further. It is also very easy to handle so my teenage daughter was able to use this by herself without any burns or accidents.<br /><br />Before you ask where the before picture is, my daughter was not open to having her wild and crazy hair all over the internet, so we had to skip that picture, but I did include an after picture to show how smooth and silky her hair turned out after using this brush. Features include a long enough cord that you can maneuver around a bit. The temperature controls go from a low of about 330 F to a high of about 450 F, which I think is enough for most hair types without burning the hair. Another great feature is that you are not pulling the hair as much as you have to when you are using a flat iron, so there is a lot less pressure on the hair. Overall, great tool to have! Makes your life a little bit easier and you can breeze through straightening the hair a lot faster.
