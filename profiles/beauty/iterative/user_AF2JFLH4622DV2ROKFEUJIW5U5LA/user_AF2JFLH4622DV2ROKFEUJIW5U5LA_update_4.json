I am very pleased to report that it really does work! My daughter is bi-racial, and her hair is very unruly sometimes. Most days it is a job in itself just to get her hair brushed. The wonderful feature of this brush is that you can use it directly after a blow dry to straighten the hair even further. It is also very easy to handle so my teenage daughter was able to use this by herself without any burns or accidents.<br /><br />Before you ask where the before picture is, my daughter was not open to having her wild and crazy hair all over the internet, so we had to skip that picture, but I did include an after picture to show how smooth and silky her hair turned out after using this brush. Features include a long enough cord that you can maneuver around a bit. The temperature controls go from a low of about 330 F to a high of about 450 F, which I think is enough for most hair types without burning the hair. Another great feature is that you are not pulling the hair as much as you have to when you are using a flat iron, so there is a lot less pressure on the hair. Overall, great tool to have! Makes your life a little bit easier and you can breeze through straightening the hair a lot faster. I did receive this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, however that has no bearing on my views and opinions.\nReview Title: Wow, I like it! It really does work with a little effort!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Vktech Hair Buns Accessories 2pcs Sponge Swelling Curvature Volume Hair Base\nVktech\n{}\nI was excited when I ordered these because I like to make a high poof ponytail from time to time. Unfortunately, these are not going to give me the kind of poof I am looking for because both of them are way too small. They do not compare to Bumpits, which I currently use. The reason I wanted to get these is because I thought it would not show as much as the plastic Bumpits and I thought it would give the same effect. These are not even big enough to give the effect the picture shows. A little disappointed with these! Will have to keep searching for sponges that are big enough. :(\nToo small, not exactly like the picture shows!\nVktech Hair Buns Accessories 2pcs Sponge Swelling Curvature Volume Hair Base\nVktech\n{}\nI was excited when I ordered these because I like to make a high poof ponytail from time to time.
