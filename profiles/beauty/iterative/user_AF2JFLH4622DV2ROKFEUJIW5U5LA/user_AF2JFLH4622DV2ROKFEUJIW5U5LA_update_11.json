I just wish these were slightly sturdier! The pages will start to tear if you load too many plates in the plastic pouches. To avoid that, I bought more than one so I could leave some slots open.

  "reference_summary": "Vktech Hair Buns Accessories 2pcs Sponge Swelling Curvature Volume Hair Base\nVktech\n{}\nI was excited when I ordered these because I like to make a high poof ponytail from time to time. Unfortunately, these are not going to give me the kind of poof I am looking for because both of them are way too small. They do not compare to Bumpits, which I currently use. The reason I wanted to get these is because I thought it would not show as much as the plastic Bumpits and I thought it would give the same effect. These are not even big enough to give the effect the picture shows. A little disappointed with these! Will have to keep searching for sponges that are big enough. :(\nToo small, not exactly like the picture shows!\nVktech Hair Buns Accessories 2pcs Sponge Swelling Curvature Volume Hair Base\nVktech\n{}\nI was excited when I ordered these because I like to make a high poof ponytail from time to time.

I am very pleased to report that it really does work! My daughter is bi-racial, and her hair is very unruly sometimes. Most days it is a job in itself just to get her hair brushed. The wonderful feature of this brush is that you can use it directly after a blow dry to straighten the hair even further. It is also very easy to handle so my teenage daughter was able to use this by herself without any burns or accidents.<br /><br />Before you ask where the before picture is, my daughter was not open to having her wild and crazy hair all over the internet, so we had to skip that picture, but I did include an after picture to show how smooth and silky her hair turned out after using this brush. Features include a long enough cord that you can maneuver around a bit. The temperature controls go from a low of about 330 F to a high of about 450 F, which I think is enough for most hair types without burning the hair. Another great feature is that you are not pulling the hair as much as you have to when you are using a flat iron, so there is a lot less pressure on the hair. Overall, great tool to have! Makes your life a little bit easier and you can breeze through straightening the hair a lot faster. I did receive this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, however that has no bearing on my views and opinions.\nWow, I like it!

It really does work with a little effort!\nGio Naturals Organic Moroccan Argan Oil, 4 oz - 100% Pure and USDA Certified for Face, Hair, Skin and Nails\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6 x 2.2 x 2.1 inches; 8.16 Ounces', 'UPC': '820103119702'}\nGio Naturals is the best! Argan oil is great for hair, skin, and nails, and I love using it for all of those purposes. But when you find a brand that takes Argan oil up a notch, it makes Argan oil even better. This brand, Gio, is a wonderful brand because it keeps my dry skin tamed all day long, even in the areas that seem to be the worst. I also love using this brand for my hair too! A little while back I had gotten sick and I remember being in bed for days. During that time I was in bed, I did not comb my hair. Totally not good for the hair. When I finally felt better, I decided to moisturize the knot in my hair with this Gio Argan Oil. I left it on that area for about 15-20 minutes and let it soak into the knot. When I went back to pick the knot, it had magically loosened up so much and came right out with ease! I was so relieved!! I have even started using this oil on my husband's beard. He loves how soft and silky his beard feels when he uses it. Great product that is a must have for me! Will most certainly replace this oil when the need arises.

For me, that area is the back of my upper thighs. While this area is not bad, there are small areas where the cellulite is noticeable. As soon as this cream arrived I started using it twice a day, once in the morning and then again before bedtime. The instructions also ask that you apply the cream in a circular motion. This was a bit more difficult since I was rubbing the back of my own thighs, but I eventually got into a rhythm and was able to get a circular motion going on. Since this item arrived in the afternoon, I was only able to apply this cream once the first day. Did not notice too much of a difference the following morning, but I was not going to give up that fast. Applied it again after my shower and went about my day. That evening when I went to look at my thighs, for some reason one of them looked better than the other one. Much smoother and tighter!! I thought maybe I had  spent more time on that thigh than I did with the other one, so this time I focused more on the thigh that looked the worst. Woke up the following morning and both of my thighs looked amazing!!! The skin looked tighter and there were fewer dimples. I have been applying this cream every day as instructed and I cannot even tell that I had cellulite just the week before. This stuff is AMAZING!!<br /><br />This product contains an intelligent dual active formula. This formula contains Adiposlim 3%, a cellulite fat burning compound that drastically minimizes fat in different parts of the body. It actually shrinks fat cells below the skin to help rid the skin of that spongy layer of fat that usually forms over muscles. Adiposlim 3% also collects fat cells which are burned off for energy during physical activity and restricts the combination of free fatty acids that collect in adipocytes to dramatically minimize parts of the body with fat deposits. Adipoless 1% helps in preventing new fat from forming. This fat-fighting compound works by maintaining fat loss results, and it avoids the growth of new adipocytes and the combination that keeps fat cells in their dormant state so they remain in their shrunken state. Adipoless 1% also provides anti-adipogenesis action restricting the formation and maturation of new fat cells that can lead to fat deposits over time. That may sound like a bunch of jibberish to some, but to sum it up, it means this cream will not only get rid of the cellulite, but it will also keep it from coming back! It does not get better than that. I love this cream! Best I have ever tried, and I have tried many!<br /><br />My experience with other cellulite remover creams have been decent, but this cream works miracles! Now I want to work on other parts of my body, although I may not have enough cellulite to see any results. I am very pleased with this cream! Will continue to use it until I am not able to get anything else out of the bottle!! Then I can order more!!
