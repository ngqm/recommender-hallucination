  "reference_summary": "165G Jumbo Braiding Hair Blonde Synthetic Jumbo Braids 3 Packs\nUHair\n{'Package Dimensions': '13.94 x 6.69 x 3.74 inches; 1.19 Pounds'}\nI wanted to make my own Rapunzel wig but cwas dissatisfied with the cost from Arda you only get 1 for $10 plus shipping and I needed 3 of them. I got these 3 for half the cost I originally bought from Arda. I kept the Arda ones until these came in just to check quality and they\u2019re literally the exact same thing. So I sent the Arda ones back. I think the wig came out beautifully and you can\u2019t even tell this was 3 separate braids at one point. Definitely would buy again! I followed a tutorial I found on google to make the wig, then added my own touches by including the lights!\nPerfect base for Rapunzel Braids!\nCute Cartoon Makeup Brushes Set - 8pcs Fairy Makeup Brushes with Soft Pink Fiber and Metallic Handle for Eyebrow, Eyeshadow, Foundation, Blending and Lips, Great Gift for Sister Girlfriend (Style B)\nrongji jewelry\n{'Brand': 'rongji jewelry', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Face Makeup', 'Color': 'Pink', 'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Item Form': 'Wand', 'Number of Pieces': '8', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult,Teen', 'Ferrule Material': 'Aluminum', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '8.2 x 3.8 x 1.3 inches; 5.75 Ounces', 'UPC': '745695122377'}\nVERY sturdy brushes. I was completely thrown at how sturdy/heavy these brushes are. I was totally expecting cheap light plastic handles that would break easily but that isn\u2019t the case at all. The bristle portion of them is nice to because they\u2019re not to thick or thin, easy to clean, and don\u2019t shed off. Super cute Designs, I know who bts is but I\u2019m not like a super fan or own any of their music to be honest but they definitely have quality merch as proven by these brushes. I don\u2019t really care for the bag they came in, it\u2019s nice enough but feels cheap in comparison to the brushes themselves. I just have them in my makeup bag instead.\nVery good quality\nForfeels Long Straight Black Wig Synthetic Wigs for Women Natural Middle Part Lace Wig Heat Resistant Fiber Natural Looking Wig (30inch, Black Color)\nforfeels\n{'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Special Feature': 'Glueless', 'Brand': 'Forfeels', 'Package Dimensions': '9.33 x 6.34 x 2.36 inches; 10.58 Ounces', 'UPC': '791262892525'}\nNot a lace front wig. I wouldn\u2019t even consider it a partial lace front. The only place it had lace was right at the part. It\u2019s not a horrible or even bad wig. But it\u2019s not a lace front. The fibers were soft but did shed. It\u2019s comfortable enough to wear, but a little tight if you already have a lot of hair going under it. Can\u2019t recommend it to any cosplayers out there looking at this for a costume, I think styling it may be hard with the way it\u2019s wefted and fact it\u2019s not actually a lace front if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for.\nNot actually a lace front wig\nCortex International Black Series Duo Platinum 1.25-Inch & 0.5 Inch Travel Size Gemstone Infused Ceramic Plates Duet Flat Iron (Rose Wood)\nCortex\n{'Shape': 'Round', 'Brand': 'Cortex', 'Hair Type': 'Dry, Curly, Straight', 'Material': 'Wood,Ceramic', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '13.19 x 4.13 x 3.98 inches; 2.2 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'CTX-DUO-125RW', 'UPC': '819804020950', 'Manufacturer': 'International'}\nThe color is great, the actual product not so much and not worth the price. You could easily buy a better one at big lots for less then half the cost. The full size definitely did not get as hot as it should have and didn\u2019t retain the heat. It wouldn\u2019t straighten my hair. The mini got to temp but would take you forever to do your whole head. It was not as wide as described, the mini is more like a bangs straightener then a mini straightener which is fine for baby hairs and of course bangs. Over all a disappointment given I like the color so much. I\u2019ll be tossing the full size but keeping the mini.\nDoesn\u2019t get to or hold temp\nLeuxe Facial Cleansing Brush, IPX6 Waterproof Rotating Face Brush for Deep Cleansing, 3 Modes and Smart Timer\nleuxe\n{'Brand': 'leuxe', 'Power Source': 'electric', 'Product Benefits': 'Softening,Pores,Cleansing', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Operation Mode': 'Automatic', 'Package Dimensions': '6.2 x 4 x 2.7 inches; 11.99 Ounces', 'UPC': '631517347748', 'Manufacturer': 'leuxe'}\nSuper easy to hold and use, came in great packaging, and works really well! My only complaint would be that it adds yet another recharging product to my life and I wish it came with a docking system so I could always be charging it rather then a cube/cord combo I have to remember to plug in. I don\u2019t use it every day, every other but it works well with my daily routine when I do.\nIt works!\n24 Inches Synthetic Long Curly Blonde Wig Natural Wavy Hair NONE Lace Heat Resistant Wigs for Women Cosplay Costume\nAILIWEI\n{'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '6.69 x 3.94 x 1.97 inches', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy, Curly', 'Special Feature': 'Heat Resistant', 'Brand': 'AILIWEI', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '6.69 x 3.94 x 1.97 inches; 9.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '710731915817'}\nNice color and length, with some styling I think this could look very natural. It sheds a bit so I recommend a good brushing with a wig brush. Overall a very good quality wig for the price. Standard wig cap so on larger heads may feel tight.\nNice and natural\nJuziviee Brown Wigs for Women, 13'' Short Brown Bob Wig with Bangs, Natural Looking Soft Synthetic Hair Wig, Cute Wigs for Party Cosplay Halloween AD016BR1\nJuziviee\n{'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Style': 'Straight', 'Special Feature': 'Heat Resistant', 'Brand': 'Juziviee', 'Package Dimensions': '11.02 x 7.48 x 1.73 inches; 6.7 Ounces', 'UPC': '824381921644'}\nA nice affordable option for cosplayers that need a very blunt style wig and don\u2019t want to style something themselves. To me some spots on the back could be a little more wefted/thicker but it never shows the wig cap so it\u2019s not too thin. Wig cap is a good fit/size with good stretch making it comfortable to wear\nA good fit\nSHINYSHOW 14'' Women's Party Wig Short Wavy Wig with Bangs Synthetic Cosplay Wig Average Size (Fresh Blue)\nSHINYSHOW\n{'Hair Type': 'Wavy', 'Brand': 'SHINYSHOW', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '10.98 x 8.46 x 2.09 inches; 8.47 Ounces'}\nCute but a little on the thin side, I wish it had been just a bit longer in length. For the price it\u2019s not a bad budget friendly cosplay option. I used it for a casual catbug cosplay for a zoom event. The wig cap in my opinion felt a bit small and gave me a headache after 2 hours. It\u2019s not super thick but wasn\u2019t so thin you saw the cap either.\nCute\nAltaba Long Wavy Wigs Ombre gray Wig Synthetic Wigs Middle Part Natural Looking Heat Resistant Party Cosplay Full Wig for Women\nAltaba\n{'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy', 'Brand': 'Altaba', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material Feature': 'Heat Resistant', 'UPC': '788436507620'}\nThis ombr\u00e9 style is more like bad roots for days in need of a dye job immediately. I feel like mine was almost all dark with the ends being light. I can\u2019t recommend it because you don\u2019t really get what\u2019s pictured. It\u2019s ok otherwise, almost on the verge of being a Halloween level wig. It\u2019s not as thick as you\u2019d like it to be but not thin enough you\u2019re seeing the wig cap. The wig cap is the standard size so it\u2019s not to small or tight but mine sat weird and tried to bubble a bit on my head. It had to be left on a wig head inside out for days to correct it. I feel like you could easily find this in another brand but better.\nKind of cheap looking\n28 inch Long Blonde 613 Wig Long Body Wavy Synthetic Wig Natural Looking Hair Replacement Wigs Blonde 613 Glueless Heat Resistant Fiber Wig\nALIABSION\n{'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy', 'Special Feature': 'Glueless', 'Brand': 'ALIABSION', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Item model number': 'SW-Wigs-613#', 'UPC': '779303844085'}\nOther then it not having bangs I thought this wig was rather nice.
