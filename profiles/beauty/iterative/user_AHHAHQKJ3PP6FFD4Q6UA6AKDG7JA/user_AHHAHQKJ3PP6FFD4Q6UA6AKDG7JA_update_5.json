  "reference_summary": "165G Jumbo Braiding Hair Blonde Synthetic Jumbo Braids 3 Packs\nUHair\n{'Package Dimensions': '13.94 x 6.69 x 3.74 inches; 1.19 Pounds'}\nI wanted to make my own Rapunzel wig but cwas dissatisfied with the cost from Arda you only get 1 for $10 plus shipping and I needed 3 of them. I got these 3 for half the cost I originally bought from Arda. I kept the Arda ones until these came in just to check quality and they\u2019re literally the exact same thing. So I sent the Arda ones back. I think the wig came out beautifully and you can\u2019t even tell this was 3 separate braids at one point. Definitely would buy again! I followed a tutorial I found on google to make the wig, then added my own touches by including the lights!\nPerfect base for Rapunzel Braids!\nCute Cartoon Makeup Brushes Set - 8pcs Fairy Makeup Brushes with Soft Pink Fiber and Metallic Handle for Eyebrow, Eyeshadow, Foundation, Blending and Lips, Great Gift for Sister Girlfriend (Style B)\nrongji jewelry\n{'Brand': 'rongji jewelry', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Face Makeup', 'Color': 'Pink', 'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Item Form': 'Wand', 'Number of Pieces': '8', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult,Teen', 'Ferrule Material': 'Aluminum', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '8.2 x 3.8 x 1.3 inches; 5.75 Ounces', 'UPC': '745695122377'}\nVERY sturdy brushes. I was completely thrown at how sturdy/heavy these brushes are. I was totally expecting cheap light plastic handles that would break easily but that isn\u2019t the case at all. The bristle portion of them is nice to because they\u2019re not to thick or thin, easy to clean, and don\u2019t shed off. Super cute Designs, I know who bts is but I\u2019m not like a super fan or own any of their music to be honest but they definitely have quality merch as proven by these brushes. I don\u2019t really care for the bag they came in, it\u2019s nice enough but feels cheap in comparison to the brushes themselves. I just have them in my makeup bag instead.\nVery good quality\nForfeels Long Straight Black Wig Synthetic Wigs for Women Natural Middle Part Lace Wig Heat Resistant Fiber Natural Looking Wig (30inch, Black Color)\nforfeels\n{'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Special Feature': 'Glueless', 'Brand': 'Forfeels', 'Package Dimensions': '9.33 x 6.34 x 2.36 inches; 10.58 Ounces', 'UPC': '791262892525'}\nNot a lace front wig. I wouldn\u2019t even consider it a partial lace front. The only place it had lace was right at the part. It\u2019s not a horrible or even bad wig. But it\u2019s not a lace front. The fibers were soft but did shed. It\u2019s comfortable enough to wear, but a little tight if you already have a lot of hair going under it. Can\u2019t recommend it to any cosplayers out there looking at this for a costume, I think styling it may be hard with the way it\u2019s wefted and fact it\u2019s not actually a lace front if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for.\nNot actually a lace front wig\nCortex International Black Series Duo Platinum 1.25-Inch & 0.5 Inch Travel Size Gemstone Infused Ceramic Plates Duet Flat Iron (Rose Wood)\nCortex\n{'Shape': 'Round', 'Brand': 'Cortex', 'Hair Type': 'Dry, Curly, Straight', 'Material': 'Wood,Ceramic', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '13.19 x 4.13 x 3.98 inches; 2.2 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'CTX-DUO-125RW', 'UPC': '819804020950', 'Manufacturer': 'International'}\nThe color is great, the actual product not so much and not worth the price. You could easily buy a better one at big lots for less then half the cost. The full size definitely did not get as hot as it should have and didn\u2019t retain the heat. It wouldn\u2019t straighten my hair. The mini got to temp but would take you forever to do your whole head. It was not as wide as described, the mini is more like a bangs straightener then a mini straightener which is fine for baby hairs and of course bangs. Over all a disappointment given I like the color so much. I\u2019ll be tossing the full size but keeping the mini.\nDoesn\u2019t get to or hold temp\nLeuxe Facial Cleansing Brush, IPX6 Waterproof Rotating Face Brush for Deep Cleansing, 3 Modes and Smart Timer\nleuxe\n{'Brand': 'leuxe', 'Power Source': 'electric', 'Product Benefits': 'Softening,Pores,Cleansing', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Operation Mode': 'Automatic', 'Package Dimensions': '6.2 x 4 x 2.7 inches; 11.99 Ounces', 'UPC': '631517347748', 'Manufacturer': 'leuxe'}\nSuper easy to hold and use, came in great packaging, and works really well!
