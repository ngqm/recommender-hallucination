I got these 3 for half the cost I originally bought from Arda. I kept the Arda ones until these came in just to check quality and they\u2019re literally the exact same thing. So I sent the Arda ones back. I think the wig came out beautifully and you can\u2019t even tell this was 3 separate braids at one point. Definitely would buy again! I followed a tutorial I found on google to make the wig, then added my own touches by including the lights!\nReview Title: Perfect base for Rapunzel Braids!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
