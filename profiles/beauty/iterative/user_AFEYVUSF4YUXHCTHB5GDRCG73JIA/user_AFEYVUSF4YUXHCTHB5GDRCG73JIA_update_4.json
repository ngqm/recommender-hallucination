Not so for me.  Clean release on some of my nail, and damaged the crap out of the lower 2/3. They looked like I had pried off acrylics. I nearly cried.  I took a fine file to them, and the damage wasn't quite so bad, except for one nail. My left thumb was badly damaged. It took weeks to grow out the damage.<br />This, however,  works ok with my teenagers nails, as she likes to peel off her nails if she gets bored (eeek) and this actually keeps her nails from being damaged. So, for her nails, its a 5, for mine, it was a 1, so I  rated it thusly.\nNot impressed for me, works on others\nPUEEN 168 Nail Stamping Plates Synthetic Leather Holder Case Organizer in Blue Rose Lace Pattern-BH000006\nPUEEN\n{}\nUse this with my bmc and other plates. I haven't had any issues with it. The front feels nice, I like the texture.  Zipper works smooth. No obvious defects, sewing issues, etc. No nauseating smells when I  got it. Plastic has a smooth feel to it that I like, doesn't feel cheap. Holds plates pretty well. Turn it upside down and shake it,  yeah, you get some slipping.  I haven't had any slide out, and I've accidentally carried it around upside down quite a lot, dropped it and in one stunning display of clumsiness - I  managed to drop it, then kick it across the room, picked it up only to drop it from chest high. Sigh. And all the plates were STILL in place, and this thing is holding up quite well. Really happy with it.

I stamp over gel nail polish with konad stamping polish, Essie polish, or Sallie Hanson insta-dri polish. When you first pull off the blue protective film, clean the plates really well with acetone. Then,  I usually paint, scrape, roll, and then clean everything off without actually rolling the first stamping on my nails. I find the first stamping doesn't go well on a fresh plate, so I  just don't waste my time.<br />After doing that, they stamp fine all the time. I have found at least one image in every stamper bundle that has stamping issues. I just don't use that stamp. These plates have intricate designs that transfer well.  If you find that not all of your design is trasferring, first clean the plate really well with acetone.  All that built-up dried polish affects the stamp. There are lots of good videos on stamping troubleshooting,  too, if you are having trouble.<br />I stamp with a konad stamper, and scrape with an old credit card or empty gift cards. Metal scrapers will damage the plates.\nMy go-to stampers\nBlackhead Extractor, Comedone Extractor & Blemish Remover Kit - 7 Professional Surgical Quality Tools including FREE Dentist's Mirror by Pristine Essentials + Complementary Ebook\nPristine Essentials\n['Safe and Effective Extraction for Flawless Beautiful Skin You Deserve', 'Get Clean, Clear and Beautiful Skin Now!
