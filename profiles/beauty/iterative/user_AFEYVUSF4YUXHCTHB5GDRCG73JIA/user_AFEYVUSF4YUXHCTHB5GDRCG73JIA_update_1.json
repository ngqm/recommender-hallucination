Not so for me.  Clean release on some of my nail, and damaged the crap out of the lower 2/3. They looked like I had pried off acrylics. I nearly cried.  I took a fine file to them, and the damage wasn't quite so bad, except for one nail. My left thumb was badly damaged. It took weeks to grow out the damage.<br />This, however,  works ok with my teenagers nails, as she likes to peel off her nails if she gets bored (eeek) and this actually keeps her nails from being damaged. So, for her nails, its a 5, for mine, it was a 1, so I  rated it thusly.\nReview Title: Not impressed for me, works on others\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
