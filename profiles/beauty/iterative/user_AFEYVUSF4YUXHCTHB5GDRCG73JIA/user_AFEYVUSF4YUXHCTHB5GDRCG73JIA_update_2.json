I haven't had any issues with it. The front feels nice, I like the texture.  Zipper works smooth. No obvious defects, sewing issues, etc. No nauseating smells when I  got it. Plastic has a smooth feel to it that I like, doesn't feel cheap. Holds plates pretty well. Turn it upside down and shake it,  yeah, you get some slipping.  I haven't had any slide out, and I've accidentally carried it around upside down quite a lot, dropped it and in one stunning display of clumsiness - I  managed to drop it, then kick it across the room, picked it up only to drop it from chest high. Sigh. And all the plates were STILL in place, and this thing is holding up quite well. Really happy with it.

Not so for me.  Clean release on some of my nail, and damaged the crap out of the lower 2/3. They looked like I had pried off acrylics. I nearly cried.  I took a fine file to them, and the damage wasn't quite so bad, except for one nail. My left thumb was badly damaged. It took weeks to grow out the damage.<br />This, however,  works ok with my teenagers nails, as she likes to peel off her nails if she gets bored (eeek) and this actually keeps her nails from being damaged. So, for her nails, its a 5, for mine, it was a 1, so I  rated it thusly.\nNot impressed for me, works on others\nPUEEN 168 Nail Stamping Plates Synthetic Leather Holder Case Organizer in Blue Rose Lace Pattern-BH000006\nPUEEN\n{}\nUse this with my bmc and other plates.
