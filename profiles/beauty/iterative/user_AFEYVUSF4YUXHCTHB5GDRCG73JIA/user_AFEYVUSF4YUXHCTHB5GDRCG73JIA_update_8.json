It did not do good with my skin. The coverage was flawless, high-medium building up to full. it started settling into fine lines in an hour and by hour three, huge pores, wrinkles where i have none and flaking. wearing up under a mask was terrible even with setting spray, the transfer was unreal. i also tried varying primers, applicators (beauty blender, brush, the included brush which was not good for me) and it's not for long wear on me.<br />i was pretty impressed with the cc cream. the mushroom head applicator is really a beauty blender with a handle but feels pretty nice. the foundation is so pretty when it stamps onto the applicator. coverage was high medium, didn't cover all my redness but tbh nothing does when my face is flaring. and it wore pretty well until i realized i was orange. like an actual orange. so i tried different primers, all with the same result. major oxidation.<br />for coverage for an event or photos, the liquid foundation is really pretty for a few hours. i am disappointed that these didn't agree with my skin, because they are really good products.\nReview Title: The coverage is really good but not for dry skin\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Not so for me.  Clean release on some of my nail, and damaged the crap out of the lower 2/3. They looked like I had pried off acrylics. I nearly cried.  I took a fine file to them, and the damage wasn't quite so bad, except for one nail. My left thumb was badly damaged. It took weeks to grow out the damage.<br />This, however,  works ok with my teenagers nails, as she likes to peel off her nails if she gets bored (eeek) and this actually keeps her nails from being damaged. So, for her nails, its a 5, for mine, it was a 1, so I  rated it thusly.\nNot impressed for me, works on others\nPUEEN 168 Nail Stamping Plates Synthetic Leather Holder Case Organizer in Blue Rose Lace Pattern-BH000006\nPUEEN\n{}\nUse this with my bmc and other plates. I haven't had any issues with it. The front feels nice, I like the texture.  Zipper works smooth. No obvious defects, sewing issues, etc. No nauseating smells when I  got it. Plastic has a smooth feel to it that I like, doesn't feel cheap. Holds plates pretty well. Turn it upside down and shake it,  yeah, you get some slipping.  I haven't had any slide out, and I've accidentally carried it around upside down quite a lot, dropped it and in one stunning display of clumsiness - I  managed to drop it, then kick it across the room, picked it up only to drop it from chest high. Sigh. And all the plates were STILL in place, and this thing is holding up quite well. Really happy with it.

I stamp over gel nail polish with konad stamping polish, Essie polish, or Sallie Hanson insta-dri polish. When you first pull off the blue protective film, clean the plates really well with acetone. Then,  I usually paint, scrape, roll, and then clean everything off without actually rolling the first stamping on my nails. I find the first stamping doesn't go well on a fresh plate, so I  just don't waste my time.<br />After doing that, they stamp fine all the time. I have found at least one image in every stamper bundle that has stamping issues. I just don't use that stamp. These plates have intricate designs that transfer well.  If you find that not all of your design is trasferring, first clean the plate really well with acetone.  All that built-up dried polish affects the stamp. There are lots of good videos on stamping troubleshooting,  too, if you are having trouble.<br />I stamp with a konad stamper, and scrape with an old credit card or empty gift cards. Metal scrapers will damage the plates.\nMy go-to stampers\nBlackhead Extractor, Comedone Extractor & Blemish Remover Kit - 7 Professional Surgical Quality Tools including FREE Dentist's Mirror by Pristine Essentials + Complementary Ebook\nPristine Essentials\n['Safe and Effective Extraction for Flawless Beautiful Skin You Deserve', 'Get Clean, Clear and Beautiful Skin Now!

When I got the opportunity to review this product at a reduced price, I was pretty excited.<br />It comes with several tools. There are many different sizes to choose from, based on the size of the whitehead you are removing. The lancet is sharp enough to work without being dangerously sharp.<br />Besides being useful just for blackhead, whitehead or small cysts, these are also pretty useful with splinters and ingrown hairs.

I adjusted it as much as I could and still it didn't lay right. Apparently, I have a huge head.<br /><br />Besides that, I really was impressed with the quality. It came with the wig cap, a nice box, and false lashes. The quality is pretty darn impressive for the size. It looks and feels like real hair. Its really cute. I am pretty disappointed tjat my huge noggin keeps me from wearing it.<br /><br />Absolutely recommend for normal heads \ud83d\ude09\nNice wig, amazing quality for price\nNatwag Makeup Remover Pads,18 Pack 3.74 Inch Reusable Microfiber Cleansing Pad with Laundry Bag Suitable for All Skin Types,3 Color Facial Cleansing Pad Set.\nNatwag\n{'Brand': 'Natwag', 'Skin Type': 'All Skin,Dry', 'Material Feature': 'Reusable', 'Unit Count': '18.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '18', 'Package Dimensions': '4.4 x 4.37 x 2.59 inches; 3.84 Ounces', 'UPC': '745103569701'}\nI was pretty hesitant on these. I mean, my microfiber cleaning cloths are kinda rough and definitely not something I want to put on my skin. However, these are soft like a dream cloud.<br /><br />They do come with a laundry bag but I washed by hand.<br /><br />I washed one side of my face with a washcloth and the other with these. Then I swiped micellar water over each side. The microfiber side had a tiny bit of makeup residue. The washcloth side had waaaay more. I was pretty stunned.<br />I now only use these for makeup removal. And I definitely recommend \ud83d\ude0a\nSo soft and great clean\nNail Dip Powder Liquid Set with Base Activator and Top Coat, 10ml x 3, for Dipping Powder Manicure System, No Including Bond Primer Brush Saver, No Need UV/LED Lamp to Cured\nunibouti\n{'Brand': 'Unibouti', 'Included Components': 'Top Coat, Dip Powder', 'Finish Type': 'Glossy', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '3.07 x 2.72 x 0.87 inches; 1.76 Ounces'}\nI love dip nails but these solutions are a mess. They glue themselves shut..the brush turns to concrete. ..and so on. I thought I would give these a go. I only dislike the base coat a bit, it doesn't seem as sticky as some others I have used. It's decent,  don't get me wrong, just mho. The activator is great, dries rock hard and the top coat settles smooth and shiny. They, so far, haven't glued themselves shut or turned to rock.
