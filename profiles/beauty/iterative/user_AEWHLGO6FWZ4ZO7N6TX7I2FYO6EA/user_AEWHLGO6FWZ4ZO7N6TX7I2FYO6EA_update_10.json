It does make your skin feel soft and smooth so maybe better used for smoothing the buttocks.\nReview Title: Doesn't help clear inner thigh acne or lighten dark spots as I was expecting!\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I love the colors in this set and it seems to last about 12-14 days as long as you prep your nails like you should for gel polish.<br /><br />The color swatch stickers are also nice so you can paint them cure them and apply them to the tops of the bottles and you know which color is which without opening each bottle!\nGood quality gel polish, but wish it included the base and top coat!\nSoo'AE Sweet Pink Bubble Mask, Clarifying & Softening, 1 Count\nSOOAE\n{'Brand': 'SOOAE', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Product Benefits': 'Softening,Softer', 'Scent': 'Peach', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Product Dimensions': '3.5 x 0.1 x 5.5 inches; 0.32 Ounces'}\nI got this as a stocking stuffer for my daughter, I will update the review once she uses it if we see any irritation or issues with it.

I haven't seen the gray color in stores so it was really nice that you could order this color on Amazon.\nGreat bobby pins, Love that you can get them in the gray color!\nFacial Cleansing Brush made with Ultra Hygienic Soft Silicone 4-PACK\nHAMUULL\n{'Product Dimensions': '2.76 x 1.97 x 0.08 inches; 0.32 Ounces', 'UPC': '779683799654', 'Manufacturer': 'HAMUULL'}\nI love these silicone face scrubbers, they exfoliate the skin so well and are easy to clean. Just place a dab of your favorite facial cleanser on the scrubber and go to work. It helps with creating a rich lather and exfoliating all of the skin.\nGreat for exfoliating the skin!\nGel Nail Polish Set, Glitter 6 Colors Gel Polish Kit Popular Nail Art Design Soak Off LED Lamp Nail Polish Gel Manicure Kit Gifts Set for Girls Women Professional DIY Home Use\nAnzuo\n{'Brand': 'Anzuo', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'gel', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Special Feature': 'Long Lasting', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '6.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '6', 'Number of Pieces': '6', 'Product Dimensions': '5.12 x 3.15 x 3.54 inches; 10.23 Ounces'}\nThese gel polish shimmer colors are beautiful and perfect on their own with two coats or over top of a base color coat. They cure easily with a UV light and are chip resistant for almost 2 weeks.<br /><br />Very durable polish and great selection of colors in this set!\nGreat gel polish, perfect shimmer colors to go over a base color coat!\nEmpty Amber Glass Spray Bottles - (4 Pack) 16 oz with Labels Refillable Container for Essential Oils, Cleaning Solutions, Cleaning Products, Hair, Plant Mister, Daily Shower, Gardening or Aromatherapy\nAYL\n{'Brand': 'AYL', 'Material': 'Glass', 'Capacity': '16 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '4', 'Product Care Instructions': 'Hand Wash Only', 'Package Dimensions': '9.88 x 7.6 x 7.17 inches; 2.98 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'EmptyAmberGlassSprayBottles 4 Pack', 'UPC': '860005177202'}\nI have been slowly switching my cleaning products over to more environmentally friendly and wanted to start investing in glass spray bottles and soap dispensers as well. These are just beautiful, the perfect size and came packaged very well to keep the glass from breaking in transit.<br /><br />These are just as esthetically pleasing as they are practical and I will be purchasing more in the future. I loved the personal touch of the note inside from the seller as I always love to support small businesses. These spray bottles are great if you are in the market do not hesitate to purchase them.\nBeautiful Amber Glass Spray Bottles!\nDip Powder Nail Starter Kit 8 Colors Acrylic Dipping Powder System for French Nail Manicure Nail Art Set, Portable Kit for Trave, No LED Nail Lamp Needed\u2026\nColorfairy\n{'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'Colorfairy', 'Included Components': 'Dip Powder, Nail Lamp', 'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Package Dimensions': '5.98 x 4.17 x 2.72 inches; 9.77 Ounces'}\nOverall this kit worked well, but I will say use the directions shown here online and not the ones on the back of the packaging that this kit comes in. On the instructions posted here it goes over which steps need to be repeated and give more detail.<br /><br />This stuff is super strong once it is on and my daughter still hasn't been able to remove all of it completely. We are going to have to look up the best removal method for dip powder, but the top coat does dry quickly and is very smooth and shiny.<br /><br />Looking at the polish you can almost see the granulated powders. It still leaves a pretty finish, but the glitter appears to be more professional looking since you cannot really see that it is a powder underneath the top coat.\nWorked well, but finish is a little different than your normal polish!\nGERSHION Pastel Gel Nail Polish Set, 6 Colors Gel Polish Set, Soak Off UV Lamp Gel Polish Kit, Nude Pink Yellow Green Color Nail Polish Kit, 7.5ml Gel Polish Kit H-10\nGERSHION\n{'Brand': 'GERSHION', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Color': 'Blue,Green,Pastel,Pink,Purple', 'Type': 'gel', 'Finish Type': 'Glossy', 'Special Feature': 'Long-lasting', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '1.5 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '6', 'Package Dimensions': '4.53 x 3.27 x 3.15 inches; 9.74 Ounces'}\nI love these spring colors in this assortment of gel polishes!
