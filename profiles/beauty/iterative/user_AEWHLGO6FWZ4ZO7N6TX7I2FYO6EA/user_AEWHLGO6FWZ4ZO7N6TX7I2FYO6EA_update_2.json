I love the colors in this set and it seems to last about 12-14 days as long as you prep your nails like you should for gel polish.<br /><br />The color swatch stickers are also nice so you can paint them cure them and apply them to the tops of the bottles and you know which color is which without opening each bottle!\nGood quality gel polish, but wish it included the base and top coat!\nSoo'AE Sweet Pink Bubble Mask, Clarifying & Softening, 1 Count\nSOOAE\n{'Brand': 'SOOAE', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Product Benefits': 'Softening,Softer', 'Scent': 'Peach', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Product Dimensions': '3.5 x 0.1 x 5.5 inches; 0.32 Ounces'}\nI got this as a stocking stuffer for my daughter, I will update the review once she uses it if we see any irritation or issues with it.
