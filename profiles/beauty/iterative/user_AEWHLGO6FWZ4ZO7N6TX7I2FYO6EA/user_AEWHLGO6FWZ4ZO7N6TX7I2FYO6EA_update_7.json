On the instructions posted here it goes over which steps need to be repeated and give more detail.<br /><br />This stuff is super strong once it is on and my daughter still hasn't been able to remove all of it completely. We are going to have to look up the best removal method for dip powder, but the top coat does dry quickly and is very smooth and shiny.<br /><br />Looking at the polish you can almost see the granulated powders. It still leaves a pretty finish, but the glitter appears to be more professional looking since you cannot really see that it is a powder underneath the top coat.\nReview Title: Worked well, but finish is a little different than your normal polish!\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I love the colors in this set and it seems to last about 12-14 days as long as you prep your nails like you should for gel polish.<br /><br />The color swatch stickers are also nice so you can paint them cure them and apply them to the tops of the bottles and you know which color is which without opening each bottle!\nGood quality gel polish, but wish it included the base and top coat!\nSoo'AE Sweet Pink Bubble Mask, Clarifying & Softening, 1 Count\nSOOAE\n{'Brand': 'SOOAE', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Product Benefits': 'Softening,Softer', 'Scent': 'Peach', 'Special Feature': 'Not Tested On Animals', 'Product Dimensions': '3.5 x 0.1 x 5.5 inches; 0.32 Ounces'}\nI got this as a stocking stuffer for my daughter, I will update the review once she uses it if we see any irritation or issues with it.
