I like that they are larger (10\u201dx15\u201d) and individually wrapped, which makes carrying them with you easier.  These would be great to take along on a hiking or camping trip, or any time you might want to wipe down your whole body.  I do NOT understand why the ad, pictures, description or box doesn\u2019t include the size of the item - I find that oddly curious.  They have an interesting scent that I suspect some people may not like.  It is the chaparral scent which can smell a little \u2018chemically\u2019.  It isn\u2019t bad but it *is* a somewhat unusual scent. After wiping down the scent does linger for a while, albeit somewhat lighter.  The wipes seem to have a lot of wiping power... it seemed that the moisture just remained as I wiped down most of my body.  They don\u2019t feel any more moist than other wipes do, but it seems that the moisture goes a longer way.  Overall a very good product that is a little pricey, but does offer a nice convenience factor.\nReview Title: 10\u201d by 15\u201d - larger size wipes\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
