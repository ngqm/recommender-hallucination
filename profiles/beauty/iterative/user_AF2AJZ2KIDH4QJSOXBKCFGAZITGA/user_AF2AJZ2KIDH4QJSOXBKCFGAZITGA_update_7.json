I appreciate that I have had no skin sensitivity, and there is no aroma at all (which is important to me because I wear contacts and often a scent will irritate my eyes - no problem with this serum).  The ingredients seem relatively standard other than the addition of caffeine.  While I like the roller and packaging and the way this feels when applying, I am not noticing any results.  The serum applies *very* thinly... you can barely tell anything has come out of the roller at all.  Because I didn\u2019t experience any effect I thought that maybe the issue was a lack of serum actually being applied and so I started applying it more frequently, and still no noticeable effect for me.  It does provide some moisturization, without leaving a sheen, but doesn\u2019t work as well as another serum that I have used (which also has a very similar roller type application).  I will continue to use it and maybe the results are just delayed... if so I will update the review.  Hope this is helpful to you...\nReview Title: Great packaging, no results so far though\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "allez outdoor | Biodegradable Cleansing Cloths | Natural Plant-Based Face and Body Wipes | PH Balanced | Cactus Bloom and Chaparral Scent | 20ct Individually Wrapped Towelettes\nAllez\n{'Brand': 'Allez', 'Skin Type': 'Oily, Combination, Dry, Normal', 'Material Feature': 'Biodegradable Warning', 'Unit Count': '20.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '6.2 x 5.4 x 4.2 inches; 13.62 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'ABWPS001', 'UPC': '860000823210', 'Manufacturer': 'Allez Outdoor, LLC'}\nThese wipes are pretty good (albeit expensive).  I like that they are larger (10\u201dx15\u201d) and individually wrapped, which makes carrying them with you easier.  These would be great to take along on a hiking or camping trip, or any time you might want to wipe down your whole body.  I do NOT understand why the ad, pictures, description or box doesn\u2019t include the size of the item - I find that oddly curious.  They have an interesting scent that I suspect some people may not like.  It is the chaparral scent which can smell a little \u2018chemically\u2019.  It isn\u2019t bad but it *is* a somewhat unusual scent. After wiping down the scent does linger for a while, albeit somewhat lighter.  The wipes seem to have a lot of wiping power... it seemed that the moisture just remained as I wiped down most of my body.  They don\u2019t feel any more moist than other wipes do, but it seems that the moisture goes a longer way.  Overall a very good product that is a little pricey, but does offer a nice convenience factor.\n10\u201d by 15\u201d - larger size wipes\nEmpty Clear Glass Spray Bottles 2-PACK,Refillable 16 oz Containers for Essential Oils, Cleaning Products, Aromatherapy, Misting Plants, or Cooking - Reliable Sprayer with Mist Settings\nCherry\n{'Brand': 'Cherry', 'Material': 'Glass', 'Capacity': '16 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Special Feature': 'Mist Spray', 'Package Dimensions': '10 x 6.5 x 3.4 inches; 1.4 Pounds', 'UPC': '791523234156'}\nI got these to put water/vinegar mixture in one and alcohol in the other, to use for cleaning and disinfecting purposes, respectively.  I wanted glass, rather than plastic, for these purposes.  The bottles themselves are top notch - heavy duty glass, nice size that is easy to hold yet doesn\u2019t require constant refilling.  There are two included cap tops which are also nice - leak-proof if you want to store something in them that you either don\u2019t need the sprayer for, OR, are transporting them somewhere and want to make sure no spillage.  The sprayer on the other hand, is not so great.  I do like that the sprayer tube is extra long... meaning you can get down to the last few drops.  But it feels cheap overall.  Other problems with the sprayer:  the screw on top fits pretty firmly, but the nozzle does not stay in place - it sort of swivels around.  This gets to be annoying if you are squirting multiple squirts because the nozzle keeps shifting.  The other thing that might be an issue for some is that there are only two settings and they are BOTH mist settings.  It appears that one is a slightly finer mist than the other (barely) but I am not 100% sure that is even the case.  This is not a problem for me because of the purpose I am using them... but wanted to point this out in case it might be a problem for others.  Overall the glass bottles are great but the nozzles need some work.  It also comes with 4 black labels - the labels actually are sort of a thin rubbery material and seem really nice... but what the heck am I going to use to write on BLACK labels?\nGlass bottle is top notch, sprayer is not\n6 Pack Fine Mist Spray Bottles, 3.4oz/100ml Travel Spray Bottle with 2 Funnels & 9 Stickers for Travel Container & Home\nAioink\n{'Brand': 'Aioink', 'Material': 'Plastic', 'Capacity': '100 Milliliters, 3.4 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '6', 'Special Feature': 'Mist Spray', 'Package Dimensions': '9.1 x 5.5 x 1.4 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'Item model number': '6-Sbottles-001'}\nThe bottles are very nice - fairly hard, dense plastic that feels sturdy and durable.  I like that the bottles are clear so that you can see what is in them easily.  Comes with labels and two small funnels to assist in filling the bottles.  These seem leak-proof and I like the misting action.  Also comes with a plastic cap to cover the spray nozzle.  These are great for traveling, your car, purse, your pocket, etc.  I filled one up with rubbing alcohol to keep in the car as a disinfectant (don\u2019t leave it in the sun though!).  Also good for hairspray, water (as a cooling solution), facial toner, etc.  The size is perfect - small enough for portability but holds enough volume to make it worthwhile.\nNice quality bottles\nElectric Shaver for Men, SOOCAS Mens Electric Razor, Wet & Dry IPX7 Waterproof Rotary Facial Shaver, Portable Face Shaver Cordless Travel USB Rechargeable for Husband Dad, Black\nSOOCAS\n{'Brand': 'SOOCAS', 'Special Feature': 'Portable,Rechargeable,Cordless,Waterproof,Compact', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Included Components': 'Charger', 'Blade Material': 'Stainless Steel', 'Package Dimensions': '7.36 x 4.21 x 2.68 inches; 11.18 Ounces', 'Batteries': '1 Lithium Ion batteries required. (included)', 'Manufacturer': 'SOOCAS'}\nThis razor looks sharp, and has great ergonomics - fitting really nicely in your hand, and making it easier to use.  Because I have a beard and mustache (neatly trimmed) I am using the razor on my cheeks and the under part of my neck, so ergonomics are important and this performs great.  The blades are nice and sharp, giving a nice, clean cut with no pulling.  It can take some getting used to the controls... there are two speeds, and the lower speed isn\u2019t adequate for me, but the faster speed is.  Read the instructions closely to make sure you know how to use (they are pretty good, although REALLY tiny print!).  I like that it can be used wet or dry, and is easy to clean.  The only thing that I wish it had was a beard/mustache/sideburn trimmer, but overall it is a nice trimmer, especially for traveling.\nGreat ergonomics, doesn\u2019t have beard/mustache trimmer\nGlass spray bottle-16 ounce empty bottle ounce refillable container 2 packs, suitable for essential oils, cleaning products, aromatherapy, water mist plants with mist and air flow settings\nDS DOODLE SABBATH\n{'Brand': 'DS DOODLE SABBATH', 'Capacity': '16 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '2.76 x 2.76 x 8.27 inches', 'Special Feature': 'Adjustable Nozzle', 'Product Dimensions': '2.76 x 2.76 x 8.27 inches; 1.4 Pounds', 'UPC': '619011520959'}\nThe glass bottles are top notch - the glass is nice and thick, and the color is beautiful.  The \u2018look\u2019 of the bottle is so nice that it actually looks good sitting around anywhere (i.e. you don\u2019t feel the need to hide it in a cabinet, under the counter, etc.).  The nozzle is ok.  It works well, and looks nice with the glass, but doesn\u2019t feel particularly sturdy.  Having said that, it is far better than some others I have had where the nozzle sort of swiveled around while you were attempting to spray (VERY annoying).  There are two settings - a fine mist and a more narrow spray/mist.  Between the two settings you should be able to get the spray you want/need.  It also comes with nice blackboard style labels, two small funnels, and two screw on caps.  The caps are nice in case you want to better seal the contents for some reason - for example, if it won\u2019t be in use for a while, packing it for a trip, etc.  Colored glass is needed for a number of liquids that you might have - peroxide, for example, or an essential oil blend.  The blue in these bottles is just really beautiful, and combined with the black sprayer, creates an attractive bottle so you will be pleased with both the functionality as well as the look.  This is the reason I chose these bottles because I use one of them to mix up a \u2018spider repellent\u2019 spray (water, peppermint oil, and a couple of drops of dish detergent), and it stays on the screened in porch.  Hope this review helps you!\nExcellent quality glass, ok nozzle, great color\nEmpty Amber Glass Spray Bottles - (4 Pack) 16 oz with Labels Refillable Container for Essential Oils, Cleaning Solutions, Cleaning Products, Hair, Plant Mister, Daily Shower, Gardening or Aromatherapy\nAYL\n{'Brand': 'AYL', 'Material': 'Glass', 'Capacity': '16 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '4', 'Product Care Instructions': 'Hand Wash Only', 'Package Dimensions': '9.88 x 7.6 x 7.17 inches; 2.98 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'EmptyAmberGlassSprayBottles 4 Pack', 'UPC': '860005177202'}\nThese amber glass bottles, and included components, are of excellent quality.  I have ordered glass bottles in the past and while the bottles themselves were always okay, the sprayer was often inferior (plus they usually don\u2019t have the other components such as labels, funnel, marking pen, caps).  The glass bottles are great, gorgeous color and sturdy glass.  Colored bottles are needed for certain liquids (peroxide, for example, always comes in an amber/brown container to protect it from light).  The sprayer is high quality and is sturdy.  The spray action is also great - you can set it on mist or stream.  As I noted, the sprayer has been my downfall on previous bottle purchases, so I am happy to see that the sprayers on these are top notch.  You also get two screw on caps in case you don\u2019t want to use the sprayer (or need to transport them and are concerned about leakage).  It also includes 4 labels and a white marking pen, as well as a small stainless steel funnel.  Every component included in the set is top notch, and the totality of the package makes it an excellent value.  I will also note that the bottles and components were very well packaged to protect them during the shipping process.  Overall a definite winner.  Hope this review is helpful to you!\nExcellent quality on all components\nHyaluronic Acid & Caffeine Eye Roller Serum for Men with Vitamin C \u2013 Made in USA \u2013 Depuffing Eye Roller Ball for Dark Circles & Puffiness \u2013 Mens Day & Night Anti-Aging Under Eye Serum Roller \u2013 10ml (0.68 Fl Oz (Pack of 2))\nGentlehomme\n{'Skin Type': 'All', 'Product Benefits': 'Eye-Bag Depuffer', 'Use for': 'Eyes', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'Gentlehomme', 'Package Dimensions': '5.67 x 2.68 x 1.14 inches; 2.89 Ounces', 'UPC': '850030774026', 'Manufacturer': 'Gentlehomme', 'Country of Origin': 'USA'}\nI really like this roller... it is so convenient and easy to apply (and also feels good doing it).
