However, they usually hurt my head. I wore these all day with no issues which is insane. I found t get a picture to give these headbands justice.

  "reference_summary": "Amtidy Solid Color Vintage Modern Style Elastic Women's Rhinestone Crown Tiara, Bridal Wedding Dance Party Birthday Party Women's Headband Tiara, Queen Tiara With Comb\uff08Silver\uff09\nAmtidy\n{'Material': 'Rubber', 'Fabric Type': 'Elastic', 'Brand': 'Amtidy', 'Item Form': 'Spiral', 'Unit Count': '10.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '11.65 x 5.63 x 3.23 inches; 12.03 Ounces', 'UPC': '782931993780'}\nThese headbands are really nice quality. They are like women\u2019s stocking or tights fabric. The colors are very vibrant and the bands are stitched so the knot stays in place. I can\u2019t quite figure out how to style them but overall they are cute, great quality, and good value.<br />If you found this review helpful please click \u201chelpful\u201d below. Thank you.\nVibrant colors, soft, good quality.\nMessy Bun Hair Piece Scrunchy Hair Extensions Tousled Updo Ponytail With Synthetic Hair Elastic Rubber Band Accessories Light Warm Brown\nAileam\n{'Package Dimensions': '4.3 x 4.2 x 1.2 inches; 0.49 Ounces', 'UPC': '780682649574'}\nThis messy bun hair piece does look exactly like the additional photos in the add. However, it doesn\u2019t look anything like the woman\u2019s hair in the main/first picture. I snapped some photos of me wrapping it around my bun and then just adding it to a \u201cmessy bun\u201d. If you want more volume it definitely works! I didn\u2019t quite get the right color so it doesn\u2019t work perfectly for me. It\u2019s hard to pick a color on a screen but it wasn\u2019t too far off. If you are doing a lot of zoom meetings this can help add some volume and change up your look. Since the cameras aren\u2019t extremely clear it definitely would pass for me as part of my bun. It came with a fun colorful hair tie and some Bobby pins.\nAdds volume. Try to match your color.\nFolora 4pcs Premium 1 Inch Wide Solid Color Floral Plaid Headband Set for Women Girls, Blue-2\nFolora\n{'Material': 'Plastic', 'Brand': 'Folora', 'Unit Count': '4.00 Count', 'Product Dimensions': '4.72 x 0.98 x 5.51 inches; 2.26 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'FLR-HB-4pcs Blue-2'}\nThese headbands are very good quality and beautiful blue colors. They are light weight and have a little suede lining which helps them stay put. I got these to spruce up my zoom meeting. they make a nice accessory. My 3YO even looks adorable in one. Since they are light they do not hurt while wearing them. Great value.\nBeautiful lightweight headbands that don\u2019t hurt your head.\nNxconsu 8Pcs Rhinestone Headbands for Women Girls Teens Kids Fashion Comfort No Hurting Hair Accessories Thin Hair Bands Crystal Exquisite Color Selection\nNxconsu\n{'Age Range (Description)': 'Child', 'Occasion': 'Wedding, Birthday', 'Material': 'Silk, Cotton', 'Fabric Type': 'Rhinestone', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '8.15 x 6.77 x 1.54 inches; 8.5 Ounces'}\nI love to wear headbands to jazz up my zoom meetings.
