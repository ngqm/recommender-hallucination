I have a ton of head bands and can now hang them on this as well as my other hangers on the wall. This really spaces them out for easy viewing. I could also add hair ties and necklaces and scrunchies. It\u2019s versatile so you can use it for a bunch of things. It would also be great in my daughters room. The metal hooks are sharp though so be careful putting them in but they seem to hold well. The price is great for this item.\nReview Title: Holds a lot of different things.\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Amtidy Solid Color Vintage Modern Style Elastic Women's Rhinestone Crown Tiara, Bridal Wedding Dance Party Birthday Party Women's Headband Tiara, Queen Tiara With Comb\uff08Silver\uff09\nAmtidy\n{'Material': 'Rubber', 'Fabric Type': 'Elastic', 'Brand': 'Amtidy', 'Item Form': 'Spiral', 'Unit Count': '10.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '11.65 x 5.63 x 3.23 inches; 12.03 Ounces', 'UPC': '782931993780'}\nThese headbands are really nice quality. They are like women\u2019s stocking or tights fabric. The colors are very vibrant and the bands are stitched so the knot stays in place. I can\u2019t quite figure out how to style them but overall they are cute, great quality, and good value.<br />If you found this review helpful please click \u201chelpful\u201d below. Thank you.\nVibrant colors, soft, good quality.\nMessy Bun Hair Piece Scrunchy Hair Extensions Tousled Updo Ponytail With Synthetic Hair Elastic Rubber Band Accessories Light Warm Brown\nAileam\n{'Package Dimensions': '4.3 x 4.2 x 1.2 inches; 0.49 Ounces', 'UPC': '780682649574'}\nThis messy bun hair piece does look exactly like the additional photos in the add. However, it doesn\u2019t look anything like the woman\u2019s hair in the main/first picture. I snapped some photos of me wrapping it around my bun and then just adding it to a \u201cmessy bun\u201d. If you want more volume it definitely works! I didn\u2019t quite get the right color so it doesn\u2019t work perfectly for me. It\u2019s hard to pick a color on a screen but it wasn\u2019t too far off. If you are doing a lot of zoom meetings this can help add some volume and change up your look. Since the cameras aren\u2019t extremely clear it definitely would pass for me as part of my bun. It came with a fun colorful hair tie and some Bobby pins.\nAdds volume. Try to match your color.\nFolora 4pcs Premium 1 Inch Wide Solid Color Floral Plaid Headband Set for Women Girls, Blue-2\nFolora\n{'Material': 'Plastic', 'Brand': 'Folora', 'Unit Count': '4.00 Count', 'Product Dimensions': '4.72 x 0.98 x 5.51 inches; 2.26 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'FLR-HB-4pcs Blue-2'}\nThese headbands are very good quality and beautiful blue colors. They are light weight and have a little suede lining which helps them stay put. I got these to spruce up my zoom meeting. they make a nice accessory. My 3YO even looks adorable in one. Since they are light they do not hurt while wearing them. Great value.\nBeautiful lightweight headbands that don\u2019t hurt your head.\nNxconsu 8Pcs Rhinestone Headbands for Women Girls Teens Kids Fashion Comfort No Hurting Hair Accessories Thin Hair Bands Crystal Exquisite Color Selection\nNxconsu\n{'Age Range (Description)': 'Child', 'Occasion': 'Wedding, Birthday', 'Material': 'Silk, Cotton', 'Fabric Type': 'Rhinestone', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '8.15 x 6.77 x 1.54 inches; 8.5 Ounces'}\nI love to wear headbands to jazz up my zoom meetings. However, they usually hurt my head. I wore these all day with no issues which is insane. I found t get a picture to give these headbands justice. They are very simple with just a little shine and I think are so very cute. The value is great as well since you get so many for the low price. Definitely recommend. The colors are gorgeous.\nGorgeous colors, shine and comfortable.\n2 Pack Hair Towel Wrap Turban Microfiber Drying Shower and Bath, Twist Head Towels with Button, Magic Quick Dryer, Hair Care for Women and Girls, One Wrap Plus One Cap and Two Velvet Hair Bands\nMEETWIN\n{}\nLove love love these towels.  They are great quality. They are thick and very pretty. I love the wooden button. I\u2019ve had a few sets of these types of towels and I like these the best. They are thick and really  absorb water. They also stay tightly wrapped which is much needed when you have a lot of wet hair. I prefer the twist over the cap type towel. The two extra velvet scrunches are a nice as on too. Definitely recommend. Great value for the price.\nThick, absorbent, and nice quality.\nChristmas Headbands for Women,Glitter headbands Sequence Red and Green,Holiday Costume Headwear Handmade Mouse Ears Hairband Hair Decorations for Girl Party Cosplay Favor Accessories\nYanJie\n{'Age Range (Description)': 'Child', 'Occasion': 'Christmas, Party, Birthday, Thanksgiving', 'Material': 'Cotton Blend', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Brand': 'YanJie', 'Package Dimensions': '10.12 x 7.6 x 1.22 inches; 1.13 Ounces', 'UPC': '751300682099'}\nThese Holiday Minnie Ears are adorable. I am so excited to wear them this season. They are shiny and really beautiful and festive. I gave 4 stars because when you are close up you can see the hot glue used in the center but when their on no one would notice. They fit me well. My 4yo loves to wear them but when she looks down they slide down off her head but that\u2019s because her head is too small. She loves the colors too!\nVery festive!\nHair Scarf Scrunchies Organizer, Hanging Hair Ribbon Bow Scrunchies Holder, Hair Ties Bowknot Ponytail Storage Display Stand for Women Girls (yellow)\nPACMAXI\n{'Color': 'Yellow', 'Item Form': 'Scrunchie', 'Brand': 'PACMAXI', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Item Weight': '175 Grams', 'Package Dimensions': '12.05 x 8 x 1.5 inches; 6.17 Ounces'}\nThis is great!
