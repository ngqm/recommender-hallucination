However, it doesn\u2019t look anything like the woman\u2019s hair in the main/first picture. I snapped some photos of me wrapping it around my bun and then just adding it to a \u201cmessy bun\u201d. If you want more volume it definitely works! I didn\u2019t quite get the right color so it doesn\u2019t work perfectly for me. It\u2019s hard to pick a color on a screen but it wasn\u2019t too far off. If you are doing a lot of zoom meetings this can help add some volume and change up your look. Since the cameras aren\u2019t extremely clear it definitely would pass for me as part of my bun. It came with a fun colorful hair tie and some Bobby pins.\nReview Title: Adds volume. Try to match your color.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

They are like women\u2019s stocking or tights fabric. The colors are very vibrant and the bands are stitched so the knot stays in place. I can\u2019t quite figure out how to style them but overall they are cute, great quality, and good value.<br />If you found this review helpful please click \u201chelpful\u201d below.
