(90ml) - Soft Melting Milk Texture Makeup Cleansing Balm, Mineral Contained Nourishing & Soothing Cleansing, Rose Scented\nReview Date: 2019/12/30\nStore: Samyang\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '3.66 x 3.39 x 2.36 inches; 5.57 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I tried this a few times and couldn't help but feeling like it left residue on my face. I end up using my normal face wash afterwards to feel properly cleansed.<br /><br />To be fair I don't wear much face makeup so perhaps this might work better for someone that wears foundation. I did try to remove my eye makeup with this balm and it was too greasy/thick and also stung my eyes, whereas my micellar water won't do that.<br /><br />The scent is a nice clean rose scent and I like the packaging, but I don't think I'll continue to use this. Seems like more work than is necessary and kinda makes me feel like it will clog my pores in the long run...\nReview Title: Feels like it creates an extra step...\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Remy Human Hair Pieces Front Clip in Hair #1B Natural Black Fringe Hair Extensions with Hair Temples\n{'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Installation Type': 'Clip-In', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '9 x 1 x 1 inches; 0.48 Ounces', 'UPC': '615517482166'}\nI think this might work for people with smaller heads or smaller faces but I felt it wasn\u2019t wider enough or thick enough to look good on me. The hair was very soft and real looking though!\nNot very much hair\nJPNK 10PCS Makeup tool set, Blender Sponges& Air cushion puff&Sponge Holder for Blending Liquid, Cream or Flawless Powder Cosmetics\nJPNK\n{'Brand': 'JPNK', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Foundation,Concealer,Blender', 'Package Dimensions': '8.5 x 5.4 x 2.3 inches; 5.61 Ounces'}\nYou never know what you're gonna get with some of these beauty sponges, but this is definitely one of the good sets.<br /><br />The sponges are actually soft and don't absorb as much product as other sponges. I recently tried another brand that looked exactly the same but they were so hard and rubbery. These are soooo much softer in comparison. I don't feel like I'm softly punching my face like I do with the others\ud83d\ude02<br /><br />Very easy to clean, after use and have no weird smell or anything. I haven't used the puffs or brush yet but I'm going to attempt to use the puffs for powder or maybe even jelly products. The brush would probably work well for concealer or eyeshadow primer. It has soft bristles and a solid handle.<br /><br />Overall I think this is an awesome quality set for a great price!!\nHigher quality beauty sponges than other brands!\nSAMYANG ABOUTME Red Recipe Super Cleansing Balm 3.04 oz.
