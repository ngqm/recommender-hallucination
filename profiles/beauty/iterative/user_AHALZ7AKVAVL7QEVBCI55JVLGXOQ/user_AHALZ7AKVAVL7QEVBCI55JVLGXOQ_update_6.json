I apply it straight on my face, rub it in a bit, then add a bit of water to my hands, lather, then rub again. Then rinse k<br /><br />I have combo skin with drier cheeks and this doesn't leave my skin feeling stripped or dry. Still feels moisturized.<br /><br />This product smells of roses pretty strongly but I actually love the way it smells so I don't mind at all.<br /><br />Wouldn't really recommend for eye makeup though, I did find it to sting a bit so I'm just gonna stick to micellar for my eye makeup.<br /><br />Hope this review helps!:)\nReview Title: Melts away makeup, smells great\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Remy Human Hair Pieces Front Clip in Hair #1B Natural Black Fringe Hair Extensions with Hair Temples\n{'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Installation Type': 'Clip-In', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '9 x 1 x 1 inches; 0.48 Ounces', 'UPC': '615517482166'}\nI think this might work for people with smaller heads or smaller faces but I felt it wasn\u2019t wider enough or thick enough to look good on me. The hair was very soft and real looking though!\nNot very much hair\nJPNK 10PCS Makeup tool set, Blender Sponges& Air cushion puff&Sponge Holder for Blending Liquid, Cream or Flawless Powder Cosmetics\nJPNK\n{'Brand': 'JPNK', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Foundation,Concealer,Blender', 'Package Dimensions': '8.5 x 5.4 x 2.3 inches; 5.61 Ounces'}\nYou never know what you're gonna get with some of these beauty sponges, but this is definitely one of the good sets.<br /><br />The sponges are actually soft and don't absorb as much product as other sponges. I recently tried another brand that looked exactly the same but they were so hard and rubbery. These are soooo much softer in comparison. I don't feel like I'm softly punching my face like I do with the others\ud83d\ude02<br /><br />Very easy to clean, after use and have no weird smell or anything. I haven't used the puffs or brush yet but I'm going to attempt to use the puffs for powder or maybe even jelly products. The brush would probably work well for concealer or eyeshadow primer. It has soft bristles and a solid handle.<br /><br />Overall I think this is an awesome quality set for a great price!!\nHigher quality beauty sponges than other brands!\nSAMYANG ABOUTME Red Recipe Super Cleansing Balm 3.04 oz. (90ml) - Soft Melting Milk Texture Makeup Cleansing Balm, Mineral Contained Nourishing & Soothing Cleansing, Rose Scented\nSamyang\n{'Package Dimensions': '3.66 x 3.39 x 2.36 inches; 5.57 Ounces'}\nI tried this a few times and couldn't help but feeling like it left residue on my face. I end up using my normal face wash afterwards to feel properly cleansed.<br /><br />To be fair I don't wear much face makeup so perhaps this might work better for someone that wears foundation. I did try to remove my eye makeup with this balm and it was too greasy/thick and also stung my eyes, whereas my micellar water won't do that.<br /><br />The scent is a nice clean rose scent and I like the packaging, but I don't think I'll continue to use this. Seems like more work than is necessary and kinda makes me feel like it will clog my pores in the long run...\nFeels like it creates an extra step...\n[moonshot] Cream Paint Lightfit Air 3g - Blackpink Lisa Makeup Kpop Kbeauty Cosmetics, Airy Velvet Texture Matte Lip Makeup, Long Lasting Natrual Daily Lip Color (501 Almond Rose)\nMoonshot\n{'Brand': 'Moonshot', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Finish Type': 'Cream', 'Product Benefits': 'Long Lasting,Brightening,Makeup'}\nA pretty MLBB velvety lip color.  The formula isn't nearly as drying as typical matte liquid lips. More of a velvety mousse like texture.<br /><br />I have medium tan skin and I'd say this is a nude pink shade on me so it may be a bit light for deeper skin tones.<br /><br />I discovered you can also use this as a cheek color as well! I dab a bit on the back of my hand and apply it from there. It's pretty pigmented on the cheeks so starting with less is better.\nCan also be used as cream blush!:)\nHair Scrunchies for women,Including 3 Pcs Long Silk Satin Hair Scarf & 3 Pcs Bunny Ear Scrunchies & 3 Pcs Elastic Hair Bands Scrunchy and 7Pcs Pearl Hair Clips,(16Pcs/9Colors)\nSuptikes\n{'Material': 'Pearl, Silk', 'Item Form': 'Scrunchie', 'Brand': 'Suptikes', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '5 x 5 x 0.7 inches', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Product Dimensions': '5 x 5 x 0.7 inches; 7.2 Ounces', 'UPC': '760635003608'}\nThese scrunchies look great in person, especially the plain scrunchies, theyre a beautiful silk like material that has some shine to it. The plain ones also have a heavy duty elastic in them. I have super thick long hair and these do a great job of keeping my hair in a bun.<br /><br />Ive definitely overpaid for scrunchies at urban outfitters when these are just as nice if not nicer for sooo much cheaper. They're great!:)<br /><br />The little barettes are just okay, I find they pull my hair but the scrunchies are totally worth it.\nSuper cute plus great deal!!\nBior\u00e9 J-Beauty Makeup Removing Moisturizing Cleansing Jelly, Top Japanese Makeup Remover, Gentle Skin Cleanser, Mild Floral Fragrance, Non-Greasy, 7.8 Ounce\nBior\u00e9\n['Bior\u00e9 J-Beauty Makeup Removing Moisturizing Cleansing Jelly is a non-greasy makeup remover that removes dirt and impurities from deep below the surface of your skin.
