  "reference_summary": "La Deessa Powerful 20% Vitamin C Serum For Face +11% Hyaluronic, Organic Anti Aging Skin Care. Hydrate, Moisturize, Increase Collagen, Reduce Fine Lines, Hyper pigmentation & Acne.\nLa Deessa\n['La Deessa products are the answer to compromised skin structure & integrity. With the utmost respect for our eco system, La Deessa sustainably combines Natural, Organic, Plant Based and Wild Crafted Botanicals with clinically proven & independently peer reviewed superstar natural and organic age-defying ingredients with highly effective delivery systems to create results-driven anti aging skin care products. KEY INGREDIENT HIGHLIGHTS: ALOE VERA increases your body\u2019s production of collagen and is packed with essential vitamins including A, B1, B2, B6, B12, C & E. Aloe penetrates skin four-times (4x) more rapidly than water and accelerates skin cell reproduction by as much as eight-times (8x)! VITAMIN C supports every aspect of collagen production from stem cell activity to improving the structural integrity, resilience and stability of the skin. Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate is an extremely stable and gentle Vitamin C derivative and a precursor to Vitamin C; it waits to convert into Ascorbic Acid until it is fully absorbed, at which time the sodium molecules separate, converting it into pure Vitamin C deep within your skin...this prevents irritation and amplifies antioxidant benefits, making Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate a superior form of Vitamin C in cosmetic formulations. HYALURONIC ACID has the unique ability to hold more than 1000 times its weight in water, allowing the skin to retain more water. Amazingly, hyaluronic acid adjusts its moisture absorption to your skin\u2019s need for moisture making it ideal for all skin types. Hyaluronic acid also protects the epidermis by scavenging reactive oxygen species generated by ultra violet light. Our formulations contain high percentages of Hyaluronic Acid. MSM- METHYL SULPHONYL MTHANE (ORGANIC SULFUR) Dubbed the \u201cBeauty Mineral\u201d Organic sulfur is referred to as the \u201cBeauty Mineral\u201d because it promotes oxygen transport across cell membranes (intracellular) facilitating cellular regeneration\u2026resulting in skin that is more beautiful.']\n{'Skin Type': 'All', 'Scent': 'Fragrance Free', 'Brand': 'La Deessa', 'Item Form': 'liquid', 'Material Feature': 'Organic, Gluten Free, Natural, Vegan', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '4 x 2 x 2 inches; 3 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'LD-VITAC20', 'UPC': '040232150944', 'Manufacturer': 'La Deessa'}\nI have very dry and sensitive skin and read so many good things about Vitamin C Serum.
