A brush with handle seemed like the obvious choice.<br /><br />The first one I bought had bristles on it and it was so hard it hurt to use so I couldn\u2019t even bear the discomfort on my back. That one was better for scrubbing feet or less sensitive areas.<br /><br />This one is completely different and luxurious. The handle is a thick bamboo that is sealed. It\u2019s a neutral colored wood but very attractive. There is some wrapped smooth rope on the base of the brush for holding. It makes the brush less slick when it\u2019s wet and soapy. There is also a hole with a piece of that same rope for hanging. I use the rope to hang the body brush off of my shower caddy.<br /><br />The bristles are extremely soft! They are pure white and have been cut so that they have a texture for the skin.  The bristles are tightly positioned and there are a ton of tiny ones. They are as soft it not softer than some of my smoothest make up brushes. It\u2019s soft enough that it could be used on my skin without irritating it.<br /><br />Now the flip side is that because it is so soft there isn\u2019t any exfoliating action. I wouldn\u2019t mind some slightly more rigid like a loofah for really deep cleaning. It\u2019s even softer than a wash cloth but closer to a makeup cloth. This brush is really going to depend on the user and the need. It\u2019s not for exfoliating.\nReview Title: Softest soft, not for exfoliating\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Pretty Frank Natural Deodorant - No Aluminum Deodorant for Women, Men, Teens, & Kids \u2013 Paraben Sulfate Free Solid Deodorant Featuring Shea Butter, Coconut Oil, Vitamin E & Baking Soda (Lavender)\nPRETTY FRANK\n{'Brand': 'PRETTY FRANK', 'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Scent': 'Lavender, Coconut', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '5.87 x 5.12 x 1.14 inches; 4.23 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'DSF-BS-LAV'}\nIn the past, I have not had good experience with baking soda deodorant. Usually, my armpits breakout in a red rash. However, I have not had this deodorant irritate my skin.<br /><br />The lavender scent is earthy and natural. It has a deep lavender scent that is fairly strong. As it is a more natural deodorant, it does not glide like the big name brands. It has a slight moisture to it and by warming the deodorant, it slide slightly better.<br /><br />I have noticed that I need to reapply. Depending on my activity level, I have had to reapply two or three times throughout a day. I think the important thing to remember with these natural deodorants is to not expect them to perform like the big name brands. They provide minimal long term fragrance as well as sweat protection.\nPowerful initial scent\nBath Body Brush with Super Comfy Bristles for Universal Skin,Long Bamboo Handle Gentle Exfoliation Improve Skin's Health and Beauty Wet or Dry Brushing Back Scrubber for Shower\nZhaoyun\n['Bath Body Exfoliating Brush,Shower Back Cleaning Scrubber with Long Handle,Dry or Wet Skin Exfoliator Brush with Soft Bristles Back Washer', 'Perfect for Daily Hygiene and Sensitive Skin.', 'Soft Nylon Bristles Be Easier to produce abundant foam,Just add some gel on it and rub the bristles.', 'This Brush will help you a better bath experience, Feel Fresh and Renewed Every Day.', 'Long Reach Handle', 'The Extended 16 inches Long Handle Will Use More Friendly.', 'Note\uff1athis brush bristles is too soft so if you want to exfoliate, we recommend using it with a body scrub.']\n{'Product Dimensions': '17 x 4 x 2 inches; 7.55 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Zhaoyun'}\nI have been using a loofah but I feel like I wanted something that could easily reach my entire back without having to be a total contortionist in the shower.
