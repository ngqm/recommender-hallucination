Usually, my armpits breakout in a red rash. However, I have not had this deodorant irritate my skin.<br /><br />The lavender scent is earthy and natural. It has a deep lavender scent that is fairly strong. As it is a more natural deodorant, it does not glide like the big name brands. It has a slight moisture to it and by warming the deodorant, it slide slightly better.<br /><br />I have noticed that I need to reapply. Depending on my activity level, I have had to reapply two or three times throughout a day. I think the important thing to remember with these natural deodorants is to not expect them to perform like the big name brands. They provide minimal long term fragrance as well as sweat protection.\nReview Title: Powerful initial scent\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
