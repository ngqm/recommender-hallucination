And this is the packaging that within the Amazon package. Luckily all 3 packs were there. I was also worried because the hair looked really plastic-y .Once I started using it though, it was really easy to work with! I ended up cutting the hair to make shorter box braids though because it was so long. I would recommend ordering 2 to cover your whole head. I needed 6 packs to do a full head of box braids.\nReview Title: Great for box braids!\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Natwag Makeup Remover Pads,18 Pack 3.74 Inch Reusable Microfiber Cleansing Pad with Laundry Bag Suitable for All Skin Types,3 Color Facial Cleansing Pad Set.\nNatwag\n{'Brand': 'Natwag', 'Skin Type': 'All Skin,Dry', 'Material Feature': 'Reusable', 'Unit Count': '18.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '18', 'Package Dimensions': '4.4 x 4.37 x 2.59 inches; 3.84 Ounces', 'UPC': '745103569701'}\nThis took off layers of foundation and contouring easily, but was soft on the skin while removing them. I like the loops on each pad because I can hook a finger through the loop to keep the pad in place while I wash my face.\nSoft on skin, hard on makeup\nBiutee Poly Nail Gel Kit 15ml 0.53oz Pink Nail Extension Gel Builder Gel Long Lasting Nail Salon Nail Art Design DIY at Home Beginner Friendly\u2026\nBiutee\n{'Package Dimensions': '3.5 x 2 x 1.5 inches; 0.81 Ounces'}\nThe polygel is very sticky and hard to smooth out on the mold. I used nail polish remover in between nails to make it a little easier. Once the gel was finally applied, I was impressed, but the nails only lasted two days before falling off during daily activities like washing my hair and doing the dishes. And that was after I put dip powder on top of the polygel for color. Also note that this is only the gel, you have to order a mold separately to help put them on.\nNot long lasting\n3 Packs Braiding Hair Extensions 165G Jumbo Braiding Hair High Temperature Synthetic Fiber Jumbo Braiding Hair Extensions ( Blue)\nUHair\n{'Brand': 'UHair', 'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Material Feature': 'Natural'}\nI was a little worried because the packaging was ripped when it came.
