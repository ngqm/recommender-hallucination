I used nail polish remover in between nails to make it a little easier. Once the gel was finally applied, I was impressed, but the nails only lasted two days before falling off during daily activities like washing my hair and doing the dishes. And that was after I put dip powder on top of the polygel for color. Also note that this is only the gel, you have to order a mold separately to help put them on.\nReview Title: Not long lasting\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
