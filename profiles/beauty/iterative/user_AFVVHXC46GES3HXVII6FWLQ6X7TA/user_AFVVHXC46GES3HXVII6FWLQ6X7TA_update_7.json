And they have become drier after baby#2. I started using this and I'm liking how it performs. Its lightweight, non greasy and absorbs well. Nice soft scent.

Great to have them in the car/purse/desk etc.\nReview Title: So far so good.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Beast Blue Beard Oil with Organic Argan & Jojoba Oils, 1 fl oz\nTame the Beast\n{'Liquid Volume': '1 Fluid Ounces', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Brand': 'Tame the Beast', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Unit Count': '1 FL OZ', 'Package Dimensions': '7.05 x 3.54 x 1.54 inches; 2.89 Ounces', 'UPC': '817662018546'}\nOut of all the beard oils the husband has used he says this one is the best. Its lightweight, moisturizing and the scent (which is excellent on its own) doesn't linger too long. I've tried other products from this line and they've all been great!\n5/5\n4 Pieces Glass Nail Shiner Crystal Nail Shine Buffer Polisher Crystal Glass Nano Nail File with Case for Natural Nails (Black Flat End)\nMudder\n{'Material': 'Glass', 'Brand': 'Mudder', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Product Dimensions': '3.94 x 1.57 x 0.63 inches; 2.4 Ounces'}\nI don't understand the good reviews. This didn't work for me. It was uncomfortable to use and didn't do a good job. I feel like it did more damage than good. There's scratches on my nails, even if you use a lighter hand you don't see any results.\nNot for me.\nWinky Lux Double Matte Whip 24-Hour Waterproof Lipstick, Liquid Wet Lipstick for Long-Lasting Matte Lip Color, Hydrating Makeup with Vanilla and Avocado Oil to Lock in Moisture, 0.14 Oz, Cookie\nWinky Lux\n{'Brand': 'Winky Lux', 'Color': 'Cookie', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Finish Type': 'Matte', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '0.65 x 0.65 x 4.28 inches; 0.14 Ounces', 'UPC': '859346006968'}\nIf you have dry lips and you'd like still like to find a liquid lipstick that doesn't crack on your lips I'm afraid this isn't it. It dries out very quickly and it settles in my lines.<br />The shade of it is nice, I can imagine it looking beautiful on someone with deeper skin tone, I have brown skin but on me it looks unflattering. It does have a soft, non irritating scent which I like.\nNot for me unfortunately!\nFoot Peel Mask For Cracked Heels, Dead Skin & Calluses - Make Your Feet Baby Soft & Get a Smooth Skin, Removes & Repairs Rough Heels\nMonikahair\n{'UPC': '739515020639'}\nThis does work but you gotta follow the instructions properly! It wont show any results immediately but over time I saw lots of dead skin shedding which was gross but also satisfying.\nIt works!\n35.4 Inch Extra Long Silicone Back Scrubber for Shower, 2021 Updated Lengthen Back Scrubber Brush for Men and Women, Exfoliating Back Washer with Wall Hooks, Easy Clean, Comfortable Massage (Green 27.5in)\nMAORULU\n{'Package Dimensions': '8.75 x 5.5 x 2.6 inches; 6.38 Ounces', 'UPC': '757173533773', 'Manufacturer': 'MAORULU'}\nI don't think this is doing anything. I've used it a couple times and doesn't feel like its doing its job. The bristles are way too soft. If you are itchy and can't reach your back then its great. But I wouldn't get this using it would clean my back.\nToo mild.\nTravel Bottles for Toiletries, Silicone Travel Size Bottles And Squeezable Containers Holders with belt clip Keychain for Backpack, Shampoo, Liquid, Cosmetic Products(2 oz, 6 Pack)\nMACRAY\n{'Brand': 'MACRAY', 'Material': 'Silicone', 'Capacity': '2 Ounces', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '11.73 x 6.61 x 1.61 inches; 8.47 Ounces', 'UPC': '782938308006'}\nI got these to throw in my hospital bag. They are good quality, do the job very well. I have not travelled anywhere with these so I am not sure if they leak while flying but I would still throw them in a ziploc to be on the safe side. They are silicone so its super easy to squeeze.<br />Overall its a great travelling essential.\nDoes the job.\nSpanature Olive Hand & Body Lotion Travel Size Selection, 4 Pack, Revitalizing Moisturizer for Rough and Dry Skin, Nourishing and Gentle for All Skin Types, Made In Korea - 75 ml/2.53oz\nSpanature\n{'Brand': 'Spanature', 'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '4', 'Use for': 'Hands', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.1 x 1.89 x 1.5 inches; 2.4 Ounces'}\nI have extremely dry hands.
