While it supplies major moisture, my skin did not appreciate the thickness. When I woke up the first morning after using my face felt greasy. It didn't appear to have that sheer feeling of a clean moisturizer. Afterward, I applied the serum every other night. Four days later, I had breakouts on my nose. I have combination skin. This didn't work well for me, but I can see this working for those with severely dry skin.\nReview Title: Vitamin C Serum\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
