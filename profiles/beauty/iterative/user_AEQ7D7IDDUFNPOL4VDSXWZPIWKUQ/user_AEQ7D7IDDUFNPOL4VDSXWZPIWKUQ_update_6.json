Hoping for positive results from BEPHOLAN serum. Ingredients are reported to be natural ingredients such as hydrolyzed oat protein, olive glycerides, and sodium hyaluronate. After doing a bit of online investigation about sodium hyaluronate, there is some indication that it can assist in hair growth. It may moisturize the hair shaft and keep it from breakage. Turns out, it could help hair growth. So, does this apply to eyelashes? Hmm. The serum comes in a mascara tube. Instead of applying with a brush, the serum is applied to the eye with a mascara wand. I've gotta say - I thought this would be better applied to roots, but the serum doesn't seem to adhere to the wand as it would to a small brush-on wand. I have to really dig the wand into the container to get the serum to stick to the applicator. My solution is to use my own small paintbrush. Thankfully, it seems to apply to my lashes much better. I've been using this lash serum for less than a week. I don't normally post reviews until I've had noticeable improvements. The product description says that lashes may show improvement within two weeks. I will post an update in two weeks to a month. I believe consistency is key with most of these products. I use it twice a day on days that I'm on top of my game. It's quick and easy. Most days, though, it's once a day. BEPHOLAN Cosmetics suggests taking a BEFORE and AFTER picture of your lashes. Stay tuned.\nReview Title: Eyelash Serum\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "MD Complete Bright & Healthy Vitamin C+ Vitalizing Face Serum| with Vitamin C, Vitamin E and Herbal Extracts | Potent Antioxidant Protection, Nourishes, Brightens and Evens Skin 0.5 fl oz\nMD Complete by Dr. Brian Zelickson\n{'Skin Type': 'Acne Prone, Sensitive', 'Use for': 'Face', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'MD Complete by Dr. Brian Zelickson', 'Item Form': 'Serum', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.05 x 1.63 x 3.75 inches; 4.97 Ounces', 'UPC': '850458005573'}\nNot my favorite Vit C serum. While it supplies major moisture, my skin did not appreciate the thickness. When I woke up the first morning after using my face felt greasy. It didn't appear to have that sheer feeling of a clean moisturizer. Afterward, I applied the serum every other night. Four days later, I had breakouts on my nose. I have combination skin. This didn't work well for me, but I can see this working for those with severely dry skin.\nVitamin C Serum\nBouquet Garni Body Shower White Musk - Unique Fragrance Decanting Engineering Method gives Long Lasting Rich Fragrance - Gentle and Mild Cleansing Scented Body Wash with Natural Surfactant 17.85 Fl Oz\nBouquet Garni\n{'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Skin Type': 'All, Dry', 'Brand': 'Bouquet Garni', 'Scent': 'Garni', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '8.23 x 6.34 x 3.66 inches; 1.34 Pounds'}\nSince COVID, finding soap and shower gels isn't the easiest task. Not sure if people are drinking gels in the shower or just really self-conscious about cleanliness. Either way, I often find myself ordering products online. The selection at physical stores is iffy. Ran across this product and decided to give it a try. After all, the packaging is attractive. If anything it will look nice in a guest bathroom IF I ever have guests at my house again.<br /><br />First, the size is great. Almost 18 ounces! Popular brands offer a hand pump with 7.5 oz. Bouquet Garni is double the size. That's a good thing. Less I've gotta get out. I'm not crazy about the White Musk smell. It's a floral scent. I'm more of a woodsy, fruity scent. On the other hand, my mother loves this scent. So, while I planned to use this as a shower gel, I've decided to use it in the guest bath. Mom can enjoy the rich lather every time she washes her hands.<br /><br />Made in Korea. I'm not sure of the ingredients because the back label is foreign. I'm sure the website offers ingredients if one must know.\nBouquet Garni Body Shower Gel\nRevitalizing N.M.F Intensive Hydrating Serum that treats Dull, Tired, Dry and Sensitive Skin from Manilla Natural Skincare\nManilla Natural Skincare\n{'Skin Type': 'mature', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydration', 'Brand': 'Manilla Natural Skincare', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Hydrating,Wrinkles', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.38 x 1.38 x 3.54 inches; 3.99 Ounces'}\nWhat woman doesn't love cosmetics and everything that entails? I'm always keeping my eyes open for beneficial face creams and serums. I became obsessed with healthy skin after moving to Puerto Rico. We all of us know about the sun's damaging effects. It's harmful to all skin, not just those with aging skin. Algae can quite possibly reduce the breakdown of hyaluronic acid within the skin. Algae subspecies have anti-aging benefits. Undaria pinnatifida extract is shown to reduce wrinkle depth and improve over-all skin appearance. It also helps to protect the skin's natural stores of collagen and hyaluronic acid. The alteromonas ferment extract is found in deep seawater algae. It has binding properties that help hydration. Salicornia herbacea extract contains good-for-the-skin things \u2013 increasing skin barrier and deep hydration. It might even help the skin recover. Caprylic triglyceride reduces dryness and has anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal properties. It will not clog pores and is suitable for people with oily skin. Arginine protects the skin from free radicals that contribute to fine lines. Arginine in cosmetics hydrates and boosts collagen production. The parfum ingredient is not damaging to the skin. Maltol and POLYQUATERNIUM-80 (plant-based) is used in cosmetics regularly and deemed safe.  NMF (Natural Moisturizing Factor) components work to keep skin supple and hydrated. The combination of these ingredients is a friend to the skin's health. Understanding what's in our products ensures that we are buying serums we actually want to put on our faces. Knowing all of this, I am 100% satisfied with applying this serum. The smell is reminiscent of cotton candy. It isn't overpowering. In fact, I think it enhances my want to use. It feels indulgent. It smells incredible. It appears to be working well for me. I have nothing to say about this product but great, great things!\nMOMENTUM Face Serum\nFollain Everybody Bar Soap | Lavender & Bergamot, Skin Moisturizing Hand & Body Cleanser with Shea Butter, Argan Oil, Hydrate for Softer Skin, Non-Drying, Rich-Lather, Cruelty Free, 5 oz\nFollain\n{'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Brand': 'Follain', 'Scent': 'Bergamot,Lavender', 'Material Feature': 'Cru, Non GMO, Dermatologist Tested', 'Product Dimensions': '3.75 x 2.25 x 1 inches; 5.11 Ounces', 'Item model number': '692764483009', 'UPC': '692764483009'}\nThank you, Follain! I could easily get addicted to this large bar of soap. It has a light minty scent. If you're familiar with essential oils, well, it smells lovely. Not overpowering. My husband likes it, too. During my shower, the soap lathered exceptionally well. It rinsed clean and didn't leave that residue that some other soaps leave behind. I felt squeaky clean. Follain gets a ten from me!\nLarge Bar of Soap\nGreenLife Russian Volume Eyelash Extension D Curl .07 Mix 5 Rows Blomming Flower 2d 3d ~10d Premade Fans Easy Fan Individual Lashes Silk Natural Eyelashes by obeya (5D 0.07 Mix D)\nGreenLife\n{'Brand': 'GreenLife', 'Material': 'Silk', 'Item Form': 'Individual', 'Mounting Type': 'Eyelash Glue', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '4.49 x 2.36 x 0.55 inches; 0.71 Ounces', 'UPC': '718879611257'}\nThe eyelashes were easy to apply, soft, and provided a natural look. The length and curl were perfect for a casual weekend look. Blended well with my own lashes. I don't wear a lot of make-up: moisturizer, eyeliner, nude shadows, mascara, and a nude-ish lip stain. These individual lashes were just right.\ud83e\udd29\nEyelash with a Natural Look\nBEPHOLAN Natural Eyelash Growth Serum and Brow Enhancer to Grow Thicker, Longer Lashes for Long, Luscious Lashes and Eyebrows|15ML\nBEPHOLAN\n{'Package Dimensions': '5.43 x 1.34 x 0.94 inches; 0.63 Ounces'}\nI've used an eyelash serum before and had some success with it in the past.
