Not sure if people are drinking gels in the shower or just really self-conscious about cleanliness. Either way, I often find myself ordering products online. The selection at physical stores is iffy. Ran across this product and decided to give it a try. After all, the packaging is attractive. If anything it will look nice in a guest bathroom IF I ever have guests at my house again.<br /><br />First, the size is great. Almost 18 ounces! Popular brands offer a hand pump with 7.5 oz. Bouquet Garni is double the size. That's a good thing. Less I've gotta get out. I'm not crazy about the White Musk smell. It's a floral scent. I'm more of a woodsy, fruity scent. On the other hand, my mother loves this scent. So, while I planned to use this as a shower gel, I've decided to use it in the guest bath. Mom can enjoy the rich lather every time she washes her hands.<br /><br />Made in Korea. I'm not sure of the ingredients because the back label is foreign. I'm sure the website offers ingredients if one must know.\nReview Title: Bouquet Garni Body Shower Gel\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

While it supplies major moisture, my skin did not appreciate the thickness. When I woke up the first morning after using my face felt greasy. It didn't appear to have that sheer feeling of a clean moisturizer. Afterward, I applied the serum every other night. Four days later, I had breakouts on my nose. I have combination skin. This didn't work well for me, but I can see this working for those with severely dry skin.\nVitamin C Serum\nBouquet Garni Body Shower White Musk - Unique Fragrance Decanting Engineering Method gives Long Lasting Rich Fragrance - Gentle and Mild Cleansing Scented Body Wash with Natural Surfactant 17.85 Fl Oz\nBouquet Garni\n{'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Skin Type': 'All, Dry', 'Brand': 'Bouquet Garni', 'Scent': 'Garni', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '8.23 x 6.34 x 3.66 inches; 1.34 Pounds'}\nSince COVID, finding soap and shower gels isn't the easiest task.
