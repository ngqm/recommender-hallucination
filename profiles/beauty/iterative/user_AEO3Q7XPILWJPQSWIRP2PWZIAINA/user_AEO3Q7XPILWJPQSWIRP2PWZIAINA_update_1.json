For me, it was simply wash, dry, moisturize and occasionally use makeup.<br /><br />The roller and Gua Sha that I received is supposedly made of Jade. To me, it looked more like New Zealand Nephrite or even Aventurine. The packaging and product are nicely done, complete with a handwritten note from the proprietress of Jane & Co.<br /><br />There is a small pamphlet with a set of instructions that includes a contact number where you can send a text to receive a complete guide on how to use both the roller and the Gua Sha. Instantly, you are given a URl to download the free eBook to go with the product.<br /><br />To use either the roller or Gua Sha you simply chill the implements in the refrigerator or freezer.  This  extra coolness helps to shrink the pores and ease any puffiness that might be present.<br /><br />Wash your face as normal to avoid pushing any dirt or impurities in your skin with the roller. Dry your face and apply a moisturizing oil such as coconut oil, jojoba, or argan oil which are particularly nourishing to the skin.<br /><br />Take your now-cool roller and roll over your face, from the center outward. The included instructions suggest to pay particular attention to the area around the nose and under the eyes to aid in the draining and circulation of the lymph glands in those areas.<br /><br />To use the Gua Sha, again, cleanse the face, and moisturize with an oil that is beneficial for the skin. Never, Never NEVER use mineral oil on the face (or anywhere else on the body for that matter).<br /><br />Using moderate yet firm pressure in a gentle scraping motion to ease out tension from the face.  I confess I haven't quite gotten the hang of the Gua Sha yet, but I am still working on it. The coolness of these facial tools feels excellent on my skin and it definitely is a relaxing practice to get into regularly.\nReview Title: Give your face a beauty massage!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
