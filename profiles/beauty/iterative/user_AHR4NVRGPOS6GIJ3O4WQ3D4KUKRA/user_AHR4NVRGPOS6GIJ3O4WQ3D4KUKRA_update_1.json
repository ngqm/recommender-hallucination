It's life changing.  It felt like I just learned how to brush my teeth.<br /><br />I've never used a tongue scraper before but it was recommended by my Dentist maybe a year ago. I thought I was good by just brushing it with my Electric Toothbrush as I've always done it.  Using it this morning!!!  It was like an epiphany.  I can see how this helps exponentially with your oral hygiene.  I honestly felt like a fool after seeing the results and realize this was what I was missing out on for many years.<br /><br />The items come in a box, you take one out, sterilize it and all you do is place over your tongue, apply pressure and pull down.  You will be surprised at what you see removed from the back of your tongue to the front.  I was taken back.<br /><br />I honestly don't know how I could have lived this long without using one of these.  I think I will buy one for all of my family.\nReview Title: I feel like I done dental hygiene wrong all my life\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
