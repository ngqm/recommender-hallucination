It did not have all the things this kit had, but nevertheless I still have and treasure that kit as my Stepmom has since passed away. It's something I keep and remember her by.<br /><br />This kit is like the 3.0 version of what she gave me.  It even has some items I'm not sure of the use.<br /><br />As soon as I opened it, it became useful. Oftentimes I'm sitting at my desk for super long periods of the day and oftentimes I may start biting my nails or even cleaning my ears as I'm looking at my computer screens. This kit allows me to clip my nails without having to run to the bathroom and grab my mother's kit. The tools in this kit allows it to be a one stop shop so that means it has a permanent place near my office desk.  You can't go wrong getting this.<br /><br />Pros<br />Fairly Compact<br />Portable<br />Many tools<br />Stainless steel<br />It has the ear scraper / cleaner.. That makes it a winner right there.<br /><br />Cons<br />Not really any.. I just wish I knew what all the tools were used for. I guess I have to do some researching.\nReview Title: Good Portable ALL in ONE nail clipper / grooming kit\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Isshah Stainless Steel Metal Tongue Scraper Cleaner - Get Rid of Bad Breath and Bacteria - Pack of 4 - Eco Friendly Packaging\nIsshah\n{'Product Dimensions': '6.1 x 3.74 x 0.51 inches; 3.21 Ounces', 'UPC': '778299097277'}\nI used one of the tongue scrapers this morning and let me say.. It's life changing.  It felt like I just learned how to brush my teeth.<br /><br />I've never used a tongue scraper before but it was recommended by my Dentist maybe a year ago. I thought I was good by just brushing it with my Electric Toothbrush as I've always done it.  Using it this morning!!!  It was like an epiphany.  I can see how this helps exponentially with your oral hygiene.  I honestly felt like a fool after seeing the results and realize this was what I was missing out on for many years.<br /><br />The items come in a box, you take one out, sterilize it and all you do is place over your tongue, apply pressure and pull down.  You will be surprised at what you see removed from the back of your tongue to the front.  I was taken back.<br /><br />I honestly don't know how I could have lived this long without using one of these.  I think I will buy one for all of my family.\nI feel like I done dental hygiene wrong all my life\nBloomy Essentials Organic Lemon Essential Oil 10 mL (1/3 oz) - USDA Certified Organic - Great for Household Cleaner & Laundry - 100% Pure\nBloomy Essentials\n{'Brand': 'Bloomy Essentials', 'Scent': 'Lemon', 'Special Feature': 'Pure', 'Seasons': 'All Seasons', 'Item Volume': '10 Milliliters', 'Package Dimensions': '4.92 x 2.52 x 1.06 inches; 1.45 Ounces', 'UPC': '680912084635', 'Manufacturer': 'Bloomy Essentials'}\nI have a diffuser that I use every single day.  I m always looking for different oils and scents to use to liven up my place.  I saw this and figured why not, give it a try..<br /><br />I'm glad I did.  This is literally the MOST natural lemon smelling scent I have ever used.  When using in a diffuser you won't need much, just a few drops.  If you buy this you won't regret it.  I've had it for over a week and I'm pretty pleased with it.  A little does go a long way.<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />Smells very good<br />No weird after smell<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />Not really much of it..<br />Bottle is pretty small.\nI'm impressed by this Essential Lemon Oil\nManicure Set, 14pcs Pedicure Kit, Nail Clippers, Professional Grooming Kit with Black Luxurious Leather Travel Case for Men Women\nEASTBUDDY\n{'Package Dimensions': '5.1 x 3.4 x 1.2 inches; 6.38 Ounces'}\nMy stepmother gave me a personal grooming kit almost 20 years ago.
