It comes with everything you need. The instructions are way to follow and I did t have any trouble. Ive read a couple other reviews that say it doesn\u2019t dry and I did have that issue at first, but I figured out that you need to use really thin layers and to leave you hands under the light for about 15-20 longer than the instructions say. That\u2019s colors are really pretty and I can\u2019t wait to play around with the gems that come with it.<br /><br />My complaints are that the colors aren\u2019t labeled so you have to open them to see the colors. Also the colors smell horrible! They are very strong and sting my nose. The top and bottom coats are labeled and don\u2019t have a sting smell. The polish last a little over a week and that\u2019s only because I started picking at it. If I haven\u2019t done that it would have lasted longer.\nReview Title: Everything you need for a great price\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Huxley Secret of Sahara Clay Mask Balanced Blend 4.23 fl. oz. | Korean Clay Mask to Refine Pores and Absorb Excess Oil and Sebum | Made with Moroccan Rhassoul Clay\nHuxley\n{'Brand': 'Huxley', 'Item Form': 'Clay', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Special Feature': 'Hypoallergenic', 'Unit Count': '4.23 Fl Oz', 'Product Dimensions': '2.68 x 2.68 x 6.97 inches; 6.38 Ounces'}\nThis mask is one my favorite clay masks that I've tried. It so gentle on the skin and hardly any scent to it. It's not too thick and easily applied in a thin layer. It exfoliates well and leaves my face feeling clean and visibly brighter after the first use. I was also pleasantly surprised that my face didn't feel dry after and it actually felt moisturized. A little goes a long way and it's well worth the price. The packaging is beautiful and looks like a luxury item. This would make a great gift! Will absolutely be buying this again when this tube is finished.\nVisibly brightens my skin\nDEROL Eyeshadow Stick Sets 12 Colors\uff0cLong Lasting Glitter Eye Brightener Eyeliner Sticks,Cream to Powder Waterproof Eye Makeup,Eyeshadow Capsules Crayon,Shimmer Eye Shadow Pencils (12 Colors/Box)\nDEROL\n{'Brand': 'DEROL', 'Item Form': 'Crayon,Cream,Powder', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Special Feature': 'Waterproof, Long lasting', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Product Dimensions': '2.2 x 2 x 2 inches; 1.45 Ounces', 'UPC': '715962598334'}\nI was really excited to receive these little eyeshadows. They are small and compact, which makes them easy to pack and travel with. The colors are pretty and while not super pigmented at to begin with they are buildable and blend well. I tried them with eye primer and with out and they lasted the same for me. I will say I have oily eyelids and noticed that they don't last more than a couple hours.<br />I think these would make a great gift for adults, teens, or even younger kids who want play makeup. My daughters who are 6 and 7 found them one day and loved using them. They especially loved the blue and purple that they said made them look like a mermaid.  They are super fun and priced fairly so I would say give them a try!\nCompact and easy application\n2Pcs Mascara Black Volume and Length 4D Natural and Long Lasting Lash Blast Mascara, 0.27 Fl Oz\nMarine Forest\n{'Brand': 'Marine Forest', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Item Volume': '0.27 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Information': 'Tube', 'Water Resistance Level': 'Waterproof', 'Package Dimensions': '4.84 x 2.01 x 0.98 inches; 3.17 Ounces', 'UPC': '729843907382'}\nThis mascara did not work for me. I tried it with a primer and without to see how it performed and both times it flaked with in 4 hours giving me raccoon eyes. I wanted to love it though because it is very pigmented and applied smoothly without clumps. Didn't work for me, but that doesn't mean it wont for others.\nPigmented but flaked\nMovo Matte Liquid Foundation and Makeup Sponge Set \u2013 5 Shades Medium Coverage Lightweight Feel Liquid Foundation for Combination / Oily Skin, Flawless Natural Look with Matte Finish 1.0 oz (#3 Medium beige)\nMovo\n{'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Skin Type': 'Oily', 'Finish Type': 'Matte', 'Package Information': 'Bottle', 'Brand': 'Movo', 'Product Dimensions': '5.11 x 1.57 x 1 inches; 2.89 Ounces'}\nIt gives a good light to medium coverage, but I found that I could only use a little bit because it would make my skin look cakey and dry. It applies easily with the damp beauty blender and feels lightweight. I was able to apply blush and bronzer easily. It lasted all day and didn't settle in my fine lines and gives a smooth matte finish. One thing I really like is that it didn't irritate my skin  and cause a reaction like a lot of foundations do.\nA little goes a long way\nLUVCIRCUS 001 Professional Hair Brush-This luxury boar and nylon bristle hair brush is a meticulously crafted, premium, flat hair brush. An exceptional hairbrush for women who love gorgeous hair.\nLUVCIRCUS\n{'Brand': 'LUVCIRCUS', 'Shape': 'Oblong', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Hair Type': 'Curly,Straight,Thick', 'Material': 'Boar, Nylon', 'Product Dimensions': '9 x 4.75 x 1.5 inches; 7.55 Ounces'}\nThis is a pretty brush that feels good on the scalp and brushes and distributes my natural oils nicely , but it is way over priced. Almost $50 for a brush that is average is crazy. I don't feel that is there is anything special about this brush that you can't find for $15 at Walmart.\nToo expensive\nBQYPOWER Gel Nail Polish Kit with UV Light 84W LED Nail Lamp 8 Nude Colors Gel Nail Polish Starter Kit with No Wipe Base Top Coat, Manicure Kit, Nail Primer, Nail Art Decorations Home DIY Gift\nBQYPOWER\n{'Brand': 'BQYPOWER', 'Included Components': 'Top Coat, Gel Nail, Nail Lamp', 'Finish Type': 'Matte', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Package Dimensions': '10.51 x 9.84 x 5.08 inches; 3.33 Pounds'}\nThis is my first ever gel polish kit and I\u2019m really happy with it.
