It so gentle on the skin and hardly any scent to it. It's not too thick and easily applied in a thin layer. It exfoliates well and leaves my face feeling clean and visibly brighter after the first use. I was also pleasantly surprised that my face didn't feel dry after and it actually felt moisturized. A little goes a long way and it's well worth the price. The packaging is beautiful and looks like a luxury item. This would make a great gift! Will absolutely be buying this again when this tube is finished.\nReview Title: Visibly brightens my skin\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
