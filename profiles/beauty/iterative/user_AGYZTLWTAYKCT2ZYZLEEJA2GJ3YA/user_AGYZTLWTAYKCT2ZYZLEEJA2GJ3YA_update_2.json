They are small and compact, which makes them easy to pack and travel with. The colors are pretty and while not super pigmented at to begin with they are buildable and blend well. I tried them with eye primer and with out and they lasted the same for me. I will say I have oily eyelids and noticed that they don't last more than a couple hours.<br />I think these would make a great gift for adults, teens, or even younger kids who want play makeup. My daughters who are 6 and 7 found them one day and loved using them. They especially loved the blue and purple that they said made them look like a mermaid.  They are super fun and priced fairly so I would say give them a try!\nReview Title: Compact and easy application\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Huxley Secret of Sahara Clay Mask Balanced Blend 4.23 fl. oz. | Korean Clay Mask to Refine Pores and Absorb Excess Oil and Sebum | Made with Moroccan Rhassoul Clay\nHuxley\n{'Brand': 'Huxley', 'Item Form': 'Clay', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Special Feature': 'Hypoallergenic', 'Unit Count': '4.23 Fl Oz', 'Product Dimensions': '2.68 x 2.68 x 6.97 inches; 6.38 Ounces'}\nThis mask is one my favorite clay masks that I've tried. It so gentle on the skin and hardly any scent to it. It's not too thick and easily applied in a thin layer. It exfoliates well and leaves my face feeling clean and visibly brighter after the first use. I was also pleasantly surprised that my face didn't feel dry after and it actually felt moisturized. A little goes a long way and it's well worth the price. The packaging is beautiful and looks like a luxury item. This would make a great gift! Will absolutely be buying this again when this tube is finished.\nVisibly brightens my skin\nDEROL Eyeshadow Stick Sets 12 Colors\uff0cLong Lasting Glitter Eye Brightener Eyeliner Sticks,Cream to Powder Waterproof Eye Makeup,Eyeshadow Capsules Crayon,Shimmer Eye Shadow Pencils (12 Colors/Box)\nDEROL\n{'Brand': 'DEROL', 'Item Form': 'Crayon,Cream,Powder', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Special Feature': 'Waterproof, Long lasting', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Product Dimensions': '2.2 x 2 x 2 inches; 1.45 Ounces', 'UPC': '715962598334'}\nI was really excited to receive these little eyeshadows.
