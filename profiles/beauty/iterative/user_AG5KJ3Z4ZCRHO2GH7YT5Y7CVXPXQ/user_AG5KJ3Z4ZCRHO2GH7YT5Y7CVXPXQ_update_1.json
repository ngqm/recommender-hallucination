I love beauty products that are natural and non- irritating (a must for sensitive skin!). This mixes into the paste well and doesn't clump. Also, it rinses well and leaves no residue on the skin. However, my only wish is it came in other scents. While I like lavender, and lavender as an ingredient, its not one of my favorite scents. Overall though this works really well (especially on combination skin).\nReview Title: Very gentle, works good!\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
