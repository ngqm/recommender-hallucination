I have been using these (Day and Night Serum) for a short time now. While I haven\u2019t seen a difference in deep wrinkles I have seen a diminished fine lines, puffiness, and dull skin.

  "reference_summary": "HANA Organic Skincare - Organic/Vegan Lavender Grains Facial Cleanser + Exfoliator\nHANA Organic Skincare\n{'Brand': 'HANA Organic Skincare', 'Item Form': 'Grain', 'Skin Type': 'Acne Prone', 'Product Benefits': 'Cleansing', 'Material Feature': 'Certified Organic, Vegan', 'Package Dimensions': '5 x 3 x 3 inches; 9.6 Ounces', 'UPC': '632709431672'}\nVery gentle but effective! I love beauty products that are natural and non- irritating (a must for sensitive skin!). This mixes into the paste well and doesn't clump. Also, it rinses well and leaves no residue on the skin. However, my only wish is it came in other scents. While I like lavender, and lavender as an ingredient, its not one of my favorite scents. Overall though this works really well (especially on combination skin).\nVery gentle, works good!\nWorker B - Organic Dawn Facial Serum (Morning Serum)\nWorker B\n{'Package Dimensions': '5 x 1.5 x 1.4 inches; 4.64 Ounces'}\nI'm reviewing both the Night and Day Serums as they seem to work best in conjunction ( Obviously).
