I ordered it from Sephora.  The reviews here regarding whether this product was a fake or not made me a little leery.  So, I'm reviewing the real Josie Maran Vibrancy foundation and not the Amazon version, real or not.<br /><br />As usual, I ordered the lightest shade, RG5.  It's a nearly perfect match.  It's described as being for fair skin with neutral undertones.  I typically prefer foundations with pink undertones, but this actually worked really well for me.<br /><br />The consistency is on the thin, runny side, which isn't surprising since oil is an ingredient.  Having said that, this foundation sits on the skin so beautifully.  It looks like real skin.  It's definitely not a matte foundation, so if that's your preference, this is not the foundation for you.  This foundation gives you more luminous, dewy-looking skin.  I don't typically care for dewy foundations, but again, I was surprised to like this one.  It just made my skin look healthy and plump.  It didn't look at all heavy, which is great because it didn't settle into my fine lines.  I did notice it took a while to set.  Again, not surprising considering the oil content, but you'll want to make sure you set it with powder before trying to blend blush/contour/bronzer, etc.  Otherwise, you'll likely look pretty streaky.<br /><br />Many reviewers here have mentioned a smell.  I didn't notice that at all, which is another reason I think the product people are buying here might not be legit.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because my t-zone gets oily fairly quickly while wearing it.<br /><br />I'd recommend this for more mature skin and dry skin types.  If you're oily, you can definitely still wear it, you just might have to blot a bit more than usual.<br /><br />Overall, though, a great foundation.  Just make sure it's what you're looking for.  It's a very specific look.\nReview Title: A beautiful, natural, dewy finish..\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Tea Tree Lemon Sage Thickening Liter Duo Set\n{'Product Benefits': 'Thickening agents boost volume, while lightweight conditioners protect and add shine.', 'Item Form': 'Discrete Subunit', 'Brand': 'Tea Tree', 'Hair Type': 'Fine', 'Scent': 'Lemon,Peppermint', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '6.5 x 3 x 9 inches; 4.3 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'EW-4266', 'UPC': '605925831670 009531523736 881200200212 887105561007 884312437323 009531550169 885596163335', 'Manufacturer': 'John Paul Mitchell Systems'}\nI can't speak to whether or not the product sold from Amazon is fake or not, as I don't order it from here.  I usually buy it from the salons or from trusted sellers on Ebay for a much more reasonable price.  Having said that, I really like this shampoo.  It smells amazing, the lather is plentiful and silky, and I can genuinely say that my hair does feel a bit thicker.  While I don't think this shampoo has caused new hair growth, I do feel as if it's strengthened each individual strand to give my hair a slightly fuller look.  Don't get me wrong...it's not an Earth-shattering change, but it's a step in the right direction.<br /><br />The reason this didn't get 5 stars is because every single shampoo bottle I have ever purchased has been faulty.  They leak, the pump either breaks or doesn't work from the start, and the plastic is flimsy.  If it's been mailed to me, it inevitably leaks all over the package and I lose a substantial amount of product, which is pretty frustrating.<br /><br />Overall though, a great product!\nGreat shampoo, crappy bottles and pumps...\nJordana Cat Eye Liner 03 Orchid\nJordana\n{'Brand': 'Jordana', 'Finish Type': 'Matte', 'Special Feature': 'Travel size', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count'}\nThe color is beautiful and it provides the perfect pop of brightness with a more neutral, smokey eye...BUT!  (You knew there was a but coming, right?)  It's not super pigmented and you have to go over it several times to get a good pop.  Since it's lighter, it's not ideal for a winged eye either.  I usually just flick it out on the edge a little, but don't do a full-on wing.  I'd say the color trends more toward violet (with red undertones), than purple (with blue). It doesn't bleed or run, and for the price, I think it's a good choice, if you're looking for a little spark with your eye make-up routine.\nBeautiful, but lightly pigmented.\nNeutrogena Ultra Light Facial Cleansing Oil & Makeup Remover, Non-Comedogenic Face Oil Cleanser to Remove Dirt, Oil, Makeup & Waterproof Mascara, 4 fl. oz\nNeutrogena\n[\"Remove makeup- even waterproof mascara- as well as dirt and oil from your skin with Neutrogena Ultra Light Cleansing Oil.

It does a great job removing make-up gently...including eye make-up.  Since it's oil based, I was worried it would break me out.  I'm 41, but my skin is very sensitive and I'm still prone to break-outs, particularly in my t-zone area.  Thankfully, so far, my skin seems to be liking this product.  I do think it's a little pricey for the size of the bottle you receive, but overall, I'm pleased.\nMy skin seems to like this product...\nCool2day 32\" Flower Girl's Curly Heat Resistant Hair Cosplay Party Wig- Purple Mixed Sky Blue\n{'Package Dimensions': '9.3 x 7.5 x 1.8 inches; 9.6 Ounces'}\n3.5 stars<br /><br />I have many thoughts on this wig.  We ordered this to compliment my daughter's Mad Hatter Halloween costume and honestly, it looked like a hot mess when it arrived.  The bangs were going everywhere, the curls were tangled, there was no part...it was awful.<br /><br />My daughter, who is 12, has long, VERY thick blonde hair.  When the wig arrived, we tried it on with her hair down to make sure it fit.  It did.  Fast forward to Halloween...I braided her hair and pulled it into a knot at the back of her head.  Lo and behold, the wig wouldn't fit...it just kept sliding off her head.  That was my mistake...I should have tested it with a bun when it arrived.  Having said that, my daughter is incredibly petite...her doctor predicts she won't surpass 5' when she's full grown  Obviously, her head isn't that large.  My point?  If you're an adult or are purchasing this for a teen or big child, it likely won't fit.  I finally had to put her hair in a low bun at the nape of her neck to make it work.<br /><br />Unfortunately, because her natural hair was so low, we couldn't do the up-do we had planned because her bun showed if we did.  We ended up leaving it down, brushing it out, putting bobby pins in strategic places to help it frame her face and to contain it, and then I hair sprayed it in place.  Styling was especially difficult because the wig is sparse.  It's a lot of work to hide the netting underneath.  The netting is a yellow-beige color and stands out like bright white against the purple and teal.  We finally got it looking decent though, and she actually got many compliments on it throughout the evening, hence the higher star rating despite all the complaints.<br /><br />Once the wig was brushed and styled, the waves looked beautiful.  Just don't buy this expecting it to look great out of the box.  It won't.  It takes work.\nTakes a lot of work to look good...\nJosie Maran Vibrancy Argan Oil Foundation Fluid - Smooth, Supple, Baby-Skin Finish That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alive With Color (30ml/1.0oz, Mystical)\nJosie Maran\n{'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Package Information': 'Bottle', 'Brand': 'Josie Maran', 'Coverage': 'Medium, Full', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.5 x 0.9 x 0.9 inches; 4 Ounces', 'UPC': '755332585854'}\nLet me start by saying, I did NOT order this from Amazon.
