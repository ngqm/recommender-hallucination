  "reference_summary": "Beard Balm Leave In Conditioner - All Natural Beard Oil Wax for Beard Mustache & Hair Growth, Deep Beard Softener Cream Butter, Soothes Softens Tames & Styles Hair, Beard Care Kit Best Gift for Men\nPremium Nature\n{'Hair Type': 'All', 'Scent': 'Citrus', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Brand': 'Premium Nature', 'Number of Items': '6', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '2.9 x 2.8 x 1.1 inches; 2.89 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'Beard Balm', 'UPC': '857646006664'}\nWhen you start getting a decent beard you realize the value of beard balms and oils. After you shampoo your beard you basically strip it of oils and dirt. That is good but you have to replace the oils if you don't want the dreaded beard itch and dandruff. This stuff does a great job at replacing the striped oils. It keeps my beard happy and that helps keep me happy. I also enjoy the sent of this balm. It is a mild sent of citrus orange in my opinion. I have used others with less sent and some that are much stronger. This sent seems to leave about an hour after applying.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Natural ingredients<br />Good conditioning<br />Easy to use tin.<br />Easy to apply consistency<br /><br />Cons:<br />If I use it multiple times in day I started to get zits in certain areas.<br /><br />All in all. It is a good product and keeps my beard looking and feeling good.\nGreat conditioner.

But I only have a few complaints. One con for me is these smell good (kinda like a unisex smell) but it's so strong that I almost got annoyed by it. Although I was amazed at how long the smell lasted after the initial wash. Another con for me is the conditioner is very thin substance. I have long hair and because of the consistency it takes a lot more conditioner than I was hoping. It did not fade my color which is a plus!! And I have to brag about how much I love the heat spray. It doesn't leave my hair looking greasy or a weird sticky texture after straightening my hair. I will be buying the heat spray again!! Overall great product just be aware of the scent. It smells good just very strong and if you aren't into unisex scent it will almost smells like cologne.\nGreat product strong scent\nBeard Grooming Kit for Men - Beard Care Gift Sets Best Mustache and Beard Growth Natural Beard Oil Beard Softener Conditioner Balm Butter And Wooden Comb Best Gift Idea for Men Premium Nature\nPremium Nature\n{'Hair Type': 'Coarse', 'Liquid Volume': '1 Fluid Ounces', 'Item Form': 'Balm', 'Brand': 'Premium Nature', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.47 x 4.02 x 2.36 inches; 6.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '857646006961'}\nAlright, I have tried many different beard oils and typically I am unsatisfied with the smell in some sort of way. Most of them seem to have the smell of an old lady. Many are so strong they give me headaches as the sent rests under me nose all day.<br />None of this is the case with this beard oil. It has an amazing smell and the sent strength is just perfect. It has citrus woodsy type smell in my opinion. It gained the approval of my wife in the smells department and that is no easy feat. Plus it conditions and hydrates just as it should. It will keep your beardruff at bay.<br /><br />I would most definitely recommend to a friend!\nI finally found the one.\nBlackhead Remover Peel Off Mask - Black Charcoal Face Mask Deep Detox Cleanser for Blackheads Pore Minimizer Facial Black Head Masks, Reduce Pores Pimple & Acne Absorbs Dirt & Oil Brighten & Purify\nPremium Nature\n{'Brand': 'Premium Nature', 'Product Benefits': 'Cleansing', 'Scent': 'Fresh', 'Skin Type': 'Acne Prone', 'Unit Count': '1.7 Ounce', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.12 x 1.65 x 1.34 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'Blackehead Remover Mask', 'UPC': '857646006619'}\nI was quite amazed with this mask.
