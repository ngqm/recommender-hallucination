But I only have a few complaints. One con for me is these smell good (kinda like a unisex smell) but it's so strong that I almost got annoyed by it. Although I was amazed at how long the smell lasted after the initial wash. Another con for me is the conditioner is very thin substance. I have long hair and because of the consistency it takes a lot more conditioner than I was hoping. It did not fade my color which is a plus!! And I have to brag about how much I love the heat spray. It doesn't leave my hair looking greasy or a weird sticky texture after straightening my hair. I will be buying the heat spray again!! Overall great product just be aware of the scent. It smells good just very strong and if you aren't into unisex scent it will almost smells like cologne.\nReview Title: Great product strong scent\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

After you shampoo your beard you basically strip it of oils and dirt. That is good but you have to replace the oils if you don't want the dreaded beard itch and dandruff. This stuff does a great job at replacing the striped oils. It keeps my beard happy and that helps keep me happy. I also enjoy the sent of this balm. It is a mild sent of citrus orange in my opinion. I have used others with less sent and some that are much stronger. This sent seems to leave about an hour after applying.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Natural ingredients<br />Good conditioning<br />Easy to use tin.<br />Easy to apply consistency<br /><br />Cons:<br />If I use it multiple times in day I started to get zits in certain areas.<br /><br />All in all. It is a good product and keeps my beard looking and feeling good.\nGreat conditioner.
