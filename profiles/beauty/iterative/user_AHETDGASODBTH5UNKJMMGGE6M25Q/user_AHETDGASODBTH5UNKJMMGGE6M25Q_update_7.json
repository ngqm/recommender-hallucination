It is a great addition to my makeup vanity.  I love the way it looks just to sit out for decoration.<br />Mirror is light weight yet the base is heavy.  The mirror does turn over to have normal side then to flip it is magnified.  The best part of this mirror is it is LED illuminated.  It took 3 AA batteries which were supplied.  The toggle switch is on the base and when illuminated it gives that cool glow.  I love plucking my eyebrows with this mirror.  Easy to see and with the added light it works well.  The light is very vibrant and puts off a very nice glow.  Lights are on both sides.<br />I would consider all materials high quality by the apperance and by the weight.<br /><br />Overall I am extremely satisfied with this dual sided mirror.  It has been a great item added to my makeup collection.  Works well to sit on the vanity to give you an additional mirror for up close application and for the magnification.  I am not sure how I have lived my 32 years without a mirror like this to apply my makeup or pluck my eyebrows.<br /><br />I received this mirror for free for testing and reviewing purposes.  This is my honest unbiased opinion and have come to it by using this mirror myself.\nReview Title: It is a great addition to my makeup vanity\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I use it in several receipes as I am always making lotions, or salves.  This brick of shea butter does not disappoint.  It has the nutty earthy aroma which is normal for shea butter.

Well that just gave me the go ahead to make some whipped shea butter lotion.  I put the shea butter melted it down, with some coconut oil, and cocoa butter and then added about 30 drops of the lavender to make me some great lotion.

Usually when I clean my brushes I clean them all at one time creating a huge mess and taking up my whole counter area as they are laying out to dry.  This brush holder works like a charm and is very compact.  It is very easy to assemble just connect the legs and its good to go.  This hold 28 brushes so it works great for me.  As I can fill it in no time.  There are different slots for different brushes.  It holds the brushes well and in place and I think because of them being upside down makes them dry faster and help hold their shape.  Love this new tool and now I dont dread cleaning my brushes any longer.<br />I received this brush holder for free for testing and reviewing purposes.

These brushes come enclosed in a nice case that has an individual slot holder and a flap that protects the bristles.  The case can then be rolled over and tied for easy carrying and storage for your brushes.  I have used all of these brushes and found that each brush seems to be soft bristles, and designed to do different makeup applications.  Love each of these brushes.  Although the brushes werent super saturated with makeup, I went a head and washed them to test the durability of the bristles.  Once washed with a mild brush wash they dried nicely and the bristles remained soft and I had no fibers falling out of the brush.  Each brush handle is wood and painted pink.  Love the girly factor.  Handles fit in my hand well and I had no issues with makeup application..<br />I received a beauty sponge.  It worked well with liquid foundation application ( just remember to wet and squeeze the water out of it before using) the sponge is super absorbent so if not wet it will absorb the makeup just like any beauty sponge.<br />This sponge is nice and soft and washed up well also.<br />Overall I am very satisfied with this set of brushes.  Bristles are soft and provide great makeup application.  Great case for portability and for freeing up space on your makeup vanity.<br />I received this set of brushes for free for testing and reviewing purposes.

It has a huge range of colors needed for dark skin, to light skin, It even includes a white cream for highlighting along with some green and pinks to even out skin tone.  Basically this set is a great set to start with and to have on hand for when your skin goes thru some funky changes.  We all have that happen from time to time.  Anyways my contouring kit is a cream set of 15 colors.  Each color is very creamy and I had no issues with blending and rubbing in.  However I always use a high quality primer with all makeup so that may add to the easy technique of blending into the mixture.  Each color has its advantages along with its disadvantages.  Like I said not every color is going to suit your needs so If you are looking for specific colors this is not the set for you, this is a range of colors for different shades of skin.<br />The makeup seemed to be long wearing but please dont forget that I used primer and that could have something to do with makeup wear length.  I also did not break out with this cream as I have done with so many other colors.  Of course I made sure to clean my face off each evening and I never slept in it at all.  The plastic holding the makeup tins is a hard black plastic,  I wouldnt call it super high quality but its not the cheapest I have come across.  The reason for 4 stars is because I prefer mirrors in the compact as sometimes I like to have my makeup in hand while applying and it would be nice if a mirror was included.  However it takes no value away from the makeup its just my personal preference.  I also need to research some of these ingredients,  (which I havent done as of yet while writing the review)  I have not recongized a couple and usually most ingredients I am somewhat familiar with as I am a makeup fanatic.  Nothing jumps out and screams do not put on your face though.  I also wish the ingredients was listed on the hard plastic case so once you dispose of the box which everyone does you still have a list of ingredients in case you have some delayed reaction after long term use.  Another reason for 4 stars.  However overall I am pleased with this makeup palette.  It seems to be well suited for a starter pack for those learning to contour, and those whose skin goes thru some weird skin tones from time to time.  My only complaints were the ones listed above and no others.  Makeup seems to spread smoothly and blends well.  Which is what most women prefer when it comes to contouring.  I did notice it did take several coats and more during application than what I am used to however compared to regular drug store kits its pretty comparable to it, may be a tad better in quality as it blends easily.<br />I received this makeup palette for free for testing and reviewing purposes,  I have come to this conclusion by using and wearing this makeup for a few days myself.\nThis is a good set of contouring colors\nModern Mirror 92231 Dual-Sided Led illuminated tabletop makeup mirror Black\nModern Mirror\n{'Brand': 'Modern Mirror', 'Room Type': 'Bathroom', 'Shape': 'Round', 'Product Dimensions': '5\"L x 5\"W', 'Mounting Type': 'Tabletop Mount', 'Package Dimensions': '11.8 x 7.4 x 4.6 inches; 8 Ounces', 'UPC': '692014012003'}\nThis mirror is a blessing to have.
