These brushes come enclosed in a nice case that has an individual slot holder and a flap that protects the bristles.  The case can then be rolled over and tied for easy carrying and storage for your brushes.  I have used all of these brushes and found that each brush seems to be soft bristles, and designed to do different makeup applications.  Love each of these brushes.  Although the brushes werent super saturated with makeup, I went a head and washed them to test the durability of the bristles.  Once washed with a mild brush wash they dried nicely and the bristles remained soft and I had no fibers falling out of the brush.  Each brush handle is wood and painted pink.  Love the girly factor.  Handles fit in my hand well and I had no issues with makeup application..<br />I received a beauty sponge.  It worked well with liquid foundation application ( just remember to wet and squeeze the water out of it before using) the sponge is super absorbent so if not wet it will absorb the makeup just like any beauty sponge.<br />This sponge is nice and soft and washed up well also.<br />Overall I am very satisfied with this set of brushes.  Bristles are soft and provide great makeup application.  Great case for portability and for freeing up space on your makeup vanity.<br />I received this set of brushes for free for testing and reviewing purposes.  This is my honest unbiased opinion and have come to it by using the brushes myself.\nReview Title: This is such an amazing set of brushes\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Usually when I clean my brushes I clean them all at one time creating a huge mess and taking up my whole counter area as they are laying out to dry.  This brush holder works like a charm and is very compact.  It is very easy to assemble just connect the legs and its good to go.  This hold 28 brushes so it works great for me.  As I can fill it in no time.  There are different slots for different brushes.  It holds the brushes well and in place and I think because of them being upside down makes them dry faster and help hold their shape.
