Usually when I clean my brushes I clean them all at one time creating a huge mess and taking up my whole counter area as they are laying out to dry.  This brush holder works like a charm and is very compact.  It is very easy to assemble just connect the legs and its good to go.  This hold 28 brushes so it works great for me.  As I can fill it in no time.  There are different slots for different brushes.  It holds the brushes well and in place and I think because of them being upside down makes them dry faster and help hold their shape.  Love this new tool and now I dont dread cleaning my brushes any longer.<br />I received this brush holder for free for testing and reviewing purposes.  This is my honest unbiased opinion and have come to it by using the holder myself.\nReview Title: ... a makeup junkie and I can tell you the worst thing about wearing makeup is cleaning the brushes\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
