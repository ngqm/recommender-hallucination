  "reference_summary": "MOSTORY 3 in 1 Eyebrow Pencil - Super Model Perfect Brow Stylist Waterproof Brown Eye Brow Makeup Long Lasting Professional Soft Powder Pen Brush (MEDIUM BROWN)\nMOSTORY\n{'Brand': 'MOSTORY', 'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Finish Type': 'Natural', 'Special Feature': 'Waterproof, Long Lasting', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '7 x 1 x 0.5 inches; 1.59 Ounces'}\nOkay, I am a fan but with caveats. I love the long chiseled pencil shape because it makes it easier to apply straight stokes of color to my very thin brows without looking drawn on or penciled in. However, it does skip a bit compared to my gel brow color that is applied with a brush. The sponge tip is great for softening the sharp line on the thicker area of my brow and i dab it with a bit of eye shadow to set it.  The color stays put and looks natural without leaning towards red. What more can you ask of a good brow pencil for brunettes? I overplucked my brows in my youth when pencil-thin brows were was the style (okay, I'm dating myself here) but this seems to apply quickly and easily and works well with super-thin brows without making me look like Groucho Marx. It works, it stays and looks great. Gals with thicker brows will reap the most benefit b using the mascara type brush for the most natural look and pigment distribution.\nFantastic natural-looking STAY PUT color with excellent pencil shape for easy application\n[Weekly Point Cosmetic Rose edition mask sheet] - Facial skin care mask sheet 3solutions(Wriklecare, Brighten up, Moisture) in one (1Pack of 10pcs)\nWeekly Point Cosmetic\n{'Brand': 'Weekly Point Cosmetic', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Product Benefits': 'Moisture,Skin', 'Scent': 'Rose', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.38 x 4.84 x 7.01 inches; 12.63 Ounces'}\nEven though I am not fond of the paper masks (prefer collagen), there is no denying they work well and my aging skin feels replenished, hydrated and rejuvenated. I have very sensitive skin due to seborrheic dermatitis, so I have to be very careful with skincare products. Why do I always feel the need to test them on Sunday when I have work the next day? No worries, my skin will look great and If I can find the time I may do another treatment in the morning to give my skin a little more radiance. There is no denying the results.<br /><br />Pro Tip: They work even better when you put them in the freezer for about 15 minutes before use. It will help tighten the pores up and feels extra refreshing!<br /><br />** If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know.
