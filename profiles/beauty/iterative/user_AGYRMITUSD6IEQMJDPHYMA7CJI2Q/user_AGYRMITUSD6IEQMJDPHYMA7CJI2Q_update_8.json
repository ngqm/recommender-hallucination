Even the smallest ones are too large and applying several coats just results in a thick, messy tacky line. I have hooded lids and it transferred the upper lid in the blink of an eye.  The eyeliner itself is nearly impossible to remove. I applied it on my hand and had to use a stiff scrub brush in order to remove it.<br />I tried a few sets of magnetic lashes and only one performed fairly well, but this wasn't one of them.\nReview Title: Seemed like a good idea at the time.\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "MOSTORY 3 in 1 Eyebrow Pencil - Super Model Perfect Brow Stylist Waterproof Brown Eye Brow Makeup Long Lasting Professional Soft Powder Pen Brush (MEDIUM BROWN)\nMOSTORY\n{'Brand': 'MOSTORY', 'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Finish Type': 'Natural', 'Special Feature': 'Waterproof, Long Lasting', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '7 x 1 x 0.5 inches; 1.59 Ounces'}\nOkay, I am a fan but with caveats. I love the long chiseled pencil shape because it makes it easier to apply straight stokes of color to my very thin brows without looking drawn on or penciled in. However, it does skip a bit compared to my gel brow color that is applied with a brush. The sponge tip is great for softening the sharp line on the thicker area of my brow and i dab it with a bit of eye shadow to set it.  The color stays put and looks natural without leaning towards red. What more can you ask of a good brow pencil for brunettes? I overplucked my brows in my youth when pencil-thin brows were was the style (okay, I'm dating myself here) but this seems to apply quickly and easily and works well with super-thin brows without making me look like Groucho Marx. It works, it stays and looks great. Gals with thicker brows will reap the most benefit b using the mascara type brush for the most natural look and pigment distribution.\nFantastic natural-looking STAY PUT color with excellent pencil shape for easy application\n[Weekly Point Cosmetic Rose edition mask sheet] - Facial skin care mask sheet 3solutions(Wriklecare, Brighten up, Moisture) in one (1Pack of 10pcs)\nWeekly Point Cosmetic\n{'Brand': 'Weekly Point Cosmetic', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Product Benefits': 'Moisture,Skin', 'Scent': 'Rose', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.38 x 4.84 x 7.01 inches; 12.63 Ounces'}\nEven though I am not fond of the paper masks (prefer collagen), there is no denying they work well and my aging skin feels replenished, hydrated and rejuvenated. I have very sensitive skin due to seborrheic dermatitis, so I have to be very careful with skincare products. Why do I always feel the need to test them on Sunday when I have work the next day? No worries, my skin will look great and If I can find the time I may do another treatment in the morning to give my skin a little more radiance. There is no denying the results.<br /><br />Pro Tip: They work even better when you put them in the freezer for about 15 minutes before use. It will help tighten the pores up and feels extra refreshing!<br /><br />** If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know.

The Milantia Mini Hair Straightener 3/4\" Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron heats up fast to take care of my half curly bangs that have a mind of their own.<br /><br /> I have coarse thick hair, but my bangs have thinned with age and have started developing weird curls and cowlicks. It's the only part of my hair that needs the nuclear option because I keep the rest of it braised most of the time.<br /><br />I don't have time for a lot of hair care, and this little flat iron heats up fast and does exactly what I need it to do. It's small, lightweight,  nimble, and exactly what I have been looking for!<br /><br />** If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know.

The results have been amazing, and many of the products I have used contain Keratin or Gossypium as the primary ingredient. The Toppik Hair Building Fibers contains 99% Keratin, but the fibers were larger and coarser than others and did not blend or adhere as well. It wasn't the natural-looking coverage I had come to expect. Just goes to show they're not all the same.<br /><br />** If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know.

The packaging is gorgeous and the brush is a thicker comb-like bristle, which is great for volume and definition. My lashes looked dramatically darker and fuller and I really noticed the difference when I went outside and checked it out in my rearview mirror. I had tested two mascaras on each eye and this one really stood out. I have been wearing it for almost 36 hours and even slept in it.  After rubbing my eyes since the last night, the top lashes held and I didn't wake up with raccoon eyes. however, it does flake a bit. It applied smoothly and since It's not a quick drying mascara so you have a bit of time to tease out the lashes to avoid  any clumping..\nMade my lashes dramatically darker and fuller\nNatural Waterproof Lash Mascara Black, 4D Silk Fiber Eyelash Mascara Makeup, Lengthening and Thick, No Clumping, Smudge-proof, Long-Lasting Voluminous Eyelashes Dramatic Extension Makeup Kit Eye Lash\nSIKEMAY\n{'Color': 'black', 'Brand': 'SIKEMAY', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '7.2 x 4 x 1.2 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '764690676845', 'Manufacturer': 'SIKEMAY'}\nI tried two 4D Silk mascaras by this brand on each eye for comparison and the CPCP Real Eyes Long Fiber Eyelash Mascara offers excellent lash separation. The thin comb bristle brush is great for separation, especially on the lower lashes.  I've worn both for 36 hours and after massive eye rubbing, I am surprised at how fresh it looks. I awoke with no raccoon eyes and no need to reapply it today. it didn't flake off! This is truly a long-lasting mascara.<br /><br />**  If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know.
