I\u2019m sick of pills,so when I came upon this lotion, it was really amazing. I didn\u2019t realize what it was advertised for, so I just thought it\u2019s for relieving pain. My \u201cmistake\u201d ended up freeing me of muscle pain and back cramps. It smells great too (like lavender, even though there\u2019s none in it).<br />It\u2019s like a masseus in a bottle.\nReview Title: Great for Muscle Aches\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
