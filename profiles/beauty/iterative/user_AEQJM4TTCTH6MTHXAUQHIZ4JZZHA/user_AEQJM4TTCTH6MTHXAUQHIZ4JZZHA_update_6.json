So you buy products to help with that, serums and shampoos, but they need to be penetrate at the scalp level to really be effective.  I also have gel nails and there's a problem with hair getting caught on them, especially when they're getting close to needing a fill.  So I was looking for something that would help with both of those things, but could do it gently so I wouldn't end up causing more problems than I was solving.  It works great with the shampoo and the serum to really work those products into the scalp and to hopefully stimulate blood flow at the same time.  After using it for that and seeing how well it worked, I started using it for pretty much everything hair related in the shower because it completely solved the problem with the snagging and pulling due to my nails.  Anyone who has any type of fake nails understands the issue.  This just WORKS.  Problem SOLVED.\nReview Title: Fixes the problem of hair snagging and catching on your nails.\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Catrice | SUNGASM Luminizing Bronzer 02 | For A Sun-Kissed Shimmery Finish | Highly Pigmented & Blendable | Vegan, Paraben Free, Oil Free | Cruelty Free\nCatrice\n{'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Coverage': 'Full', 'Brand': 'Catrice', 'Color': 'C02 Bronzed Euphoria', 'Product Dimensions': '2.72 x 2.72 x 0.51 inches; 1.52 Ounces'}\nYa know how product descriptions are usually a bunch of marketing hype that you just kind of blow by....like blah, blah, blah natural, blah blah blah 10 years younger.  Or whatever.  So the point is that I was writing this review and I had used the words \"sun-kissed\" twice (I took one out).  Then I looked at the product description and I was like....well, crap.  That's what they literally said it would look like.  So here's the details:<br /><br />It is a highly pigmented powder that blends out beautifully and is easily buildable.  Not an in-your-face blinding shimmer, more of a sun-kissed shimmer that looks natural on the skin.  The color 02 bronzed euphoria looks like you\u2019ve gotten a light tan with a little bit of pink undertone.  (I\u2019m fair skin, strawberry blonde, blue eyes for reference.)  Kind of like what would happen if you actually WENT into the sun.  Without SPF.  Which, of course, you shouldn\u2019t do.  Like, ever.  I also handed it off to my 18 year old daughter and her opinion was the same as mine.....right down to the slightly pinkish undertone.  We would both put this on \"summer makeup must-have\" list.\nThis is LITERALLY a sun-kissed look in a bronzer.  So freakin' pretty on the skin....\nSilicone Back Scrubber For Shower,Strong Rub Back Mud Silica Gel Bath Towel, Easy to Clean, All Parts Of The Body To Remove Ash And Mud\nLHIUEM\n{'Material': 'Silicone', 'Brand': 'LHIUEM', 'Operation Mode': 'Manual', 'Package Dimensions': '11.02 x 7.87 x 2.48 inches; 1.21 Pounds', 'UPC': '791523116391'}\nThis thing is REALLY long.  One side is rounded dimples, the other side is raised brush-type projections.  Bought it for my husband\u2019s shower because it looked fairly indestructible and he seems to be able to destroy pretty much any type of back scrubber.  This thing is thick, has some heft to it, and has sturdy grips at either end.  My husband was definitely more impressed with this one than some of the others I\u2019ve handed to him for use in the shower.<br /><br />So, after his first shower with it I asked him how it went.  He looks at me and says \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m using it the right way, but it works pretty good.\u201d  And that was his idea of providing feedback on how it worked.  Of course, that\u2019s not enough\u2026.especially when it starts with I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m using it right.  Turns out (after tons of questioning, Good Lord it\u2019s like bath scrubbers had suddenly become highly confidential state secrets) that it didn\u2019t work all that well as a back scrubber for him.  He didn\u2019t like that you have to lather up your back with a loofah or washcloth first and then use the back scrubber.  He tried to put soap on the scrubber and use it to wash his back but the soap just ran down between the scrubbers and he couldn\u2019t build a lather up.  So he tossed it on the shower floor and was going to tell me that it didn\u2019t work.  But then he decided to see if it would work to remove the callused skin on his feet.  Apparently it did.  He started by just leaving it on the floor of the shower and rubbing his feet back and forth on it, and that worked well.  But then he grabbed the handles and put some tension on it with his foot and moved it by using the handles.  Apparently this worked VERY well.  So well that he had brought up the brush he usually uses in the shower for his feet and threw it in the garbage.  (He said it needed replacing anyway.)  He wants to keep this one in the shower to keep using it on his feet & is completely excited that he doesn\u2019t have to bend over and contort himself while scrubbing his feet anymore.  He still needs me to find a back scrubber though\u2026\u2026.\nIt works really well, just not for what I had bought it for\u2026.\n2oz / 60ml Glass Spray Bottles for DIY Refill, Essential Oils, Pillow Mists,Fine Mist Spray -3Packs Amber Color\nEagleKing\n{'Brand': 'EagleKing', 'Material': 'Glass', 'Capacity': '2 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '3', 'Special Feature': 'Mist Spray', 'Package Dimensions': '6.3 x 6.1 x 1.7 inches; 8.78 Ounces'}\nI ordered these to hold the essential oils mix I use for sachets.  The mist from the sprayer is perfect to refresh the bags and to evenly distribute the scented oils over materials used in the mix.<br /><br />Since the COVID thing hit, and everyone in our house is dealing with prolonged mask use irritation and \u201cmaskne\u201d, I\u2019ve filled up a few more with a 100% green tea toner that can be sprayed on the face during the day.  It helps cut down on the inflammation from irritation and since it\u2019s also an anti-bacterial it has helped control the acne, as well.  These are great to throw in your purse or keep in the car.  The glass is heavy & durable and the spray attachment screws down tight so they DON\u2019T LEAK and the mist created is a nice, fine mist with zero \u201cspitting\u201d or errant streams.\nSolid, heavy glass with an excellent mist & great for mask relief!!\nEasydew Daily Double Hydra Cream 2.02 fl oz - Moisturizing Cream with EGF & Serine of NMFHydrating, Soothing, Anti-Aging EGF, Serine - N.M.F(Natural Moisturizing Factors) for Oily, Sensitive, Acne-Prone, Dry Skin Types\nEASYDEW\n{'Brand': 'EASYDEW', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '5.2911 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Type': 'Acne Prone,Oily,Sensitive,All Skin Types', 'Package Dimensions': '5.98 x 1.69 x 1.46 inches; 3 Ounces'}\nEasydew has a winner in this one.  To start, it has a creamy texture and a light, fresh scent.  It\u2019s super hydrating and has a great slip to it so it just glides over the skin.  It sinks into the skin beautifully, and fairly quickly, and leaves a dewy finish to your skin.  No weird residue or film left on the skin, and it works well with all of my sunscreens and foundations.  It provides you a nice, plump hydrated base to work with and that dewy finish holds up really well.  It works really well as a daily moisturizer for me during the colder/dryer months of fall and winter.  It will probably be a little too heavy to work during the day in the warmer months, but I can see myself using it as a nighttime moisturizer then with no problem.  Super versatile and definitely one I would recommend for daily use.\nExcellent daily moisturizer, plays well with ALL my other products!!\nMagnetic Eyeliner and Eyelashes Kit Self Adhesive Eyeliner Pen - 3D Natural Look Eyelash Without Magnet - Reusable Eye Lash with Waterproof Liner, Black, Applicator(5 Sets Lashes + 1 Pen Liners)\nLampelc\n{'Brand': 'Lampelc', 'Material': 'Mink Fur', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Item Form': 'Individual', 'Mounting Type': 'Eyelash Glue', 'Package Dimensions': '6.14 x 5.59 x 0.59 inches; 11.29 Ounces'}\nWe've got a bit of experience in this house with magnetic eyeliner and lashes.  We've tried super expensive ($75/pair), super cheap (Wish is NOT the place to go for lashes) and everything in between.  My daughter has TTM and has no natural eyelashes, so magnetics are the ONLY type of lashes that work for here.<br /><br />She liked the look of the lashes in this set.  They weren't all over-the-top, super glam.  There were quite a few pairs that she thought she could use for daily wear and even liked the look of \"glam\" pairs that were included for when she really wants to go all out.  So it was HUGELY disappointing that there were NO MAGNETS on ANY of the pairs of lashes.  She did try the eyeliner with lashes she already had, but wasn't very impressed with it either.  It didn't seem to completely dry down and had a slightly tacky feel even after waiting about 10 minutes.  I thought maybe they had mixed up the order and sent her regular lashes & lash glue, but it wasn't tacky ENOUGH to hold a lash in place.  Overall, it was a fail for her.  Which is disappointing because she quite liked the style of the lashes offered in this set.\nThere were no magnets on the lashes!!\nAledy Hair Scalp Massager, Shampoo Brush with Soft Silicone Head Massager (Blue)\nAledy\n{'Package Dimensions': '4.8 x 3.6 x 2.4 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Aledy'}\nI'm 49 (at least for a few more weeks), and along with the many joys of aging comes thinning hair.
