You don't have to constantly change the heads on this.<br /><br />However, when you rotate the heads you have to hold down a button on one side and then use the very small rotater to change heads. It makes it a bit difficult to change the heads.<br /><br />Also, I had problems with it constantly stopping while I was using it. And my calluses aren't even that bad. If you just have a bit of dry skin this will probably work for you, otherwise you're going to want to skip it.\nReview Title: Not very powerful\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
