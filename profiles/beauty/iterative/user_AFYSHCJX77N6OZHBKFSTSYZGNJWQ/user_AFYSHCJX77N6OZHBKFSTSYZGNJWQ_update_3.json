It's GORGEOUS!!!  The color is perfect.  I love that these look neat and uniform.  The ends are curled to perfection.  There is definitely enough hair included to complete your full head without too many gaps.  The orange thing included looks more like a wrist band than a hair tie, but use it as you see fit.  This hair is phenomenal.  I highly recommend.\nReview Title: LOVE!!!!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Mtmei hair 5Packs 10\" Pre-twisted Spring Twist Hair Crochet Braids 15 Strands/Pack Nubian Bomb Twist Crochet Hair Messy Fluffy Spring Twist Crochet Hair Extensions(T27)\nMtmei hair\n{'Brand': 'Mtmei hair', 'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Extension Length': '10 Inches', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '9.02 x 7.52 x 2.76 inches; 11.99 Ounces', 'UPC': '765470972508'}\nThere are pros and cons to this hair.  This hair is very soft and very stretchy, so it can be pulled back out of your face. I love that this came with a crochet hook.  The T27 color is pretty BUT it is very frizzy, especially on the blonde ends.  It came straight out of the package frizzy, so I was very disappointed.  It looks like hair that has been in someone's hair for 2-3 weeks before I received it.  it's possible to make the 5 packs work, but I would've preferred to have 6 packs of hair included to make sure there weren't too many gaps without any colored hair, especially since my natural hair color is dark brown.  Overall the hair is just OK.  Next time I'll go for hair that is a better quality.\nIt's OK\nzelaxy Mask Strap Extenders, Soft Silicone Mask Holders for Relieve Ear Pain Caused by Mask (Dot)\nzelaxy\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.5 x 4.7 x 0.2 inches; 3.99 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'zelaxy'}\nThese Mask Strap Extenders are so comfortable! They're soft and it's easy to forget you have them on.  I love how they help keep my masks that are too large in place and snug where they need to be.  I love that there's no pressure on my ears whatsoever! These are phenomenal.  I highly recommend!\nComfortable and Necessary\nOmbre Burgundy Prelooped Bomb Twist Crochet Hair Prelooped Crochet Braids 18 Inch\nUHair\n{'Brand': 'UHair', 'Extension Length': '18 Inches', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Installation Type': 'Sew-In', 'Package Dimensions': '12.95 x 9.41 x 3.19 inches; 2.09 Pounds'}\nI love this hair!
