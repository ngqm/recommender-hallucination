BUT can cause flue like systems and lung problems.<br /><br />SDARA SKIN CARE could just as easily made a healthy product<br />BUT - with 3 of 5 points being negative<br />I feel this a 2 star product.\nSome Issues\nBarber Hair Cutting Cape for Men Women, Made with Ultra Soft Silk Fiber, 63\" x 57\"\nSmoTecQ\n{'Package Dimensions': '11.8 x 9.2 x 0.7 inches; 4.8 Ounces'}\nIt's nice size and good for our purpose, cutting hair.<br />And since it called a 'Barber's Cape' and thusly one would expect dry cutting<br />I'm not sure how relevant this is.<br /><br />HOWEVER - it's also stated it's resistant to chemicals.<br />But I don't see how it could be protective to ones clothing when it's not water proof,<br />liquid pours right through, so it's not good for various processes using chemicals etc.<br />And the reason for 3 stars<br /><br />The material around the neck is pleated / drawn together with elastic.<br />It's adjustable with metal hooks, but feels poky and uncomfortable.\nSafe For Dry Cutting\nzelaxy Mask Strap Extenders, Soft Silicone Mask Holders for Relieve Ear Pain Caused by Mask (Eagle)\nzelaxy\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.3 x 2.5 x 0.4 inches; 1.59 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'zelaxy'}\nThese hold well during use and don't pull too tight on the nose.<br />However, they are maxed out for me (last hook on each side) for comfort<br />and wouldn't want them any tighter. (my head - thick hair - 22\" around)<br /><br />Even when pulling mask down around the neck, IF careful, stays connected.<br />But if pulling down without care, of course the strap is disconnected.<br />The silicone seems durable enough and doesn't pull my hair.<br /><br />This isn't a perfect situation, but I've not come across one that is.<br />SOo = 4 stars\nAre Reasonably Comfortable\nlorelo 4 Pieces Nail Dotting Pen, Dual-ended Nail Dotting Pen Liner Brush Nail Art Point Drill Drawing Tools Set Nail Art DIY Decoration Tool\nlorelo\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.3 x 4.2 x 0.6 inches; 1.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '619156572950'}\nThese are good tools for nails, and any number of hobby's.<br />Excellent also for costume jewelry repair.<br /><br />The wax end nicely picks up rhinestones to lay in place.<br />It's fairly soft so you don't need to press.<br />In-fact will press them out of shape if you do.<br /><br />The stainless steel tip is the size of the head of a straight pin.<br />and hollow in the middle for better centering / pressing down.<br /><br />5 stars\nGood quality / value\n5pcs Nail Art Liner Brushes, Lystaii Dual-ended Painting Nail Design Brush Pen Include Liner Brushes and Dotting Pen Nail Art Point Drill Drawing Brush Double Ended Dotting Tools Set 5,7,9,11,14mm\nLystaii\n{'Package Dimensions': '9.41 x 3.86 x 0.75 inches; 1.41 Ounces'}\nThe brushes are 5 1/2\" long 1/4\" wide and easy hold for articulating designs.<br />The 5 different brushes allow for various strokes of width / depth.<br /><br />The metal ends each have a different ball size tip<br />Perfect selection for large variety of designs.<br /><br />Very attractive rhinestones centers of pens.<br />5 stars\nGood quality set.",
