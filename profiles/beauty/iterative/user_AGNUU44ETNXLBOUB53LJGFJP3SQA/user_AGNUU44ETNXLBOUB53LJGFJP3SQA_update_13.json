BUT can cause flue like systems and lung problems.<br /><br />SDARA SKIN CARE could just as easily made a healthy product<br />BUT - with 3 of 5 points being negative<br />I feel this a 2 star product.\nSome Issues\nBarber Hair Cutting Cape for Men Women, Made with Ultra Soft Silk Fiber, 63\" x 57\"\nSmoTecQ\n{'Package Dimensions': '11.8 x 9.2 x 0.7 inches; 4.8 Ounces'}\nIt's nice size and good for our purpose, cutting hair.<br />And since it called a 'Barber's Cape' and thusly one would expect dry cutting<br />I'm not sure how relevant this is.<br /><br />HOWEVER - it's also stated it's resistant to chemicals.<br />But I don't see how it could be protective to ones clothing when it's not water proof,<br />liquid pours right through, so it's not good for various processes using chemicals etc.<br />And the reason for 3 stars<br /><br />The material around the neck is pleated / drawn together with elastic.<br />It's adjustable with metal hooks, but feels poky and uncomfortable.\nSafe For Dry Cutting\nzelaxy Mask Strap Extenders, Soft Silicone Mask Holders for Relieve Ear Pain Caused by Mask (Eagle)\nzelaxy\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.3 x 2.5 x 0.4 inches; 1.59 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'zelaxy'}\nThese hold well during use and don't pull too tight on the nose.<br />However, they are maxed out for me (last hook on each side) for comfort<br />and wouldn't want them any tighter. (my head - thick hair - 22\" around)<br /><br />Even when pulling mask down around the neck, IF careful, stays connected.<br />But if pulling down without care, of course the strap is disconnected.<br />The silicone seems durable enough and doesn't pull my hair.<br /><br />This isn't a perfect situation, but I've not come across one that is.<br />SOo = 4 stars\nAre Reasonably Comfortable\nlorelo 4 Pieces Nail Dotting Pen, Dual-ended Nail Dotting Pen Liner Brush Nail Art Point Drill Drawing Tools Set Nail Art DIY Decoration Tool\nlorelo\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.3 x 4.2 x 0.6 inches; 1.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '619156572950'}\nThese are good tools for nails, and any number of hobby's.<br />Excellent also for costume jewelry repair.<br /><br />The wax end nicely picks up rhinestones to lay in place.<br />It's fairly soft so you don't need to press.<br />In-fact will press them out of shape if you do.<br /><br />The stainless steel tip is the size of the head of a straight pin.<br />and hollow in the middle for better centering / pressing down.<br /><br />5 stars\nGood quality / value\n5pcs Nail Art Liner Brushes, Lystaii Dual-ended Painting Nail Design Brush Pen Include Liner Brushes and Dotting Pen Nail Art Point Drill Drawing Brush Double Ended Dotting Tools Set 5,7,9,11,14mm\nLystaii\n{'Package Dimensions': '9.41 x 3.86 x 0.75 inches; 1.41 Ounces'}\nThe brushes are 5 1/2\" long 1/4\" wide and easy hold for articulating designs.<br />The 5 different brushes allow for various strokes of width / depth.<br /><br />The metal ends each have a different ball size tip<br />Perfect selection for large variety of designs.<br /><br />Very attractive rhinestones centers of pens.<br />5 stars\nGood quality set.\nFacial Cleansing Brush, Sonic Ultrasonic Vibration Facial Brush, Red-light for Deep Cleaning, Discharge Makeup, Gentle Exfoliating, Blackhead Removing, Massaging with 3 Adjustable Modes and Speeds\nLKV\n{'Material': 'Silicone', 'Brand': 'LKV', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Product Care Instructions': 'Wash with Warm Water', 'Number of Speeds': '3', 'Package Dimensions': '4.7 x 3.1 x 1.7 inches; 3.99 Ounces', 'UPC': '193499829655', 'Manufacturer': 'LKV'}\nAlthough this isn't the most productive cleaning tool, I can see it of some purpose.<br />The vibration modes have some noticeable movement.<br />And if one wishes = this fits good in hand to move around the face for quite a good scrubbing.<br /><br />The teardrop design allows easier cleaning the edges of face to the hair line.<br />And with continual ultrasound movement = the scrubber leavers the face feeling cleansed & massaged.<br />Although honestly - a wash cloth would also work.<br /><br />Don't know that this would actually remove blackheads,<br />other than the fact that it's deep cleaning might clean facial pores.<br /><br />One hr charge = (I think) 12 hr run time.<br />(( which is confusing, \"it can be used about 12 hours, and operated about 300 times\" )))<br />Red light = charging<br />Blue light = done\nAlthough honestly - a wash cloth would also work.\nDr. Denese SkinScience Essential Lipid Anti Aging Power Infusion Dry Oil - Skin Nutrients 97% Organic 100% Natural - Rejuvinating Blend with Amaranth & Resveratrol - Paraben-Free, Cruelty-Free - 2oz\nDr. Denese\n{'Brand': 'Dr. Denese', 'Item Form': 'Dr. Denese', 'Unit Count': '2.00 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Type': 'Adult', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.57 x 3.15 x 3.07 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'Item model number': '800166A', 'UPC': '811684022284', 'Manufacturer': 'Dr. Denese'}\nIt's easy to see why it is, and expect this liquid to be / feel oily.<br />Of the 20 ingredients = 7 are extracts while 13 are various healthy oils.<br /><br />Interestingly = though there's some flower extracts - the product doesn't<br />have any fragrance. This is a light oil that is supposed to soak in skin.<br />Not sure how many hours it may take.<br /><br />But it is as the product description / reviews say =<br />These are all top notch ingredients.<br />And to have 20 in one product, I feel explains the price.<br /><br />Just started using this, so can't speak to it's effeteness.<br />But with 20 high end ingredients, I'm expecting to notice good things.\nWith a belief in the ingredients\nBath Pillow for Bathtub, Spa Pillows for Neck Head Shoulders Back Support, Thick Bath Tub Cushion with 6 Suction Cups Men Women Breathable Comfort 4D Air Mesh Quick Dry Headrest Bath Accessories\nAzun\n{'Brand': 'Azun', 'Material': 'Mesh', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '13 x 11 x 1 inches', 'Product Care Instructions': 'Hand Wash Only', 'Product Dimensions': '13 x 11 x 1 inches; 11.36 Ounces'}\nThe 2 upper suction cups ended up needing placed where the shower surround<br />fake grout is = so no suction on the wall to keep it in place.<br />But the 4 suction cups against the tub hold it fairly well in place.<br /><br />We've found the pillow to be comfortable and filled in the 2\" ledge of the tub<br />to the wall perfectly. It's a soft / comfy / convenient cushion.<br />From my 'big box store' shopping from back in the day seems a good value.\nA nice bath pillow.\nLnlofen Silicone Back Scrubber for Shower, Exfoliating Long Silicone Body Back Brush, Handle Scrubbing Pad, Easy to Clean, Lathers Well, Comfortable Massage for Shower(Green)\nLnlofen\n{'Package Dimensions': '9.37 x 7.44 x 1.93 inches; 7.05 Ounces', 'UPC': '768894803786'}\nOuter side tip to tip of handles 29 1/2\" but inside is 26\" (actual scrubbing area 23\" L - 3\" W)<br />Of course silicone isn't as effective as several other materials which actually scrub.<br />But this pad does a surprisingly good job.<br />At least it does reach across my back, which many I've tried don't.<br /><br />Not quite sure how effective it's gonna be for exfoliating.<br />But that also has some bearing on each individual<br />and how long they've let the back soak to loosen / open pores.<br />And how much it lathers has a lot to do with what soap one uses.<br /><br />Includes a 2 1/4\" sq tacky hook for shower wall.<br />So far I'd give this 5 stars\nScrubs Pretty Good\nVitamin C & 100% Pure Tea Tree Oil, Invisible Acne Spot Treatment Serum Oil to Clear Face & Body, Minimize Pores - Great Makeup Primer - Beard-Friendly (0.5oz)\nJOMO CARE\n{'Skin Type': 'Sensitive Skin,All Skin Types', 'Use for': 'Face', 'Scent': 'Tea Tree', 'Brand': 'JOMO CARE', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Package Dimensions': '3.86 x 1.46 x 1.38 inches; 2.08 Ounces', 'UPC': '093674953956'}\nOur daughter used this Vit C / Tea Tree oil for treating a cyst on her back,<br />trying to avoid the need for it surgically removed.<br />But it was already out of hand for home remedies and she ended up having the surgery<br /><br />HOWEVER = this was found to be helpful in treating until the surgery,<br />and aided in the cyst drainage til it was removed.<br /> 4 stars\nGood Serum\nRevitalizing N.M.F Intensive Hydrating Serum that treats Dull, Tired, Dry and Sensitive Skin from Manilla Natural Skincare\nManilla Natural Skincare\n{'Skin Type': 'mature', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydration', 'Brand': 'Manilla Natural Skincare', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Hydrating,Wrinkles', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.38 x 1.38 x 3.54 inches; 3.99 Ounces'}\nThe serum is rather like a Very thin gel with a lightly sweet, pleasant fragrance.<br />(reminds me of vanilla)<br />It's cloudy looking and doesn't feel oily / greasy, = soaks in very quickly,<br />actually during application.<br /><br />> Instructions - apply on clean face morning / evening. (no mention of how much)<br />> Massage in and wait for it to settle.<br />Since it's adsorbed while applying it can seem the skin is begging for more serum,<br />even on already covered areas. Therefore I likely used more than may have been needed.<br />Gotta be aware to not go quickly through the bottle.<br /><br />Skin looks more naturally alive, and feels soft and supple.<br />> However, this doesn't leave my skin feeling hydrated.<br /><br />> SO - the purpose of this serum is of course to encourage / support the skins<br />Natural Moisturizing Factor = (NMF)<br />which in turn maintains the skins elasticity and supports synthesis of collagen which tightens the skin.<br />(> Which - the tightening effect is mostly how skin feels)<br />>>> Note that over moisturizing skin can actually weaken the skin barrier function<br />of self moisturizing.<br /><br />This seem to be a good serum for problematic areas that more often get heavy wrinkles.<br />(forehead - nose - lips - eyes)<br /><br />Comes in an attractive / quality / thick brown glass bottle - gold cap w/white dropper.<br />(total 3 1/2\" tall - under 1 1/2\" sq)<br />Expiration date on what I received = July 1, 2022 (stamped inside top flap of box)<br />5 stars\nTHIS may work\n3D Mask Bracket for Kids\uff0cInternal Support Holder Frame Nose Breathing Smoothly - Protect Lipstick Lips - Cool Face Mask Inner Support Frame-5Pcs\nVedory\n['\u2764-Outfits Set Include: 1 pack of 5 3D mask bracket (not including mask or cloth, etc.). \u2764-Size: about 10*9*4.2cm / 3.9*3.51*1.64 inches, enough space for various masks. \u2764-Unique design: designed to fit the face of the nose bridge, breathing more smoothly, breathable and not stuffy. \u2764-Ideal Saver for Makeup - It makes the mask not to stick lipstick, protecting your perfect makeup from being messed up.If you wear glasses, 3D Inner Bracket can also prevent the lens from fogging because of more breathing space. \u2764 3D Inner Bracket also suitable for various ma-sks.Using double sided tape or thread to fasten the silicone frame onto the mask can make it work better.']\n{'Package Dimensions': '11.93 x 4.41 x 1.73 inches; 0.71 Ounces', 'UPC': '305393618956 305393618819 800914455060', 'Manufacturer': '01'}\nAdding a bracket to any mask - kids or adults will likely cause more perspiration in the summer.<br />This is a pliable / thin silicone bracelet that can lay between a regular mask / face.<br />> You don't need to have a mask with an opening, this has a hook on each side<br />to hook over the fold of the mask.<br /><br />> While the hooks are nice for placement - I've not found any that stay in place<br />without them being taped in place.<br />> If you do have masks with opening - this bracelet fits inside with lots of extra room.<br /><br />> If the ear elastics have a tiny bit of give / or are a bit loose, this can make them perfect.<br />It's not intrusive<br /><br />> Can be cleaned and disinfected after use.<br />> Washable / reusable<br /><br />3 1/2\" wide - 3\" tall - 1 1/2\" deep<br /><br />CONS<br />1.
