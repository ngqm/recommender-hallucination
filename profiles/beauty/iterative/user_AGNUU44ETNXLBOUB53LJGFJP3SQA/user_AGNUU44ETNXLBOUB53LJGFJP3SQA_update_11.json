BUT can cause flue like systems and lung problems.<br /><br />SDARA SKIN CARE could just as easily made a healthy product<br />BUT - with 3 of 5 points being negative<br />I feel this a 2 star product.\nSome Issues\nBarber Hair Cutting Cape for Men Women, Made with Ultra Soft Silk Fiber, 63\" x 57\"\nSmoTecQ\n{'Package Dimensions': '11.8 x 9.2 x 0.7 inches; 4.8 Ounces'}\nIt's nice size and good for our purpose, cutting hair.<br />And since it called a 'Barber's Cape' and thusly one would expect dry cutting<br />I'm not sure how relevant this is.<br /><br />HOWEVER - it's also stated it's resistant to chemicals.<br />But I don't see how it could be protective to ones clothing when it's not water proof,<br />liquid pours right through, so it's not good for various processes using chemicals etc.<br />And the reason for 3 stars<br /><br />The material around the neck is pleated / drawn together with elastic.<br />It's adjustable with metal hooks, but feels poky and uncomfortable.\nSafe For Dry Cutting\nzelaxy Mask Strap Extenders, Soft Silicone Mask Holders for Relieve Ear Pain Caused by Mask (Eagle)\nzelaxy\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.3 x 2.5 x 0.4 inches; 1.59 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'zelaxy'}\nThese hold well during use and don't pull too tight on the nose.<br />However, they are maxed out for me (last hook on each side) for comfort<br />and wouldn't want them any tighter. (my head - thick hair - 22\" around)<br /><br />Even when pulling mask down around the neck, IF careful, stays connected.<br />But if pulling down without care, of course the strap is disconnected.<br />The silicone seems durable enough and doesn't pull my hair.<br /><br />This isn't a perfect situation, but I've not come across one that is.<br />SOo = 4 stars\nAre Reasonably Comfortable\nlorelo 4 Pieces Nail Dotting Pen, Dual-ended Nail Dotting Pen Liner Brush Nail Art Point Drill Drawing Tools Set Nail Art DIY Decoration Tool\nlorelo\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.3 x 4.2 x 0.6 inches; 1.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '619156572950'}\nThese are good tools for nails, and any number of hobby's.<br />Excellent also for costume jewelry repair.<br /><br />The wax end nicely picks up rhinestones to lay in place.<br />It's fairly soft so you don't need to press.<br />In-fact will press them out of shape if you do.<br /><br />The stainless steel tip is the size of the head of a straight pin.<br />and hollow in the middle for better centering / pressing down.<br /><br />5 stars\nGood quality / value\n5pcs Nail Art Liner Brushes, Lystaii Dual-ended Painting Nail Design Brush Pen Include Liner Brushes and Dotting Pen Nail Art Point Drill Drawing Brush Double Ended Dotting Tools Set 5,7,9,11,14mm\nLystaii\n{'Package Dimensions': '9.41 x 3.86 x 0.75 inches; 1.41 Ounces'}\nThe brushes are 5 1/2\" long 1/4\" wide and easy hold for articulating designs.<br />The 5 different brushes allow for various strokes of width / depth.<br /><br />The metal ends each have a different ball size tip<br />Perfect selection for large variety of designs.<br /><br />Very attractive rhinestones centers of pens.<br />5 stars\nGood quality set.\nFacial Cleansing Brush, Sonic Ultrasonic Vibration Facial Brush, Red-light for Deep Cleaning, Discharge Makeup, Gentle Exfoliating, Blackhead Removing, Massaging with 3 Adjustable Modes and Speeds\nLKV\n{'Material': 'Silicone', 'Brand': 'LKV', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Product Care Instructions': 'Wash with Warm Water', 'Number of Speeds': '3', 'Package Dimensions': '4.7 x 3.1 x 1.7 inches; 3.99 Ounces', 'UPC': '193499829655', 'Manufacturer': 'LKV'}\nAlthough this isn't the most productive cleaning tool, I can see it of some purpose.<br />The vibration modes have some noticeable movement.<br />And if one wishes = this fits good in hand to move around the face for quite a good scrubbing.<br /><br />The teardrop design allows easier cleaning the edges of face to the hair line.<br />And with continual ultrasound movement = the scrubber leavers the face feeling cleansed & massaged.<br />Although honestly - a wash cloth would also work.<br /><br />Don't know that this would actually remove blackheads,<br />other than the fact that it's deep cleaning might clean facial pores.<br /><br />One hr charge = (I think) 12 hr run time.<br />(( which is confusing, \"it can be used about 12 hours, and operated about 300 times\" )))<br />Red light = charging<br />Blue light = done\nAlthough honestly - a wash cloth would also work.\nDr. Denese SkinScience Essential Lipid Anti Aging Power Infusion Dry Oil - Skin Nutrients 97% Organic 100% Natural - Rejuvinating Blend with Amaranth & Resveratrol - Paraben-Free, Cruelty-Free - 2oz\nDr. Denese\n{'Brand': 'Dr. Denese', 'Item Form': 'Dr. Denese', 'Unit Count': '2.00 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Type': 'Adult', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.57 x 3.15 x 3.07 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'Item model number': '800166A', 'UPC': '811684022284', 'Manufacturer': 'Dr. Denese'}\nIt's easy to see why it is, and expect this liquid to be / feel oily.<br />Of the 20 ingredients = 7 are extracts while 13 are various healthy oils.<br /><br />Interestingly = though there's some flower extracts - the product doesn't<br />have any fragrance. This is a light oil that is supposed to soak in skin.<br />Not sure how many hours it may take.<br /><br />But it is as the product description / reviews say =<br />These are all top notch ingredients.<br />And to have 20 in one product, I feel explains the price.<br /><br />Just started using this, so can't speak to it's effeteness.<br />But with 20 high end ingredients, I'm expecting to notice good things.\nWith a belief in the ingredients\nBath Pillow for Bathtub, Spa Pillows for Neck Head Shoulders Back Support, Thick Bath Tub Cushion with 6 Suction Cups Men Women Breathable Comfort 4D Air Mesh Quick Dry Headrest Bath Accessories\nAzun\n{'Brand': 'Azun', 'Material': 'Mesh', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '13 x 11 x 1 inches', 'Product Care Instructions': 'Hand Wash Only', 'Product Dimensions': '13 x 11 x 1 inches; 11.36 Ounces'}\nThe 2 upper suction cups ended up needing placed where the shower surround<br />fake grout is = so no suction on the wall to keep it in place.<br />But the 4 suction cups against the tub hold it fairly well in place.<br /><br />We've found the pillow to be comfortable and filled in the 2\" ledge of the tub<br />to the wall perfectly.
