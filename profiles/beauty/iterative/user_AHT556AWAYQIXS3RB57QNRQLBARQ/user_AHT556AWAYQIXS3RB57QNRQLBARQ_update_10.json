The application stick is very long so it can be very useful to long hair types and the application can be adjusted to shorted types by removing a layer. Easy application as well! For application:<br />-slide hook side first through the roller while it is stretched out<br />-make sure when you slide it through the hook is showing as well as the bottom of the tool so you can pull it easy off your hair<br />-hook a small section of your hair (start at the root)<br />- once your hair is hooked hold the top of the curler gently and the bottom of the tool and gently pull your hair through until the entire hook is out and your hair is covered by the curler.<br />-and your done!

Although they are on the thinner side they have a natural pattern that goes thickest from the wefted hair and thins out to the bottom giving you a more natural look when installed. The hair has plenty of movement and very soft to the touch. The luster is there as you can see when my light hits it. I\u2019m also glad that the color isn\u2019t super black and has natural black color with hints of brown. I know that it\u2019s gonna but the below my back with these lengths so hopefully I don\u2019t sit on it by mistake lol\nLuster And Softness! It There!

Even the UV nail lamp! My little cousin loves seeing her older cousin do nails and I wanted her to start with something a little bit easier to work with that\u2019s why I chose polygel because you can take as long as you need to work it around to your liking and no matter how messed up it may be you can file it into shape. It even gives nice gel color polishes to choose from and some pretty decors to add. She\u2019s gonna love it!
