This hair is gorgeous! Very nice thickness for a 20 inch and silky to the touch with so much body. The closure is perfect on this wig as well! Just to give you guys an idea of the body of this hair I uploaded videos but excuse me for still having my edges wrapped up lol\nSilky and Quality Hair!\nSenegalese Twist Crochet Hair Extensions Ombre-Brown - 32inch 8Packs Synthetic Crochet Braids Pre Looped Crochet Hair Synthetic Braiding Hair (32 inch, T30)\nToyoTree\n{'Package Dimensions': '16.5 x 7.2 x 2.1 inches; 1.6 Pounds', 'UPC': '781827816141'}\n[[VIDEOID:a3e393606a2e6dcef86b83ecc97fa694]] These are a very nice quality synthetic hair but they are small so I\u2019d you\u2019re going for a more fuller look I suggest getting more but if you\u2019re going to space your crochets quite a bit or do individuals with these you should be okay. Very long too, but it\u2019s great they give you a free gift of the crochet needle and jewels so no need for a store trip!\nNice Quality Twist But May Need More Packs!\nlorelo 20 pieces Hair Curlers, Hair Rollers Spiral Curls Styling Kit No Heat Hair Curlers with Styling Hooks for Girls Woman\nlorelo\n{'Number of Items': '20', 'Material': 'Silicone', 'Brand': 'Lorelo', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '10.59 x 9.02 x 2.8 inches; 9.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '619156721396'}\nPerfect for curling hair the heartless way! The application stick is very long so it can be very useful to long hair types and the application can be adjusted to shorted types by removing a layer. Easy application as well! For application:<br />-slide hook side first through the roller while it is stretched out<br />-make sure when you slide it through the hook is showing as well as the bottom of the tool so you can pull it easy off your hair<br />-hook a small section of your hair (start at the root)<br />- once your hair is hooked hold the top of the curler gently and the bottom of the tool and gently pull your hair through until the entire hook is out and your hair is covered by the curler.<br />-and your done! (For best results leave it on overnight if you can!)<br />Hope this helps anyone! \u2764\ufe0f\nPerfect Heatless Curling tool!\nNail Powder Vcedas 12 Colors Acrylic Powder Set for Nail UV Gel Powder Dust Design Decoration 3D Manicure\nVcedas\n{'Product Dimensions': '5.91 x 3.94 x 0.79 inches; 6.38 Ounces'}\nNice vibrant colors!
