Although they are on the thinner side they have a natural pattern that goes thickest from the wefted hair and thins out to the bottom giving you a more natural look when installed. The hair has plenty of movement and very soft to the touch. The luster is there as you can see when my light hits it. I\u2019m also glad that the color isn\u2019t super black and has natural black color with hints of brown. I know that it\u2019s gonna but the below my back with these lengths so hopefully I don\u2019t sit on it by mistake lol\nLuster And Softness! It There!
