The application stick is very long so it can be very useful to long hair types and the application can be adjusted to shorted types by removing a layer. Easy application as well! For application:<br />-slide hook side first through the roller while it is stretched out<br />-make sure when you slide it through the hook is showing as well as the bottom of the tool so you can pull it easy off your hair<br />-hook a small section of your hair (start at the root)<br />- once your hair is hooked hold the top of the curler gently and the bottom of the tool and gently pull your hair through until the entire hook is out and your hair is covered by the curler.<br />-and your done! (For best results leave it on overnight if you can!)<br />Hope this helps anyone! \u2764\ufe0f\nPerfect Heatless Curling tool!\nNail Powder Vcedas 12 Colors Acrylic Powder Set for Nail UV Gel Powder Dust Design Decoration 3D Manicure\nVcedas\n{'Product Dimensions': '5.91 x 3.94 x 0.79 inches; 6.38 Ounces'}\nNice vibrant colors!
