  "reference_summary": "Red Carpet Manicure Starter Kits\n{'Color': 'RCM Essentials Starter Kit', 'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'RC Red Carpet Manicure', 'Finish Type': 'Glossy', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'UPC': '817248203854', 'Manufacturer': 'RC Red Carpet Manicure/ Zupishi'}\nI know gel polish has been around for quite some time but I actually switched from dip powder to gel. I do my own nails and just find dip to be messy and time consuming. I figured at this point all gel systems were the same, so I\u2019ve been using a cheap brand. I came across this kit and definitely notice the difference in Red Carpet. It\u2019s much better quality. Your gel polish will last 21 days if you follow the directions. Five stars from me and it\u2019s a great value!\nRed Carpet... the difference in quality is noticeable!\nAUGNORYE 13 Pcs Hair Cutting Scissors Kit, Professional Hair Barber Scissors Kit with Thinning Shears, Home Hair Shears for Women, Men, Kids\nAUGNORYE\n{'Brand': 'AUGNORYE', 'Included Components': 'Scissors', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Blade Material': 'Stainless Steel'}\nI was looking for a decent set of scissors to trim my daughters hair. This set exceeded my expectations. The Sheers have a nice weight to them, comfortable in your hands. The cuts are precise. The kit come with great accessories. All are useful, only complaint is the brush is cheaply made.\nStrudy scissors!\n3 Pieces Messy Donut Chignons Hair Piece Scrunchies Synthetic Extensions Updo Hair Bun for Women Scrunchies Natural Black #1b\nSHINYSHOW\n{'UPC': '738630490242'}\nMy hair is a 3/4 medium to dark brown with some red undertones. I went with the 1b natural black because the 4 was described as light brown. Light brown is usually a 5. I suggest you go with the number instead of relying on the description. This is still a good product and will match my hair when I first color it... it is always a bit darker. Unfortunately, I was not blessed with thick luscious hair so my buns are super thin (see pictures). This scrunchie is made of synthetic hair and easy to use. I only need to use one but it came with three buns. This is an added bonus because over time synthetic hair will become frizzy and tangled. Also with synthetic, you can not color it or use heat on it.\nGreat to add umph! to your messy bun!\nDr. Denese SkinScience Essential Lipid Anti Aging Power Infusion Dry Oil - Skin Nutrients 97% Organic 100% Natural - Rejuvinating Blend with Amaranth & Resveratrol - Paraben-Free, Cruelty-Free - 2oz\nDr. Denese\n{'Brand': 'Dr. Denese', 'Item Form': 'Dr. Denese', 'Unit Count': '2.00 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Type': 'Adult', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.57 x 3.15 x 3.07 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'Item model number': '800166A', 'UPC': '811684022284', 'Manufacturer': 'Dr. Denese'}\nAt 30 something, I wanted to start taking better care of my skin. I was excited to try this Infusion Oil. Many referred to this as the game changer. But sadly this wasn't a product for me. I still have combination and acne prone skin. The oil never soaked into my skin. It also caused me to break out. I gave it to my mother-in-law, she has dry patches. She loved this stuff. It worked perfectly for her. Her face felt refreshed and moisturized. She also has sensitive skin and has not had any irritation from this Infusion Oil.\nNot for combination skin type.\nLANGE HAIR Extend\u00e9 Conditioning Detangler Hair Spray - Paraben Free Leave-in Conditioner Spray, Detangles and Hydrates Hair, Moisture & Shine | 4OZ\n{'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Material Feature': 'Paraben Free', 'Hair Type': 'Curly, Dry', 'Product Benefits': 'Helps protect color and reinforces strands, leaving them strong and vibrant', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '6.5 x 1.4 x 1.4 inches; 4 Ounces', 'UPC': '793150592708'}\nI've tried a couple L'ange products with the sea salt spray being my favorite. I love this fortifying detangler as well! My hair is fine which means its fragile. I'm trying to grow it out about four more inches. My ends tend to get thin from breakage. I'm hoping this product helps prevent this. So far I notice my hair is breaking less when I brush it. It's a great detangler with a clean scent. It adds shine to my hair and there is less frizz.\nAnother great L'ange product!\nNail Files 16 Pcs, Double Sided Emery Board Manicure Tools for Filing Natural Gel and Acrylic Nails for Home and Salon Use\nKeiby Citom\n{'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'Keiby Citom', 'Grit Number': '100', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '7.8 x 5.08 x 0.59 inches; 5.29 Ounces', 'UPC': '742025065137', 'Manufacturer': 'YHIT'}\nI like to do my own nails.
