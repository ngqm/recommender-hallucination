I do my own nails and just find dip to be messy and time consuming. I figured at this point all gel systems were the same, so I\u2019ve been using a cheap brand. I came across this kit and definitely notice the difference in Red Carpet. It\u2019s much better quality. Your gel polish will last 21 days if you follow the directions. Five stars from me and it\u2019s a great value!\nReview Title: Red Carpet... the difference in quality is noticeable!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
