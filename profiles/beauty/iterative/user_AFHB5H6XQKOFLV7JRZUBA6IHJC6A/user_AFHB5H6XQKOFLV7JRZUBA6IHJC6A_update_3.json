I went with the 1b natural black because the 4 was described as light brown. Light brown is usually a 5. I suggest you go with the number instead of relying on the description. This is still a good product and will match my hair when I first color it... it is always a bit darker. Unfortunately, I was not blessed with thick luscious hair so my buns are super thin (see pictures). This scrunchie is made of synthetic hair and easy to use. I only need to use one but it came with three buns. This is an added bonus because over time synthetic hair will become frizzy and tangled. Also with synthetic, you can not color it or use heat on it.\nReview Title: Great to add umph! to your messy bun!\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I do my own nails and just find dip to be messy and time consuming. I figured at this point all gel systems were the same, so I\u2019ve been using a cheap brand. I came across this kit and definitely notice the difference in Red Carpet. It\u2019s much better quality. Your gel polish will last 21 days if you follow the directions. Five stars from me and it\u2019s a great value!\nRed Carpet... the difference in quality is noticeable!\nAUGNORYE 13 Pcs Hair Cutting Scissors Kit, Professional Hair Barber Scissors Kit with Thinning Shears, Home Hair Shears for Women, Men, Kids\nAUGNORYE\n{'Brand': 'AUGNORYE', 'Included Components': 'Scissors', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Blade Material': 'Stainless Steel'}\nI was looking for a decent set of scissors to trim my daughters hair. This set exceeded my expectations. The Sheers have a nice weight to them, comfortable in your hands. The cuts are precise. The kit come with great accessories. All are useful, only complaint is the brush is cheaply made.\nStrudy scissors!\n3 Pieces Messy Donut Chignons Hair Piece Scrunchies Synthetic Extensions Updo Hair Bun for Women Scrunchies Natural Black #1b\nSHINYSHOW\n{'UPC': '738630490242'}\nMy hair is a 3/4 medium to dark brown with some red undertones.
