I do my own nails and just find dip to be messy and time consuming. I figured at this point all gel systems were the same, so I\u2019ve been using a cheap brand. I came across this kit and definitely notice the difference in Red Carpet. It\u2019s much better quality. Your gel polish will last 21 days if you follow the directions. Five stars from me and it\u2019s a great value!\nRed Carpet... the difference in quality is noticeable!\nAUGNORYE 13 Pcs Hair Cutting Scissors Kit, Professional Hair Barber Scissors Kit with Thinning Shears, Home Hair Shears for Women, Men, Kids\nAUGNORYE\n{'Brand': 'AUGNORYE', 'Included Components': 'Scissors', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Blade Material': 'Stainless Steel'}\nI was looking for a decent set of scissors to trim my daughters hair.
