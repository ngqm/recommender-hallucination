It is super oily. I also do not feel like it takes off the dirt as well as other cleaners. My skin feels super soft after. I also think the packaging is super cute, and I appreciate the included applicator.  I love products with hyaluronic acid, so I am a fan of this product, especially for morning use.\nReview Title: Good\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

They are thin and flexible. However, if your nails are on the small side, these may be challenging to use. I had to file the smallest size down to use on my pinky nails.  They were decently easy to work with, but I was a little frustrated that the listing was not as described. I filed them with an e file. I began dipping my nails at home due to COVID. I am not a professional, but I am decent at working with nails. I will still use these, but I would not purchase again-especially because I can only use half of them.\nA little large and I did not receive clippers\nBEPHOLAN Natural Eyelash Growth Serum and Brow Enhancer to Grow Thicker, Longer Lashes for Long, Luscious Lashes and Eyebrows|10ML\nBEPHOLAN\n{'Package Dimensions': '5.94 x 1.18 x 1.06 inches; 0.88 Ounces'}\nI have tried to use this product for 3 weeks, but I cannot see any difference. There is barely any product in the tube. It is practically dry. You have to reinsert the wand multiple times just to get any coverage on your lashes. I cannot tell any difference except maybe they are softer. I do feel like when I use mascara after this product, the lashes seem fuller. I was really hopeful to see growth.<br /><br />Once I tried this product on my eyebrows, it seemed to make them fuller (what little product I could get out). I do not think this product is worth the price.\nI wish I would have got the mascara wand\nMIZON Cicaluronic Line, Cicaluronic Cleansing Balm, Makeup Remover, Centella Asiatica,Hyaluronic Acid, One Step Cleansing (2.7 fl oz)\nMIZON\n{'Package Dimensions': '2.99 x 2.91 x 2.05 inches; 6.74 Ounces', 'Item model number': '8809606850345'}\nI do like this cleanser, but beware if you have oily skin.
