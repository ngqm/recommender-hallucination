They are thin and flexible. However, if your nails are on the small side, these may be challenging to use. I had to file the smallest size down to use on my pinky nails.  They were decently easy to work with, but I was a little frustrated that the listing was not as described. I filed them with an e file. I began dipping my nails at home due to COVID. I am not a professional, but I am decent at working with nails. I will still use these, but I would not purchase again-especially because I can only use half of them.\nReview Title: A little large and I did not receive clippers\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
