Plus I was really worried about what would happen if it got into my eyes. They made it clear to NOT get it on your eyelids because it doesn't need to go into your eyes. That worries me because I know no matter how careful I am there's probably going to some that will drip down into my eye. Anything that's going on or around my eyes shouldn't be toxic. And maybe they only say that as a precaution and it wouldn't hurt your eye but I don't like to take chances with my eyes.\nReview Title: No luck for me\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I didn't really use it even though it was a great idea it was just uncomfortable and kept fogging up. The foam around it is rough and hurt the soft skin around my eye. The strap I found to be fine once I tied it off to fit me. I still have it and if I ever have another bout of BP I might glue or somehow put some soft fabric around it. Won't fix the fogging up but it might make it feel a little more comfortable. Don't have anything to lose. I wouldn't wear it like it is.\nGreat idea....\nButecare Eyelash Growth Enhancer & Brow Serum for Long - Amazon Vine\n{'Package Dimensions': '4.5 x 0.9 x 0.9 inches; 0.81 Ounces'}\nDidn't work at all for me.
