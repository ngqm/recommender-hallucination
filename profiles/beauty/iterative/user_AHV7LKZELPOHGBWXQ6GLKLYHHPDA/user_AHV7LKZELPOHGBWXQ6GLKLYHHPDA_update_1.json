I didn't really use it even though it was a great idea it was just uncomfortable and kept fogging up. The foam around it is rough and hurt the soft skin around my eye. The strap I found to be fine once I tied it off to fit me. I still have it and if I ever have another bout of BP I might glue or somehow put some soft fabric around it. Won't fix the fogging up but it might make it feel a little more comfortable. Don't have anything to lose. I wouldn't wear it like it is.\nReview Title: Great idea....\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
