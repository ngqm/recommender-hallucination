I didn't really use it even though it was a great idea it was just uncomfortable and kept fogging up. The foam around it is rough and hurt the soft skin around my eye. The strap I found to be fine once I tied it off to fit me. I still have it and if I ever have another bout of BP I might glue or somehow put some soft fabric around it. Won't fix the fogging up but it might make it feel a little more comfortable. Don't have anything to lose. I wouldn't wear it like it is.\nGreat idea....\nButecare Eyelash Growth Enhancer & Brow Serum for Long - Amazon Vine\n{'Package Dimensions': '4.5 x 0.9 x 0.9 inches; 0.81 Ounces'}\nDidn't work at all for me. Plus I was really worried about what would happen if it got into my eyes. They made it clear to NOT get it on your eyelids because it doesn't need to go into your eyes. That worries me because I know no matter how careful I am there's probably going to some that will drip down into my eye. Anything that's going on or around my eyes shouldn't be toxic. And maybe they only say that as a precaution and it wouldn't hurt your eye but I don't like to take chances with my eyes.\nNo luck for me\nAnti-Aging Hydrating Serum with Natural Mango Micro-beads, Vitamins E and C, Natural and Organic Plant Extracts, Paraben-Free, 30 ml, Made in France, Phytema\nPHYTEMA\n['Anti-Aging Hydrating Serum with Natural Mango Micro-beads, Vitamins E and C, Natural and Organic Plant Extracts, Paraben-Free, 30 ml, Made in France, Phytema']\n{'Brand': 'PHYTEMA', 'Material Feature': 'Organic, Natural', 'Item Volume': '30 Milliliters', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.8 x 1.4 x 1.4 inches; 4.23 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'PHYTEMA'}\nI've had some splotchy acne here and there. Not like teenage acne but I get little flesh colored bumps in certain areas/patches on my face and neck. I started thinking maybe I had too much bacteria on my face even though I wash it everyday but decided to use dial soap on it. That wasn't helping at all. I heard that serums are really good on your face and if your face isn't well moisturized it will produce more sebum which in turns can cause more acne. This stuff has been great! It's not completely gone but it's a lot better. I didn't take any pictures cause since they were flesh colored you could hardly see them especially in a photo. I feel like my skin glows a little better since I've been using this too. I was afraid \"vit C\" would break me out cause of the acids but Apparently it's the opposite. Those acids are good for your skin. I would certainly recommend this!\nHelped my acne\nAuroTrends Makeup Remover Towel,2 Pack Reusable Chemical-free Microfiber Makeup Remover Cloths,Magically and Gently Wipe Away Cosmetics,Sunscreen,Oil and Dirt,Set of 2 (Pink+Black)\nAuroTrends\n{'Brand': 'AuroTrends', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Material Feature': 'Reusable', 'Unit Count': '2.0 Count', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '7.52 x 2.72 x 1.42 inches; 6.4 Ounces'}\nThis is so soft! It worked great but I don't use a lot of makeup. Just some pressed powder and eye line. I don't know how it would take off liquid and mascara. I like it just as a face washcloth for anytime. It's really soft. My 6 yr daughter really liked it too and wants one to wash her face with since we do that every morning.\nVery soft\n8Pcs Limit Comb Universal Hair Clipper Limit Comb Guide Attachment Size Barber Replacement\nhuanban072\n['Description:  Features: 100% brand new and high quality Great for adding additional length and styles during your grooming, clipping, and trimming experience.
