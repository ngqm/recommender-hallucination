I love the way this hair feels, it feels so soft & the density of this hair is just right, it\u2019s not too thick or thin. The part is already pre-plucked, but I\u2019ll likely customize it further &  dye the hair black because it\u2019s too brown for my liking. Other than that, this wig is perfect.\nReview Title: I love the way this hair feels\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
