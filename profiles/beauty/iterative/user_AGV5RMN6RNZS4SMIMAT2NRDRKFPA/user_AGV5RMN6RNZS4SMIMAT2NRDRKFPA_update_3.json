The coil groomer was the most difficult to use. No matter how much I twisted it, I could only get a hair or two after a few tries. Tweezing was faster and more effective. The electric face trimmer was designed for removing all facial hair, including nose and ear hair, so the cutting tip was very small and the cutting mechanism was gentle on delicate skin. It was great at removing the peach fuzz on my cheeks; I just needed to make several swipes to get my whole cheek.<br /><br />These shavers are well made. Unfortunately, the instructions were all written in either Japanese or Chinese. I figured they looked self explanatory, so I didn't look up videos on how to use them. The cutting tip is long, which should make shaving go faster as it can cover a larger area. However, the larger blade also means that it is more difficult to reach certain areas. I have a lot of small moles on my face, so I made sure to be extra careful while using them. Despite this, I managed to nick myself a few times. What's ironic is that the nicks weren't on any moles.<br /><br />I think my skin is just too delicate and uneven to use these shavers.\nReview Title: Not for me\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

The first time I tried it on, some of the bling popped off. It is lightweight, so I don't expect it to last long.<br /><br />It's hard to tell from their pictures how this is designed. The tines are bent forward before bending back. They are also split at the band. The effect is separated hair.\nCute, but cheap\n1 Ounce Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Skin \u2013 Hydrating Facial Moisturizer with Anti-Aging Skin Care Properties.

It doesn't bother my sensitive skin, so that's one positive. I will finish using this bottle.
