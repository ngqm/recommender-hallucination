It does faintly smell of coffee but I had hoped there would be more of a spicy smell.  But, this is a nice feeling scrub against your skin.  It does make your skin feel energized.  I'm not sure how long it would take to make my cellulite become less visible but I will keep using it for the mere purpose that it does feel good.  I would say too that it would make a good gift because it's so unique.  I do recommend this product and for the price it's a good value for either a gift or keeping it for yourself as a treat.  Enjoy!\nReview Title: Coffee Scrub\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Gents of London Design Paste Matt Firm Hold Professional Hair Styling Wax (3 oz)\nGENTS OF LONDON\n{'Hair Type': 'All', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Liquid Volume': '3 Fluid Ounces', 'Item Form': 'Wax', 'Brand': 'GENTS OF LONDON'}\nThis hair paste is awesome! for the price, it almost even out performs some way more expensive hair products! I used to use Paul Mitchell hair paste, but this is probably going to be my go to now.<br /><br />This stuff does have somewhat of a smell, but it smells sort of like the original old spice.  It's not too strong though, but if you want something scentless, then you may wanna try something else.\nSmells Kinda like Old Spice\nSdara Aloe Vera Gel For Face and Body - Organic & Natural, Soothing & Cooling For Sunburn Relief, Restorative For Dry Skin - Made In USA\nSdara Skincare\n{'Brand': 'Sdara Skincare', 'Scent': 'Aloe Vera', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '4.9 x 2.3 x 1.3 inches; 9.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '707486993085'}\nSeriously there\u2019s nothing better on a sunburn than Aloe Vera.  It\u2019s natural and won\u2019t harm your skin.  This aloe has a clear color so there\u2019s no artificial dyes contained in this gel.  Just pure headlining and soothing properties.  I feel for the size of the bottle, it\u2019s a great bargain and it\u2019s effective.\nCooling Natural Aloe Vera\n3D Mask Bracket - Internal Support Holder Frame Nose Breathing Smoothly- Lipstick Protection Cool Mask Bracket - DIY Face Mask Accessories - 5Pcs (L-Adult)\nVedory\n['\u2764-Outfits Set Include: 1 pack of 5 3D mask bracket (not including mask or cloth, etc.). \u2764-Size: about 10*9*4.2cm / 3.9*3.51*1.64 inches, enough space for various masks. \u2764-Unique design: designed to fit the face of the nose bridge, breathing more smoothly, breathable and not stuffy. \u2764-Ideal Saver for Makeup - It makes the mask not to stick lipstick, protecting your perfect makeup from being messed up.If you wear glasses, 3D Inner Bracket can also prevent the lens from fogging because of more breathing space. \u2764 3D Inner Bracket also suitable for various ma-sks.Using double sided tape or thread to fasten the silicone frame onto the mask can make it work better.']\n{'Package Dimensions': '6.3 x 4.72 x 2.36 inches; 1.41 Ounces', 'UPC': '800914455053', 'Manufacturer': 'Vedory'}\nThese really do help to make wearing a mask a little easier to breathe.  I don't like wearing mine and I don't have to for very long, but this does help with air circulation underneath your mask.  If you're having a hard time, give these a try.  They are a great value and seem to be very sturdy.\nMask Brackets\nZeitun Natural Anti Cellulite Body Scrub - Organic Coffee Body Scrub Exfoliator With Robusta & Dead Sea Salt - Cinnamon, Ginger And Moisturizing Oils, 7 oz\nZeitun\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.57 x 5.91 x 8.27 inches; 7 Ounces'}\nI didn't notice a distinct fragrance from this scrub.
