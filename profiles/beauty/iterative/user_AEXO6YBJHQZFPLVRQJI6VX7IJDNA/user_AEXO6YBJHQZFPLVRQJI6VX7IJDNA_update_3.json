I used to use Paul Mitchell hair paste, but this is probably going to be my go to now.<br /><br />This stuff does have somewhat of a smell, but it smells sort of like the original old spice.  It's not too strong though, but if you want something scentless, then you may wanna try something else.\nSmells Kinda like Old Spice\nSdara Aloe Vera Gel For Face and Body - Organic & Natural, Soothing & Cooling For Sunburn Relief, Restorative For Dry Skin - Made In USA\nSdara Skincare\n{'Brand': 'Sdara Skincare', 'Scent': 'Aloe Vera', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '4.9 x 2.3 x 1.3 inches; 9.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '707486993085'}\nSeriously there\u2019s nothing better on a sunburn than Aloe Vera.  It\u2019s natural and won\u2019t harm your skin.  This aloe has a clear color so there\u2019s no artificial dyes contained in this gel.  Just pure headlining and soothing properties.
