First let me say that I do like the idea - i love it in fact.  I was so excited about receiving this product because it was so different and unique.  I wanted to learn how to use this product in different ways.  When I received it, I got the bag as pictured above and couldn't figure out what was inside.  There was no description on the outside at all.  I didn't know what was inside till I ripped the bag open. After I opened it, I immediately saw the beautifully colored foil wrapped buds and remembered \"Oh yes, this is the flower buds that I saw that can be used as tea, bath pods and for baking.\"  There was no description, instructions or anything inside other than the beautifully foil wrapped buds.  I'm still left wondering how I will use them.  If I use for tea, I suppose I just wing it and drink the tea when I think it's done as there's no recipe for how long to steep to experience the perfect amount of flavor is extracted.  If I use for a bath, I'm sure there would be much more flexibility but it also advertises you can use for baking.  I have no idea how to use it for that.  If I wanted to use it for a gift, it would be incomplete not to mention that in order to even know what I ordered, I had to already open the pretty bag so that would ruin the presentation.  I feel this is a great product with great potential to be a high end gift or luxury indulgence.  They just have one more step to complete in the way of instructions and explanation on the packaging to make it achieve it's potential.  This idea could easily go viral and become very popular.\nReview Title: Dried Flower Buds\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Gents of London Design Paste Matt Firm Hold Professional Hair Styling Wax (3 oz)\nGENTS OF LONDON\n{'Hair Type': 'All', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Liquid Volume': '3 Fluid Ounces', 'Item Form': 'Wax', 'Brand': 'GENTS OF LONDON'}\nThis hair paste is awesome! for the price, it almost even out performs some way more expensive hair products! I used to use Paul Mitchell hair paste, but this is probably going to be my go to now.<br /><br />This stuff does have somewhat of a smell, but it smells sort of like the original old spice.  It's not too strong though, but if you want something scentless, then you may wanna try something else.\nSmells Kinda like Old Spice\nSdara Aloe Vera Gel For Face and Body - Organic & Natural, Soothing & Cooling For Sunburn Relief, Restorative For Dry Skin - Made In USA\nSdara Skincare\n{'Brand': 'Sdara Skincare', 'Scent': 'Aloe Vera', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '4.9 x 2.3 x 1.3 inches; 9.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '707486993085'}\nSeriously there\u2019s nothing better on a sunburn than Aloe Vera.  It\u2019s natural and won\u2019t harm your skin.  This aloe has a clear color so there\u2019s no artificial dyes contained in this gel.  Just pure headlining and soothing properties.  I feel for the size of the bottle, it\u2019s a great bargain and it\u2019s effective.\nCooling Natural Aloe Vera\n3D Mask Bracket - Internal Support Holder Frame Nose Breathing Smoothly- Lipstick Protection Cool Mask Bracket - DIY Face Mask Accessories - 5Pcs (L-Adult)\nVedory\n['\u2764-Outfits Set Include: 1 pack of 5 3D mask bracket (not including mask or cloth, etc.). \u2764-Size: about 10*9*4.2cm / 3.9*3.51*1.64 inches, enough space for various masks. \u2764-Unique design: designed to fit the face of the nose bridge, breathing more smoothly, breathable and not stuffy. \u2764-Ideal Saver for Makeup - It makes the mask not to stick lipstick, protecting your perfect makeup from being messed up.If you wear glasses, 3D Inner Bracket can also prevent the lens from fogging because of more breathing space. \u2764 3D Inner Bracket also suitable for various ma-sks.Using double sided tape or thread to fasten the silicone frame onto the mask can make it work better.']\n{'Package Dimensions': '6.3 x 4.72 x 2.36 inches; 1.41 Ounces', 'UPC': '800914455053', 'Manufacturer': 'Vedory'}\nThese really do help to make wearing a mask a little easier to breathe.  I don't like wearing mine and I don't have to for very long, but this does help with air circulation underneath your mask.  If you're having a hard time, give these a try.  They are a great value and seem to be very sturdy.\nMask Brackets\nZeitun Natural Anti Cellulite Body Scrub - Organic Coffee Body Scrub Exfoliator With Robusta & Dead Sea Salt - Cinnamon, Ginger And Moisturizing Oils, 7 oz\nZeitun\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.57 x 5.91 x 8.27 inches; 7 Ounces'}\nI didn't notice a distinct fragrance from this scrub.  It does faintly smell of coffee but I had hoped there would be more of a spicy smell.  But, this is a nice feeling scrub against your skin.  It does make your skin feel energized.  I'm not sure how long it would take to make my cellulite become less visible but I will keep using it for the mere purpose that it does feel good.  I would say too that it would make a good gift because it's so unique.  I do recommend this product and for the price it's a good value for either a gift or keeping it for yourself as a treat.  Enjoy!\nCoffee Scrub\nReusable Makeup Remover Pads| Dual- Texture Soft Reusable Face Microfiber Rounds For Mascara, Eye Shadow, Lipstick, Foundation (3 Pads+ Makeup Headband +Laundry Bag)\nTECHEALTH\n{'Product Dimensions': '11 x 7.5 x 2 inches; 2.82 Ounces', 'UPC': '860002480299'}\nIf you are concerned about the environment and like a simple way to remove your makeup, these are for you!  You use these microfiber pads once and you can wash them in a bag that is provided for you in this pouch.  It couldn't be easier or better for our environment.  I feel this would make an excellent gift for someone as well.  Everything you need is all included in this ziplock pouch.  It's a big savings financially to have pads that can be washed and reused over and over again.  I think you'll enjoy this product very much.\nReusable Makeup Removal Pads with Laundry bag\nRancco Dried Flower Buds Fragrant Petals Ball, 10 Kinds Natural Organic Flowers Ball, Premium Grade Dried Blooming Flower Tea Balls for Tea, Baking or Bath Bombs\nRancco\n{'Brand': 'Rancco', 'Scent': 'Honey, Rose, Lily', 'Material Feature': 'Vegan', 'Unit Count': '10.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '10', 'Package Dimensions': '9.49 x 6.26 x 1.1 inches; 3.88 Ounces'}\nI want to explain why I didn't give this neat product a better rating.
