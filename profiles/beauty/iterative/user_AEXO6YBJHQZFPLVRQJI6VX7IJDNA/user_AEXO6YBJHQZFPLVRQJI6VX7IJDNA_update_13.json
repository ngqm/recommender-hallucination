This solves that problem nicely.  It's very soft and pliable and opens with a squeeze of the ends of the container.  It's very easy to use and your sponge fits nicely inside.  It seems quite durable and like it would last a good long time.  It's also easy to clean and allows circulation in case you wash your sponge and it's slightly damp.  The air holes will allow for proper circulation.  This is a really handy gadget!\nReview Title: Makeup Sponge Holder\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Gents of London Design Paste Matt Firm Hold Professional Hair Styling Wax (3 oz)\nGENTS OF LONDON\n{'Hair Type': 'All', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Liquid Volume': '3 Fluid Ounces', 'Item Form': 'Wax', 'Brand': 'GENTS OF LONDON'}\nThis hair paste is awesome! for the price, it almost even out performs some way more expensive hair products! I used to use Paul Mitchell hair paste, but this is probably going to be my go to now.<br /><br />This stuff does have somewhat of a smell, but it smells sort of like the original old spice.  It's not too strong though, but if you want something scentless, then you may wanna try something else.\nSmells Kinda like Old Spice\nSdara Aloe Vera Gel For Face and Body - Organic & Natural, Soothing & Cooling For Sunburn Relief, Restorative For Dry Skin - Made In USA\nSdara Skincare\n{'Brand': 'Sdara Skincare', 'Scent': 'Aloe Vera', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '4.9 x 2.3 x 1.3 inches; 9.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '707486993085'}\nSeriously there\u2019s nothing better on a sunburn than Aloe Vera.  It\u2019s natural and won\u2019t harm your skin.  This aloe has a clear color so there\u2019s no artificial dyes contained in this gel.  Just pure headlining and soothing properties.  I feel for the size of the bottle, it\u2019s a great bargain and it\u2019s effective.\nCooling Natural Aloe Vera\n3D Mask Bracket - Internal Support Holder Frame Nose Breathing Smoothly- Lipstick Protection Cool Mask Bracket - DIY Face Mask Accessories - 5Pcs (L-Adult)\nVedory\n['\u2764-Outfits Set Include: 1 pack of 5 3D mask bracket (not including mask or cloth, etc.). \u2764-Size: about 10*9*4.2cm / 3.9*3.51*1.64 inches, enough space for various masks. \u2764-Unique design: designed to fit the face of the nose bridge, breathing more smoothly, breathable and not stuffy. \u2764-Ideal Saver for Makeup - It makes the mask not to stick lipstick, protecting your perfect makeup from being messed up.If you wear glasses, 3D Inner Bracket can also prevent the lens from fogging because of more breathing space. \u2764 3D Inner Bracket also suitable for various ma-sks.Using double sided tape or thread to fasten the silicone frame onto the mask can make it work better.']\n{'Package Dimensions': '6.3 x 4.72 x 2.36 inches; 1.41 Ounces', 'UPC': '800914455053', 'Manufacturer': 'Vedory'}\nThese really do help to make wearing a mask a little easier to breathe.  I don't like wearing mine and I don't have to for very long, but this does help with air circulation underneath your mask.  If you're having a hard time, give these a try.  They are a great value and seem to be very sturdy.\nMask Brackets\nZeitun Natural Anti Cellulite Body Scrub - Organic Coffee Body Scrub Exfoliator With Robusta & Dead Sea Salt - Cinnamon, Ginger And Moisturizing Oils, 7 oz\nZeitun\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.57 x 5.91 x 8.27 inches; 7 Ounces'}\nI didn't notice a distinct fragrance from this scrub.  It does faintly smell of coffee but I had hoped there would be more of a spicy smell.  But, this is a nice feeling scrub against your skin.  It does make your skin feel energized.  I'm not sure how long it would take to make my cellulite become less visible but I will keep using it for the mere purpose that it does feel good.  I would say too that it would make a good gift because it's so unique.  I do recommend this product and for the price it's a good value for either a gift or keeping it for yourself as a treat.  Enjoy!\nCoffee Scrub\nReusable Makeup Remover Pads| Dual- Texture Soft Reusable Face Microfiber Rounds For Mascara, Eye Shadow, Lipstick, Foundation (3 Pads+ Makeup Headband +Laundry Bag)\nTECHEALTH\n{'Product Dimensions': '11 x 7.5 x 2 inches; 2.82 Ounces', 'UPC': '860002480299'}\nIf you are concerned about the environment and like a simple way to remove your makeup, these are for you!  You use these microfiber pads once and you can wash them in a bag that is provided for you in this pouch.  It couldn't be easier or better for our environment.  I feel this would make an excellent gift for someone as well.  Everything you need is all included in this ziplock pouch.  It's a big savings financially to have pads that can be washed and reused over and over again.  I think you'll enjoy this product very much.\nReusable Makeup Removal Pads with Laundry bag\nRancco Dried Flower Buds Fragrant Petals Ball, 10 Kinds Natural Organic Flowers Ball, Premium Grade Dried Blooming Flower Tea Balls for Tea, Baking or Bath Bombs\nRancco\n{'Brand': 'Rancco', 'Scent': 'Honey, Rose, Lily', 'Material Feature': 'Vegan', 'Unit Count': '10.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '10', 'Package Dimensions': '9.49 x 6.26 x 1.1 inches; 3.88 Ounces'}\nI want to explain why I didn't give this neat product a better rating.  First let me say that I do like the idea - i love it in fact.  I was so excited about receiving this product because it was so different and unique.  I wanted to learn how to use this product in different ways.  When I received it, I got the bag as pictured above and couldn't figure out what was inside.  There was no description on the outside at all.  I didn't know what was inside till I ripped the bag open. After I opened it, I immediately saw the beautifully colored foil wrapped buds and remembered \"Oh yes, this is the flower buds that I saw that can be used as tea, bath pods and for baking.\"  There was no description, instructions or anything inside other than the beautifully foil wrapped buds.  I'm still left wondering how I will use them.  If I use for tea, I suppose I just wing it and drink the tea when I think it's done as there's no recipe for how long to steep to experience the perfect amount of flavor is extracted.  If I use for a bath, I'm sure there would be much more flexibility but it also advertises you can use for baking.  I have no idea how to use it for that.  If I wanted to use it for a gift, it would be incomplete not to mention that in order to even know what I ordered, I had to already open the pretty bag so that would ruin the presentation.  I feel this is a great product with great potential to be a high end gift or luxury indulgence.  They just have one more step to complete in the way of instructions and explanation on the packaging to make it achieve it's potential.  This idea could easily go viral and become very popular.\nDried Flower Buds\nKneipp Body Lotion (Lavender)\n{'Brand': 'Kneipp', 'Scent': 'Lavender', 'Item Form': 'Lotion', 'Active Ingredients': 'lavender,vitamin a', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '5.2 x 2.72 x 13.7 inches; 7.05 Ounces'}\nI love that this is Vegan!  It's got good things for your skin other than the relaxing qualities of Lavender.  It's got Vitamin A and Almond Oil in this lotion.  It comes out very thick and creamy.  The scent is amazing too.  It is very calming for you and I'd suggest using it right before bed.  It's just the ticket to a good sleep regimen.  You will love this lotion as much as I do I'm certain of it!\nLavender Lotion\nCalendula Soap With Coconut Oil Soap - Natural Body Soap | Best Body Bar For Dry & Sensitive Skin | Use As A Bath Soap & Face Pure Extracts (2.64 Ounce)\nPure Extracts\n{'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Brand': 'Pure Extracts', 'Scent': 'Calendula', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '3.23 x 2.2 x 1.34 inches; 4.16 Ounces'}\nIt's got to be the Calendula oil that leaves your skin so moisturized after using this soap.  I first smelled the very subtle fragrance and thought I'd enjoy this soap enough to purchase it again till I also realized it's really moisturizing.  I think you'll be very happy with how it leaves your skin feeling most of all.  It's advertised as being all natural as well so if you have sensitive skin, you shouldn't have any problems with this although I'd always recommend trying a test patch first before using it in the shower all over.\nBar of Soap with Calendula Oil\nmagicopper Face Masks with strap, Breathable Face Mask special 2 Layer Facemask, Lightweight Facial Masks for Adult, Men, Women, Indoor, Outdoor Use\nmagicopper\n{'Brand': 'Magicopper', 'Material': 'Copper', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Pattern': 'Solid', 'Size': '1 Count (Pack of 1)', 'Ply Rating': '2 ply', 'Style': 'Earloop', 'Closure Type': 'Ear Loop', 'Reusability': 'Reusable', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Product Dimensions': '1 x 8.3 x 6 inches; 1.45 Ounces', 'UPC': '792279090133', 'Manufacturer': 'magicopper'}\nI wasn't sure what to expect when this arrive but I was pleasantly surprised at how breathable this mask is.  It's more formed and cone shaped on it's own which allows a breathing space between your face and the mask itself.  This makes this mask so easy to breath with.  I'm not used to using masks since I spend more time at home but when I do go out, I want a mask that doesn't make me feel like I'm struggling for breath.  This is the mask for you!  It not only is very safe and the harder shell surface will keep germs out, it's also a nice breathable mask.  The price is extremely fair as well.  It comes with a lanyard so you don't have to put your mask down on any dirty surface when not in use.  It can hang from your neck comfortably.  The inside of the mask is washable so you can use it again and again without fear.\nMagicopper Film Mask\nCuticle & Nail Care Set 3pcs - Stainless Steel Cuticle Nippers, Cuticle Pusher And Scraper To Remove Gel Nail - Nail Art Remover Tool, Manicure Tools (Silver)\nHeisey\n{'Package Dimensions': '6.61 x 2.56 x 0.59 inches; 2.47 Ounces', 'UPC': '793811542271'}\nI ordered this mainly for the cutters.  This cuticle nipper has a double tension resistance and is easy to maneuver.  I like to keep my nails and cuticles looking good.  It's important to have the right quality tools.  This kit has the basics and the price is right.  Each item seems to be of high quality steel and feels good in your hand making them an easy way to keep your manicure and pedicure looking good.\nNail Care Cuticle Nippers and accessories\nLittle Moon Essentials Floral Bath & Shower Sugar Exfoliant, Relax, 2 oz.\nLittle Moon Essentials\n{'Brand': 'Little Moon Essentials', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Product Benefits': 'Exfoliating', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Material Type Free': 'preservative free,paraben free', 'Package Dimensions': '2.2 x 2.2 x 1.3 inches; 2 Ounces', 'UPC': '673673882459'}\nThis has a very pleasant scent and works quite well at exfoliating and moisturizing your skin.  I think the scent is a bit on the stronger side but it's pleasant and is more like something you'd smell in a spa for relaxation.  It's a small size tin so use sparingly.  A little goes a long way.  You will enjoy this little luxury very much.  It's a great value as well as a fun thing to use or gift to a friend.\nSugar Scrub\n2PCS Portable Electric Toothbrush Travel Case, Plastic Travel Toothbrush Container Holder Suitable for Oral-B, Philips Sonicare and Other Electric Toothbrush Set (Black and White)\nHovesty\n{'Package Dimensions': '9.84 x 5.59 x 1.73 inches; 6.38 Ounces', 'UPC': '664935369078'}\nThese toothbrush cases are a good size and you can fit your electric toothbrush inside easily if you remove the brush stem.  They won't rattle around in there because they have grooves where the brush and stem both can easily fit inside and clip into place.  The reason I gave these a 3 star rating was because the clip that is to keep the case closed doesn't really clamp or close right.  It's very loose and I think that you will need a rubber band to keep the case closed.  I know that's not really a big deal but given that I haven't even used these yet I can't blame wear and tear on the fact that the clasp doesn't work.  It didn't work from the moment I took it out of the box.  I suppose if you put this case inside a toiletry bag, it's unlikely it will open even without a rubber band so really, if you need something to pack up your electric toothbrush, these cases will work and hold most brands of electric toothbrush and the price was fair.\nTravel Electric Toothbrush Case\nFERYES Makeup Sponge Holder with Makeup Sponge\u2013 Eco-Friendly Silicone Beauty Make Up Blender Case and Dry & Wet Use Foundation Sponge for Travel - Khaki (MS Khaki)\nFERYES\n{'Brand': 'FERYES', 'Color': '(MS Khaki)', 'Material': 'Silicone', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Makeup', 'Package Dimensions': '3.19 x 2.48 x 2.44 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'LEYIX', 'Country of Origin': 'China'}\nOne issue I've had in my makeup drawer is that I hate to just put my blender sponge in there without being inside something to keep it clean and sanitary.
