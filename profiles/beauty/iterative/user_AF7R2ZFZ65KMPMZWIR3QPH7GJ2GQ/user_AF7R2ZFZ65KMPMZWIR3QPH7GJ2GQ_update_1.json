We end up replacing them after about 3 years or so, but, at a price under $20 each, it still is cheaper than a Sonicare.  The replacement head brushes are about the same price as the more expenseive rechargeables, and we purchase them at Sam's and on line.  And, in the end, the results are what matter.  No one in our family has had a cavity in over 7 years.  Some of that has to be the results of a good toothbrushing (especially with my children).\nReview Title: Great Product. Great Price. Great Results.\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
