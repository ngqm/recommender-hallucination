We end up replacing them after about 3 years or so, but, at a price under $20 each, it still is cheaper than a Sonicare.  The replacement head brushes are about the same price as the more expenseive rechargeables, and we purchase them at Sam's and on line.  And, in the end, the results are what matter.  No one in our family has had a cavity in over 7 years.  Some of that has to be the results of a good toothbrushing (especially with my children).\nGreat Product. Great Price.

The wipes do not completely remove makeup/residue, so if I use the wipes exclusively, I will get clogged pores within a couple of weeks. This result is the same using other manufacturer's wipes.  Consequently, while super convenient especially while traveling, if I travel with make-up wipes, I also travel with blemish cream.\nNice, Pleasant Smell.

They are suppose to draw out impurities (charcoal side) and soothe the skin for a \"healthier\" look.<br /><br />The pads are premoistened and have plenty of moisture.  It is easy to discern the charcoal side.  After about 3 weeks of use every 3rd day, I cannot see the difference in my skin. I'm not a heavy make-up wearer, so this may be a factor in trying to see noticeable differences when using/not using the Neogen charcoal pad.\nOK Facial Pads.\nAloe Vera Gel 100% Natural Moisturisers - Pure Organic Fresh Soothing Aloe-Vera Moisturizing Gel Skin Hair, Aloe Leaf Wash-free Clean After Sun Face Body (8.8 oz)\nCIMIY\n{'Brand': 'CIMIY', 'Scent': 'Aloe Vera', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Unit Count': '8.8 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Product Dimensions': '5.91 x 1.57 x 1.57 inches; 11.22 Ounces'}\nAs an Aloe Vera product, this gel is OK.
