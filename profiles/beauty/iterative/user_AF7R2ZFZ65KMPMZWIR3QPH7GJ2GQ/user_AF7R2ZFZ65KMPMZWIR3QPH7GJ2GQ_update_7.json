It cleans well but leaves my hair with some fly-aways, so I follow the shampoo with a conditioner when washing my hair.  I can go about every other day for washing, which is about normal for most of my shampoos. The lather is adequate and not overly generous (so not a lot of additive to produce excess lather).<br /><br />The bottle arrived a bit slimy because the screw cap came loose in shipping. Luckily, the bottle was sealed in plastic. The pump action works as expected.\nReview Title: Cleans Well.

We end up replacing them after about 3 years or so, but, at a price under $20 each, it still is cheaper than a Sonicare.  The replacement head brushes are about the same price as the more expenseive rechargeables, and we purchase them at Sam's and on line.  And, in the end, the results are what matter.  No one in our family has had a cavity in over 7 years.  Some of that has to be the results of a good toothbrushing (especially with my children).\nGreat Product. Great Price.

The wipes do not completely remove makeup/residue, so if I use the wipes exclusively, I will get clogged pores within a couple of weeks. This result is the same using other manufacturer's wipes.  Consequently, while super convenient especially while traveling, if I travel with make-up wipes, I also travel with blemish cream.\nNice, Pleasant Smell.

The sponge acts as the abrasive to assist the nail polish remover liquid complete the removal job. It works pretty well on fingers - you have th kind of twist your fingers around/about. Can't see using this for toes at all.<br /><br />3-1/2 stars because limited use.

They are suppose to draw out impurities (charcoal side) and soothe the skin for a \"healthier\" look.<br /><br />The pads are premoistened and have plenty of moisture.  It is easy to discern the charcoal side.  After about 3 weeks of use every 3rd day, I cannot see the difference in my skin. I'm not a heavy make-up wearer, so this may be a factor in trying to see noticeable differences when using/not using the Neogen charcoal pad.\nOK Facial Pads.\nAloe Vera Gel 100% Natural Moisturisers - Pure Organic Fresh Soothing Aloe-Vera Moisturizing Gel Skin Hair, Aloe Leaf Wash-free Clean After Sun Face Body (8.8 oz)\nCIMIY\n{'Brand': 'CIMIY', 'Scent': 'Aloe Vera', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Unit Count': '8.8 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Product Dimensions': '5.91 x 1.57 x 1.57 inches; 11.22 Ounces'}\nAs an Aloe Vera product, this gel is OK. Its moisturizing capabilities are below average and its soothing abilities on tender skin are average.<br /><br />The gel leans thin-ish for a \"thick\" gel. The smell is light and inoffensive. The seller says this can be used as a base to make homemade hand sanitizer and the thickness is about on par with typical hand sanitizers on the market.\nMildly Moisturizing.\nHair Clipper Beard Trimmer Kit for Men,Cordless Hair Trimmer Mustache Trimmer Body Groomer Trimmer for Nose Ear Facial Hair with LED Display USB Rechargeable 5 In 1\n8sanlione\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '6.5 x 1.77 x 1.18 inches; 1.12 Pounds'}\nReview from my bearded spouse:<br /><br />Things I like about this trimmer:<br />1. The dial adjustment works very well for the gate.<br />2. The trimmer is very quiet (especially compared to my old one).<br />3. The nose/ear trimmer works better than any I have ever used before.<br />4. I generally use a razor for shaving but the two micro screen shaving heads work well for a quick clean up (beware of an occasional pulled whisker).<br />5. For my beard and mustache, the large trimmer used with the gate does a fantastic job.<br />6. Doesn't come with an adapter to plug the USB charging cord into the wall.<br /><br />Verdict: great for beard, mustache and ear/nose hair removal, but I wouln't want to use it as an everyday shaver\nVery Quiet.
