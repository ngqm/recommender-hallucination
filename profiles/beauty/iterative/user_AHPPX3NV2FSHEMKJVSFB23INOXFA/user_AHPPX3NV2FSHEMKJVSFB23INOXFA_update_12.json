I\u2019m really trying to understand where all of these great reviews came from.<br />This is worth Nowhere near the amount of money that I paid for this. The hairline was not pre-plucked, the knots were not bleached, and the frontal part is not the same length as the rest of the hair. I ordered a 20 inch and the frontal part is maybe 10 inches long.<br />I have included pictures. This will be going back today.\nSo disappointed\nPersephone Curly Headband Wig Human Hair Pixie Cut Wigs for Black Women Natural Color 8 Inch\nPersephone\n['Persephone Curly Headband Wig Human Hair Pixie Cut Wigs for Black Women Natural Color 8 Inch']\n{'Color': 'curly headband', 'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Brand': 'Persephone', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '12.7 x 9.1 x 1.4 inches; 6.07 Ounces'}\n[[VIDEOID:d0c52af0efb43e01223c088eae46c351]] This is definitely a wig that you will have to play with to get it where you want it. But no complaints for me. No weird smell and the hair curls nicely.\nIt\u2019s cute but you have to play with it\u2026\nLVWIGXE Short Wigs China Virgin Hair with Baby Hair 13X4X1 T Part Hairline Silky Straight Bob Wigs for Black Women 180% Density Lace Front Wigs Human Hair 14 Inch, Orange (T Part )\nLvwigxe\n{'Color': 'Orange', 'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Brand': 'Lvwigxe', 'Package Dimensions': '13.35 x 8.15 x 2.2 inches; 8.78 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Lvwigxe'}\nI\u2019m pleasantly surprised with this wig. It\u2019s soft, doesn\u2019t shed, and is exactly as described. There are some short hairs in the way but it\u2019s nothing major. The lace is not harsh at all. If you\u2019re into colored hair, I would definitely recommend this.\nIt\u2019s cute\u2026\nZILING Body Wave 13x4 Lace Front Wigs Human Hair for Black Women Pre Plucked with Baby Hair 150% Density Brazilian Body Wave Human Hair Lace Front Wigs 16 Inch\nZILING\n{'Material': 'Human', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Special Feature': 'Tangle Free', 'Brand': 'ZILING', 'Package Dimensions': '11.26 x 9.76 x 1.65 inches; 6.38 Ounces'}\nIt\u2019s a nice wig for the most part. The hair doesn\u2019t fall the same way it does in the pictures. Also the knots are very big on this unit. They look like ants to be honest. It is not preplucked.\nBasic unit\u2026nothing that stands out\nYILITE Blue Tape in Hair Extensions Human Hair 10pcs 20g Tape in Human Hair Extensions Blue Tape Hair Extensions 14 inches\nYILITE\n{'Brand': 'YILITE', 'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Extension Length': '14 Inches', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Installation Type': 'Tape-In', 'Package Dimensions': '11.73 x 2.64 x 0.59 inches; 1.13 Ounces', 'UPC': '737353301699'}\n[[VIDEOID:a60247ffbd9b2dafeea155a50c4972d7]] They pulled off the greatest heist with this one. \ud83d\ude02<br />This is not the same color that is posted. Do not waste your money.<br /><br />Update: The seller updated the color. If you look at my video, the color that was posted was a dark blue.

Straight out of the pack, it looks really nice. It had great parting space . Once I started combing through it, I realized that the hair on the lace part is shorter than the rest of the hair. Because of that, it makes the hair look very damaged. It has a ton of short hairs. You cannot straighten those to look smooth. Even with a wax stick, it didn\u2019t help them.\nNot the best\n13x4 Body Wave HD Lace Front Wigs Human Hair Wigs for Black Women Pre Plucked with Baby Hair 180% Density Natural Hairline Body Wave Transparent Lace Frontal Wigs Natural Color (18 Inch, natural color)\nGRACE PLUS\n{'Material': 'Human', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy', 'Special Feature': 'Tangle Free', 'Brand': 'GRACE PLUS', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '10.31 x 8.15 x 3.43 inches; 9.91 Ounces'}\nSheds way too much.
