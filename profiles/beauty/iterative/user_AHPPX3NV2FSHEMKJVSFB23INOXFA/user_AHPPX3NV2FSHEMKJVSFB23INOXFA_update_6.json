Straight out of the pack, it looks really nice. It had great parting space . Once I started combing through it, I realized that the hair on the lace part is shorter than the rest of the hair. Because of that, it makes the hair look very damaged. It has a ton of short hairs. You cannot straighten those to look smooth. Even with a wax stick, it didn\u2019t help them.\nReview Title: Not the best\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

I\u2019m really trying to understand where all of these great reviews came from.<br />This is worth Nowhere near the amount of money that I paid for this. The hairline was not pre-plucked, the knots were not bleached, and the frontal part is not the same length as the rest of the hair. I ordered a 20 inch and the frontal part is maybe 10 inches long.<br />I have included pictures. This will be going back today.\nSo disappointed\nPersephone Curly Headband Wig Human Hair Pixie Cut Wigs for Black Women Natural Color 8 Inch\nPersephone\n['Persephone Curly Headband Wig Human Hair Pixie Cut Wigs for Black Women Natural Color 8 Inch']\n{'Color': 'curly headband', 'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Brand': 'Persephone', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '12.7 x 9.1 x 1.4 inches; 6.07 Ounces'}\n[[VIDEOID:d0c52af0efb43e01223c088eae46c351]] This is definitely a wig that you will have to play with to get it where you want it.

It\u2019s soft, doesn\u2019t shed, and is exactly as described. There are some short hairs in the way but it\u2019s nothing major. The lace is not harsh at all.
