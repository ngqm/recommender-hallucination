I\u2019m really trying to understand where all of these great reviews came from.<br />This is worth Nowhere near the amount of money that I paid for this. The hairline was not pre-plucked, the knots were not bleached, and the frontal part is not the same length as the rest of the hair. I ordered a 20 inch and the frontal part is maybe 10 inches long.<br />I have included pictures. This will be going back today.\nSo disappointed\nPersephone Curly Headband Wig Human Hair Pixie Cut Wigs for Black Women Natural Color 8 Inch\nPersephone\n['Persephone Curly Headband Wig Human Hair Pixie Cut Wigs for Black Women Natural Color 8 Inch']\n{'Color': 'curly headband', 'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Brand': 'Persephone', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '12.7 x 9.1 x 1.4 inches; 6.07 Ounces'}\n[[VIDEOID:d0c52af0efb43e01223c088eae46c351]] This is definitely a wig that you will have to play with to get it where you want it.
