Last year my husband and son were in a fishing tournament and had forgotten to put on sunscreen. By the end of the day they both came home really burnt. My son got it really bad on his face and nose.  So I went to Walmart to buy something to help give them some relief. Everything was pretty much sold out  except one really small tube of the SunBurnt Gel. I almost didn't buy it because it was kind of pricey and pretty small. I decided though to give it a try since it was my only option. I put it on both my husband and son and immediately they felt a huge relief from the pain. They said the gel instantly took the heat out of the burn and cooled it down. Then by the next morning I was so shocked to see that they both looked like they never even got burned at all and neither of them were in pain. A few days later my son did start to peel a little on his face. So I used the rest of the sun burnt gel and it actually took the peeling away. His face looked normal again within minutes and didn't  peel again after that. My husband didn't even peel at all. I was thinking maybe we just got lucky because there was no way this product had those results in one day, but I found out this year that it definitely was the sunburnt gel that helped. This year, right before summer I found this one for a great deal. I remembered paying alot last year. I also wanted to try it again, so I decided to buy it and store it away until I needed it. Well last weekend my husband went fishing and forgot to put sunscreen on again. He came home burnt pretty bad. So we tried sunburnt gel again and the same thing as last year happened. By the next morning it was a huge improvement. This time he had to put it on twice, but we are still so amazed with how well this stuff works. For now on this is the only after sun care product that my family and I will buy.\nReview Title: The Best After Sun Care Product\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
