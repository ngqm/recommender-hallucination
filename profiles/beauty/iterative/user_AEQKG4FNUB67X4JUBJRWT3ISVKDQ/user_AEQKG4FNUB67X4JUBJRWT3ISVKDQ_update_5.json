For the great low price and quantity of hair received , the quality is good. It came with 3 big packages of the hair and two small bonus hair clips. I picked the blue color and it is beautiful and vibrant. I originally got the hair to make hair extensions for my daughter, but I found it a little difficult because the hair is a little frizzy and does tangle easily. So we ended up just doing braids and some of the blue hair added into each braid.<br /><br />PROS: Good value for your money. Comes with plenty of hair to work with. It's a beautiful and vibrant color. Works really well with braids.<br /><br />CONS: The hair has a little bit of frizz.

  "reference_summary": "SunBurnt PLUS Pain Relief Gel for After Sun, 5 oz - Non-sticky Pain Relief with Lidocaine, Aloe, Calendula\nSunburnt\n{'Brand': 'Sunburnt', 'Scent': 'Aloe Vera', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Unit Count': '5.00 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.88 x 3 x 7.13 inches; 6.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'SG_B07BHTXZ49_US', 'UPC': '324330240012', 'Manufacturer': 'Sun Burnt'}\nThis stuff is the best that I have found for after sun care. Last year my husband and son were in a fishing tournament and had forgotten to put on sunscreen. By the end of the day they both came home really burnt. My son got it really bad on his face and nose.  So I went to Walmart to buy something to help give them some relief. Everything was pretty much sold out  except one really small tube of the SunBurnt Gel. I almost didn't buy it because it was kind of pricey and pretty small. I decided though to give it a try since it was my only option. I put it on both my husband and son and immediately they felt a huge relief from the pain. They said the gel instantly took the heat out of the burn and cooled it down. Then by the next morning I was so shocked to see that they both looked like they never even got burned at all and neither of them were in pain. A few days later my son did start to peel a little on his face. So I used the rest of the sun burnt gel and it actually took the peeling away. His face looked normal again within minutes and didn't  peel again after that. My husband didn't even peel at all. I was thinking maybe we just got lucky because there was no way this product had those results in one day, but I found out this year that it definitely was the sunburnt gel that helped. This year, right before summer I found this one for a great deal. I remembered paying alot last year. I also wanted to try it again, so I decided to buy it and store it away until I needed it. Well last weekend my husband went fishing and forgot to put sunscreen on again. He came home burnt pretty bad. So we tried sunburnt gel again and the same thing as last year happened. By the next morning it was a huge improvement. This time he had to put it on twice, but we are still so amazed with how well this stuff works. For now on this is the only after sun care product that my family and I will buy.\nThe Best After Sun Care Product\nDetangling Brush for Curly Hair,Hair Brush Afro America Textured 3a to 4c Kinky Wavy for Wet/Dry/Long Thick Curly Hair for Beautiful and Shiny Curls (Black)\nBROUYOUE\n{'Brand': 'BROUYOUE', 'Shape': 'Oblong', 'Product Benefits': 'Detangle', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy, Dry, Curly, Normal, Thick', 'Product Dimensions': '0.5 x 0.2 x 0.2 inches; 3.53 Ounces', 'UPC': '300692537076'}\nI was really surprised with how much I really love this brush. I have owned many other types of detangling brushes, and this one is way better. It's was like magic.<br />It has a good weight to it and feels like a durable and great quality brush. The little black plastic piece that comes with the brush, clips onto the back side of the brush. There is two different spots that you can pick from to put the clip on piece.<br />I have 3A type of hair and this brush just rips right through the knots and tangles without causing pain. With my other brushes, the brush would be full of my hair after brushing all of the tangles out. With this brush there was very little hair left in the brush afterwards. Which was easy to clean off of the brush.<br />My daughter also doesn't run for the hills anymore when it comes time for me to brush her hair lol. Now she wants her own brush like this, so I will be buying another one soon.<br /><br />Great Tip For Others: No matter what type of hair you have, you should always start from the bottom and work your way upward when brushing. Take your free hand and hold the section of hair that you are brushing tightly enough so that there is less pulling of the hair from your scalp. I usually place my free hand a little above where the brush is going through the hair. I also find that when you come across an area that is pretty tangled or knotted, that it works better to hold the brush in a vertical position to brush that area.\nAwesome Detangling Brush\nDeepDream Portable Electric Nail Drill - Professional Efile Nail Drill Kit For Acrylic, Gel Nails, Manicure Pedicure Polishing Shape Tools with 11Pcs Nail Drill Bits and 36 Sanding Bands\nDeep Dream\n{'Brand': 'Deep Dream', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Maximum Rotational Speed': '20000 RPM', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '8 x 4 x 2.6 inches; 10.41 Ounces', 'UPC': '191762584966', 'Manufacturer': 'Deep Dream'}\nI am a newbie at learning to do nails, so this is actually my first electric nail drill kit. I really like it. At first, I was really nervous about getting it. I was thinking that maybe I wouldn't be able to figure out how to use it, but thankfully it was pretty easy to use and figure out. It is definitely great for beginners .<br />  It is just as described and as pictured. It works great, it's not loud, it doesn't shake, and it doesn't get hot.

You just soak your cotton ball/pad in pure acetone, and then put the cotton on your nail where it completely covers the nail. Then place the clip-on caps on your fingers to hold the cotton in place. They are comfortable to wear and don't hurt at all. Within 3-5 minutes the nail polish comes right off. It makes the process much easier and quicker. They are definitely worth buying, and they can be used for either at home use or for professional use.\nJust As Described\n3 Packs Braiding Hair Extensions 165G Jumbo Braiding Hair High Temperature Synthetic Fiber Jumbo Braiding Hair Extensions ( Blue)\nUHair\n{'Brand': 'UHair', 'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Material Feature': 'Natural'}\nThe hair is as I expected it to be.
