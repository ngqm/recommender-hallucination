After using this soap for a while the soap leaves a lemon grass smell mix with this other scent that I don\u2019t know how to describe but I don\u2019t really like the smell of the scent. The soap itself is great though the texture is more of a gooey slime feeling compare to other soaps that I have used\nReview Title: Weird texture\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
