I gave this product 4 stars because the package did come kind of open and there was a very strong perfume like odor but I\u2019ll just soak these in soap and barbecide.\nVery nice but has an odor\nCortex International Black Series Duo Platinum 1.25-Inch & 0.5 Inch Travel Size Gemstone Infused Ceramic Plates Duet Flat Iron (Rose Wood)\nCortex\n{'Shape': 'Round', 'Brand': 'Cortex', 'Hair Type': 'Dry, Curly, Straight', 'Material': 'Wood,Ceramic', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '13.19 x 4.13 x 3.98 inches; 2.2 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'CTX-DUO-125RW', 'UPC': '819804020950', 'Manufacturer': 'International'}\nThis hair straightener get is job done immediately, I only use the small straightener only thought just because I like to curl my bangs inwards, but yeah I love this straightener so much\nSleek and gets job done\nLEAP Lemongrass Hand Soap, Natural & Moisturizing Lather, Gentle & Rinses Clean, Made with Organic Oils, Cruelty Free & Vegan, Liquid Hand Wash, Superbly Designed, 12 fl oz\nLeap Organics\n{'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'Leap Organics', 'Scent': 'Lemongrass', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2.4 x 2.4 x 6.9 inches; 12 Ounces', 'UPC': '855920002692'}\nThe hand soap scent is not the best to me. After using this soap for a while the soap leaves a lemon grass smell mix with this other scent that I don\u2019t know how to describe but I don\u2019t really like the smell of the scent. The soap itself is great though the texture is more of a gooey slime feeling compare to other soaps that I have used\nWeird texture\n7pcs Pearl Hair Clips Large Hair Clips Pins Barrette Ties Hair Headwear Barrette for Party Wedding Daily, Gift for Girls and Women\nMEETWIN\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.5 x 3.5 x 0.2 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '723668014119'}\nVery beautiful hair clips that will add some elegance to your look.\nVery elegant",
