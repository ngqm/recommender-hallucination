She cuts my hair every 2-3 weeks and relies heavily on using electric shears to do so.  This unit works very well. It can work plugged in, or with battery, which should give you about 40 minutes of time per charge.<br /><br />The shears are sharp and do a great job of cutting through my thick hair. The attachments are also very nice. Unlike other units that have 6 or 7 different guards depending on what you want to do. It has a fixed length one, a short variable one, and a long variable one. For my hair she used the short variable one.  The settings go from 1/16 of a inch up to about 3/4 inch, and the long variable one goes up from there.<br /><br />Having the variable length guards is great as it reduces the number of guards you need and allows you to change lengths on the fly.<br /><br />Using the shears without the guard is also good for trimming to the skinline, edging and shaping.<br /><br />The only complaint my wife had is that she wishes it were a little more powerful on battery, but wasn't really lacking in power, it is just that she usually uses professional shears. This unit is actually as powerful or more powerful than most shears you buy at walmart or the like.<br /><br />Overall a great shear for home hair cutting.\nReview Title: Great hair cutter, easy to use.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

A definite step up from traditional trimmers. The magic in it is the vacuum that captures and stores trimmed beard and mustache hair instead of letting it fall into your sink to make a mess. You don't make your lady mad, and everyone is happy.<br /><br />The trimmer itself fits comfortably in your hand. It has an detachable cord that allows the unit to be charged. It can operate on the cord or off it's batteries for cordless use. The trimmer is NOT submersible.<br /><br />The attached guard can be adjusted to 9 length settings with a rotating selector. It can also be taken off for trimming necklines or other areas. There is also a separate smaller attachment that can be used for precision cuts.<br /><br />The vacuum is power and made more powerful over earlier models through the use of the \"Turbo\" button that amps up the cutting power and vacuum power substantially.  When you are done cutting your hairs are captured in a removable tray for disposal. There are still a few hairs that don't get sucked up but it a huge improvement over using trimmers without suction.<br /><br />The only negatives are that the hair capture cup is a tad small. There is also a plastic piece that guides hair into the cup that makes neck and cheek-line trimming a little tricky until you get the hang of it.<br /><br />Overall a great trimmer for those of us real men with beards.
