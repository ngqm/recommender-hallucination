A definite step up from traditional trimmers. The magic in it is the vacuum that captures and stores trimmed beard and mustache hair instead of letting it fall into your sink to make a mess. You don't make your lady mad, and everyone is happy.<br /><br />The trimmer itself fits comfortably in your hand. It has an detachable cord that allows the unit to be charged. It can operate on the cord or off it's batteries for cordless use. The trimmer is NOT submersible.<br /><br />The attached guard can be adjusted to 9 length settings with a rotating selector. It can also be taken off for trimming necklines or other areas. There is also a separate smaller attachment that can be used for precision cuts.<br /><br />The vacuum is power and made more powerful over earlier models through the use of the \"Turbo\" button that amps up the cutting power and vacuum power substantially.  When you are done cutting your hairs are captured in a removable tray for disposal. There are still a few hairs that don't get sucked up but it a huge improvement over using trimmers without suction.<br /><br />The only negatives are that the hair capture cup is a tad small. There is also a plastic piece that guides hair into the cup that makes neck and cheek-line trimming a little tricky until you get the hang of it.<br /><br />Overall a great trimmer for those of us real men with beards. A must have!!\nReview Title: A great way to trim your beard!\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
