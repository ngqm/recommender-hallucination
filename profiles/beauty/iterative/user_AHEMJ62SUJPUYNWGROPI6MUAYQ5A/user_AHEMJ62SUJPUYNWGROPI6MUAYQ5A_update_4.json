I have plenty, so it wasn't a problem, but it would have been if I hadn't.<br /><br />The plug that covers the USB port is not attached to the unit and I can see it very easily lost.<br /><br />There is no hose. The whole unit needs to be picked up and rotated to use this item. I found it a little cumbersome, especially when I couldn't figure out which button was the off one when I was using it.<br /><br />If you don't get the nozzle in just right it will come off and you will get sprayed. Again, without being able to see the \"off\", it gets messy.<br /><br />The water canister isn't very big. I frequently have to fill it twice per use.<br /><br />All in all, it is an OK unit. I don't have the expectation that it will still be working in a couple of years. But, it is very nice to use now. I will likely buy another WaterPik type device when this breaks. I just don't know if it will be this brand or if I will upgrade to a better one.\nReview Title: OK\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

Please refer to the ingredients list on the product packaging for the most accurate list of ingredients.']\n{'Brand': 'Neutrogena', 'Scent': 'Unscented', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Active Ingredients': 'Isopropyl myristate, sesamum indicum (sesame) seed oil, PEG-40 sorbitan peroleate, propylparaben', 'Unit Count': '8.50 Ounce', 'Package Dimensions': '7.8 x 2 x 2 inches; 9.77 Ounces'}\nThe oil itself is great, but to me it smells like suntan oil. I use coconut oil, also scented but very lightly and it dissipates quickly, after a shower. Although I love Neutrogena stuff and use many of their products, I will stick to [[ASIN:B00P8CQK90 Fractionated Coconut Oil - 100% Pure Premium Grade - PUMP + SQUEEZE CAP + FREE Recipe eBook! - BIG 16Oz - Best Carrier Oil & Base For Essential Oils, Aromatherapy & Massage - Great for Roll-On Bottles - Soothing for Skin & Hair!]]\nSmells like suntan oil\nWahl Smart Shave Rechargeable lithium ion wet / dry water proof foil shaver for men.

I think of Wahl as a hair clipper and probably wouldn't have thought of them when replacing his razor, but I am glad to have learned that they make just as good of a quality razor. He uses a regular razor in the shower, then runs an electric around to catch any missed spots. Because of this the battery doesn't need to be charged very often. The battery life indicator is very helpful as is the razor's ability to charge very quickly. He likes it. He is not raving about it being the best razor ever, but we are both happy with this unit.\nWorking just fine\nLagunamoon Gel Nail Polish, Soak Off UV LED Nail Manicure Color Gel Polish Varnish Set 6PCS 8ML - Love Spectrum\n{'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Glossy', 'Unit Count': '1.62 Fl Oz', 'Liquid Volume': '5 Milliliters', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '5.91 x 0.79 x 1.18 inches', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '5.91 x 0.79 x 1.18 inches; 0.35 Ounces', 'Item model number': '20035', 'UPC': '613869736715'}\nWell, I do have a setting light. These polishes work fine. I think some of the premium ones, like OPI, work better, and are easier to see what colors are in the bottle. But, for the price they are OK. Gel polish is a pain to use.\nOK for the price\nWater Flosser Cordless Teeth Cleaner, SOOCAS Professional Oral Irrigator 230ML Portable and Rechargeable Water Dental Flosser with 3 Modes and 4 Jet Tips, IPX7 Waterproof, USB Charged for 30 Days Use\nSOOCAS\n{'Brand': 'SOOCAS', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Special Feature': 'Por, Multiple Operation Modes, Multiple Tips', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Tank Volume': '230 Milliliters', 'Package Dimensions': '9.49 x 4.41 x 3.23 inches; 1.08 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'SOOCAS W3', 'Manufacturer': 'SOOCAS'}\nI had never used one of these before, so I didn't realize how much of a mess they can make.<br /><br />First, I saw that the USB charger did not come with a plug.
