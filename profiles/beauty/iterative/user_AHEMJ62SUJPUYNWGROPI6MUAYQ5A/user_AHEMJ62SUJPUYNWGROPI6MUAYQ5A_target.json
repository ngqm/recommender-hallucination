It has a pleasant scent, not flowery but with the faint scent of the aloe.. It is not strongly scented and I don't smell it at all once the foam has been rinsed away.<br /><br />It did a good job of removing my makeup. Some cleansers don't touch my non-waterproof mascara. I didn't think this removed it the first time I used it, so I used another tiny amount just on my eyes. When I dried my eyes on a white towel only a faint amount showed on the towel, so it did a pretty good job.<br /><br />My skin feels good after using this, It is clean but not dried out.<br /><br />The most important thing for me is sensitivity. My skin is very sensitive and easily irritated. This caused no reaction. I don't know if the aloe helps, but I really like this cleanser.\nReview Title: very nice on my sensitive skin\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Neutrogena Fragrance-Free Lightweight Body Oil for Dry Skin, Sheer Moisturizer in Light Sesame Formula, 8.5 fl. oz\nNeutrogena\n['While Neutrogena strives to keep ingredient lists on this website as accurate as possible, we cannot guarantee that these lists are complete, reliable, up-to-date, and error-free. Please refer to the ingredients list on the product packaging for the most accurate list of ingredients.']\n{'Brand': 'Neutrogena', 'Scent': 'Unscented', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Active Ingredients': 'Isopropyl myristate, sesamum indicum (sesame) seed oil, PEG-40 sorbitan peroleate, propylparaben', 'Unit Count': '8.50 Ounce', 'Package Dimensions': '7.8 x 2 x 2 inches; 9.77 Ounces'}\nThe oil itself is great, but to me it smells like suntan oil. I use coconut oil, also scented but very lightly and it dissipates quickly, after a shower. Although I love Neutrogena stuff and use many of their products, I will stick to [[ASIN:B00P8CQK90 Fractionated Coconut Oil - 100% Pure Premium Grade - PUMP + SQUEEZE CAP + FREE Recipe eBook! - BIG 16Oz - Best Carrier Oil & Base For Essential Oils, Aromatherapy & Massage - Great for Roll-On Bottles - Soothing for Skin & Hair!]]\nSmells like suntan oil\nWahl Smart Shave Rechargeable lithium ion wet / dry water proof foil shaver for men. Smartshave technology for shaving, trimming, and wet or dry shave with precision ground trimmer blade #7061-900\nWAHL\n{'Brand': 'WAHL', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Beard, Face', 'Special Feature': 'Pop Up Trimmer', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Included Components': 'Clipper, Cleaning Brush, Battery, Charger'}\nMy husband is very happy with this razor. I think of Wahl as a hair clipper and probably wouldn't have thought of them when replacing his razor, but I am glad to have learned that they make just as good of a quality razor. He uses a regular razor in the shower, then runs an electric around to catch any missed spots. Because of this the battery doesn't need to be charged very often. The battery life indicator is very helpful as is the razor's ability to charge very quickly. He likes it. He is not raving about it being the best razor ever, but we are both happy with this unit.\nWorking just fine\nLagunamoon Gel Nail Polish, Soak Off UV LED Nail Manicure Color Gel Polish Varnish Set 6PCS 8ML - Love Spectrum\n{'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Glossy', 'Unit Count': '1.62 Fl Oz', 'Liquid Volume': '5 Milliliters', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '5.91 x 0.79 x 1.18 inches', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '5.91 x 0.79 x 1.18 inches; 0.35 Ounces', 'Item model number': '20035', 'UPC': '613869736715'}\nWell, I do have a setting light. These polishes work fine. I think some of the premium ones, like OPI, work better, and are easier to see what colors are in the bottle. But, for the price they are OK. Gel polish is a pain to use.\nOK for the price\nWater Flosser Cordless Teeth Cleaner, SOOCAS Professional Oral Irrigator 230ML Portable and Rechargeable Water Dental Flosser with 3 Modes and 4 Jet Tips, IPX7 Waterproof, USB Charged for 30 Days Use\nSOOCAS\n{'Brand': 'SOOCAS', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Special Feature': 'Por, Multiple Operation Modes, Multiple Tips', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Tank Volume': '230 Milliliters', 'Package Dimensions': '9.49 x 4.41 x 3.23 inches; 1.08 Pounds', 'Item model number': 'SOOCAS W3', 'Manufacturer': 'SOOCAS'}\nI had never used one of these before, so I didn't realize how much of a mess they can make.<br /><br />First, I saw that the USB charger did not come with a plug. I have plenty, so it wasn't a problem, but it would have been if I hadn't.<br /><br />The plug that covers the USB port is not attached to the unit and I can see it very easily lost.<br /><br />There is no hose. The whole unit needs to be picked up and rotated to use this item. I found it a little cumbersome, especially when I couldn't figure out which button was the off one when I was using it.<br /><br />If you don't get the nozzle in just right it will come off and you will get sprayed. Again, without being able to see the \"off\", it gets messy.<br /><br />The water canister isn't very big. I frequently have to fill it twice per use.<br /><br />All in all, it is an OK unit. I don't have the expectation that it will still be working in a couple of years. But, it is very nice to use now. I will likely buy another WaterPik type device when this breaks. I just don't know if it will be this brand or if I will upgrade to a better one.\nOK\nPARWIN Infrared Flat Iron 1 1/4 Inch Digital Hair Straightener Iron with Ceramic Tourmaline Plate Temperature Control Hair Iron Christmas Gift Black\nPARWIN\n{'Brand': 'PARWIN', 'Hair Type': 'Coarse, Wavy, Frizzy, Curly, Thick, Thin', 'Material': 'Ceramic', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Max Temperature Setting': '232.2 Degrees Celsius', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '13.94 x 3.82 x 1.93 inches; 1.3 Pounds', 'UPC': '605826620649', 'Manufacturer': 'Parwin'}\nWe have been using this for several months and it hasn't died yet. That shouldn't be a big deal, but there seems to be more and more stuff that doesn't last. It is easy to use and does a good job.\nWorking fine\nWonder4 Electric Callus Remover - Rechargeable Electric Foot File Callus Shaver Hard Skin Remover Pedicure Tools with 3 in 1 Roller Heads, for Cracked Heels Calluses and Dead Skin\nWonder4\n{'Brand': 'Wonder4', 'Is Electric': 'Yes', 'Item Form': 'Roller', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Unit Count': '11.4 Ounce'}\nI have the Amope, which only has one file. This has three, from coarse to fine. But the files are quite a bit narrower than the Amope. I thought this would be a bigger deal, but most of the time only part of the file is being used as I am working on the tough spots like the heel or edge of the toe. It doesn't have a lot of power and it kind of slows down a lot. But it gets the job done. I like that it is rechargeable as the Amore went through a lot of batteries.\nsmall and weak, but it does the job\nCanple Self-cleaning Slicker Brush for Medium Long Hair Types Dog and Cat, Removes Loose Hair Undercoat Effectively Reduce Mats & Tanglings Grooming Brush\nCanple\n{'Brand': 'Canple', 'Special Feature': 'Self Cleaning', 'Product Benefits': 'Smoothing', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '10.16 x 6.3 x 2.2 inches; 8.82 Ounces'}\nThe lever to lift the brushes up and down is tough to push. I don't know if it will get better with time, but the dozen or so times I have used this has not helped. But it works well to brush my dog and I am finding pulling the fur off the bristles works just fine.\nsticks, but it works\nMagnesium Salt Bath Flakes | 8 lb Bulk Size | Body and Foot Soak | By Horbaach\nHorb\u00e4ach\n{'Brand': 'Horb\u00e4ach', 'Product Benefits': 'Relaxing', 'Unit Count': '128.0 Ounce', 'Item Weight': '8 Pounds', 'Variety': 'Bath Soak', 'Product Dimensions': '10 x 3 x 15 inches; 8 Pounds', 'UPC': '840050601426', 'Manufacturer': 'Horbaach'}\nThese are the same as epsom salts. They should not be used in gardens unless you need more magnesium. Too much is not a good thing, so all of the internet stuff recommending epsom salts are really bad advice. But, palm trees often need supplemental magnesium, so I got this. The effect takes time to show, so I am not going to lie and say my palms instantly look great, but this is a decent product and it should work just fine. But no, your tomatoes will not grow better if you add this.\ngot them for my palm tree\nJOYPAWS Pet Self Cleaning Slicker Brush Grooming Brush- Shedding Tools with Flea Comb for Dogs Cats Removes Mats, Tangles, and Loose Hair(L)\nJOYPAWS\n{'Brand': 'JOYPAWS', 'Special Feature': 'Self Cleaning', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Material': 'stainless steel', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '6.7 x 4.7 x 3 inches; 6.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'KUDI2020'}\nThis has very sharp tines that scratch my dog. The packaging is all in Chinese. I don't like it when a company doesn't bother to write the packaging in the market's dominant language. Two stars because it does actually brush, but that's about it.\nSharp\nDog Slicker Brush By Rita's Pet Supplies | Grooming Tool with Long Soft Massage Stainless Steel Pins Coat for Cats and Dogs | Slicker Brush for Dogs | Long Pin Slicker Brush for Dematting & Deshedding\nRita's Pet Supplies\n{'Brand': \"Rita's Pet Supplies\", 'Color': 'Red', 'Shape': 'Oblong', 'Handle Material': 'Metal', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '7.8 x 4.17 x 2.76 inches; 4.66 Ounces', 'UPC': '196852230556', 'Manufacturer': 'Shinegold Housewares Co., Ltd.'}\nThis has longer than average tines, so it got down into my double-coated dog's fur. The tines are a little sharp. But it is not self-cleaning, meaning there is nothing to press and collect the fur. Because the tines are extra long, I had to empty this brush less often than with some, but it still was a pain to stop and pull the fur off. I have gotten spoiled with the self-cleaning ones.\nworks, but not self-cleaning\nStride Foot Cream Smoothes Rough Cracked Heels & Dry Skin \u2013\u2013 Dematologist-Developed, Intensely Moisturizing Foot Cream with Aloe Vera, Coconut oil and Green tea\nStride\n{'Brand': 'Stride', 'Scent': 'Coconut', 'Active Ingredients': 'Coconut oil,green tea,vitamin e', 'Unit Count': '4.0 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '3 x 3 x 2 inches; 3.99 Ounces', 'UPC': '860006643317'}\nUnless this is on sale, you can do a lot better by buying a thick lotion from a major brand or even just a jar of coconut oil. It works fine. I use it before bed and wear socks to keep it on my feet and prevent my sheets from turning yucky.\nNot worth $27\nREBONCEL Aqua Rich Hydrating Face Foam Cleanser Gentle Hypoallergenic pH Balance Korean Skin Care Face Wash Cleansing Foam(8.45 fl.oz 250ml)\nReboncel\n{'Item Form': 'Foam', 'Brand': 'Reboncel', 'Material Feature': 'Plant Based', 'Material Type Free': 'Paraben Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '6.46 x 3.27 x 2.32 inches; 11.71 Ounces'}\nThis is a very soft, creamy foam. It has a pleasant scent, not flowery but with the faint scent of the aloe.. It is not strongly scented and I don't smell it at all once the foam has been rinsed away.<br /><br />It did a good job of removing my makeup. Some cleansers don't touch my non-waterproof mascara.
