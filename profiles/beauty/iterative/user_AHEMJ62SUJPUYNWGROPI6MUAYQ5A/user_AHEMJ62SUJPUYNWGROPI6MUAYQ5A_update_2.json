Smartshave technology for shaving, trimming, and wet or dry shave with precision ground trimmer blade #7061-900\nReview Date: 2017/01/15\nStore: WAHL\nAverage Rating: 4.2\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'WAHL', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Beard, Face', 'Special Feature': 'Pop Up Trimmer', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Included Components': 'Clipper, Cleaning Brush, Battery, Charger'}\nReview Text: My husband is very happy with this razor. I think of Wahl as a hair clipper and probably wouldn't have thought of them when replacing his razor, but I am glad to have learned that they make just as good of a quality razor. He uses a regular razor in the shower, then runs an electric around to catch any missed spots. Because of this the battery doesn't need to be charged very often. The battery life indicator is very helpful as is the razor's ability to charge very quickly. He likes it. He is not raving about it being the best razor ever, but we are both happy with this unit.\nReview Title: Working just fine\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
