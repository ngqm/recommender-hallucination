The packaging looks luxurious to me and really stands out from my collection. I went with this shade which is a bright red with orange tones. It just goes with everything I wear and surprisingly my hair color at the moment. I also like how versatile this is so I can dress up or down with this color. It is 100% vegan, made with plant based wax and other natural ingredients like candelilla wax, castor seed oil, shea butter, almond oil, grape seed oil, jojoba, and coconut oil. The lipstick feels very smooth when applying and it I didn\u2019t need a liner. And I think I reapplied when I remembered to after 3 hours and held up fine without any chapping or colorless patches. This is cruelty-free too!\nReview Title: Favorite new lipstick\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
