This one has a shimmer I didn't need but it\u2019s pretty to look at. The creamy texture is amazing. I did like the camomile scent. The hydrating serum was not good at all. It comes in a squeeze tube but the serum ball up badly while applying it. Even when I use a thin layer, it doesn't spread. I would only recommend the wash.\nReview Title: FEMININE WASH & HYDRATING SERUM\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Trophy Wife Cosmetics Lipstick - Semi Matte - Natural, Vegan & Cruelty Free Anna\nTrophy Wife\n{'Brand': 'Trophy Wife', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Item Form': 'Stick', 'Finish Type': 'Semi-Matte, Glossy', 'Product Benefits': 'Long Lasting,Shine,Moisturizing,Clean,Long-lasting,Makeup', 'Package Dimensions': '3.1 x 1 x 1 inches; 1.59 Ounces', 'UPC': '670924966586'}\nI am in love with this lipstick! The packaging looks luxurious to me and really stands out from my collection. I went with this shade which is a bright red with orange tones. It just goes with everything I wear and surprisingly my hair color at the moment. I also like how versatile this is so I can dress up or down with this color. It is 100% vegan, made with plant based wax and other natural ingredients like candelilla wax, castor seed oil, shea butter, almond oil, grape seed oil, jojoba, and coconut oil. The lipstick feels very smooth when applying and it I didn\u2019t need a liner. And I think I reapplied when I remembered to after 3 hours and held up fine without any chapping or colorless patches. This is cruelty-free too!\nFavorite new lipstick\nCatrice | SUNGASM Luminizing Bronzer 01 | For A Sun-Kissed Shimmery Finish | Highly Pigmented & Blendable | Vegan, Paraben Free, Oil Free | Cruelty Free\nCatrice\n{'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Brand': 'Catrice', 'Color': 'C01 Golden Ecstasy', 'Skin Tone': 'All', 'Product Dimensions': '2.72 x 2.72 x 0.51 inches; 1.27 Ounces'}\nIt\u2019s such a beautiful warm bronzer! Great for the summertime to get that golden goddess glow. I love the embossing and the packaging is very compacted. It\u2019s lightweight and I can throw it into my bag to carry it with me.\nLuminous Bronzer\nC'est Moi Gentle Cleansing Water | Gentle, Fragrance-Free Cleanser Removes Makeup and Refreshes Skin, Made with Cornflower Water, Aloe Vera, and Strawberry, Kiwi, and Apple Extracts | 5.9 fl oz.\nC'est Moi\n{'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Skin Type': 'Acne Prone,Sensitive', 'Brand': \"C'est Moi\", 'Scent': 'Kiwi, Strawberry, Unscented, Aloe Vera', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '1.84 x 1.84 x 6.06 inches; 7.69 Ounces', 'UPC': '039897626055'}\nNot bad for gentle cleansing water. I was able to remove a lot of impurities and not irritate my dry sensitive skin. However, it's soap-free but when I took the bottle out, it started bubbling. I think you can see them in my picture. And it felt like a lightweight liquid soap. I double cleanse so it doesn't matter if there is residue but I don't think I wouldn\u2019t leave it on without rinsing after. It's still really good cleansing water for the price point!\nGentle Cleansing Water Indeed\nCaudalie Favorites Set\n{'Package Dimensions': '9.09 x 6.54 x 2.05 inches; 9.59 Ounces', 'Item model number': '2346203'}\nIf you never tried this brand before, this is the best way to give their popular products a try. It came with a beautiful bag and  5 different skincare products, a cleanser, serum, moisturizer, eye cream, and a mist! They all basically promote different skin issues but for the most part targets fine lines, wrinkles, aging spots, and improve dull-looking skin. Everything here works well together but can be used separately as well depending on your skincare routine. So happy with this set!\nCaudalie Bestseller Travel Kit\nC'est Moi Vanilla Vibes Sugar Balm Body Scrub | Invigorating & Hydrating Exfoliant, Clinically Tested Non-Toxic Ingredients feat.

It is formulated with organic sugar, shea butter, coconut and avocado oils to gentle slough away body built up. It\u2019s a wet sugary consistency that is easy to scrub all over. The rinsing does take a little bit of time to fully get all the residue off. Unlike dry scrub, it does not make a mess in the shower. It smells good and leaves my skin looking glowy!\nVanilla Sugar Scrub\nMoist Toilet Wipes, Septic and Sewer Safe 4packs\nBaskrean\n{'Brand': 'Baskrean', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Unit Count': '187.00 Count', 'Item Form': 'Wipes', 'UPC': '770807392133'}\nIt\u2019s good to have. My Bf likes having this around. We can travel with it and leave it in the bathroom to use when needed. The packaging is simple and not outrageous or obvious. And it's flushable and safe.\nGREAT MOIST WIPES\nSummer's Eve Spa Set for Women | Gift Box | Women's Post Shave Hydrating Serum, 1oz Tube | Cleansing Feminine Wash, 12oz Bottle\nSummer's Eve\n[\"Give a special someone or pamper yourself and experience Daily Intimate Beauty with the Summer's Eve Spa gift set containing a Luxurious Cleansing Wash and an Intimate Serum.
