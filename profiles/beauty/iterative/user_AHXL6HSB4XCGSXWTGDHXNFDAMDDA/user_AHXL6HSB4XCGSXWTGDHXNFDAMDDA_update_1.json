If you want color polish, you will have to go buy some. I was wondering where it was because it shows it on the box. I decided to read other reviews and see if I was the only one. Turns out it just isn't in the box. I've had other kits in the past and was hoping this one would be better but it was the worst. The top/base coat was very runny which made it very hard to paint my nails properly.\nReview Title: Some items not included\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
