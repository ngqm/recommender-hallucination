It's not. It comes out like a squirt gun. You still need to use a mitt to spread it around. I felt like I had dirt rubbed on my face after. It was blotchy and just not even at all.\nReview Title: Not as expected\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Red Carpet Manicure Starter Kits\n{'Color': 'RCM Essentials Starter Kit', 'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'RC Red Carpet Manicure', 'Finish Type': 'Glossy', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'UPC': '817248203854', 'Manufacturer': 'RC Red Carpet Manicure/ Zupishi'}\nWell atleast you get the light! If you want color polish, you will have to go buy some. I was wondering where it was because it shows it on the box. I decided to read other reviews and see if I was the only one. Turns out it just isn't in the box. I've had other kits in the past and was hoping this one would be better but it was the worst. The top/base coat was very runny which made it very hard to paint my nails properly.\nSome items not included\n35.4 Inch Extra Long Silicone Back Scrubber for Shower, 2021 Updated Lengthen Back Scrubber Brush for Men and Women, Exfoliating Back Washer with Wall Hooks, Easy Clean, Comfortable Massage (Green 27.5in)\nMAORULU\n{'Package Dimensions': '8.75 x 5.5 x 2.6 inches; 6.38 Ounces', 'UPC': '757173533773', 'Manufacturer': 'MAORULU'}\nMy favorite part of this is the sticky hooks that come with it. I tried putting body wash on it but it's a bit tricky to do. The one side with the bristles feels great on your back the opposite side isn't anything special. Very easy to clean and nice that you can hang it anywhere.\nThe extras make it worth it\nNAILGIL Poly Nail Gel (Temperature)\nNAIL GIL\n{'Brand': 'NAIL GIL', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'gel', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '9.45 x 4.72 x 1.18 inches'}\nI have seen a ton of social media posts about these poly gel kits and figured I would give it a try. I am not a professional at all and can barely paint my own nails. I watched a couple of YouTube videos before giving this a try and I didn't do terrible! Here are some pointers for those of you that are trying this out for the first time.<br />1) you need to have a uv/led curing light. You start with the clear base and cure it before applying the gel. Apply the gel and cure, then apply the top coat and cure.<br />2) thick but not too thick!- If you make it too thin, the tips will just bend and break off. You need to make sure that you are putting it on about the consistency of the plastic nail that you use to apply the gel.<br />3) Don't forget to fix the bottom of the nail tip before you cure. If you don't do this you will have a giant glob of hardened get that you will need to file down.<br />4) If you don't want an ombre effect, you will need to make sure that the thickness is consistent from the top to the bottom of the nail.<br />5) Have a few disposable nail files. The giant one that comes with the kit isn't my favorite because it is quite bulky. I used a few coarse nail files to really get the shape that I wanted.<br /><br />The kit itself is nicely put together, I just wish there were directions with it. You will need to have a lamp, nail file, cuticle cutter, and nail trimmers to accomplish your finished nails which is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5.\nfirst time\nUV LED Nail Lamp Mercase,72W Gel uv light for Fingernail & Toenail Gel Based Polishes \u2013 Portable Nail Curing Light with 36pcs LEDs, 4 Timer Settings & Smart Sensor (White)\nMercase\n{}\nFinally, a UV light that I can fit my entire hand in including my thumb! The first thing I noticed when I took it out of the package was the multiple power ports on the back of the unit. It comes with a cable already to plug into any outlet but I guess if you wanted to use your own cord you could. I ended up plugging my nail drill/file into the back of the unit so I didn't have multiple things to plug into separate outlets. The lights go around the entire inside of the dome so you don't have to worry about your hand being flat. It has 3 different settings on the top for 30/60/90 seconds. I just watched the timer on the top of the unit that counts up every time you put your hand or foot in. I like that the entire unit is plastic and not metal. The light also shuts off when you remove your hand. Very nice and look forward to doing my nails again!\nlarge enough for an entire hand including your thumb\nArgan Magic Color Protection Hair Mask \u2013 Nourishes, Hydrates & Helps to Protect Color Treated Hair | Enriched with Moringa Oil & Botanical Extracts | Made in USA | Paraben Free | Cruelty Free (8 oz)\nArgan Magic\n{'Brand': 'Argan Magic', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Material Feature': 'Natural, Cruelty Free, Paraben Free', 'Hair Type': 'Color Treated', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating', 'Package Dimensions': '4.45 x 4.09 x 3.43 inches; 8 Ounces', 'UPC': '605923470710'}\nSo the container itself isn't very big and I wish there was more. I have bleach blonde hair that is very thin but I have a lot of it. I have to use quite a bit of product to get it to cover my entire head. It is very thick so you really have to use a ton of product. I use it twice a week and let it sit for 10 minutes before washing out. I have noticed that my hair isn't as frizzy and I don't have as many fly aways when I wear my hair up. The scent is very fresh and light; husband approved. My reason for the 4/5 stars is just because I was anticipating much more product than I received.\nI wish there was more\nREBLX Premium Self Tanner Spray - Best Spray Self Tanner for Face and Body - Blend of Premium & Natural Ingredients for Natural Self Tans - No Fake Tan Smell - Sunless Self Tanner Spray for Streak Free Results - Vegan Friendly - Cruelty Free - Made in the US\nREBLX\n{'Item Form': 'Lotion,Spray', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Material Type Free': 'Cruelty-free,Paraben Free,Vegan', 'Brand': 'REBLX', 'Product Benefits': 'Pores,Nourishing,Clean,Anti-aging', 'Package Dimensions': '8.7 x 3.23 x 2.36 inches; 10.23 Ounces', 'UPC': '861259000476'}\nI figured since it was a spray it would be more of a mist.
