I tried this on removing polish from my toenails; generally this is a more stubborn area for polish removal.  It worked okay, but no better than other removers I have tried.  I will use this but I won't repurchase.\nReview Title: Decent but no better than other remover products\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "Crest Whitestrips Premium - Dental Whitening System 28 Strips (14 Upper & 14 Lower for 7 Days) Enamel Safe Formula\nCrest\n[\"Crest Whitestrips whitening power comes from a gel that contains the same enamel-safe ingredient dentists use for tooth whitening. Crest Whitestrips and Crest Whitestrips Premium holds the whitening ingredient against your teeth long enough to get at stains beneath the surface. You'll have visibly whiter teeth in just 14 days with Crest Whitestrips.\"]\n{'Brand': 'Crest', 'Product Benefits': 'Whitening', 'Item Form': 'Strip, Gel', 'Included Components': 'Whitening Strip', 'Flavor': 'Unflavored', 'Package Dimensions': '5.4 x 5.3 x 1.5 inches; 4 Ounces', 'UPC': '037000432579', 'Manufacturer': 'Crest'}\nAfter very minimal and barely noticeable success with whitening toothpastes and gels, I finally decided to give Crest Premium Whitestrips a try.  Previously, I had found the cost to be prohibitive, but the fact that $5 or $7 coupons are offered in our Sunday paper with some regularity made the price a bit easier to swallow.<br /><br />Just like the commercials say, I definitely did begin to see some improvement after about three days.  I would describe the effect as more of a lightening than a whitening per se:  the darker yellow spots on my teeth began to fade and to become less apparent.  Now, after using the product as prescribed for a week, the color of my teeth is clearly improved; I wouldn't say that my teeth are bright white, but they are definitely more of an ivory or a paler yellow color.  According to the package insert, you can immediately begin a second course of treatment for even better whitening effects, but I haven't yet decided if I want to lay out another $30 in order to do this.  Also, I should mention that the effect is not so dramatic thta anyone has noticed (UNLIKE in the commercials!).<br /><br />Now for the caveats.  First of all, I found these strips to be a bit difficult to use.  It can be hard to remove the strips from the protective backing without them becoming mangled, and it is very easy to get the gel on your fingertips (which causes a temporary whitening effect).  Also, the strips are not ideally shaped for your mouth, and I found that they covered my front eight teeth only.  Finally, while the top strip adhered fairly well, I found that the bottom strip was more tricky and tended to slide around, especially if I moved my mouth at all.  The only solution I found to this was to wear the strips while commuting to work, which luckily gave me a 30-minute period when I did not need to talk.  Otherwise, it can be difficult to find a good time to wear the strips, as the insert information advises against wearing them immediately after you brush your teeth, while sleeping, and while you are eating/drinking.<br /><br />Unlike other reviewers, I did not have a problem with the taste of the strips:  I could not detect anything while wearing them, and after taking them off, I thought that the gooey paste left behind was virtually tasteless.  I did experience some sensitivity in a lower tooth which I had capped over 20 years ago.  Although this sensation went away in time, it was uncomforable enough to make me cut the lower strip to fit around this particular tooth.<br /><br />In summary, I did see clear--although not miraculous--results from this product and I would be willing to try the strips again, especially if the price were to come down a bit.  Ultimately, I would rate Crest Whitestrips three and a half stars, as there is definitely room for improvement.\nYes, these really work...but keep a few things in mind\nHoliday Special - Eyes 4 You Eyelash Growth Serum available in 3ml 0.1 Fl Oz.

Without mascara, they are barely noticeable.  I have never before tried an eyelash growth serum and was frankly somewhat skeptical, yet at the same time, I was excited at the thought that this product might be beneficial.<br /><br />This serum is packaged in a tube that looks like mascara.  However, the inner wand ends in a tiny brush that is like a VERY thin paintbrush.  I would have preferred a slightly thicker applicator; the brush was SO small that it was difficult to see the serum for precise application.<br /><br />I followed the instructions for this product, applying nightly along my lash line.  I used this product daily for over a month (since late August).  Unfortunately, I am not able to discern any noticeable results.  I actually took photos, thinking that might show more of a difference, I but do not see any changes in the photos, either.  (It looks like Amazon has finally posted my photos, so you can see what you think for yourself.)<br /><br />The only small improvement I have noticed of late is that AFTER applying my mascara, my lashes seem longer than they normally would with mascara--it's almost as if they are somehow adhering to the mascara better than they would normally.  I'm not 100% sure if this is a real effect, but that possible sign combined with the fact that I didn't have any adverse reactions to this product is the reason why I gave it two stars rather than one.  Perhaps others will have better luck than I did.<br /><br />UPDATED 11/9/14:  Despite my lack of results after one month, I continued to use this product.  It has now been over two months, and I believe that I have seen SOME results.  At this point, my lashes DO appear longer--I think that's why my mascara has seemed to be working better, as my lashes are a bit longer than before.  However, my results have been nothing like the miracles in the photos posted on the product page--yes, my lashes are a bit longer, but the effect is hardly noticeable to the bare eye (I asked my husband, and he didn't notice).  Furthermore, my lashes are neither thicker nor more plentiful; this product gave me a bit of length only, not thickness or any other effect.  So, in summary, I upgraded my review from two to three stars, but I don't feel like I can go beyond that at this time.\nNo noticeable results after over a month - UPDATED 11/9/14\nButecare Eyelash Growth Enhancer & Brow Serum for Long - Amazon Vine\n{'Package Dimensions': '4.5 x 0.9 x 0.9 inches; 0.81 Ounces'}\nMy eyelashes are thin, sparse, and short (like my hair, haha).  I had a eyelash grower product that seemed to work for me before, so I thought I would give this one a try.  My previous one stressed to only apply once per day, before bed; this one encourages you to apply twice per day.  I started with once at bedtime but then began adding mornings too.<br /><br />This definitely seems to work for me!  Now, if you are expecting full, lush lashes, I think that's unlikely--at least that's not what happened for me.  For me, this product added length but not really any fullness.  And the length is mainly noticeable when I use mascara--my lashes actually hold the mascara and look significantly longer.  Also, it only takes a week or two to see results!  My only complaint is that this is a tiny tube, and after just a few weeks, there doesn't seem to be much product left.  Still, overall I really like this product and would recommend it!<br /><br />UPDATE 1/18/19:<br />I am still using this product, although I think I might be getting to the end.  It is still giving me longer lashes.  I attached a photo to provide an idea of how it works for me.  I am wearing mascara for this photo, but even with mascara, my lashes would NOT usually come all the way close to my brows like they are in this photo!  But you can also see that while my lashes are longer, they are still pretty thin/sparse.  Given this, I think this product would work best for those who have thicker but short lashes.\nReally seems to work for me!\nMountain Falls Regular Nail Polish Remover for Natural Nails with Vitamin E and Panthenol, 16 Fluid Ounce\nMountain Falls\n['This nail polish remover is formulated to help soften cuticles and add strength and resiliency for more beautiful nails.
