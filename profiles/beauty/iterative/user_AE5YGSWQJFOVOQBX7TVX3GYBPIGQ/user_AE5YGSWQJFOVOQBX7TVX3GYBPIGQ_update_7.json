I've been working my way around with different cushions seeing what I like. Cushions are nice because they are easy to carry around in a purse due to the compact design. This is a very decent cushion with good coverage. Etude House has never failed me. It also arrived much faster than I thought it would.\nReview Title: Great coverage/ beautiful color \u2747\ufe0f\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
