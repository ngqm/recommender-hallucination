I have tried many of their moisturizers, serums, and facial cleansers and am never disappointed.<br /><br />This is a one ounce glass bottle, pump action. Clear serum.<br /><br />Though I can't know what it does on a cellular level, really, I do know that using Oz products (along with other good skin care products and eating healthfully, along with exercise and good sleep, and genes - really, the stuff we put on our faces is only a part of good skin care) keeps my skin looking good. Many people can't tell my age, and that means I'm doing something right. So since Oz Naturals is also reasonably priced (under $18 at time of this reveiw), I feel good about purchasing it.<br /><br />What I wish is that it were easier to pump - it kind of jets out so it's more difficult to control how much you want.<br /><br />This is not a &#34;luxe feel&#34; type of serum, so be aware of that. It feels more dry (though not drying to your skin-there's just no sits-on-top-of-skin thicker feel that some serums have) after you put it on rather than with that emollient feeling some serums have. That's probably also because of the hydraulic acid quality in it. It's a serum blend of hydraulic acid, vitamin E, retinol, and other ingredients.<br /><br />I use this at night, applying it to my cleansed face. I wait a few minutes and then I apply my moisturizer.<br /><br />Love their product; love their company.\nReview Title: Oz Naturals makes great products.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
