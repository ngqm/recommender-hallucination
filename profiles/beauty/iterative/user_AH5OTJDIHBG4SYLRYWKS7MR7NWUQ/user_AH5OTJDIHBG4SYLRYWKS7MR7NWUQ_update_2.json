(Apparently some of my Pre De Provence products are showing up in one review - so while this reveiw is for bath salts, I have the lavender lotion as well, which I do love the scent of it but as with the bath salts, wish the bottle were nicer).<br /><br />There was no seal on the top of the jar, just the lid. That's fine, but I would wonder how long it would sit on a shelf before purchasing and how &#34;fresh&#34; the scent would last. That said, when I opened the lid and took a whiff, it was pretty powerfully scented. I like the lavender aspect but there's another scent there that I don't like and can't figure out what it is. It's off-putting. It doesn't linger in the water, so that's good.<br /><br />I sprinkled some in my bathroom sink that I'd filled with warm water. The water turned a slight lavender shade as the bath salts turned clear. The salt crystals did melt pretty quickly, though as with any bath salts I've used there are always a few that are stubborn.<br /><br />The water felt soft enough, I suppose-nothing really special, but that strong scent wasn't as apparent in the diluted water.<br /><br />I did think it a bit pricey at just under $17 (at time of this review). For that price, I'd like a glass bottle or something prettier in the jar design itself, though the lavender-colored crystals do look pretty. Still, there are plenty of bath salts out there that are half the price and smell about the same, so what would make me want to purchase this one exclusively? Something that made it attractive to me, and that would be a pretty bottle/jar that I could display in my bathroom in my basket of bath goodies. Or, to give someone as a gift.<br /><br />This plastic jar makes it seem like one of those cheaper jars of bath salts you can buy at Big Lots, which I can do for less than half the price if I want bath salts. Pretty it up some so I feel I'm getting my money's worth. You cold say Pre De Provence has quality ingredients and maybe that's why the price, but I'm not finding it special enough to pay almost $17.\nReview Title: Okay but nothing special.\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "OZNaturals Anti Aging 2.5 Retinol Serum, 30 ml (1 Fl Oz)\nOZ Naturals\n{'Brand': 'OZ Naturals', 'Scent': 'Fragrance Free', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Active Ingredients': 'Vitamin e', 'Unit Count': '1 Fl Oz', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.25 x 1.25 x 4 inches; 1 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'OZ-SE-PR-1009', 'UPC': '816457020108', 'Manufacturer': 'OZ Naturals'}\nOz Naturals is a favorite go-to of mine for beauty products. I have tried many of their moisturizers, serums, and facial cleansers and am never disappointed.<br /><br />This is a one ounce glass bottle, pump action. Clear serum.<br /><br />Though I can't know what it does on a cellular level, really, I do know that using Oz products (along with other good skin care products and eating healthfully, along with exercise and good sleep, and genes - really, the stuff we put on our faces is only a part of good skin care) keeps my skin looking good. Many people can't tell my age, and that means I'm doing something right. So since Oz Naturals is also reasonably priced (under $18 at time of this reveiw), I feel good about purchasing it.<br /><br />What I wish is that it were easier to pump - it kind of jets out so it's more difficult to control how much you want.<br /><br />This is not a &#34;luxe feel&#34; type of serum, so be aware of that. It feels more dry (though not drying to your skin-there's just no sits-on-top-of-skin thicker feel that some serums have) after you put it on rather than with that emollient feeling some serums have. That's probably also because of the hydraulic acid quality in it. It's a serum blend of hydraulic acid, vitamin E, retinol, and other ingredients.<br /><br />I use this at night, applying it to my cleansed face. I wait a few minutes and then I apply my moisturizer.<br /><br />Love their product; love their company.\nOz Naturals makes great products.\nPre De Provence Maison French Lavender Bath Salts\nPre de Provence\n['Rejuvenate your senses and sooth your muscles with a restorative bath of aromatic Mediteranean Sea Salts.
