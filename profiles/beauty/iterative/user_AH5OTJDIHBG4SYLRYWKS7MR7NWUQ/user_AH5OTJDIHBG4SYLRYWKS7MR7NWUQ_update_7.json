It feels amazing going on my skin and smooths on very well\u2014there\u2019s no dragging feeling or feeling as if I have to apply more for good coverage.<br /><br />This feels and looks like a moisturizer rather than a clear serum, so you could use it alone, I suppose, but I apply it in the morning (it does read that it\u2019s a sunrise serum!) and enjoy my coffee, letting it fully absorb into my skin, and then apply my moisturizer. It leaves no sticky or \u2018tacky\u2019 feeling.<br /><br />I have sensitive skin with slight rocasea and this serum did not irritate my skin, cause any redness, stinging, or itching. It left my skin feeling soft, and there was a glow to my skin as well, not like a highlighter glow, but a healthy sheen to it, a clean skin healthy glow/sheen.<br /><br />It has resveratrol, which is an antioxidant agent\u2014in a plant, resveratrol \u2018attacks\u2019 bacteria or fungi that is attacking the plant, so the idea behind it in skincare is for resveratrol to \u2018attack\u2019 bad elements in our environment to keep our skin healthier.<br /><br />I can\u2019t comment on what it really is doing on a cellular level, and it\u2019s difficult to determine what it will do for my skin over weeks, but when I try out serums to review (and I\u2019ve tried out a LOT of them!), I go by: can I afford it: yes!; does it glide over my skin easily and nicely: yes!; is it emollient: yes! does my skin feel amazing afterwards: yes! does my skin immediately look better in any way: yes! Is it irritating my skin: no!<br /><br />If you are looking for a serum that isn\u2019t expensive\u2014$22 at time of this review, which is as good a price or better than many L\u2019oreal Serums you find in the drugstore\u2014and want something that feels great going on, won\u2019t upset your skin, and leaves a healthy glow, then this is one to try.<br /><br />I hope my review helped you today.\nReview Title: Nice healthy glow to my skin\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "OZNaturals Anti Aging 2.5 Retinol Serum, 30 ml (1 Fl Oz)\nOZ Naturals\n{'Brand': 'OZ Naturals', 'Scent': 'Fragrance Free', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Active Ingredients': 'Vitamin e', 'Unit Count': '1 Fl Oz', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.25 x 1.25 x 4 inches; 1 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'OZ-SE-PR-1009', 'UPC': '816457020108', 'Manufacturer': 'OZ Naturals'}\nOz Naturals is a favorite go-to of mine for beauty products. I have tried many of their moisturizers, serums, and facial cleansers and am never disappointed.<br /><br />This is a one ounce glass bottle, pump action. Clear serum.<br /><br />Though I can't know what it does on a cellular level, really, I do know that using Oz products (along with other good skin care products and eating healthfully, along with exercise and good sleep, and genes - really, the stuff we put on our faces is only a part of good skin care) keeps my skin looking good. Many people can't tell my age, and that means I'm doing something right. So since Oz Naturals is also reasonably priced (under $18 at time of this reveiw), I feel good about purchasing it.<br /><br />What I wish is that it were easier to pump - it kind of jets out so it's more difficult to control how much you want.<br /><br />This is not a &#34;luxe feel&#34; type of serum, so be aware of that. It feels more dry (though not drying to your skin-there's just no sits-on-top-of-skin thicker feel that some serums have) after you put it on rather than with that emollient feeling some serums have. That's probably also because of the hydraulic acid quality in it. It's a serum blend of hydraulic acid, vitamin E, retinol, and other ingredients.<br /><br />I use this at night, applying it to my cleansed face. I wait a few minutes and then I apply my moisturizer.<br /><br />Love their product; love their company.\nOz Naturals makes great products.\nPre De Provence Maison French Lavender Bath Salts\nPre de Provence\n['Rejuvenate your senses and sooth your muscles with a restorative bath of aromatic Mediteranean Sea Salts. We have added our pure essential oils to enhnace your perfect bath and relax your mind.']\n{'Brand': 'Pre de Provence', 'Scent': 'Lavender', 'Product Benefits': 'Detox,Rejuvenate', 'Unit Count': '19.0 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2 x 2 x 6 inches; 1.2 Pounds', 'Item model number': '35415BS', 'UPC': '612082765328', 'Manufacturer': 'EUROPEAN SOAPS (EURAQ)'}\nA plastic jar full of lavender-colored and -scented bath salts. (Apparently some of my Pre De Provence products are showing up in one review - so while this reveiw is for bath salts, I have the lavender lotion as well, which I do love the scent of it but as with the bath salts, wish the bottle were nicer).<br /><br />There was no seal on the top of the jar, just the lid. That's fine, but I would wonder how long it would sit on a shelf before purchasing and how &#34;fresh&#34; the scent would last. That said, when I opened the lid and took a whiff, it was pretty powerfully scented. I like the lavender aspect but there's another scent there that I don't like and can't figure out what it is. It's off-putting. It doesn't linger in the water, so that's good.<br /><br />I sprinkled some in my bathroom sink that I'd filled with warm water. The water turned a slight lavender shade as the bath salts turned clear. The salt crystals did melt pretty quickly, though as with any bath salts I've used there are always a few that are stubborn.<br /><br />The water felt soft enough, I suppose-nothing really special, but that strong scent wasn't as apparent in the diluted water.<br /><br />I did think it a bit pricey at just under $17 (at time of this review). For that price, I'd like a glass bottle or something prettier in the jar design itself, though the lavender-colored crystals do look pretty. Still, there are plenty of bath salts out there that are half the price and smell about the same, so what would make me want to purchase this one exclusively? Something that made it attractive to me, and that would be a pretty bottle/jar that I could display in my bathroom in my basket of bath goodies. Or, to give someone as a gift.<br /><br />This plastic jar makes it seem like one of those cheaper jars of bath salts you can buy at Big Lots, which I can do for less than half the price if I want bath salts. Pretty it up some so I feel I'm getting my money's worth. You cold say Pre De Provence has quality ingredients and maybe that's why the price, but I'm not finding it special enough to pay almost $17.\nOkay but nothing special.\nAnti-Aging Hydrating Serum with Natural Mango Micro-beads, Vitamins E and C, Natural and Organic Plant Extracts, Paraben-Free, 30 ml, Made in France, Phytema\nPHYTEMA\n['Anti-Aging Hydrating Serum with Natural Mango Micro-beads, Vitamins E and C, Natural and Organic Plant Extracts, Paraben-Free, 30 ml, Made in France, Phytema']\n{'Brand': 'PHYTEMA', 'Material Feature': 'Organic, Natural', 'Item Volume': '30 Milliliters', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.8 x 1.4 x 1.4 inches; 4.23 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'PHYTEMA'}\nWhen I first looked at this Phytema Anti-Aging Hydrating Serum, I thought it looked so weird for a serum, and then, when I put a little on my skin, I wasn\u2019t so sure I was going to like it at all.  My first reaction was that I didn\u2019t want to use it. Not only did it feel a little thick and sticky, there were those micro-beads in there that felt strange for a serum. I honestly thought, at first, that maybe I\u2019d received a facial wash with scrubbing beads, but when I added water to it, it didn\u2019t lather or foam.<br /><br />I looked up the product online and found the French company who makes this serum and other beauty products. I was a little reassured so I decided to give it another try.<br /><br />I applied a little of the serum on the back of my right hand. What amazed me is that once it sinked into my skin, the skin of my right hand took on a glow. I\u2019m a skeptic when it comes to beauty products\u2014the claims companies make don\u2019t often pan out or are exaggerated\u2014but I could see it, and still do, that glow/illumination on my right hand versus my left hand, and over 30 minutes later it is still there. I love that glowing aspect of it.<br /><br />As for softness, I really don\u2019t see any difference from this product and others but that doesn\u2019t bother me. What I am interested in is how it is illuminating my skin as advertised. As for what other claims the company says the serum does, that\u2019s a little more difficult to determine except with continued use over time, but if I like how a serum feels and if it gives my skin that glow, then I\u2019m happy enough to try it and see what happens.<br /><br />There is no irritation to my skin, no burning, itching, redness.<br /><br />The beads do soften onto the skin as you apply it. Here\u2019s what the company says about how to apply (which is kind of a weird different way to apply it-I still want to do the circular thing!): \u2018Apply with the flat of the hand, without making circular motions, but starting from the middle of the face towards the outside of the face, to explode the jojoba micro-beads and to release the vitamins E and C on your skin.\u2019<br /><br />It is a little difficult to apply a serum onto your face with the flat of your hand, but I did try patting it with my fingers and that worked better.<br /><br />It will feel sticky when you first apply it, and you can feel those beads. However, the stickiness goes away and the beads do melt onto your skin.<br /><br />The price isn\u2019t shown on Amazon. I looked up the price on the company\u2019s website and it\u2019s $49.90 Francs (I am assuming it\u2019s Francs), and that\u2019s only about $8 in American dollars. So I don\u2019t know what the final price will be here on Amazon or how they\u2019ll do that. I\u2019d pay a decent price for this serum just for that glow.<br /><br />It is advertised to be partially organic and mostly natural. The company\u2019s advert reads: \u201899.85% natural ingredients of which 28.79% organic. Phytema \u2122 Skincare Radiance Serum is an ultra-concentrated anti-aging, anti-radical & anti-stain active ingredient. All the effectiveness of white mulberry, cucumber and bearberry, to prevent and fade pigment spots. Natural smoothing agents provide an immediate tightening effect to your face. No phenoxyethanol, no silicone, no paraben.\u2019<br /><br />I\u2019m willing to give this serum a try, and this company I\u2019ve not heard of, Phytema, a try.\nA different approach to my skincare\nTRESemm\u00e9 Botanique Shampoo and Conditioner Four Pack, Nourish & Replenish, 88 oz\nTRESemm\u00e9\n{'Material Type Free': 'paraben free,dye free', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Brand': 'TRESemm\u00e9', 'Scent': 'prafum', 'Special Ingredients': 'Coconut-oil,Aloe-vera', 'Product Dimensions': '14.75 x 9.88 x 3.56 inches; 6.8 Pounds', 'UPC': '022400002248'}\nThis is a LOT of shampoo and conditioner\u2014two huge bottles of each for a total of four bottles\u2014so if you like them, then you\u2019ll be happy. I put one of each down in the guest room.<br /><br />What I like the best about this shampoo is the scent. Really pleasant, and for me, not too strong. It\u2019s a lovely scent that\u2019s not too coconutty. The scent of it would have me use it just to have my hair smell great.<br /><br />As for what it does and how it works: I don\u2019t find this shampoo to be any better than many shampoos I use\u2014I have my favorites that I regularly use that work well with my hair. This Tresemme Botanique shampoo and conditioner didn\u2019t weight down my super baby fine hair, so that was great. My hair was shiny afterwards, so that was great as well.<br /><br />It\u2019s a good shampoo with a nice scent that cleansed and conditioned my hair decently.<br /><br />One thing I wish\u2014since the bottles are so big, a pump dispenser would have been so much easier to use. I think I will pour some of each into a smaller bottle with a pump dispenser and put the bigger bottles in the cabinet. They really are way too big to sit in my shower/tub area. It\u2019s kind of like they are for refillable bottles.<br /><br />If you like the Tresemme brand, then you\u2019ll be happy with this shampoo and conditioner. The price is reasonable for how much you are receiving, the scent is lovely, and it does a decent job of cleansing your hair (there are an awful lot of suds lathering, so I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s good or bad).\nLovely scent.\nMountain Falls Regular Nail Polish Remover for Natural Nails with Vitamin E and Panthenol, 16 Fluid Ounce\nMountain Falls\n['This nail polish remover is formulated to help soften cuticles and add strength and resiliency for more beautiful nails. Trust this product to quickly and gently care for your nails.']\n{'Brand': 'Mountain Falls', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Item Weight': '1.1 Pounds', 'Unit Count': '16 Fl Oz', 'Package Dimensions': '8 x 2.5 x 2.5 inches; 1.1 Pounds', 'Manufacturer': 'Vi-Jon'}\nThis is a huge bottle of Mountain Falls nail polish remover (16oz). At $5.99, I don\u2019t find that unreasonable as this bottle will likely last me years. Though I only polish my toenails and not my fingernails so I don\u2019t use as much as those who regularly polish their fingernails along with their toenails.<br /><br />The scent isn\u2019t overwhelming and that\u2019s a plus. None of them are going to smell good\u2014wouldn\u2019t that be nice, to have a nail polish remover that smelled spiced or like your favorite body lotion or body spray!<br /><br />What surprised me the most is how effectively it removed some black nail polish I had on my toes that I\u2019d done for Halloween. I\u2019d done my fingers too and the generic polish I had took a few more swipes and wipes than this Mountain Falls. The MFalls took it off in one wipe! So, it\u2019ll be replacing the other generic I had - bye-bye!<br /><br />What would also be really cool along with nail polish that smelled good is if the top of the applicators were smaller so you could squeeze out or pour out a little less\u2014I often drench my tissue or cotton ball.<br /><br />All in all, this is a good generic/Amazon brand product. I\u2019d recommend it if you use a lot of polish remover. A big 16 ounces will last a good while. For me, this bottle is a little too large, but it\u2019ll sure last me a long long time.\nTook off black nail polish in one wipe!\nRUGGED & DAPPER Core Regimen Travel Kit, Includes Age Defense Facial Moisturizer, Daily Scrub Face Wash, Body Wash plus Shampoo and Organic Lip Balm\nRUGGED & DAPPER\n{'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Brand': 'RUGGED & DAPPER', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Number of Items': '4', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.8 x 4.7 x 1.5 inches; 8.01 Ounces', 'UPC': '862332000420'}\nFor Christmas I\u2019d bought my guy the Rugged & Dapper candle that smelled like a walk in the forest in the winter! I wanted to keep it for myself, it smelled so good. He loves it.<br /><br />So, I ordered this travel-sized set for him to try. He\u2019s a kind of wash-and-go guy but I this set will be a nice set for him to try out something new.<br /><br />Do note these bottles are small\u2014they are travel-sized; think travel or sample sized. They won\u2019t last long. This is a starter set or something you do take to travel with.<br /><br />There is a shampoo/body wash, a facial scrub, facial moisturizer, and a lip balm.<br /><br />The shampoo and body wash has almost the same type of scent as the candle\u2014not as spruce tree forward but it does have a pine-y woodsy scent. I see other reviews compare it to floor cleaner but I like the scent\u2014the reason people may think that is the pine scent may remind some of some types of floor cleaner, but for me it is a fresh woodsy-pine-scent.<br /><br />The facial scrub has tiny beads in it. The scent isn\u2019t quite as apparent in the scrub as it is in the shampoo/body wash. It does have an exfoliating quality to it.<br /><br />The moisturizer is unscented. It\u2019s a light moisturizer. It\u2019d be good for my guy in winter when our air is particularly dry.<br /><br />I like the lip balm a lot. It\u2019s very emollient and feels super good going on (I tried it!) It has a cool refreshing feel to it after you apply it. Really nice lip balm.<br /><br />I think my bf will like this set a lot to try out using specialized skin care products instead of just using soap on his face and go.<br /><br />Rugged & Dapper is a little on the pricy side for someone who\u2019s doesn\u2019t follow a skin-care regime so I don\u2019t know that he\u2019d purchase these items again; however, the price isn\u2019t all that bad for someone who does regularly use specialty skin-care products.<br /><br />He\u2019ll enjoy this set, but if he does not like something, I\u2019ll come back to report that here.<br /><br />I hope my review helped you today.\nA nice little starter, or travel, set\nSERUM By MERLOT - RESVERATROL - NATURAL ANTI-AGING - DAMAGE CORRECTOR - BOOST COLLAGEN - 1 FL OZ. - DARK CIRCLE CORRECTOR -\nMerlot\n{'Product Benefits': 'Anti-Aging', 'Scent': 'Unscented', 'Brand': 'Merlot', 'Item Form': 'Serum', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '4.6 x 0.8 x 0.8 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '860219000945'}\nThis Serum by MERLOT is a thick white cream, though it is a serum and not a moisturizer (it will moisturizer your skin, however!).<br /><br />Pump out just a little and apply to face, throat, chest, and then the rest can be rubbed into your hands.<br /><br />The fruity scent at first I thought would interfere with my morning coffee\u2014I usually use unscented before I have my coffee, but it didn\u2019t overpower and it dissipates quickly.<br /><br />This morning, I washed my face with a little Erno Laszlo cleansing oil as I usually do, patted dry, then applied a little of this Merlot serum.
