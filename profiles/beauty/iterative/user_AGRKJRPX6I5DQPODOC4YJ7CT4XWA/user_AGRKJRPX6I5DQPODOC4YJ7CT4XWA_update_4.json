0.49 Ounces', 'UPC': '780682649574'}\nWhat I was expecting to get with this was not what I actually got...<br />Still, the real problem is that this hair accessory requires a lot of work, yet produces only a very casual result.<br /><br />The set itself consists of: scrunchy with hair attached to it, a small black elastic tie, and some black hair clips.<br />In order to use it, you put your hair up in a bun with the elastic tie, pull the scrunchy over the bun, then secure it with the pins as needed.<br /><br />The biggest issues I had with this set were the overall quality and the difficulty of use.<br />It also won't be much help to those with very thin/sparse hair because it only makes the end of your hair look longer/thicker, while doing nothing much for your scalp or hairline.<br />You also need enough hair to form a small bun to begin with, which limits the number of women who will be able to wear it at all.<br /><br />The color I selected was a light brown that matches my hair well enough to wear,<br />though not well enough to make it disappear into my hair style completely.<br />Since you are ordering from a photograph, you have to simply use your best guess to decide what the right color for you would be.<br /><br />Other concerns include that fact that the scrunchy shed several strands of hair pretty quickly and the accessories are very chintzy.<br />More likely than not, you will need/want to use your own pins to secure your bun before you add the scrunch element.<br />Personally, I had to fuss with this a lot to get it to look right and stay put; however, I am not naturally gifted in the art of coiffuring, so that may be a reflection on me, as much as the scrunchy itself.<br /><br />In the end, I would definitely not recommend this for a formal occasion because it does look very tousled and I doubt that is something you can change.<br />If you are someone who likes to play with your hair, this might be a fun way to create the illusion of fuller hair.<br />Personally, I would rather this set either be easier to use, since it would most likely be used on casual days, or be more amendable to formal hairstyles, so that investing the effort of getting it to look good would feel more worthwhile.\nDefinitely casual and a bit tricky\nFacial Steamer with Portable Mini Cold Facial Mister, Face Steamer for Facial Deep Cleaning, Nano Ionic Face Hot Steaming Machine for Home Facials Personal Moisturizing Skincare Beauty\nROSEFEAST\n{'Material': 'Cotton', 'Brand': 'ROSEFEAST', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Product Benefits': 'Cold,Moisturizing,Relaxing,Clean,Aromatherapy', 'Package Dimensions': '8.31 x 7.87 x 4.57 inches;
