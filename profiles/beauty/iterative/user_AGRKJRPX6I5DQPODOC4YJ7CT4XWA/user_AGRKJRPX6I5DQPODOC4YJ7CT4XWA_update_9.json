3.2 Pounds', 'UPC': '601202246434'}\nI got these to help apply body oil, but ended up using them for that and more.<br />They are great for cleaning if you like to use your own homemade products or just like to buy refill for products without wrestling with those chintzy plastic bottles.<br />I particularly like that glass is pretty much chemically neutral, so you don't have worry about these breaking down or interacting with what you put in them.<br /><br />Of course because they are glass, they can break, but the fact that they are glass is more of a positive for me than a negative.\nWide range of uses, very nice addition to almost any household\nMessy Bun Hair Piece Scrunchy Hair Extensions Tousled Updo Ponytail With Synthetic Hair Elastic Rubber Band Accessories Light Warm Brown\nAileam\n{'Package Dimensions': '4.3 x 4.2 x 1.2 inches; 0.49 Ounces', 'UPC': '780682649574'}\nWhat I was expecting to get with this was not what I actually got...<br />Still, the real problem is that this hair accessory requires a lot of work, yet produces only a very casual result.<br /><br />The set itself consists of: scrunchy with hair attached to it, a small black elastic tie, and some black hair clips.<br />In order to use it, you put your hair up in a bun with the elastic tie, pull the scrunchy over the bun, then secure it with the pins as needed.<br /><br />The biggest issues I had with this set were the overall quality and the difficulty of use.<br />It also won't be much help to those with very thin/sparse hair because it only makes the end of your hair look longer/thicker, while doing nothing much for your scalp or hairline.<br />You also need enough hair to form a small bun to begin with, which limits the number of women who will be able to wear it at all.<br /><br />The color I selected was a light brown that matches my hair well enough to wear,<br />though not well enough to make it disappear into my hair style completely.<br />Since you are ordering from a photograph, you have to simply use your best guess to decide what the right color for you would be.<br /><br />Other concerns include that fact that the scrunchy shed several strands of hair pretty quickly and the accessories are very chintzy.<br />More likely than not, you will need/want to use your own pins to secure your bun before you add the scrunch element.<br />Personally, I had to fuss with this a lot to get it to look right and stay put; however, I am not naturally gifted in the art of coiffuring, so that may be a reflection on me, as much as the scrunchy itself.<br /><br />In the end, I would definitely not recommend this for a formal occasion because it does look very tousled and I doubt that is something you can change.<br />If you are someone who likes to play with your hair, this might be a fun way to create the illusion of fuller hair.<br />Personally, I would rather this set either be easier to use, since it would most likely be used on casual days, or be more amendable to formal hairstyles, so that investing the effort of getting it to look good would feel more worthwhile.\nDefinitely casual and a bit tricky\nFacial Steamer with Portable Mini Cold Facial Mister, Face Steamer for Facial Deep Cleaning, Nano Ionic Face Hot Steaming Machine for Home Facials Personal Moisturizing Skincare Beauty\nROSEFEAST\n{'Material': 'Cotton', 'Brand': 'ROSEFEAST', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Product Benefits': 'Cold,Moisturizing,Relaxing,Clean,Aromatherapy', 'Package Dimensions': '8.31 x 7.87 x 4.57 inches; 1.57 Pounds', 'Manufacturer': 'ROSEFEAST'}\nIt took a while to get this review together because there was a lot to unpack with this steamer and all the little extras that came with it; however, what stood out most was how fast and powerful the steamer itself was.<br />If you were thinking you'd be waiting around a few minutes for this thing to start producing steam, chances are you will be pleasantly surprised by how little time it takes for the device to start pushing out huge clouds of steam.<br /><br />While the instructions that come with this set are detailed, using the device itself is fairly straightforward.<br />Simply be aware that the steamer needs to be plugged in to work; moreover,  you will probably want to sit during its operation so that you can lean over it for a few minutes at a time.<br />That means you'll want to find a place where you can use the steamer comfortably, like a vanity or desk.<br /><br />Other things to keep in mind as you consider buying this.<br />- The handheld, portable, rechargeable device is a mister, not a steamer. This wasn't completely clear on the product page, so I want to make note of it. Basically, the mister is a nice thing you can use to cool down and refresh your skin on the go.<br />- Packaging suggests two different types of water for the steamer and mister respectively.<br />  - steamer = distilled water<br />  - mister = mineral water<br />- The steamer's cord is about 2.5 feet long, which is something you will want to consider when decided where you will be most likely to use the steamer.<br />- The little extras like the headband with ears and the pore clearing tools make this a great gift to give someone who enjoys getting and giving facials.<br />- The manufacturer warns that acne which is hormonal in nature will not respond to the steamer<br />- The instructions also advise you not to use the steamer everyday, nor more than 10 minutes at a time. Accordingly, this is not something that is likely to add a lot of time to your daily routine, but rather something you will use once or twice a week.<br />- The steamer itself is cute and compact, so you're not giving up a huge amount of space if you get one, nor do you necessarily have to hide it in between uses, unless you want to.<br />- The steam produced is hot/warm and there is no way to control the temperature; however, you can easily regulate how you experience the heat simply by adjusting the proximity of your face to the steamer.<br /><br />Overall, I would definitely recommend this facial steamer set as a purchase for yourself or as a gift for someone else who enjoys giving/getting spa treatments at home.<br />I personally like the effect it had on my skin; I felt as though using it has helped with both the cleansing and hydration of my skin.<br />Once you get through all the instructions, procure the right type of water for your steamer, and identify where you want to set it up, you will be rewarded with an easy to use machine that produces copious amounts of steam very rapidly\nQuick and powerful\nDEROL Lip Plumper, Lip Plumping Lip Gloss, Derol Lip Enhancer, Lip Care serum, Hydrating & Moisturizing Clear Lip Gloss, Tingling Lip Plumper Fuller And Maximizer\u2026\nDEROL\n{'Brand': 'DEROL', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating', 'Item Volume': '5.5 Milliliters', 'Package Information': 'Bottle', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2.32 x 0.7 x 0.7 inches; 0.32 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'AB-11', 'UPC': '735314440425'}\nThis lip treatment arrives in a well sealed package and is in an attractive container. The liquid in the container is clear and has a sponge top applicator. After I applied the liquid it started to feel prickly as if I had eaten a bit of hot pepper. The taste is a bit bitter and I should emphasize that it was not horrible, but it was there.<br />  Did the lips look plumper, they seemed to be, but I am Not sure I will use it again.\nSpicy item\nPurple Shampoo and Conditioner Set - Sulfate Free Salon Grade (2 x 16.9 fl oz) - Hydrating Toner - Shimmer Correction for Platinum Blonde, Silver, Light, and Grey Hair - New Formula\nBELLISSO\n{'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Shine,Restoring,Nourishing', 'Brand': 'BELLISSO', 'Hair Type': 'Color', 'Scent': 'Green Tea,Natural', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Package Dimensions': '8.86 x 6.02 x 3.11 inches; 2.91 Pounds', 'UPC': '765066671129'}\nMy hair is thin,  light gray, and very fine, so I am always looking for a shampoo that will help with these issues. Purple shampoo aims to prevent the yellow cast that you sometimes see on gray hair, but it didn't give my hair any odd blue look. The shampoo is a very dark purple color, but it did not stain the shower, the conditioner is a much lighter color.<br />  Both the shampoo and conditioner have little or no fragrance, the shampoo suds well in hard water and rinses easily. The bottle are attractive pump units that were easy to use in the shower. Persons with blonde or gray hair will find these products useful to prevent that brassy look.\nA product with a useful purpose\nProfessional Nail Drill Machine, Gugusure Anti-Drop 35000 RPM Rechargeable Nail Drill Machine for Acrylic Nails, Gel, Manicure, Portable Electric Cordless Efile Nail Drill Kit for Salon and Home DIY\nGugusure\n{'Brand': 'Gugusure', 'Material': 'Aluminum', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Maximum Rotational Speed': '35000 RPM', 'Package Dimensions': '8.15 x 6.5 x 2.24 inches; 1.46 Pounds', 'Manufacturer': 'gugusure company'}\nThis drill is POWERFUL!<br />And I mean that both in the sense of how fast and strong the drill is, as well as how long the battery pack lasts.<br /><br />I have a rechargeable nail drill that I like, but it doesn't always work as fast or as long as I hope, so I was curious to see how this would compare.<br />Well, I was blown away.<br />This is like a rechargeable drill on steroids.<br /><br />To be clear, there is still a wire connecting the drill to the power source/control panel.<br />While that cord is not a huge problem, it does handle differently than the rechargeable nail drills that are a single unit.<br />That being said, for me the trade off in power you get makes the two piece design well worth it.<br /><br />One thing to consider before committing to this nail drill, which is AMAZING, is that as the saying goes, \"With great power comes great responsibility\".<br />Put another way, you need to be very careful when using this nail drill, particularly on the highest setting.<br />This drill can turn fast enough to: quickly heat up your nails, file right through acrylic and natural nail material, get away from you and damage the skin around your nail.<br />Basically, you need to respect the power of this drill when you are using it, particularly when you start out learning how to handle it.<br /><br />Other things I really like about this drill:<br />- The remaining charge is digitally displayed on the battery portions, so you know exactly how much power you have let<br />- You select the power level with a dial; this allows you to adjust the rotation of your drill very precisely<br />- You get a wide range of attachments that cover almost anything you would want to do with your nail drill<br />- Charges with a standard USB cord, which is included (you need to provide an adapter or USB port)<br />- You change the nail bits by locking and unlocking them with a twist release; I find this is easier and makes for a more secure hold of the bits than the drill bits that rely on a simple push/pull mechanism<br />- Reverses direction quickly and easily<br /><br />I definitely recommend this nail drill if you are in the market for one.<br />It is extremely powerful, has a broad range of speeds, allows you precision control of speed, has a long battery life, let's you know exactly how much charge is left, and comes with a great selection of accessories.\nWHOA!\nLiquid Foundation Makeup Sunscreen 2 Pcs 35ml Waterproof Oil Control Moisturizing Lightweight Non Stick Concealer Foundation for Face and Body in Glass Bottle with 2 Pcs Black Makeup Sponge\nMarine Forest\n{'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Finish Type': 'Natural', 'Package Information': 'Bottle', 'Brand': 'Marine Forest', 'Coverage': 'Light', 'Package Dimensions': '8.11 x 5.91 x 2.36 inches; 8.78 Ounces', 'UPC': '729843448380'}\nI included a half make-up, half naked skin photo, taken with my phones portrait filter off, to give you some sense of how this foundation looks.<br />I was fortunate in that the time I spent studying the shades on the product page paid off with a pretty spot on color match for my skin, which had me very excited.<br /><br />Regarding how the make-up went on, I actually found I got better results applying it with my finger than I did with the included make-up sponge.<br />I know using a sponge is better for your skin, but I found it just kept blending the foundation right off my face.<br />Whether that was a result of how I applied it, the foundation itself, and/or the sponge is up for debate.<br />Since you get two sponges included with the two bottles of make-up, you can experiment and decide what application method works best for you.<br />Side note, this is way too thick to be air brushed on and can't be diluted, so if you use an airbrush, this foundation probably isn't for you.<br /><br />Regarding how the foundation looked and felt, I would say, standard.<br />This reminded me of pretty much every good quality foundation I have ever tried.<br />- It looks best after you first put it on<br />- It covers many, but not all marks and discoloration<br />- As the end of the day approaches, it starts to look \"fatigued\"<br />- It will wipe off on hands, clothing, etc... if you rub your face<br />- You need to put some effort into getting all traces of the foundation cleaned off at the end of the day<br />- For best results, you'll probably want to pair it with a spot concealer and finishing powder<br /><br />Overall, this is a solid foundation that performs well, but is not exceptional.<br />If you get a good match to your skin tone like I did, I suspect you will be very pleased with this make-up set.<br />In the end, I would definitely recommend this, so long as you understand this is not the ultimate fix all your problems, find your prince, do your taxes, and make you smarter miracle in a bottle all foundations claim to be, but instead, a quality make-up that will give you good coverage.\nGot a perfect color match with decent coverage\nNACOLUS Gentle Soothing Exfoliating Gloves Professional Korean exfoliating mitt,Two-sided Use skin exfoliator for body,Dead Skin Exfoliating Gloves for softer & smoother skin Chemical free ,Pink\nNACOLUS\n{'Brand': 'NACOLUS', 'Skin Type': 'Acne Prone', 'Product Benefits': 'Exfoliating', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Material Type Free': 'Chemical Free', 'Product Dimensions': '8.66 x 5.9 x 0.12 inches;
