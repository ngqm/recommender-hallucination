3.2 Pounds', 'UPC': '601202246434'}\nI got these to help apply body oil, but ended up using them for that and more.<br />They are great for cleaning if you like to use your own homemade products or just like to buy refill for products without wrestling with those chintzy plastic bottles.<br />I particularly like that glass is pretty much chemically neutral, so you don't have worry about these breaking down or interacting with what you put in them.<br /><br />Of course because they are glass, they can break, but the fact that they are glass is more of a positive for me than a negative.\nWide range of uses, very nice addition to almost any household\nMessy Bun Hair Piece Scrunchy Hair Extensions Tousled Updo Ponytail With Synthetic Hair Elastic Rubber Band Accessories Light Warm Brown\nAileam\n{'Package Dimensions': '4.3 x 4.2 x 1.2 inches; 0.49 Ounces', 'UPC': '780682649574'}\nWhat I was expecting to get with this was not what I actually got...<br />Still, the real problem is that this hair accessory requires a lot of work, yet produces only a very casual result.<br /><br />The set itself consists of: scrunchy with hair attached to it, a small black elastic tie, and some black hair clips.<br />In order to use it, you put your hair up in a bun with the elastic tie, pull the scrunchy over the bun, then secure it with the pins as needed.<br /><br />The biggest issues I had with this set were the overall quality and the difficulty of use.<br />It also won't be much help to those with very thin/sparse hair because it only makes the end of your hair look longer/thicker, while doing nothing much for your scalp or hairline.<br />You also need enough hair to form a small bun to begin with, which limits the number of women who will be able to wear it at all.<br /><br />The color I selected was a light brown that matches my hair well enough to wear,<br />though not well enough to make it disappear into my hair style completely.<br />Since you are ordering from a photograph, you have to simply use your best guess to decide what the right color for you would be.<br /><br />Other concerns include that fact that the scrunchy shed several strands of hair pretty quickly and the accessories are very chintzy.<br />More likely than not, you will need/want to use your own pins to secure your bun before you add the scrunch element.<br />Personally, I had to fuss with this a lot to get it to look right and stay put; however, I am not naturally gifted in the art of coiffuring, so that may be a reflection on me, as much as the scrunchy itself.<br /><br />In the end, I would definitely not recommend this for a formal occasion because it does look very tousled and I doubt that is something you can change.<br />If you are someone who likes to play with your hair, this might be a fun way to create the illusion of fuller hair.<br />Personally, I would rather this set either be easier to use, since it would most likely be used on casual days, or be more amendable to formal hairstyles, so that investing the effort of getting it to look good would feel more worthwhile.\nDefinitely casual and a bit tricky\nFacial Steamer with Portable Mini Cold Facial Mister, Face Steamer for Facial Deep Cleaning, Nano Ionic Face Hot Steaming Machine for Home Facials Personal Moisturizing Skincare Beauty\nROSEFEAST\n{'Material': 'Cotton', 'Brand': 'ROSEFEAST', 'Power Source': 'Corded Electric', 'Product Benefits': 'Cold,Moisturizing,Relaxing,Clean,Aromatherapy', 'Package Dimensions': '8.31 x 7.87 x 4.57 inches; 1.57 Pounds', 'Manufacturer': 'ROSEFEAST'}\nIt took a while to get this review together because there was a lot to unpack with this steamer and all the little extras that came with it; however, what stood out most was how fast and powerful the steamer itself was.<br />If you were thinking you'd be waiting around a few minutes for this thing to start producing steam, chances are you will be pleasantly surprised by how little time it takes for the device to start pushing out huge clouds of steam.<br /><br />While the instructions that come with this set are detailed, using the device itself is fairly straightforward.<br />Simply be aware that the steamer needs to be plugged in to work; moreover,  you will probably want to sit during its operation so that you can lean over it for a few minutes at a time.<br />That means you'll want to find a place where you can use the steamer comfortably, like a vanity or desk.<br /><br />Other things to keep in mind as you consider buying this.<br />- The handheld, portable, rechargeable device is a mister, not a steamer. This wasn't completely clear on the product page, so I want to make note of it. Basically, the mister is a nice thing you can use to cool down and refresh your skin on the go.<br />- Packaging suggests two different types of water for the steamer and mister respectively.<br />  - steamer = distilled water<br />  - mister = mineral water<br />- The steamer's cord is about 2.5 feet long, which is something you will want to consider when decided where you will be most likely to use the steamer.<br />- The little extras like the headband with ears and the pore clearing tools make this a great gift to give someone who enjoys getting and giving facials.<br />- The manufacturer warns that acne which is hormonal in nature will not respond to the steamer<br />- The instructions also advise you not to use the steamer everyday, nor more than 10 minutes at a time. Accordingly, this is not something that is likely to add a lot of time to your daily routine, but rather something you will use once or twice a week.<br />- The steamer itself is cute and compact, so you're not giving up a huge amount of space if you get one, nor do you necessarily have to hide it in between uses, unless you want to.<br />- The steam produced is hot/warm and there is no way to control the temperature; however, you can easily regulate how you experience the heat simply by adjusting the proximity of your face to the steamer.<br /><br />Overall, I would definitely recommend this facial steamer set as a purchase for yourself or as a gift for someone else who enjoys giving/getting spa treatments at home.<br />I personally like the effect it had on my skin; I felt as though using it has helped with both the cleansing and hydration of my skin.<br />Once you get through all the instructions, procure the right type of water for your steamer, and identify where you want to set it up, you will be rewarded with an easy to use machine that produces copious amounts of steam very rapidly\nQuick and powerful\nDEROL Lip Plumper, Lip Plumping Lip Gloss, Derol Lip Enhancer, Lip Care serum, Hydrating & Moisturizing Clear Lip Gloss, Tingling Lip Plumper Fuller And Maximizer\u2026\nDEROL\n{'Brand': 'DEROL', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating', 'Item Volume': '5.5 Milliliters', 'Package Information': 'Bottle', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2.32 x 0.7 x 0.7 inches; 0.32 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'AB-11', 'UPC': '735314440425'}\nThis lip treatment arrives in a well sealed package and is in an attractive container. The liquid in the container is clear and has a sponge top applicator. After I applied the liquid it started to feel prickly as if I had eaten a bit of hot pepper. The taste is a bit bitter and I should emphasize that it was not horrible, but it was there.<br />  Did the lips look plumper, they seemed to be, but I am Not sure I will use it again.\nSpicy item\nPurple Shampoo and Conditioner Set - Sulfate Free Salon Grade (2 x 16.9 fl oz) - Hydrating Toner - Shimmer Correction for Platinum Blonde, Silver, Light, and Grey Hair - New Formula\nBELLISSO\n{'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Shine,Restoring,Nourishing', 'Brand': 'BELLISSO', 'Hair Type': 'Color', 'Scent': 'Green Tea,Natural', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Package Dimensions': '8.86 x 6.02 x 3.11 inches; 2.91 Pounds', 'UPC': '765066671129'}\nMy hair is thin,  light gray, and very fine, so I am always looking for a shampoo that will help with these issues. Purple shampoo aims to prevent the yellow cast that you sometimes see on gray hair, but it didn't give my hair any odd blue look. The shampoo is a very dark purple color, but it did not stain the shower, the conditioner is a much lighter color.<br />  Both the shampoo and conditioner have little or no fragrance, the shampoo suds well in hard water and rinses easily. The bottle are attractive pump units that were easy to use in the shower. Persons with blonde or gray hair will find these products useful to prevent that brassy look.\nA product with a useful purpose\nProfessional Nail Drill Machine, Gugusure Anti-Drop 35000 RPM Rechargeable Nail Drill Machine for Acrylic Nails, Gel, Manicure, Portable Electric Cordless Efile Nail Drill Kit for Salon and Home DIY\nGugusure\n{'Brand': 'Gugusure', 'Material': 'Aluminum', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Maximum Rotational Speed': '35000 RPM', 'Package Dimensions': '8.15 x 6.5 x 2.24 inches; 1.46 Pounds', 'Manufacturer': 'gugusure company'}\nThis drill is POWERFUL!<br />And I mean that both in the sense of how fast and strong the drill is, as well as how long the battery pack lasts.<br /><br />I have a rechargeable nail drill that I like, but it doesn't always work as fast or as long as I hope, so I was curious to see how this would compare.<br />Well, I was blown away.<br />This is like a rechargeable drill on steroids.<br /><br />To be clear, there is still a wire connecting the drill to the power source/control panel.<br />While that cord is not a huge problem, it does handle differently than the rechargeable nail drills that are a single unit.<br />That being said, for me the trade off in power you get makes the two piece design well worth it.<br /><br />One thing to consider before committing to this nail drill, which is AMAZING, is that as the saying goes, \"With great power comes great responsibility\".<br />Put another way, you need to be very careful when using this nail drill, particularly on the highest setting.<br />This drill can turn fast enough to: quickly heat up your nails, file right through acrylic and natural nail material, get away from you and damage the skin around your nail.<br />Basically, you need to respect the power of this drill when you are using it, particularly when you start out learning how to handle it.<br /><br />Other things I really like about this drill:<br />- The remaining charge is digitally displayed on the battery portions, so you know exactly how much power you have let<br />- You select the power level with a dial; this allows you to adjust the rotation of your drill very precisely<br />- You get a wide range of attachments that cover almost anything you would want to do with your nail drill<br />- Charges with a standard USB cord, which is included (you need to provide an adapter or USB port)<br />- You change the nail bits by locking and unlocking them with a twist release; I find this is easier and makes for a more secure hold of the bits than the drill bits that rely on a simple push/pull mechanism<br />- Reverses direction quickly and easily<br /><br />I definitely recommend this nail drill if you are in the market for one.<br />It is extremely powerful, has a broad range of speeds, allows you precision control of speed, has a long battery life, let's you know exactly how much charge is left, and comes with a great selection of accessories.\nWHOA!\nLiquid Foundation Makeup Sunscreen 2 Pcs 35ml Waterproof Oil Control Moisturizing Lightweight Non Stick Concealer Foundation for Face and Body in Glass Bottle with 2 Pcs Black Makeup Sponge\nMarine Forest\n{'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Finish Type': 'Natural', 'Package Information': 'Bottle', 'Brand': 'Marine Forest', 'Coverage': 'Light', 'Package Dimensions': '8.11 x 5.91 x 2.36 inches; 8.78 Ounces', 'UPC': '729843448380'}\nI included a half make-up, half naked skin photo, taken with my phones portrait filter off, to give you some sense of how this foundation looks.<br />I was fortunate in that the time I spent studying the shades on the product page paid off with a pretty spot on color match for my skin, which had me very excited.<br /><br />Regarding how the make-up went on, I actually found I got better results applying it with my finger than I did with the included make-up sponge.<br />I know using a sponge is better for your skin, but I found it just kept blending the foundation right off my face.<br />Whether that was a result of how I applied it, the foundation itself, and/or the sponge is up for debate.<br />Since you get two sponges included with the two bottles of make-up, you can experiment and decide what application method works best for you.<br />Side note, this is way too thick to be air brushed on and can't be diluted, so if you use an airbrush, this foundation probably isn't for you.<br /><br />Regarding how the foundation looked and felt, I would say, standard.<br />This reminded me of pretty much every good quality foundation I have ever tried.<br />- It looks best after you first put it on<br />- It covers many, but not all marks and discoloration<br />- As the end of the day approaches, it starts to look \"fatigued\"<br />- It will wipe off on hands, clothing, etc... if you rub your face<br />- You need to put some effort into getting all traces of the foundation cleaned off at the end of the day<br />- For best results, you'll probably want to pair it with a spot concealer and finishing powder<br /><br />Overall, this is a solid foundation that performs well, but is not exceptional.<br />If you get a good match to your skin tone like I did, I suspect you will be very pleased with this make-up set.<br />In the end, I would definitely recommend this, so long as you understand this is not the ultimate fix all your problems, find your prince, do your taxes, and make you smarter miracle in a bottle all foundations claim to be, but instead, a quality make-up that will give you good coverage.\nGot a perfect color match with decent coverage\nNACOLUS Gentle Soothing Exfoliating Gloves Professional Korean exfoliating mitt,Two-sided Use skin exfoliator for body,Dead Skin Exfoliating Gloves for softer & smoother skin Chemical free ,Pink\nNACOLUS\n{'Brand': 'NACOLUS', 'Skin Type': 'Acne Prone', 'Product Benefits': 'Exfoliating', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Material Type Free': 'Chemical Free', 'Product Dimensions': '8.66 x 5.9 x 0.12 inches; 1.13 Ounces', 'UPC': '049500266806'}\nThis is a pretty great exfoliating pad/mitt with one key feature I have not seen before.<br />The thing that sets this apart from similar products is that the inside is lined with terry cloth.<br />That small addition makes a major difference when it comes to using the mitt because you don't end up exfoliating your hand the entire time you are trying to exfoliate you body.<br /><br />The external material does a pretty good job exfoliating.<br />It's rough, but not painful, so it should work for a wide range of skin types.<br />Obviously, you can also pair it with soaps and scrubs to enhance its ability to exfoliate.<br />Personally, I find this gentle enough to use every shower, yet textured enough to remove a lot of dead skin.<br /><br />If there is one extra change I wish the makers of this mitt would consider for future iterations,<br />it would be to add a loop of some sort to hang it by, so it can be left to dry on a hook.<br />Still, I can add something like that myself or just hang it over a towel rack, so it's not a big deal.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this mitt to someone in the market for one.<br />It's perfect for a bath or shower, offering good exfoliation for your skin, while protecting your hand from unnecessary wear and tear.\nExfoliate your skin without ruining your hands\nUNNY CLUB Cover Glow Cushion 0.3 Oz / 11g Beige Color SPF50+, Flawless Gloss Cushion Powder Complex Single Layer Concealer Cover Moisture Essence Tight Fit, Korea Cosmetics (No.21 Light Beige)\nUNNY CLUB\n{'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Finish Type': 'Natural', 'Package Information': 'Tube', 'Brand': 'UNNY CLUB', 'Coverage': 'Light', 'Package Dimensions': '3.07 x 2.95 x 1.06 inches; 2.4 Ounces'}\nThis makeup is very different than any other I have used in terms of how it is stored and applied; however, I really, really like it.<br />If you are someone who travels or likes to touch up your foundation throughout the day, this might well be the perfect makeup for you.<br />It comes in a very well designed compact that holds the liquid foundation in a sponge in its own closed compartment.<br />The applicator sponge sits atop the cover to that compartment, so the entire thing is spill proof and well protected.<br /><br />Applying the makeup I found that it blended very well using the included applicator sponge.<br />The coverage level is medium, evening out skin tone and obscuring imperfections, but not covering major discoloration.<br />Put another way, if you have a mole or blemish you really want to cover up, you would probably still want to use a spot corrector.<br /><br />The foundation itself has a matte finish with a nice feel.<br />I've found I can wear it on its own or with a powder finish.<br /><br />Color matches are always tricky, particularly online; however, I managed to get a pretty great one.<br />Unless I have been getting a lot of sun, my skin is pretty pale.<br />I'm basically one step up from ivory skin, which this Beige Color blended with extremely well.<br /><br />To show how well it blends and how matte the finish is, I applied it onto one half of my inner forearm, then took photos in two different light settings.<br />In the photos, the bottom half of my forearm has the foundation on it, but it leaves almost no line and no shine.<br /><br />As far as staying power is concerned, I would rate this is above average.<br />It stayed on well for me all day when I was not sweating, but would come off a little on anything that directly rubbed against my skin.<br />I also found this to be a gentle foundation that did not irritate my skin.<br /><br />I can happily recommend this foundation compact.<br />I was truly pleased with both the design of the dispenser, which makes it perfectly portable, and with the performance of the makeup itself.\nIdeal make-up when you are on the go\nBloomeffects - Natural Tulip Dew Face Cream | Cruelty-Free, Non-Toxic, Clean Beauty (1.7 oz | 50 ml)\nBloomeffects\n{'Brand': 'Bloomeffects', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Use for': 'Face', 'Package Dimensions': '5.98 x 3.27 x 2.91 inches; 1.7 Ounces', 'UPC': '850006566419'}\nThis cream has a very light fragrance, more botanical, than floral. The cream comes in an attractive little pot shaped jar and is made in the USA and contains imported materials. The ingredients are listed on the box, but printed in such a fashion that I couldn't read them even with my trusty magnifier.<br />  For me this cream did not irritate, did not feel greasy, and left my skin feeling dewy. The illuminating factor I really couldn't notice. Over all a very nice facial cream.\nMild fragrance\nNose Pore Wax Strips for hair removal\nGLAMOR VALLEY\n{'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Scars, Dark Spots, Acne, Uneven Skin Tone, Inflammation', 'Skin Type': 'Acne Prone,All Skin Types', 'Brand': 'GLAMOR VALLEY', 'Product Benefits': 'Moisture', 'Product Dimensions': '1.97 x 1.97 x 1.97 inches; 6.74 Ounces'}\nThis is a cream that is somewhat gel like, it is made in China and is clearly labeled. The ingredients are clearly labeled on the package along with cautions for exposure to sun. It is easier to have confidence in a product that provides the needed information. As I age there are more pigment areas appearing on my skin, so  I am hoping this cream will be effective. It is too early to report any significant changes or improvement in my skin, but the product does not irritate my skin.\nGentle on the skin\n8PC Lazy Bird's Nest Plate Hairpin Velvet Bird Nest Shaped Hair Clips Expandable Ponytail Holder Hair Loops Nest Plate Hairpin Hair Claw Clip barrette\nAhkeaDirectly\n{'Brand': 'AhkeaDirectly', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Embellishment': 'Resin', 'Material': 'Plastic', 'Package Dimensions': '6.02 x 5.2 x 2.32 inches; 4.16 Ounces', 'UPC': '761312153890'}\nWhen I first began using these I really struggled with getting them on/off, particularly when trying to put my hair up in a ponytail.<br />The problem was that when I was pulling my hair out through the circular clip, it would get caught on the prongs spread out along the inside<br />After using these a while, however, I am getting better at putting the clips in and taking them out.<br /><br />One trick I figured out pretty quickly is that twisting my hair before pulling it through the circle prevents it getting caught.<br />The other thing I have learned is that this is excellent for putting my hair up in a bun.<br />That's probably my favorite use for these because I get a nice symmetrical look and a very tight hold that keeps my hair up all day long.<br /><br />Overall, I am very glad I stuck with these because, the longer I have them, the more I like them.<br />The clips which start out as kind of stiff and hard to open, also get easier to slide open and closed with repeated use.<br /><br />In the end, I cannot promise these will work for every type of hair out there.<br />I can, however, confirm that they hold my long, fine, straight, and very slippery hair in place well.<br />That's a huge deal for me since my hair is exceptionally hard to keep up with scrunchies, clips, bands, and ties.<br /><br />If you like the look of these clips, I do recommend getting a set, but caution that patience and practice will be needed before you are able to make the most out of them.\nTakes some getting used to, but holds hair well\nDry Weightless Hair Volume and Texture Spray | Dry Texture Spray for Hair | Texturizing Spray | Sulfate and Cruelty Free 244ml (7oz)\nOsensia\n{'Hair Type': 'All, Dry, Fine', 'Liquid Volume': '7 Fluid Ounces', 'Brand': 'Osensia', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Unit Count': '7.0 Fl Oz', 'Package Dimensions': '8.03 x 1.93 x 1.89 inches; 8.78 Ounces', 'UPC': '850001832274'}\nI am not sure what this spray is supposed to do.<br />\"texture spray\" apparently makes your hair \"gritty\" according to the can.<br />It is also supposed to absorb oil, so I suppose it's a deshiner.<br />On the product page it reads:<br />\"This weightless dry texture spray for hair provides a manageable and light hold without the crunch. It has long staying power and keeps your hairstyle in place without looking or feeling stiff\"<br />Consequently, I thought this would be like a light hairspray, but it's really not.<br />It smells nice and is easy to apply, but does not hold my hair.<br /><br />In the end, I feel like this is sort of a body enhancer and mattifier, so maybe more like a waterless shampoo?<br />Honestly, even after using this I am still not sure.<br />I feel like this is going to work best for anyone with oily hair who wants to absorb the oiliness to give their hair more lift.<br />Where I think this really falls down is in holding hair, as well as clearly and consistently describing what it's for.\nI remain confused\nL\u2019ANGE HAIR Pocket Size Comb | Blush Acetate | Compact Design for Travel | Easy Glide Mini Wide Tooth Comb\nL'ANGE HAIR\n{'Brand': \"L'ANGE HAIR\", 'Hair Type': 'Wavy, Dry', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Product Dimensions': '5 x 3.63 x 0.25 inches; 1.45 Ounces', 'Item model number': '2438', 'UPC': '810108191001'}\nBecause this comb is compact and comes with a little protective pouch I could see how you would call it a travel comb.<br />At the same time, I'm using this every single day since it makes an ideal shower comb.<br /><br />If you have thin hair that tends to tangle, apply products like glosses, masks, deep conditioners, etc... this helps you apply those product more quickly and easily.<br />If you have very fine hair, this helps you detangle without doing damage.<br /><br />In the end this is a great comb because it's<br />- Sturdy<br />- Compact<br />- Cute<br />- Very useful<br /><br />Definitely recommend.\nPerfect for combing through and applying product",
