I was definitely skeptical but it really is as easy as swiping on the magnetic liner and then sticking the lash strip in place.  THAT IS IT!  No fussing, no dropping, no glue, no 2-piece magnet that you can't ever position properly.  Just swipe and stick.  Pretty much foolproof!  I did find them to be a tad heavy on my eyelid but I imagine that is because I'm not used to wearing false lashes (because I could never figure how to get them on properly...haha) and I'm hoping it will get better with time.<br /><br />Ok...now onto the negative.  While these lashes are absolutely amazing, I was appalled to receive a used tube of eyeliner in my pack.  You know the black thread rings that mascara tubes develop after you have removed and inserted the wand a hundred times?  That's exactly what the eyeliner tube looked like.  A 'sealed' package that contained a used product?  Not really sure how that happened.  Luckily, the kit contains 2 tubes of eyeliner so I went against my better judgement and decided to try the tube that was obviously (maybe I should say hopefully) not used.<br /><br />Other than receiving a partially used product, these eyelashes are AMAZING.  So easy and fun, I highly recommend!!\nReview Title: SO easy to apply!\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
  "reference_summary": "UMICKOO Hair Straightener,Upgraded Flat Iron for Hair With Real-Time Temperature Display And Adjustable Temperature,1 Inch (Rose Gold)\nUMIKOO\n{'Package Dimensions': '14.48 x 4.61 x 2.32 inches; 1.79 Pounds', 'UPC': '692232543075'}\nLet me start by saying that this straightener is very pretty.  It is a lovely rose-gold color and has a sleek design.  Included in the package was the straightener, a comb, two clips, a heat-resistant glove, and a storage pouch.<br /><br />There is a digital temperature display that shows the current temperature, which is a really helpful feature.  There is also a power button, up/down temperature control, and a barrel lock to keep the clamp closed.<br /><br />I did find that this straightener heated up really quickly.  It did not, however, straighten my hair very efficiently.  I had to go over really small sections multiple times to achieve the desired results.  That cannot be good for your hair and it took forever!  My hair is very thick and on the coarse side so it may be much better suited to someone with finer hair.  Overall, this is a definitely a decent straightener but it just didn\u2019t work well for me.<br />*I received this product at no cost in exchange for a fair and unbiassed review.\nDidn't work well for my hair\n2-Pack Puretize 16.9 Oz Hand Sanitizing Gel w/Pump Tops - Extra Strength 70% Ethyl Alcohol - Moisturizing Formula with Aloe Vera, Vitamin E & Botanical Extracts - Quick Drying Formula\nPure Daily Care\n{'Brand': 'Pure Daily Care', 'Unit Count': '33.8 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Special Feature': 'Moisturizing', 'Scent': 'Unscented', 'Package Dimensions': '7 x 6.5 x 4.5 inches; 1.06 Pounds', 'UPC': '810016711360'}\nThis sanitizer is a great find!  It did not dry my hands out or leave them feeling sticky.  The package arrived quickly and both bottles were tightly wrapped.  I have not been able to find sanitizer in stores and was so excited to find it on Amazon.  Very pleased!\nGreat find!\nMagnetic Eyelashes and Magnetic Eyeliner Kit, Magnetic Eyelashes with Eyeliner, 5 Pairs Reusable Magnetic Eyelashes with Tweezer, False Lashes\nEyenjoy\n{'Brand': 'Eyenjoy', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '5.71 x 5.39 x 0.71 inches', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Item Form': 'Pair', 'Mounting Type': 'Magnet', 'Product Dimensions': '5.71 x 5.39 x 0.71 inches; 2.12 Ounces', 'UPC': '736067423758'}\nLet me start by saying that these are the easiest eyelashes that I have ever used.
