It is a lovely rose-gold color and has a sleek design.  Included in the package was the straightener, a comb, two clips, a heat-resistant glove, and a storage pouch.<br /><br />There is a digital temperature display that shows the current temperature, which is a really helpful feature.  There is also a power button, up/down temperature control, and a barrel lock to keep the clamp closed.<br /><br />I did find that this straightener heated up really quickly.  It did not, however, straighten my hair very efficiently.  I had to go over really small sections multiple times to achieve the desired results.  That cannot be good for your hair and it took forever!  My hair is very thick and on the coarse side so it may be much better suited to someone with finer hair.  Overall, this is a definitely a decent straightener but it just didn\u2019t work well for me.<br />*I received this product at no cost in exchange for a fair and unbiassed review.\nReview Title: Didn't work well for my hair\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------",
