Oz.\nFrulatte\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '8.46 x 3.86 x 2.8 inches; 1.23 Pounds'}\nI first found this product at a discount store. And I\u2019m thrilled to find that Amazon has it so I can never be without it! I have waist-length hair that is kinky curly with gray hair throughout that I wear straightened. This product is the only one that keeps my hair from frizzing no matter how hot and humid it gets! And the shine and softness of my hair is the best it\u2019s ever been. I use it after using It\u2019s A Ten Miracle Silk Leave-In after washing my hair with Wen.<br /><br />Even if you have long hair, use this stuff sparingly and make sure you liquify it in the palms of your hand and between your fingers before you put it through your hair.<br /><br />Another plus: the huge bottle lasts me about 6 months. Keep in mind my hair is dry so I only wash it twice a week. Knowing that, you can gauge how long this bottle will last you.\nBest Anti-Frizz Hair Product I\u2019ve Ever Used\nFESHFEN Straight Long Ponytail Extensions 24 Inch Wrap Around Synthetic Hair Piece Magic Paste Pony Tail Hair Extensions Hairpieces for Women Girls\nFESHFEN\n{'Brand': 'FESHFEN', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '14.96 x 3.58 x 0.75 inches; 5.19 Ounces'}\nDifficult to get the hair \u2018wrap\u2019 wrapped around my own ponytail  because the Velcro sticks to the fake hair. Also is too heavy so is slides down your own ponytail.\nDoesn\u2019t stay on!\nYoungSee 20\" Remy Tape in Hair Extensions Ombre Balayage Medium Brown with Bleach Blonde 100% Real Human Hair Seamless Tape in Human Hair Extensions 50g 20pcs\nYoungSee\n{'Brand': 'YoungSee', 'Extension Length': '20 Inches', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy, Straight', 'Installation Type': 'Tape-In', 'Product Dimensions': '20 x 1 x 1 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '786784875194'}\nI was so disappointed when I open the package. The top of the Wests are almost black. They are not a medium brown at all. Unfortunately I open the package too late to be able to return them. I\u2019m keeping the box to remind myself never to buy from them again.<br /><br />UPDATE: They also mat horribly!\nDON\u2019T BUY -Tops are Black,NOT Brown\nVeSunny 20Inch Balayage Tape in Hair Extensions Remi Human Hair Brazilian Remy Hair Invisible Tape Ombre #4 Dark Brown to Caramel Blonde Mixed Platinum Blonde Human Hair Tape in Extensions 20pc 50g\nVe Sunny\n{'Brand': 'Ve Sunny', 'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Installation Type': 'Tape-In', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '20 x 0.98 x 0.98 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'UPC': '798863462690'}\nThese extensions are NOT Remy! You can\u2019t call this remy hair if the cuticles are not all going in the same direction. And miss-matched cuticles cause matting at the tape. While sitting and watching TV not moving my head, they all matted up at the tape! Now I have to take them all out!\nNOT REMY HAIR-They all may up at the tapes!\nHuman Hair Extensions Tape in 50g Golden Blonde Highlighted With Light Blonde Tape in Hair Extensions 20 Inches Tape Extensions\nRUNATURE\n{'Brand': 'RUNATURE', 'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Extension Length': '20 Inches', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Installation Type': 'Tape', 'Package Dimensions': '8.31 x 4.65 x 1.77 inches; 5.36 Ounces'}\nThe first set I purchased matted several times a day no matter how often I oiled them. They matted within 10-15 minutes after brushing, even when I sat still and didn\u2019t move my head. I contacted the company, and they were very helpful. They offered to replace the extensions with new ones! Now that\u2019s Customer Service! I look forward to receiving my replacement extensions.\nGreat Customer Service!\nVario Tape In Human Hair Extensions 7A Silky Straight Skin Weft Human Remy Hair For Fashion Women (22 Inche 60g 20PCS #12P613)\nVARIO\n{'Brand': 'VARIO', 'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Installation Type': 'Tape-In', 'Product Dimensions': '22 x 2 x 0.5 inches; 3.2 Ounces', 'UPC': '610877854301'}\nBeautiful hair, match my color perfectly.\nBeautiful hair",
