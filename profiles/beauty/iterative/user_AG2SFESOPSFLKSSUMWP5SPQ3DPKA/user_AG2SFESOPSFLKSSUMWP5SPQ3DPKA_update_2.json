Oz.\nFrulatte\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '8.46 x 3.86 x 2.8 inches; 1.23 Pounds'}\nI first found this product at a discount store. And I\u2019m thrilled to find that Amazon has it so I can never be without it! I have waist-length hair that is kinky curly with gray hair throughout that I wear straightened. This product is the only one that keeps my hair from frizzing no matter how hot and humid it gets! And the shine and softness of my hair is the best it\u2019s ever been. I use it after using It\u2019s A Ten Miracle Silk Leave-In after washing my hair with Wen.<br /><br />Even if you have long hair, use this stuff sparingly and make sure you liquify it in the palms of your hand and between your fingers before you put it through your hair.<br /><br />Another plus: the huge bottle lasts me about 6 months. Keep in mind my hair is dry so I only wash it twice a week. Knowing that, you can gauge how long this bottle will last you.\nBest Anti-Frizz Hair Product I\u2019ve Ever Used\nFESHFEN Straight Long Ponytail Extensions 24 Inch Wrap Around Synthetic Hair Piece Magic Paste Pony Tail Hair Extensions Hairpieces for Women Girls\nFESHFEN\n{'Brand': 'FESHFEN', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '14.96 x 3.58 x 0.75 inches; 5.19 Ounces'}\nDifficult to get the hair \u2018wrap\u2019 wrapped around my own ponytail  because the Velcro sticks to the fake hair.
