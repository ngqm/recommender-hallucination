They apply easily with water, I would just wait a minute or two before opening your mouth so its dry, You want to make sure to create the opening slowly and that its adhered to your lips or it will tear and ruin the effect.

  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:  \nThe user has highlighted several enjoyable experiences with their purchases. They appreciate the unique and charming designs of certain items, specifically noting a handmade quality that stands out. The effectiveness and ease of use of various products have also been praised, such as a smoothing brush that aids in training a pet, a versatile setting powder that matches their foundation well, and a luminizer that provides great coverage and waterproof qualities. Additionally, the user enjoyed the quality of tools that accompanied some products, emphasizing that convenience and functionality are key positive aspects.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:  \nDespite the positive experiences, there were notable dislikes. The user expressed disappointment regarding the lack of glue with a nail set, finding the alternative stickers inadequate. There was also frustration with the limited variation in designs, impacting overall satisfaction. The temporary tattoos had a steep learning curve for application, requiring patience and care, which may deter some users from fully enjoying the product. Furthermore, the user mentioned limited sizing, which may not cater to everyone. \n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:  \nThe user has generally shown satisfaction with multiple purchases, valuing unique designs, product performance, and ease of use. Positive experiences ranged from effective pet care tools to high-quality cosmetics that enhance their beauty routine. However, there were some disappointments, particularly with product inclusions and usability of certain items.
