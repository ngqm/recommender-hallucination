  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:  \nThe user has expressed satisfaction with various skincare and haircare products. They particularly appreciated the gentle and effective cleansing properties of the exfoliant, noting a soft and vibrant skin feel. In haircare, the user enjoyed pleasant scents and effective moisturizing benefits that left hair clean, soft, and without tangles. Additionally, both the consistency and application of products received positive remarks, with several reviews highlighting ease of use and immediate results like shine and bounce in hair. Overall, the user had enjoyable experiences with the pleasant fragrances and beneficial effects of the products, influencing their overall satisfaction.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:  \nDespite several positive experiences, the user encountered a few disappointments. Initial expectations were not met with one scrub due to its small container size, leading to concerns about longevity despite its efficacy. Additionally, there was mention of a particularly sweet scent in one haircare product that did not align with their personal taste. The varied product ratings suggest a lack of consistency in meeting expectations, with certain items falling short of providing a satisfactory experience when compared to others.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:  \nThe user\u2019s purchase history reflects a blend of positive and negative experiences with skincare and haircare products. They praised several items for their effectiveness, pleasant scents, and ease of application, often leading to satisfying results such as improved skin texture and clean, manageable hair. However, there were instances of disappointment related to product sizes and fragrance preferences that did not resonate. Overall, while there were standout products that contributed to a positive experience, some inconsistencies in product satisfaction indicate room for improvement in future purchases.",

It kind of works... it at least slows down the growth of the hair, and wen the hair returns the roots are considerably more fragile.  very pleased!",
