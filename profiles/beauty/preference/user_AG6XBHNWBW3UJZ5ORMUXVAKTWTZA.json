No clumping or flaking. I was able to go in with multiple coats without clumping as as I wore it throughout the day, I didn't notice any flakes on my face. I honestly didn't notice any extra lengthening or volumizing with this product though. It goes on easily though. It is one of the few mascaras that I experienced absolutely no clumping with, so I'll be a return customer just for that alone as clumping is a huge pet peeve of mine.

  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user's shopping experience highlights several positive interactions with beauty products that delivered satisfactory results. A noteworthy mascara provided excellent performance without clumping or flaking, leading to customer loyalty. Positive feedback was also received for the cute design and versatility of a nail art brush set, which enhanced creative possibilities. An electric nail drill is praised for its smooth operation and suitability for beginners, making it a preferred option among drills. Additionally, a heated eye mask significantly improved dry eye symptoms, with impressive features such as adjustable heat and automatic shut-off, further contributing to user satisfaction.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nConversely, some products fell short of expectations, leading to disappointment. Hair tools intended for thick hair were found ineffective, although they performed better on fine hair, indicating limited utility. The metallic lipstick had a beautiful color but struggled with longevity, requiring frequent reapplication. A synthetic wig was described as visually appealing but problematic for daily wear due to tangling and a synthetic feel. The nail polish remover worked quickly but left a heaviness, which was unsettling compared to other removers, causing uncertainty about its effectiveness.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nOverall, the user's purchase history reflects a mix of positive and negative experiences. While several products excelled in performance, design, and effectiveness\u2014leading to high satisfaction levels\u2014others did not meet the user's expectations, particularly in usability and longevity. This blend of experiences underscores the importance of product performance and quality in influencing overall customer satisfaction.",
