  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user expressed satisfaction with several products that garnered compliments, particularly in terms of style and color. Specifically, experiences highlighted a positive reception from others, indicating that certain wigs were well-liked for their aesthetic appeal. A noteworthy instance mentioned being pleased overall, despite minor adjustments needed with fullness and curl tightness, showcasing moments of contentment and approval in the shopping experience.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user encountered significant disappointment across multiple purchases. Common grievances included products not matching their advertised appearance, such as issues with length, cut, and overall quality. Many reviews depicted frustrations with items being too short, tangling easily, or shedding excessively. Specific remarks highlighted feelings of regret about purchases due to unmet expectations, leading to a sense of discontent with the options available.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user's shopping experience reflects a blend of admiration and dissatisfaction. While some products received praise for their style and the compliments they garnered, a substantial number fell short of expectations, leading to feelings of disappointment and frustration. The disparity in experiences suggests a struggle between desire for attractive, quality wigs and the reality of product performance, emphasizing the importance of accurate representations in marketing to enhance overall customer satisfaction.",
