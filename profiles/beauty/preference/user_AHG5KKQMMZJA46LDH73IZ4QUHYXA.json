Is it a top of the line, 5 star iron? No...But for this price, it is an excellent value for an entry level device. The handle is very ergonomic with an on/off button with +/- temperature control. It heats up quick enough, giving you a temp readout on the LCD display. The iron itself is a little thin and somewhat cheaply painted but it functions nicely. The clasp opens and closes with ease but has good retention.

It smells very sweet, candy/sweet tarts, with a floral rose bouquet. Excuse the gender stereotyping but it's more feminine, even teenage. Reminds me of grade school and the roll on candy perfumes the girls would use.<br /><br />I like the serum, it's more of an oil though. Fairly runny. Does a nice job on my skin and beard. I do like it and the scent I'm just embarrassed to smell that way in public.\nReview Title: Smells good, but not how I want to smell.\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: ZOUSZ Black Oud Vegan Beard Balm - Classic Wood-Scented Facial Hair Grooming and Skin Care Butter for Men - Avocado, Argan, Macadamia Oils - Vegan Moisturiser, Conditioner, and Dandruff Remover\nReview Date: 2021/06/15\nStore: ZOUSZ\nAverage Rating: 4.2\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'ZOUSZ', 'Item Form': 'Liquid,Balm', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Hair Type': 'Dry', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '3.15 x 3.15 x 3.94 inches; 1.76 Ounces'}\nReview Text: If you're a cologne guy, this is more for you...It's strong enough you probably don't have to wear cologne with it. Scent starts off as clean laundry, then comes a little cedar spice, ending with a sweet vanilla...Combined for what I personally wouldn't call \"manly\" but more of a \"man who is trying to smell good\"... Has a designer fragrance to it, a little body spray but a bit more classy.<br /><br />Performance is okay. The balm is very fluffy ad soft like coconut butter. It doesn't tame as much as I like but softens and gives a nice glow.<br /><br />Overall I want to hate on this but just can't... I can see why some might hate the cologne smell, it's quite strong and different from the dozens of balms I've reviewed... BUT if you like wearing cologne, you'll love this. It's a bit high in price but hey, you'll be saving in cologne price.\nReview Title: Good if you like cologne.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: SUPRENT Razors for Men with Matrix Cutter Head, 38.5\u00b0 Golden Angle Shaving Kit for Men, Travelling Razor Kit-1 Mens Razor Handle, 2 Blade Refills,1 Dock,1 Shave Foam\nReview Date: 2021/09/07\nStore: SUPRENT\nAverage Rating: 3.6\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'SUPRENT', 'Number of Blades': '6', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Handle Material': 'Metal', 'Product Dimensions': '3.94 x 3.94 x 1.97 inches; 1.28 Pounds'}\nReview Text: This is a tough one to review...Works great on my neck and face but not so great on my bald head. The ergonomics are fantastic, it's a hefty metal body with nice curves. The blade nestles in the top groove with metal surrounding it...This makes for a difficult close shave from my bald head curves, I like to press down harder and get a close shave but the surrounding metal prevents that from happening. However, on my neck and cheeks, it does well, particularly with a dry shave.<br /><br />The foam is nice but nothing special. Doesn't slick up great but has a nice scent. The holder is okay...Sturdy but holds the blade loosely. Also, as of now, I don't see where I can get replacement blades.\nReview Title: Love the ergonomics.

Every item fit securely in it's place and the box has a nice hard shell to it. The hard shell is a medium strength...Sturdy, not floppy but not crush proof but does a great job of protection and would feel safe packing this in a suitcase for travel.\nGreat investment protection.\nNAILGIL Poly Nail Gel (Temperature)\nNAIL GIL\n{'Brand': 'NAIL GIL', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'gel', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '9.45 x 4.72 x 1.18 inches'}\nNice set for the money.

Is it a top of the line, 5 star iron? No...But for this price, it is an excellent value for an entry level device. The handle is very ergonomic with an on/off button with +/- temperature control. It heats up quick enough, giving you a temp readout on the LCD display. The iron itself is a little thin and somewhat cheaply painted but it functions nicely.

Scent is very cologne like with a strong backbone of sweet lemon rind/lemonhead. It's in no way overpowering but has a fair presence. I find the scent enjoyable and the oil decent, I would prefer it a little more slick but this is a great happy medium and I can just go extra if need be.\nGood stuff.

It smells very sweet, candy/sweet tarts, with a floral rose bouquet. Excuse the gender stereotyping but it's more feminine, even teenage. Reminds me of grade school and the roll on candy perfumes the girls would use.<br /><br />I like the serum, it's more of an oil though. Fairly runny. Does a nice job on my skin and beard. I do like it and the scent I'm just embarrassed to smell that way in public.\nSmells good, but not how I want to smell.\nZOUSZ Black Oud Vegan Beard Balm - Classic Wood-Scented Facial Hair Grooming and Skin Care Butter for Men - Avocado, Argan, Macadamia Oils - Vegan Moisturiser, Conditioner, and Dandruff Remover\nZOUSZ\n{'Brand': 'ZOUSZ', 'Item Form': 'Liquid,Balm', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Hair Type': 'Dry', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '3.15 x 3.15 x 3.94 inches; 1.76 Ounces'}\nIf you're a cologne guy, this is more for you...It's strong enough you probably don't have to wear cologne with it.

Has a designer fragrance to it, a little body spray but a bit more classy.<br /><br />Performance is okay. The balm is very fluffy ad soft like coconut butter. It doesn't tame as much as I like but softens and gives a nice glow.<br /><br />Overall I want to hate on this but just can't... I can see why some might hate the cologne smell, it's quite strong and different from the dozens of balms I've reviewed... BUT if you like wearing cologne, you'll love this.

The ergonomics are fantastic, it's a hefty metal body with nice curves. The blade nestles in the top groove with metal surrounding it...This makes for a difficult close shave from my bald head curves, I like to press down harder and get a close shave but the surrounding metal prevents that from happening. However, on my neck and cheeks, it does well, particularly with a dry shave.<br /><br />The foam is nice but nothing special. Doesn't slick up great but has a nice scent. The holder is okay...Sturdy but holds the blade loosely. Also, as of now, I don't see where I can get replacement blades.\nLove the ergonomics.

I'll break down each product briefly below.<br /><br />BAG: Very nice, basic black but well padded and holds it's shape. I basic in shape but I higher quality then usual.<br /><br />SOAP: Great balsam/fir scent. Excellent balance of exfoliation and suds. Leaves body invigorated, soft and smelling great!<br /><br />SHAVE: Has a tea scent, hint of some sort of alcohol. Builds into a creamy texture, not much sud but decent coverage. Does it's job. Finishes with a clean scent.<br /><br />FACE WASH: Nice balsam/fir scent to it. A little goes a long way! Very slick, seems to not penetrate but wash the exterior of skin. Takes some work to wash off. Finishes with a green tea scent and refreshed.<br /><br />FACE MOISTURIZER: Has a tea/alcohol scent at first...Goes on smooth. Dries fairly quickly, leaving a sweet green tea scent. Leaves face feeling soft not oily.<br /><br />POMADE: Great scent, more cologne like. Goes on easy, not too tacky or slick. Does a decent job.<br /><br />LIP BALM: Awesome balm!!! At first I thought it was an odd addition to the set. But man I love this balm. Goes on with a hint of sweet tea.

Its very strong but not overpowering. Truly one of the best things I've smelt.<br /><br />APPLICATION: Goes on fairly oily and blends pretty well. Immediately brings color to my face, I have medium skin and it starts with an apricot redness but fades back to an awakened tone. I really enjoy that about this, I see others complain about this so maybe it's not best for fair skinned people?.<br /><br />Once dry, I am left with a matte sheen that is well hydrated. You expect it to feel oily but it's more like a raw feel. A really nice balance of hydrated but not wet and definitely softer.

Price is subjective, but you don't feel like you are getting a $50 product. The logo is just a crappy sticker, it feels pretty thin, isn't very powerful and didn't come with a wall plug (only cord, not a huge deal but for the price...). There are similar ones for less.<br /><br />Performance wish, I like it a lot. Coming from a manual one, this makes for much easier work to wrangle my dog an let this do the work.

It's a bit high in price but hey, you'll be saving in cologne price.\nReview Title: Good if you like cologne.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: SUPRENT Razors for Men with Matrix Cutter Head, 38.5\u00b0 Golden Angle Shaving Kit for Men, Travelling Razor Kit-1 Mens Razor Handle, 2 Blade Refills,1 Dock,1 Shave Foam\nReview Date: 2021/09/07\nStore: SUPRENT\nAverage Rating: 3.6\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'SUPRENT', 'Number of Blades': '6', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Handle Material': 'Metal', 'Product Dimensions': '3.94 x 3.94 x 1.97 inches; 1.28 Pounds'}\nReview Text: This is a tough one to review...Works great on my neck and face but not so great on my bald head. The ergonomics are fantastic, it's a hefty metal body with nice curves. The blade nestles in the top groove with metal surrounding it...This makes for a difficult close shave from my bald head curves, I like to press down harder and get a close shave but the surrounding metal prevents that from happening. However, on my neck and cheeks, it does well, particularly with a dry shave.<br /><br />The foam is nice but nothing special. Doesn't slick up great but has a nice scent. The holder is okay...Sturdy but holds the blade loosely. Also, as of now, I don't see where I can get replacement blades.\nReview Title: Love the ergonomics. Tough to get a close shave though.\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Organic Patchouli Beard Wash by American Shaving Co, Rich, Foaming Cleanser that Softens, cleanse & Strengthens the beard hair, Clean and Refresh your beard with Patchouli Fragrance - 8 oz\nReview Date: 2022/08/29\nStore: American Shaving Co.\nAverage Rating: 3.5\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'American Shaving Co.', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Unit Count': '8.0 Ounce', 'Package Dimensions': '7.84 x 1.85 x 1.81 inches; 8.64 Ounces', 'UPC': '685167904479'}\nReview Text: Not bad...Large size, pumps a thick tan cream. Fair amount of sud/foam. Pretty strong, classic, patchouli scent. Scent washes out a bit with the soap but leaves a nice, light amount behind. Does a good job at cleansing and softening.\nReview Title: Good stuff.

Additionally, some scents were mentioned as unpleasant or unsuitable, reflecting a disconnect between the product\u2019s marketed benefits and actual outcomes. Overall, there were several reviews indicating disappointment with product durability and effectiveness.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user's experiences reflect a blend of satisfaction and frustration with various grooming and skincare products. While many items were appreciated for their quality, effective performance, and attractive scents, several failures in product reliability and value for money led to negative experiences.
