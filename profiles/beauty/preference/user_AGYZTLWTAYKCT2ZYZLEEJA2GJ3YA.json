It so gentle on the skin and hardly any scent to it. It's not too thick and easily applied in a thin layer. It exfoliates well and leaves my face feeling clean and visibly brighter after the first use. I was also pleasantly surprised that my face didn't feel dry after and it actually felt moisturized. A little goes a long way and it's well worth the price. The packaging is beautiful and looks like a luxury item. This would make a great gift!

They are small and compact, which makes them easy to pack and travel with. The colors are pretty and while not super pigmented at to begin with they are buildable and blend well. I tried them with eye primer and with out and they lasted the same for me. I will say I have oily eyelids and noticed that they don't last more than a couple hours.<br />I think these would make a great gift for adults, teens, or even younger kids who want play makeup. My daughters who are 6 and 7 found them one day and loved using them. They especially loved the blue and purple that they said made them look like a mermaid.

  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:  \nThe user has expressed high satisfaction with multiple products in their purchase history. They particularly enjoyed a clay mask that is gentle and effective, providing noticeable skin benefits without drying effects. The lightweight feel and smooth application of a foundation also received positive feedback, highlighting its good coverage and non-irritating nature. Additionally, the gel nail polish kit's comprehensive components and effective instructions contributed to a fulfilling first-time experience. A compact eyeshadow set was noted for its travel-friendly design and fun colors, appealing to both the user and their children. Overall, the aesthetic and luxury feel of these products have enhanced the user's shopping experience.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:  \nThe user encountered several disappointments across their purchases. A mascara caused flaking within hours, resulting in smudging and dissatisfaction. The hairbrush was criticized for being overpriced despite its average performance, leading to a perception of lack of value. Issues with the gel nail polish kit included strong odors and unlabeled colors, with initial drying problems. The eyeshadows, while fun, were also noted to lack long-lasting wear, particularly for oily skin types. Overall, these negative experiences highlight concerns regarding product reliability and value for money.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:  \nThe user's shopping experiences reveal a mix of positive and negative aspects. Products such as the clay mask and foundation excelled in performance and satisfaction, enhancing their beauty routine. However, challenges with mascara, hairbrush pricing, and some components of the gel nail polish kit indicated areas for improvement. While certain items provided joyful and effective experiences, others fell short of expectations, impacting the overall shopping experience. Balancing effective performance with fair pricing appears crucial for future purchases.",

I to think over all the accessories for it are geared to older kids because the stick on nails were too big for my 8 year old. The toe dividers and flip flops are huge and seem more sized for adults. The nail polish is quick dry which is great for kids who are impatient and file works fine.",
