The curly wavy still looks great after three months and I expect the kinky curly probably will, too.  Love this company and will continue to buy from them as long as the prices are this great.\nReview Title: BUY THIS FREAKING HAIR!!!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: 18 Inch Medium Length Clip in Hair Extensions #12 Blonde Highlighted with #613 Blonde Human Hair Kinkys Curly Clip in Hair Extensions Real Human Hair Double Weft 100g/pack\nReview Date: 2019/08/15\nAverage Rating: 3.2\nProduct Details: {'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Extension Length': '18 Inches', 'Hair Type': 'Curly', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Installation Type': 'Clip-In', 'Item Weight': '3.52 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I was the customer who specifically asked the seller if the hair was kinky curly as in the photo on the right or loose like the model's hair.  As you can read, I was told the hair was kinky curly.  Silky with crimps is not kinky curly nor does it look like the photo. I give it 2 stars because the color is as it says.  Very disappointed as this was a complete waste of money as it does not blend in with kinky curly hair as I was led to believe.\nReview Title: Not even close\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n        Format your response exactly as follows:\n        POSITIVE SUMMARY:\n        [Your positive summary here]\n\n        NEGATIVE SUMMARY:\n        [Your negative summary here]\n\n        OVERALL SUMMARY:\n        [Your overall summary here]",
  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:  \nThe user has expressed satisfaction with several hair-related purchases, particularly appreciating the quality and aesthetics of the hair extensions.

The user overall seems to enjoy well-performing hair accessories and extensions, frequently noting the likelihood of ordering again and enjoying the end results.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:  \nThere are notable frustrations in the user\u2019s experiences, especially with regard to the performance of specific beauty products. Several reviews mention dissatisfaction with the effectiveness of eyebrow tattoo equipment, citing inadequate depth for dye permanence and mediocre results. Additionally, there are complaints about misleading descriptions concerning hair textures, with certain products not matching the advertised features, leading to disappointment and perceived wasted purchases. Overall, inconsistent product quality detracted from their shopping experience.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:  \nThe user\u2019s shopping history reflects a mix of positive and negative experiences centered around beauty and hair products. While they have had commendable purchases that resulted in repeat orders and satisfaction with quality, challenges arose from certain products underperforming against expectations. Notable frustrations include subpar effects from a tattoo machine and misleading product representations concerning hair texture.
