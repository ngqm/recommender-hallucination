  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user has consistently enjoyed several products, particularly those that provide effective results. They appreciated the under-eye patches that helped reduce puffiness, highlighting the refreshing feeling they delivered, especially when chilled. The user expressed satisfaction with the exceptional quality and natural appearance of wigs, especially noting their softness and beautiful colors. Hair accessories, such as a diverse assortment of hair ties and pearl headbands, were also well-received for their quality, comfort, and great value, reinforcing a trend of finding affordable yet effective beauty products.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nDespite several positive experiences, the user encountered some disappointments. They found certain items, specifically a hairbrush, to be overpriced and uncomfortable due to sharp bristles that led to dissatisfaction. Additionally, a set of headbands was deemed too small and ineffective in staying put, which contradicted their expectations for functional hair accessories. The eucalyptus sheet masks were considered overpriced when compared to other similar products available on the market, which could imply a search for better value in that category.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user's purchasing history reveals a strong inclination toward beauty and self-care products with varying satisfaction levels. Positive experiences include effective under-eye treatments, high-quality wigs, and great value hair accessories. However, they have faced challenges with a few items, namely overpriced products that did not meet comfort expectations and accessories that failed to stay in place. This balance of positive and negative experiences highlights the user's pursuit of quality at reasonable prices while indicating areas for improvement in product offerings.",
