  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:  \nThe user had some favorable experiences, particularly with a makeup brush that was praised highly for effectively applying foundation. This product received multiple five-star ratings, indicating satisfaction with its performance and quality. The majority of positive feedback highlighted the ease of use and effectiveness, suggesting a preference for products that enhance makeup application.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:  \nThere were notable negative experiences reflected in the user's feedback. A face wash and makeup remover received low ratings due to limitations, specifically not being suitable for use around the eyes, which was an intended purpose for the purchase. Additionally, the hair styling tools led to disappointment, as one product failed to spin effectively in fine hair, while another left hair crimped instead of providing the expected volume. These interactions indicate frustration with product effectiveness.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:  \nThe user's shopping experience reveals both satisfaction and dissatisfaction with a variety of beauty products. Positive experiences were characterized by high ratings for tools that enhanced makeup application, showcasing a strong preference for those items. Conversely, negative feedback centered around products that didn't meet expectations, particularly in terms of performance and usability. This mixed experience highlights the crucial role of product functionality in the user's overall satisfaction.",
