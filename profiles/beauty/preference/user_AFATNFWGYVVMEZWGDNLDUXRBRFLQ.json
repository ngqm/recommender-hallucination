Well, I do have &#34;nicer&#34; (aka at least more expensive, anyways) plates, and had gone through that whole phase w the bridal registry picks, fancy parties and such. Lately tho, I am back to ease of use, and simple living is far more important to me. I've been purchasing Corelle plates and bowls again, which I like to use the most, because nothing beats their lightweight and thin design, and I love their bright designs, like this newer South Beach pattern, which is just very Happy.

Oz', 'Number of Items': '1'}\nReview Text: This Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Skin \u2013 Hydrating Facial Moisturizer is a very good moisturizing acid, with the benefit of stimulating skin sloughing and renewal over time. The texture is like a lightweight syrup (but not sticky), and it has very little fragrance. This goes on the face smoothly and provides a protective, lightly moisturizing feel that does not sting at all. I like how my face feels very soft and dewy when I wake up, as I use this before bedtime. I think my skin has definitely improved in texture over the few weeks I've used this.\nReview Title: Lightly Moisturizing and Non-Stinging\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Segbeauty empty bottle 290\nReview Date: 2019/10/21\nStore: TruuMe\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Segbeauty', 'Color': 'Clear', 'Material Type Free': 'Dairy Free', 'Item Weight': '3.4 Ounces', 'Bottle Nipple Type': 'Vented', 'Package Dimensions': '7.99 x 3.19 x 2.24 inches; 3.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'AM-160083-03', 'UPC': '701822757553 701822760621'}\nReview Text: This Fine Mist Clear Bottles, Segbeauty 5.4oz/160ml Continuous Plastic Spray Squirt Bottle is a unique style spray bottle that mists fairly well, without the typical pump action you need with regular manual spray bottles. This has a pressurized lever that provides a longer spray with one squeeze. The mist is fine, but not quite as fine as I was hoping- it's more granular than a steamer or vibration dispenser (like cool mist vaporizers), but this is manual, so I guess I'm complaining for no reason. For a hand pump spray, this is a very good (fine) spray overall.  They recommend that you not put anything but water in the device, and I'm guessing that may be due to it being easy to clog. So, if you do add some other products in the bottle, just be aware that it's not recommended.\nReview Title: Unique, Manual Squeeze-type Water Spray\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Nail Files and Buffers, Teenitor 16PCS Professional Nail Manicure Tool for Acrylic Nails, 100/180 and 120/240 Grits Emery Boards 120 Grits Nail Buffer Block for Shaping and Buffing Nails\nReview Date: 2020/01/22\nStore: Teenitor\nAverage Rating: 4.6\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '7 x 6 x 1 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nReview Text: This Teenitor Nail File And Buffer gives you quite a bit of product at a good price.

This easily adds a pastel color to my lighter hair with a smallish amount of product.  I could see that to change up dark hair or to get a strong/intense color tone, you'd need to pile this stuff on, and I think that's where this gets a bad rap. Yes, you can glob this on to higher opacity and change your dark colored hair to the color shown in the jar. BUT, you need a lot to do this, and you may not like the sticky, waxy result -it is wax, after all. If you are using a little bit (about a quarter sized blob) and adding this through your washed and wet hair and then blow dry, your hair will still move naturally and have the lighter tone of the product, provided your hair was fairly light to begin with-- just my two cents.\nReview Title: Very Good For Some Purposes, Difficult For Others\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: 360 Pieces French False Nails Artificial Fingernails Pink White French Fake Nail Tips Kit 12 Sizes Full Cover with Nail Files and Stick for Salon DIY Decoration\nReview Date: 2020/02/14\nStore: Mudder\nAverage Rating: 3.6\nProduct Details: {'Size': '370 Piece Set', 'Material': 'Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS)', 'Brand': 'Mudder', 'Style': 'French', 'Coverage': 'Full Well Tips', 'Product Dimensions': '7.09 x 1.97 x 0.79 inches; 1.76 Ounces'}\nReview Text: Having tried many fake nail tops, I know they fit differently for everyone. I feel very lucky that this particular set fits my nail bed very well- so much so that I barely have to file them to fit, and they conform to the curvature of my nail as well. These are on the slightly thinner side, which I prefer, because they feel and look a lot more natural on top. The length is perfect too- not too long.<br /><br />I lightly buffed the top of these and painted them w regular nail polish. If I polish without buffing, they can crinkle a bit - I have not tried gel yet tho, and that probably will work out w a clear top if I want to keep the white tip look. Even without polish, the buffed look just looks like a beautiful pink matte polish, as if I had painted them that way on purpose. Some commenters have said the white part scratches off somewhat easily. This is true. But, I love these for the natural look and great fit, and am buying another set now, so I never run out.\nReview Title: Best Nails I've Tried- Very Good Fit For Me\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Straight 13x4 Lace Front Wigs Burgundy Lace Front Wigs Long Bob Synthetic Ombre Wine Red Wig Pre-plucked with Baby Hair Free Part Heat Resistant Synthetic Lace Wigs for Women 20 Inch\nReview Date: 2020/06/05\nStore: NOBLE\nAverage Rating: 3.8\nProduct Details: {'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Special Feature': 'Heat Resistant', 'Brand': 'NOBLE', 'Package Dimensions': '13.74 x 7.87 x 2.2 inches; 12.63 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I really love this NOBLE Natural Straight Lace Front Wigs Burgundy Color- it's only slightly burgundy- and more auburn imo, but it looks very natural and not artificially colored.

Well, I do have &#34;nicer&#34; (aka at least more expensive, anyways) plates, and had gone through that whole phase w the bridal registry picks, fancy parties and such. Lately tho, I am back to ease of use, and simple living is far more important to me. I've been purchasing Corelle plates and bowls again, which I like to use the most, because nothing beats their lightweight and thin design, and I love their bright designs, like this newer South Beach pattern, which is just very Happy.  Some things just are good, and stay good, no matter how many years pass.\nReview Title: Awesome Corelle.

Beauty and Skin Care\nReview Date: 2019/06/17\nStore: Temer\nAverage Rating: 4.2\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Temer', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Active Ingredients': 'Hyaluronic_acid', 'Unit Count': '1 Fl. Oz', 'Number of Items': '1'}\nReview Text: This Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Skin \u2013 Hydrating Facial Moisturizer is a very good moisturizing acid, with the benefit of stimulating skin sloughing and renewal over time. The texture is like a lightweight syrup (but not sticky), and it has very little fragrance. This goes on the face smoothly and provides a protective, lightly moisturizing feel that does not sting at all. I like how my face feels very soft and dewy when I wake up, as I use this before bedtime. I think my skin has definitely improved in texture over the few weeks I've used this.\nReview Title: Lightly Moisturizing and Non-Stinging\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Segbeauty empty bottle 290\nReview Date: 2019/10/21\nStore: TruuMe\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Segbeauty', 'Color': 'Clear', 'Material Type Free': 'Dairy Free', 'Item Weight': '3.4 Ounces', 'Bottle Nipple Type': 'Vented', 'Package Dimensions': '7.99 x 3.19 x 2.24 inches; 3.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'AM-160083-03', 'UPC': '701822757553 701822760621'}\nReview Text: This Fine Mist Clear Bottles, Segbeauty 5.4oz/160ml Continuous Plastic Spray Squirt Bottle is a unique style spray bottle that mists fairly well, without the typical pump action you need with regular manual spray bottles. This has a pressurized lever that provides a longer spray with one squeeze. The mist is fine, but not quite as fine as I was hoping- it's more granular than a steamer or vibration dispenser (like cool mist vaporizers), but this is manual, so I guess I'm complaining for no reason. For a hand pump spray, this is a very good (fine) spray overall.  They recommend that you not put anything but water in the device, and I'm guessing that may be due to it being easy to clog. So, if you do add some other products in the bottle, just be aware that it's not recommended.\nReview Title: Unique, Manual Squeeze-type Water Spray\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Nail Files and Buffers, Teenitor 16PCS Professional Nail Manicure Tool for Acrylic Nails, 100/180 and 120/240 Grits Emery Boards 120 Grits Nail Buffer Block for Shaping and Buffing Nails\nReview Date: 2020/01/22\nStore: Teenitor\nAverage Rating: 4.6\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '7 x 6 x 1 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nReview Text: This Teenitor Nail File And Buffer gives you quite a bit of product at a good price. This includes the 10 large 2 sided nail files as well as the 6 soft sponge smoothing finishers. These work well for either smoothing out the ridges on your natural nails, or doing doing a final once over for a clean finish. I wouldn't be using these for the first pass on acrylics though, as the grit is too fine. This is a good value set.\nReview Title: Good Value For A Finishing Smoother Set\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Sliver Grey Hair Color Wax Temporary Hairstyle Cream 4.23 oz Hair Pomades Natural White Hairstyle Wax for Party Cosplay Halloween Date (Grey)\u2026\nReview Date: 2020/01/22\nStore: SOVONCARE\nAverage Rating: 3.1\nProduct Details: {'Hair Type': 'All', 'Item Form': 'Wax', 'Brand': 'SOVONCARE', 'Unit Count': '4.23 Fl Oz', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2.94 x 2.94 x 2.11 inches; 6.38 Ounces', 'UPC': '725732252984'}\nReview Text: I have about 5 different colors of this Mofajang Hair Color Wax Temporary Hairstyle Cream, and I purchased them before I got this gray sample to try. what I like about these products is that they add a temporary color to my already light grey hair- such as a pink or purple tinge or even a darker gray or darker blue gray...you get the picture. This easily adds a pastel color to my lighter hair with a smallish amount of product.  I could see that to change up dark hair or to get a strong/intense color tone, you'd need to pile this stuff on, and I think that's where this gets a bad rap. Yes, you can glob this on to higher opacity and change your dark colored hair to the color shown in the jar. BUT, you need a lot to do this, and you may not like the sticky, waxy result -it is wax, after all. If you are using a little bit (about a quarter sized blob) and adding this through your washed and wet hair and then blow dry, your hair will still move naturally and have the lighter tone of the product, provided your hair was fairly light to begin with-- just my two cents.\nReview Title: Very Good For Some Purposes, Difficult For Others\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: 360 Pieces French False Nails Artificial Fingernails Pink White French Fake Nail Tips Kit 12 Sizes Full Cover with Nail Files and Stick for Salon DIY Decoration\nReview Date: 2020/02/14\nStore: Mudder\nAverage Rating: 3.6\nProduct Details: {'Size': '370 Piece Set', 'Material': 'Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS)', 'Brand': 'Mudder', 'Style': 'French', 'Coverage': 'Full Well Tips', 'Product Dimensions': '7.09 x 1.97 x 0.79 inches; 1.76 Ounces'}\nReview Text: Having tried many fake nail tops, I know they fit differently for everyone. I feel very lucky that this particular set fits my nail bed very well- so much so that I barely have to file them to fit, and they conform to the curvature of my nail as well. These are on the slightly thinner side, which I prefer, because they feel and look a lot more natural on top. The length is perfect too- not too long.<br /><br />I lightly buffed the top of these and painted them w regular nail polish. If I polish without buffing, they can crinkle a bit - I have not tried gel yet tho, and that probably will work out w a clear top if I want to keep the white tip look. Even without polish, the buffed look just looks like a beautiful pink matte polish, as if I had painted them that way on purpose. Some commenters have said the white part scratches off somewhat easily. This is true. But, I love these for the natural look and great fit, and am buying another set now, so I never run out.\nReview Title: Best Nails I've Tried- Very Good Fit For Me\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Straight 13x4 Lace Front Wigs Burgundy Lace Front Wigs Long Bob Synthetic Ombre Wine Red Wig Pre-plucked with Baby Hair Free Part Heat Resistant Synthetic Lace Wigs for Women 20 Inch\nReview Date: 2020/06/05\nStore: NOBLE\nAverage Rating: 3.8\nProduct Details: {'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Special Feature': 'Heat Resistant', 'Brand': 'NOBLE', 'Package Dimensions': '13.74 x 7.87 x 2.2 inches; 12.63 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I really love this NOBLE Natural Straight Lace Front Wigs Burgundy Color- it's only slightly burgundy- and more auburn imo, but it looks very natural and not artificially colored. The texture is also smooth and heavy, but it's slippery or shiny. This fits my head very comfortably and looked great out of the box with very little plucking or adjusting.

The top has a rubberized part that looks better imo than the circular spot part that a lot of less pricey wigs have, and the hair is thick with a lot of gradations in color that make this very pretty. My daughter thought it was too shiny, but a little powder will take that out. The only thing I'd note is that this is less ash blonde than I expected in color- it's has more of a darker blonde/ reddish/ golden tone- still very pretty however.\nReview Title: Pretty Wig- Very Comfortable, Well Made\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: 16 Jars Chrome Nail Powder Kit Mirror Effect Manicure Decoration Pigment 16 Colors Art Nail Powders with 16pcs Eyeshadow Sticks, 1g/Jar (Mirror-16 Jars)\nReview Date: 2021/02/20\nStore: FIFATA\nAverage Rating: 4.2\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'FIFATA', 'Item Weight': '1 Grams', 'Number of Pieces': '16', 'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Arts', 'Package Dimensions': '7.6 x 7 x 2.6 inches; 0.04 Ounces'}\nReview Text: This 16 Jars Chrome Nail Powder Kit Mirror Effect Manicure Decoration Pigment is a set with more colors than I can use, and it's a good value.

I received a good quality unit with thick feeling hair that looked like virgin hair. The lace front was as expected and the part was easy to move around naturally. I only deducted a star because the hair became a bit thinner near the ends, a bit more than usual, and I'd recommend getting a longer length if you are planning to get a straight cut at the bottom vs. more of a \"v\" shape.\nReview Title: Comfortable Cap, Good Quality and Weight\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: AISI BEAUTY Short Wavy Bob Wig with Bangs Shoulder Length Burgundy Synthetic Bob Curly Wigs for Women Natural Looking Heat Resistant Fiber Hair\nReview Date: 2021/06/06\nStore: AISI BEAUTY\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy, Curly', 'Brand': 'AISI BEAUTY', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '12.13 x 9.21 x 2.95 inches; 9.59 Ounces'}\nReview Text: This AISI BEAUTY Short Wavy Bob Wig with Bangs Shoulder Length Burgundy is a comfortable unit with straight across bangs and a wavy, casual look.

  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:  \nThe user has expressed strong satisfaction with various products highlighting their quality and aesthetic appeal. They have praised the realistic appearance and comfort of several wigs, noting that some wigs resemble natural hair and fit well, enhancing their overall look. Corelle plates have also been appreciated for their lightweight design and durability, reminiscent of fond childhood memories. Additionally, the moisturizing serum has been commended for its non-sticky texture and effective hydrating properties, leading to improved skin softness and health. Overall, the user enjoys products that combine functionality with visual charm across multiple categories.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:  \nDespite several positive experiences, the user has encountered some dissatisfaction. Notably, certain products, especially some wigs, received lower ratings due to issues like unexpected color variations and texture not meeting expectations. A temporary hair color wax was critiqued for requiring excessive product for desired results and leaving a sticky feel. Additionally, false nails were noted for their tendency to scratch easily, detracting from their appeal. These concerns indicate that while some items excel in quality, others may fall short in terms of performance or durability.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:  \nThe user's purchasing history showcases a blend of delightful products and areas for improvement. They have consistently enjoyed high-quality items like wigs and kitchenware, praising realism, comfort, and nostalgia, while also receiving value from beauty and nail products. Nonetheless, some experiences highlighted concerns regarding product performance, such as color fidelity and texture, reflecting mixed feelings about certain purchases. Overall, the shopping behavior reveals a balance of excitement for well-made items alongside caution for those that may not meet expectations.",
