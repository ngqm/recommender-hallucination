And I\u2019m thrilled to find that Amazon has it so I can never be without it! I have waist-length hair that is kinky curly with gray hair throughout that I wear straightened. This product is the only one that keeps my hair from frizzing no matter how hot and humid it gets! And the shine and softness of my hair is the best it\u2019s ever been. I use it after using It\u2019s A Ten Miracle Silk Leave-In after washing my hair with Wen.<br /><br />Even if you have long hair, use this stuff sparingly and make sure you liquify it in the palms of your hand and between your fingers before you put it through your hair.<br /><br />Another plus: the huge bottle lasts me about 6 months. Keep in mind my hair is dry so I only wash it twice a week. Knowing that, you can gauge how long this bottle will last you.\nReview Title: Best Anti-Frizz Hair Product I\u2019ve Ever Used\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: FESHFEN Straight Long Ponytail Extensions 24 Inch Wrap Around Synthetic Hair Piece Magic Paste Pony Tail Hair Extensions Hairpieces for Women Girls\nReview Date: 2019/12/02\nStore: FESHFEN\nAverage Rating: 3.3\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'FESHFEN', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '14.96 x 3.58 x 0.75 inches; 5.19 Ounces'}\nReview Text: Difficult to get the hair \u2018wrap\u2019 wrapped around my own ponytail  because the Velcro sticks to the fake hair.

  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user has had notable successes with certain hair care products, particularly appreciating one leave-in conditioner for effectively reducing frizz and enhancing shine and softness. This product stood out for its ability to manage hair during humid conditions, a significant benefit for someone with longer, curly hair. The user valued the product's ample size for longevity and praised another set of hair extensions for their beautiful color match, which positively impacted their overall satisfaction. Excellent customer service was highlighted in another interaction, where the company promptly addressed issues with quality, reinforcing a positive brand experience.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user encountered several significant disappointments with hair extensions. Common issues included mismatched colors and the claim of Remy hair not being upheld, leading to matting problems. The difficulty in using a particular ponytail extension due to its heaviness and poor attachment further detracted from the experience. The frustrations were compounded by defective tape on another extension set that made application tedious and time-consuming. Overall, the user expressed regret over specific purchases and indicated that some products resulted in less than satisfactory outcomes.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user's shopping experience reflects a mix of positive and negative outcomes. They enjoyed an effective leave-in conditioner that provided excellent hydration and frizz control, alongside favorable interactions with customer service for defective products. Conversely, several hair extension purchases were marred by quality issues, including color mismatches, matting, and poor adhesion, leading to frustration. Overall, while some products boosted their hair care routine positively, considerable dissatisfaction arose from failed purchases, indicating variability in product reliability and performance.",
