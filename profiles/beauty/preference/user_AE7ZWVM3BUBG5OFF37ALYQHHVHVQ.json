The instructions and all the ads on Amazon are in Korean, and I HIGHLY recommend that the sellers switch this to include English instructions. I had to go to their website in order to find out the ingredients and what it was supposed to do for the skin, and most people aren't going to do that.<br />To continue, the balm contains 2 plant ingredientspine sprouts and centella asiatica roots.  The cica pine water helps sooth and moisturize sensitive skin.  The color in the balm comes from calamine powder, which helps cover red areas of the skin.  It is a 100% vegan formula.  The balm comes in a compact with a puff applicator.  The puff is eco-friendly and anti-bacterial.  This is meant to be applied as the last step during the skincare routine and before you apply your makeup.<br /><br />Overall, I found this product easy to apply.  You dip the poof into the cream balm, and then apply it to the skin. It has an almost creamy texture on the skin, and absorbs in quickly.  It has a slight white cast when I used it but that went away as it absorbed in.  I was hoping to use this as a color corrective on red areas on my skin before I applied concealer (I currently do not use foundation).  Overall I think it is nice, but it really hasn't gotten rid of any redness on my skin.  I do like the way it feels though and I think it helps my makeup go on smoother, so I plan to keep using it.\nReview Title: Calming face balm\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: essence | Welcome to Miami Eyeshadow Palette | 12 Highly Pigmented, Blendable Shades | Matte & Metallic | Vegan & Cruelty Free | Made Without Oil, Fragrance, Parabens, Alcohol, & Microplastic Particles\nReview Date: 2022/08/26\nStore: essence cosmetics\nProduct Description: [\"\u00a1BIENVENIDOS A MIAMI!

  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:  \nThe user has expressed satisfaction with several skincare and makeup products, highlighting aspects such as effective hydration, luxurious textures, and enjoyable application experiences. Positive feedback includes the quick absorption of creams, soothing properties of balms, and high pigmentation of eyeshadows. The lightweight nature and skin-soothing benefits of products created a feeling of softness and comfort. Additionally, the user appreciated products that were eco-friendly, vegan, and free from harmful ingredients. Overall, the aesthetic appeal and enjoyable results fostered a positive shopping experience.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:  \nDespite the mostly favorable reviews, the user noted several issues that detracted from their experiences. A heavy perfume scent in one face cream was particularly off-putting, leading to a reduced rating. Instructions for one product were only available in a foreign language, causing confusion. Additionally, expectations for packaging were unmet for a serum, which arrived in a basic and less appealing form. Some products did not deliver the expected corrective results for skin redness, leading to some disappointment. \n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:  \nThe user's shopping experience reflects a mix of satisfaction and frustration. While many products delivered positive results in terms of hydration, texture, and effectiveness, there were notable grievances regarding scents, language barriers in instructions, and insufficient packaging. Despite these issues, the enjoyable aspects of the products, particularly in skincare and makeup application, suggest that the overall experience remains predominantly positive, with room for improvement in certain areas.",
