These are nice and flexible, making removal super easy.  They can be reused, once you clean them and sanitize them with rubbing alcohol.  These are more square at the cuticle area, great for those with a more square shaped nail bed, my thumbs are pretty square.  They come in 10 sizes (10 of each size) and the sizes are reasonable sizing too.  I have dual forms from another brand and half of them are unreasonably HUGE, whereas these are for normal people.  For my thumb I used size 2 and my other fingers fit 4-8.  They came in a plastic organizer case that is way smaller than my other case, so they don't take up a ton of room in my nail station.  The latch on mine didn't close tight, so I had to use a piece of tape, but I'm not taking off any stars because that didn't affect the usefulness of the product itself.  All in all, the C curve was perfect, easy to load, cure and pinch off.  I found these to be perfect for anyone who wants a square cuticle line, rather than a round one. I purchased this thru my Amazon Prime account and did not receive any compensation for this completely unbiased review.\nReview Title: I found these to be perfect for anyone who wants a square cuticle line, rather than a round one.\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: 10Pack 2oz Plastic Empty Spray Bottle, Mostof Fine Mist Small Clear Travel Plastic Bottles Container with Funnels Labels\nReview Date: 2020/07/29\nStore: Mostof\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Mostof', 'Capacity': '2 Ounces', 'Special Feature': 'Mist Spray', 'Product Care Instructions': 'Hand Wash Only', 'Reusability': 'Reusable', 'Package Dimensions': '6.5 x 6.3 x 3.9 inches; 8.78 Ounces', 'UPC': '634715829481'}\nReview Text: This is a nice spray bottle kit, it comes with 2 funnels and a sheet of labels, I found the labels too small for use, each one is approximately 1 inch x 1/2 inch in diameter, and not sure if it can be used in an inkjet printer or not. All 10 spray bottles included all the necessary parts, and the stem that draws up liquid was long in each one, none were short and I really appreciated that. You should be able to spray down to the last drop.  I tested mine with rubbing alcohol, for sanitizing my phones. The funnel came in handy for filling the bottle. It made the job so easy! The sprayer does spray a very fine mist. I used it several times to clean some things then left it overnight with the cap on. Next day I tested it again. First off, the cap contained some of the rubbing alcohol inside it, which means the container will leak into the cap standing up. Not necessarily a huge deal breaker, but a negative for me. Holding it in my hand I got the rubbing alcohol on my finger too, so this may waste product just from this. Several drops every 24 hours may not seem like a lot, but if you make your own essential oil room spray then this could be an expensive waste. Lastly, I had an issue with the spray top, the angle is so slight I wasn't sure if I would spray myself in the face of I wasn't wearing eyeglasses. You have to be careful, ensuring you're spraying away from yourself. I did not get any leakage of the alcohol out of the cap, it seemed pretty tight.  It did pool in the cap, didn't run down the bottle.  I did get a rubbing alcohol ring when I set down the cap on my coffee table tho.  Beware of that possibility whatever you use in these bottles.<br />All in all, a nice kit and I give it 4 stars.\nReview Title: I got leaking inside the cap, but it didn't come out.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: UV LED Nail Lamp 36w, Portable USB Gel Nail Dryer, Polish Nail Light for Home and Travel, White\nReview Date: 2020/10/29\nStore: KOCECER\nAverage Rating: 3.4\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'KOCECER', 'Special Feature': 'Rechargeable', 'Light Source Type': 'LED', 'Room Type': 'Usb', 'Power Source': 'Battery Powered', 'Package Dimensions': '7.9 x 7.5 x 3.5 inches; 10.09 Ounces', 'UPC': '791555028525'}\nReview Text: This is a nice little UV & LED cure lamp, it is smaller than the other ones I have, so it takes up less space.

This does come with little gloves that were to protect the skin, and I'm sure they help a little bit.  I did have plenty of room to cure my full hand, but I did my thump separately.  I find that when you use these lamps it is best to turn on the lamp and slowly insert your hand with the timer started so you don't get those heat spikes.

They are 13.5 ml each, and made in the U.S.A.  Initially I thought I would love Stay Nude the most, but it ended up being my least favorite of the set, only because it is pearl and streaks are unavoidable due to the type of finish it is.  All 4 have a shiny topcoat built into the formula.  The 3 cremes are all very sheer formulas, not super opaque.  The thickness of the formula for all of these is good.  If you like a sheer formula, where you can see your nail bed thru the polish, then these are your jam.  I did several manicures with each of them, and found that if I wanted a sheer look then 1 coat worked perfectly, otherwise 2 or 3 coats for full coverage and less peek thru of your natural nail and smile line.  I did 2 easy coats for each of my manicures.  The blue (Hypnosis) seemed to have the best coverage, and the formula for that was my favorite of the 4, it dried the fastest at 8 minutes to the touch.  They all go on easily, with a regular round brush (not flat) and they dry fairly well, in about 10-15 minutes each layer.  I did find that using my own quick drying topcoat that these wore much better, but from the manufacturer neither base nor top coat are required.  I did not get any staining from these, which I love.  The pink and white will both be really good polishes for doing either French tip or pond manicures when you just want a sheer base, where you do a layer, do art over it, then cover it again, and more art on that layer-it gives a layered effect that is fun to do.  The color palate is a fun one, with lots of options for artwork.  These are not quick drying-more of the typical 10 minutes per layer, and I expected them to be hardened on their own, without the help of a quick drying topcoat, but that was not the case with them.\nReview Title: Sheer formula, builds well.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: 576 Pieces Medium Length Short Square Press on Nails Matte Fake Nails Full Cover Artificial Acrylic colorful Coffin Nails Tips Kit for DIY Nail Art Salon Nail Gifts for Women Girls\nReview Date: 2021/04/04\nStore: KXAMELIE\nAverage Rating: 3.6\nProduct Details: {'Size': '576 Count (Pack of 1)', 'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'KXAMELIE', 'Style': 'French', 'Pattern': 'Solid', 'Package Dimensions': '9.76 x 6.73 x 0.98 inches; 2.89 Ounces', 'UPC': '749212759893'}\nReview Text: I do like these, first off!  I like the color choices, and that these are already matte.  This is so easy for anyone who doesn't have a lot of time, but wants to do quick nails.  I really appreciate these.  There are a lot, and you have lots of choices.  I wish the maker gave an option for a round cuticle area, instead of these square cuticle area nails.  Looking at these from the side, you can see the space between my real nails and the fake nails...so for anyone who has a long nail bed, their real nails will more than likely show as mine do.  I will use these for nail art, I just can't see changing my real nail shape at the side walls to fit these, that can be hazardous.  The curve of these is good, fitting to the nail plate well.  If you use gel polish, this curve will be more drastic when the gel cures, so be aware of that possibility.

  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user has expressed satisfaction with various products, highlighting their quality and flexibility in design. Positive experiences include the ease of removal and reusability of false nails, as well as the practicality of spray bottles with effective mist functionality. The compact size of the nail lamp was appreciated, allowing for convenient storage, while the nail polish set was enjoyed for its variety and usability, particularly for those who favor sheer finishes. The easy application of nail art and the color options provided in nail kits also contributed to the user's enjoyment.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user encountered several issues, notably with missing items in an art brush kit and problematic aspects of product design. A spray bottle exhibited leakage into the cap, causing potential waste, while the cost of the nail lamp was perceived as slightly higher than similar products. A request for round cuticle options was noted in the false nail sets, as the square cut design did not suit the user's nail shape, leading to discomfort and visible gaps.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user's shopping experiences reflect a mix of positive and negative interactions with products. While they appreciate the quality and functionality of various nail-related items and find value in spray bottle kits, they have faced challenges with missing pieces and design flaws. The combination of positive feedback on aesthetics and ease of use juxtaposed with complaints about product fit and potential leaks paints a picture of a discerning shopper with specific preferences yet a willingness to adapt.",

    "title": "Very sticky, good details, all sheets different.",
    "text": "Very good set, all sheets are diffferent. Size is decent, most of these stickers will fit on an adults nails. Some will fit on a pre-teens nails too. They do stick very well, and they dissolve under pressure and acetone-it takes a bit of time for that.  The details are really good!  Each sticker sheet measures 3 3/4 inches long and 2 1/2 inches wide.  There are some longer stickers - for those with longer nails this is great.  There are some stickers that no matter what won't fit on a normal sized nail and would have to be cut.  There are a lot of tiny hearts and star images that are super cool for little kids to enjoy or to add that little bit extra to a mani.  There is an assortment of flames, flags, peace hands, lips, numbers, uncle Sam hats, lots of hearts, butterflies, and birds. There are even a few high heels and vote checkmarks.  This is a fantastic collection that was well thought out and I'm super impressed.  For anyone with a need for speed to add decor to a mani, these stickers are the way.  We have lots of holidays that can be celebrated using patriotic stickers, such as Labor day, Presidents day, Veterans Day, 4th of July, Gold Star Mothers day, POW recognition day, and Pearl Harbor day.  These are all worthy of recognition with a special manicure.  These are easily lifted and placed using a sharp tipped pair of tweezers and they do stick well!  I even tried them without a top coat, and they stayed for 2 days.",
