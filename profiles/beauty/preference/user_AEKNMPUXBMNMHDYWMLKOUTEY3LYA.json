  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user has consistently highlighted the effectiveness and enjoyment of various skincare and personal care products. They appreciated the solid performance of generic replacement toothbrush heads and found value in a well-presented hydration set, praising its full-size serum and calming effects on their skin. Additionally, many products featured pleasant scents and appealing packaging, enhancing their overall shopping experience. The immediate hydration and fine line reduction from the oil serum was also positively noted. Overall, the user expressed satisfaction with the quality and results of the purchased items.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nDespite primarily positive experiences, the user encountered several drawbacks in their purchases. The face primer was criticized for its application issues, particularly with spray control, leading to unwanted hair contact. Some masks were deemed unsuitable for sensitive skin, resulting in disappointment. The hand lotion left an undesirable film, perhaps due to mineral oil, which affected their preference for use. Finally, a face mask, while pleasant, failed to deliver lasting benefits, leading to a lukewarm impression overall.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user's shopping history reflects a blend of positive and negative experiences. They valued products that offered effective results, good value, and pleasant sensory experiences, citing multiple instances of satisfaction with skincare items. However, issues such as application difficulties, suitability for sensitive skin, and the presence of unwanted residues tempered their enthusiasm at times. This combination of great product efficacy with some application and formulation concerns forms a nuanced picture of their overall experience.",

The packaging is great and they will elevate the feel of the room for anyone who knows the name.  That said when you open them the lather is so-so, the soap leaves a lot to be desired and it leaves a film when it washes off that isn't a nicely scented moisturizer.  So, looks great and it's soap but if it wasn't for the presentation this would be 1 or 2 stars.",
