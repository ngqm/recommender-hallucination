It have a very nice LCD display that is very easy to read. This is a 1 inch ceramic tourmaline flat iron. It worked great in my hair making it very soft, shiny and smooth and it was done very quickly. I also like that it has an auto shut off, since I can easily get distracted. It comes with a very pretty satin drawstring bag, that will be great for putting it in my luggage.\nReview Title: SOFT, SHINY & SMOOTH HAIR\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Leyla Milani Hair - No Crease, No Tug, Ouch-less design, hand dyed, Hair Accessories, Ponytail Holder, stretchy material 4pack, Best Hair Tie for Women, Teens, Girls - All Tied Up Hair Ties - msrp $18\nReview Date: 2018/09/18\nStore: Leyla Milani Hair\nAverage Rating: 4.0\nProduct Details: {'Item Form': 'Ribbon', 'Brand': 'Leyla Milani Hair', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Number of Pieces': '4', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.5 x 3.4 x 0.4 inches; 0.63 Ounces', 'UPC': '855389006491'}\nReview Text: My hair is always breaking and coming off in my hair ties, so recently I have started replacing all my normal hair ties with hair items that are less damaging to my hair.

It has a nicely lit LCD screen. All the buttons are on the inside, which is good since I usually hit the controls on my hair curling wand because they are on the outside. The temperature is adjustable, I only needed it about halfway since I have a finer hair. It does come with a heat resistant glove, instructions and a carrying case/ storage bag. There is a little loop on the cord so you can hang it and the cord also rotates so it doesn't get all tangled up.\nReview Title: HEATS UP VERY FAST & WORKS GREAT\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: L\u2019ange Hair Borago Borage Oil Deep Conditioning Masque | Powerful Nourishing Borage Oil for Hair | Ideal for Medium to Coarse Hair\nReview Date: 2019/04/02\nStore: L'ANGE HAIR\nAverage Rating: 4.6\nProduct Details: {'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '3.6 x 3.6 x 2.5 inches; 10 Ounces', 'Item model number': '2113', 'UPC': '810108191612'}\nReview Text: I had bought myself a  heat cap for my hair because my hair is dry and it has really been thinning since I started becoming middle aged. My sister gave me this deep condition protein  hair mask a few months ago to try. I have been using it once a week and my hair is definitely a lot softer and shinier.

My hair has a mind of its own, so I have to keep it straightened. It is pretty light weight and I really like the black color with the rose gold accents.  It heats up very fast and really left my hair smooth and silky. So far I am very happy with it and to me the true test will be when I go overseas. As you can see in my picture it has an infrared light strip in the center of  the straightener.\nReview Title: DUAL VOLTAGE HAIR STRAIGHTENER\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Flosuber Shower Brush with 100% Natural Loofah, Body Brushes Perfect for Exfoliating, Bath Back Loofahs Brush with Removable Dual-Purpose Long Handle\nReview Date: 2021/05/29\nStore: Flosuber\nAverage Rating: 3.6\nProduct Details: {'Material': 'Sponge', 'Brand': 'Flosuber', 'Power Source': 'Hand_powered', 'Product Benefits': 'Softening,Massage,Pores,Clean,Exfoliating', 'Skin Type': 'Acne Prone,Oily', 'Package Dimensions': '16.02 x 6.69 x 1.26 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'UPC': '782932073702', 'Manufacturer': 'Flosuber'}\nReview Text: As I get older my skin seems to be drier and itchier. I can no longer reach all my back area and this loofah brush is great for getting those areas.  It is always fun to watch how big it can get in water.

It is very well made.\nReview Title: WORKS GREAT\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n        Format your response exactly as follows:\n        POSITIVE SUMMARY:\n        [Your positive summary here]\n\n        NEGATIVE SUMMARY:\n        [Your negative summary here]\n\n        OVERALL SUMMARY:\n        [Your overall summary here]",
