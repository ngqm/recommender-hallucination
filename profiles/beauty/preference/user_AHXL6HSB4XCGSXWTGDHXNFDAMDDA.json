I am not a professional at all and can barely paint my own nails. I watched a couple of YouTube videos before giving this a try and I didn't do terrible! Here are some pointers for those of you that are trying this out for the first time.<br />1) you need to have a uv/led curing light. You start with the clear base and cure it before applying the gel. Apply the gel and cure, then apply the top coat and cure.<br />2) thick but not too thick!- If you make it too thin, the tips will just bend and break off. You need to make sure that you are putting it on about the consistency of the plastic nail that you use to apply the gel.<br />3) Don't forget to fix the bottom of the nail tip before you cure. If you don't do this you will have a giant glob of hardened get that you will need to file down.<br />4) If you don't want an ombre effect, you will need to make sure that the thickness is consistent from the top to the bottom of the nail.<br />5) Have a few disposable nail files. The giant one that comes with the kit isn't my favorite because it is quite bulky. I used a few coarse nail files to really get the shape that I wanted.<br /><br />The kit itself is nicely put together, I just wish there were directions with it. You will need to have a lamp, nail file, cuticle cutter, and nail trimmers to accomplish your finished nails which is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5.\nReview Title: first time\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: UV LED Nail Lamp Mercase,72W Gel uv light for Fingernail & Toenail Gel Based Polishes \u2013 Portable Nail Curing Light with 36pcs LEDs, 4 Timer Settings & Smart Sensor (White)\nReview Date: 2021/02/15\nStore: Mercase\nAverage Rating: 4.2\nProduct Details: {}\nReview Text: Finally, a UV light that I can fit my entire hand in including my thumb! The first thing I noticed when I took it out of the package was the multiple power ports on the back of the unit. It comes with a cable already to plug into any outlet but I guess if you wanted to use your own cord you could. I ended up plugging my nail drill/file into the back of the unit so I didn't have multiple things to plug into separate outlets. The lights go around the entire inside of the dome so you don't have to worry about your hand being flat. It has 3 different settings on the top for 30/60/90 seconds. I just watched the timer on the top of the unit that counts up every time you put your hand or foot in. I like that the entire unit is plastic and not metal. The light also shuts off when you remove your hand.

  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user has expressed satisfaction with several products, highlighting positive features and experiences. Notably, the ease of use and functionality of a nail lamp was praised for its design, allowing the entire hand to fit comfortably, and the timer settings were appreciated. The silicone back scrubber received commendations for its easy cleaning and effective design along with the convenience of included hooks. Additionally, a hair mask was noted for its pleasant scent and noticeable improvement in hair texture, despite the small container size. The user showed enjoyment in the overall effectiveness and practicality of the products.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user experienced dissatisfaction with a few purchases, pointing out major drawbacks. A nail kit was criticized for missing essential color polish and having runny top/base coats, affecting application. The self-tanner's performance fell short of expectations, as it dispensed unevenly, leading to blotchy results and an undesirable texture. Moreover, the user expressed disappointment about the hair mask's quantity due to needing excessive product for full coverage. Overall, these negative experiences centered around product expectations not being met and usability issues.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user's shopping experiences reveal a mixture of satisfaction and frustration with their purchases. Positive aspects include effective designs, practical features, and beneficial results from various products, particularly in the beauty and grooming categories. However, there were notable negative experiences, particularly related to missing or inadequate product components and inconsistent results, suggesting a discrepancy between expectations and reality. The overall trend shows a discerning shopper who values both functionality and reliability in product efficacy while being frustrated by unmet product claims.",
