  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user has demonstrated satisfaction with a few purchases, particularly enjoying the quality and fullness associated with specific hair bundles. Users noted that some products maintained good length and softness, indicating potential satisfaction with their overall appearance and texture. Positive ratings suggest that there were moments of happiness, particularly with the value offered by certain extensions, bringing forth a sense of assurance in certain brands.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user has experienced numerous disappointments, primarily concerning excessive shedding in many hair products, leading to unsatisfactory volume and styling difficulties. Thinning quality was an ongoing concern, with repeated comments about items being unexpectedly lightweight or appearing shorter than advertised. Additional negatives included tangling issues and poor fit or comfort of wigs, resulting in a lack of confidence in the products and financial adjustments for refunds.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user's shopping experience reflects a blend of positive and negative outcomes. While there were moments of satisfaction regarding the softness and quality of specific hair extensions, the overwhelming trend indicates significant frustration with shedding, inadequate density, and misrepresentations of product length and quality. Many products received low ratings, pushing the user to reconsider future purchases, yet there might be a willingness to explore new options based on the few favorable interactions. Overall, this suggests a cautious approach to future hair-related products.",
