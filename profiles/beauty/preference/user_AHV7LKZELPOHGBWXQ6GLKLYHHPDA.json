I didn't really use it even though it was a great idea it was just uncomfortable and kept fogging up. The foam around it is rough and hurt the soft skin around my eye. The strap I found to be fine once I tied it off to fit me. I still have it and if I ever have another bout of BP I might glue or somehow put some soft fabric around it.

Not like teenage acne but I get little flesh colored bumps in certain areas/patches on my face and neck. I started thinking maybe I had too much bacteria on my face even though I wash it everyday but decided to use dial soap on it. That wasn't helping at all. I heard that serums are really good on your face and if your face isn't well moisturized it will produce more sebum which in turns can cause more acne. This stuff has been great! It's not completely gone but it's a lot better. I didn't take any pictures cause since they were flesh colored you could hardly see them especially in a photo. I feel like my skin glows a little better since I've been using this too. I was afraid \"vit C\" would break me out cause of the acids but Apparently it's the opposite.

  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:  \nThe user had notable positive experiences with certain products. They expressed satisfaction with skin care items, highlighting significant improvements in skin condition and overall appearance. Softness was appreciated in a reusable makeup remover, which both the user and their child found enjoyable for daily use. Additionally, the affordability and functionality of hair clipper attachments received praise, indicating a positive sentiment toward value for money. A hair scissors kit was acknowledged for its usefulness, despite minor concerns regarding other components. The variety and comfort of fashion accessories were also well-received by both the user and their daughter.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:  \nSeveral negative experiences were reported, primarily concerning comfort and effectiveness. One product was deemed uncomfortable due to a rough design, leading to dissatisfaction despite its potential benefits. A lash growth serum raised safety concerns due to the risk of irritation, resulting in a lack of trust. Similarly, a nail file set was criticized for its impracticality, as it failed to perform adequately. The quality of included capes in grooming kits was consistently noted as subpar, frustrating the user. Further disappointment was expressed regarding a hair accessory that arrived damaged, highlighting concerns about quality assurance.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:  \nThe user's shopping experiences reflect a mix of satisfaction and frustration. Positive aspects include effective skin care solutions, comforting accessories, and value-rated grooming tools. However, significant dissatisfaction arose from issues of comfort, product effectiveness, and quality concerns, particularly regarding safety with eye-care products. The user\u2019s feedback suggests that while some items provide favorable results and value, certain products failed to meet expectations, leading to mixed feelings regarding future purchases.

    "text": "I ordered this because I have a couple teeth that food gets stuck in a LOT and it's super annoying. I was using those picks but not only are they expensive BUT I noticed some of the plastic on it would be gone after using it on my teeth. Where was the plastic going? It was there and now it's not so it must be in my mouth! We do NOT need to be swallowing any more plastic!! I have a regular water pick and tooth brush combo but saw this and thought it would be GREAT travel with! Comes with a nice little bag to put it in which is nice because once you put water in it, unless you take it apart, there will be some water left in there. I squirt out as much as I can when I'm done but it's not totally cleaned out. That being said I think it's probably wise after a couple of months at least if not sooner you should maybe run some vinegar through it to clean it really well. I did that to start with to clean it before I used it.<br /><br />As for the settings.... I would like if there were more than 3 but for a travel one I'm OK with it only being 3. As another reviewer said, you DO need to make sure the light is lit on the setting you want to start off with. I'm used to using a water pick so I like it up pretty high but you may not! If you're new start low.<br />I can get through all of my teeth in my water tank but I have to go fast. If I've had some sticky stuff I may have to fill it back up again for a second go round. I saw some bigger ones but I like how this one is a little smaller. It does it's job.<br />I don't have a problem with cleaning mine after each go round. Someone mentioned cleaning it after each time. I just wipe it off with my hand towel. It's water that came out of my mouth. I have my own hand towel that no one else uses and it's my spit and I wash my hands afterwards so I don't feel it needs to be sanitized all the time. Maybe if you were sharing it but this is mine!<br /><br />I really like how you can charge it in any USB adapter. Super convenient these days.<br /><br />It comes with several pieces. For the normal water picker to blow stuff from your teeth then there's plenty for others in the family or if you just want to use another while one is drying from being cleaned or something. I haven't used the tongue piece yet. I have a tongue scraper I'm fond of so this doesn't appeal to me.<br />I do really recommend this!",
