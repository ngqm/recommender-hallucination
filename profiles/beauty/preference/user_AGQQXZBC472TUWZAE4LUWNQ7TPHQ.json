  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user has consistently expressed satisfaction with various hair extension purchases, noting high quality and appealing colors. They appreciate the softness and blendability of the products, indicating a preference for natural-looking results. Additionally, the durability of the extensions is highlighted, with many reviews mentioning that they remain intact for several weeks. The user has also praised the ease of maintenance, sharing effective care tips that support the longevity of the products.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user has encountered some issues with certain products, particularly regarding shedding and dryness. There is concern over the amount of hair lost during use, as well as the necessity for additional conditioning to maintain the hair's texture and appearance. One product review for cleansing wipes indicates dissatisfaction due to insufficient moisture and visibility problems, leading to a recommendation against future purchases. \n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nOverall, the user's experience reflects a strong preference for high-quality hair extensions, with multiple reviews celebrating their beauty, blendability, and durability. While they have encountered challenges with shedding and dryness, these issues do not overshadow their positive experiences. The user shows a willingness to adapt their care routine to achieve optimal results. However, their recent experience with cleansing wipes demonstrates a disconnect in product expectations, which may influence future shopping decisions.",
