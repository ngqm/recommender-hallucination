You don't have to constantly change the heads on this.<br /><br />However, when you rotate the heads you have to hold down a button on one side and then use the very small rotater to change heads. It makes it a bit difficult to change the heads.<br /><br />Also, I had problems with it constantly stopping while I was using it. And my calluses aren't even that bad. If you just have a bit of dry skin this will probably work for you, otherwise you're going to want to skip it.\nReview Title: Not very powerful\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Zeitun Natural Anti Cellulite Body Scrub - Organic Coffee Body Scrub Exfoliator With Robusta & Dead Sea Salt - Cinnamon, Ginger And Moisturizing Oils, 7 oz\nReview Date: 2020/09/28\nStore: Zeitun\nAverage Rating: 3.8\nProduct Details: {'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.57 x 5.91 x 8.27 inches; 7 Ounces'}\nReview Text: This scrub smells wonderful, just like ground coffee.
