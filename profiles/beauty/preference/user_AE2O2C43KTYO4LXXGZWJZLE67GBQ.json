All 50 capes were placed on top of each other. Then, it was folded lengthwise in half, then folded multiple times so that the resulting product fit neatly inside a rectangular-shaped plastic bag.<br /><br />To get 1 cape, I unfold the entire 50 capes, get one cape, and fold the rest of the capes back in their original form. Once I got a cape, then re-folded the rest of the capes, I could not get it to fit back into the plastic bag. So, we put the capes in a grocery bag.<br /><br />A cape measures 59 inches in length x 50-1/4 inches in width.<br /><br />I smelled no odors emanating from these capes.<br /><br />These capes are thin, fragile, see-through, and when a family member tied the top part of the cape around my neck (much like how a barber would do at the barber shop), the plastic \"string\" broke. So, with the next cape, he was more cautious in tying the string. We are able to carefully tie the string tightly around the neck, and then use clips to tie other parts of the cape around the back of my neck and shoulders. This way, I could get a hair cut, and not have hair falling down on my neck/shoulders/clothes.<br /><br />These capes work best when I sit in a chair, have it on me and tied around my neck, then get a haircut. If I have the cape on, and the phone rings, and I need to get up from the chair and go to another room to answer the phone, the cape floats around randomly as I am moving. The cape gets tangled and wrinkled unto itself.<br /><br />Overall, these are functional capes to use for when we get hair cuts at home.\nReview Title: Plastic cape that is fragile, thin, see-through.\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Heyedrate Activated Charcoal Soap Bar and Face Wash | Organic, Vegan, Natural Soap made with Dead Sea Mud and Our Essential Oil Blend (1 Pack (5 Ounces))\nReview Date: 2021/04/12\nStore: Eye Love\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Brand': 'Eye Love', 'Scent': 'Eucalyptus, Coconut, Grapefruit, Rosemary', 'Material Feature': 'Organic, Natural, Vegan', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '4 x 1 x 1 inches; 4.97 Ounces', 'UPC': '850436007827'}\nReview Text: This activated charcoal soap bar comes in a product box that has a tamper-evident seal on the top and bottom part of the opening.<br /><br />The soap has a mild scent, and while I don't know how to describe the scent, the product description says the scent consists of Eucalyptus, Coconut, Grapefruit, Rosemary. I did not find the scent to be pleasant nor unpleasant. When I am done showering, the scent disappears from my body soon after.<br /><br />The soap bar does not have a smooth appearance; I can see various swirls and indentations through the surfaces of the soap. The bar is slippery to hold when wet.<br />The soap gives a generous, rich lather.<br /><br />Although charcoal is one of the ingredients, this soap did not feel harsh on my skin. I've used other soaps with ingredients (sea salt granules, for instance) that I could feel on my skin as I was using the soap and exfoliated better than this soap. But, I do like how fresh and clean my body feels after using this soap.<br /><br />I did not notice my skin being significantly better moisturized after using this bar of soap for the past 3 weeks versus how my skin felt before using the soap.<br /><br />While the box shows stains from the soap (see pic I took), it does not leave stains on the shower stall once I was done rinsing off.<br /><br />Lastly, expiration date can be found on the side of the box.

I had to provide my own adapter in order to plug this power cord into the outlet.<br /><br />Inserting a drill bit into the nail drill takes a little bit of effort, as does removing the bit from the drill. Once I have the bit properly seated in (i.e. I insert the bit into the drill, leaving 3-mm space, as shown in picture #6 at the upper left corner of the product description page), and start using the drill, the bit stays securely in place.<br /><br />I like being able to increase / decrease the speed at which the drill bits rotate, using the speed control on the power cord. Some of us have thin nails, so they use a slower speed so that the bit doesn't put too much pressure on the nail. At its highest speed, this nail drill (along with the mandrel drill bit and sanding band) can reduce the thickness of our fungus toenails of our big toes.<br /><br />The various drill bits (11 in total) provide enough variety to use on the many different fingernails and toenails of our family members.<br /><br />Lastly, the user manual has excellent diagrams to describe the parts of the nail drill and some of the drill bits, as well as a step-by-step guide on how to operate this nail drill and the drill bit.<br /><br />Overall, this nail drill and its drill bits works well for our fingernail and toenail needs\nReview Title: Works great for our toenail and fingernail needs.\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Calendula Soap With Coconut Oil Soap - Natural Body Soap | Best Body Bar For Dry & Sensitive Skin | Use As A Bath Soap & Face Pure Extracts (2.64 Ounce)\nReview Date: 2021/04/25\nStore: Pure Extracts\nAverage Rating: 3.8\nProduct Details: {'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Brand': 'Pure Extracts', 'Scent': 'Calendula', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '3.23 x 2.2 x 1.34 inches; 4.16 Ounces'}\nReview Text: This soap feels smooth to the touch.<br /><br />I smell a strong floral / flowery scent. I could smell the scent even when the soap was still in the box. I could not smell much of a coconut scent. Once I am done using this soap during showering, the scent lingers for little while before disappearing.<br /><br />The soap gives a creamy, rich lather.<br /><br />My skin is typically of a dry nature, due in part to the hard water that is prevalent in our region. After using nearly all this soap in the past 3 weeks, I like that the soap helps my skin not be excessively dried out.<br /><br />On the product description page, in the \"important information\" section, there were only 2 ingredients listed: Calendula Extract & Coconut Oil (100% Natural Ingrediants).<br /><br />However, on the back of the product box, here are all the ingredients listed: sodium palmate, sodium palm, kernelate, aqua, glycerin, perfume, titanium dioxide, HEDP 60%, tinogard TT, tinopal CBS-X, extract of calendula and coconut oil. T.F.M. 76%<br /><br />Manufactured date (Jan 2021) and used-before date (Dec 2023) is found on the back of the box, at the lower right area.<br /><br />Overall, I like that this soap cleans my skin well, and I find the scent to be pleasant.\nReview Title: Strong floral scent; good for my dry skin; cleans well\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Fog-free Dental Mirror and 4 Pieces of Stainless Steel Dental Pick Professional Oral Care Kit for Family including Dogs Oral Care\nReview Date: 2021/04/27\nStore: Sunrise glow\nAverage Rating: 3.8\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '8.15 x 2.4 x 1.3 inches; 4.23 Ounces'}\nReview Text: [[VIDEOID:cbac90e8387083ce10f04b521f9fab97]] These stainless steel dental picks are well-made. The ridged areas of the picks help give me a secure grip.<br /><br />Before I use any of the picks, I sterilize them as follows:<br />a) I boil water, then place the picks in them for 10+ minutes.<br />b) Then, I lay them on a clean plate to cool.<br />c) Once the picks have cooled enough for me to handle, I choose a pick to take care of my teeth/gums.<br /><br />I use the dental pick with the sharp hook at the end to remove stubborn food debris stuck between my teeth that my toothpick cannot remove.<br />I use the dental pick with an end that reminds me of a chisel to pick away at the plaque/tartar.<br /><br />The dental mirror gives me a good view of the inside of my mouth, so I know what parts need to be worked on.<br />I breathed on the mirror, and it did not fog up. The light is bright.<br />note: the product description page makes no mention of what to do if the light doesn't work.

Even after a couple weeks use, most of the bar is still there. And, there is very little mushy remnants of soap left on the soap dish.<br /><br />There is a good amount of lather, and I enjoy the smooth lather on my skin as I am using it.<br /><br />Best of all, I like how clean my body gets with the use of this soap.

All 50 capes were placed on top of each other. Then, it was folded lengthwise in half, then folded multiple times so that the resulting product fit neatly inside a rectangular-shaped plastic bag.<br /><br />To get 1 cape, I unfold the entire 50 capes, get one cape, and fold the rest of the capes back in their original form. Once I got a cape, then re-folded the rest of the capes, I could not get it to fit back into the plastic bag. So, we put the capes in a grocery bag.<br /><br />A cape measures 59 inches in length x 50-1/4 inches in width.<br /><br />I smelled no odors emanating from these capes.<br /><br />These capes are thin, fragile, see-through, and when a family member tied the top part of the cape around my neck (much like how a barber would do at the barber shop), the plastic \"string\" broke. So, with the next cape, he was more cautious in tying the string. We are able to carefully tie the string tightly around the neck, and then use clips to tie other parts of the cape around the back of my neck and shoulders. This way, I could get a hair cut, and not have hair falling down on my neck/shoulders/clothes.<br /><br />These capes work best when I sit in a chair, have it on me and tied around my neck, then get a haircut. If I have the cape on, and the phone rings, and I need to get up from the chair and go to another room to answer the phone, the cape floats around randomly as I am moving. The cape gets tangled and wrinkled unto itself.<br /><br />Overall, these are functional capes to use for when we get hair cuts at home.\nPlastic cape that is fragile, thin, see-through.\nHeyedrate Activated Charcoal Soap Bar and Face Wash | Organic, Vegan, Natural Soap made with Dead Sea Mud and Our Essential Oil Blend (1 Pack (5 Ounces))\nEye Love\n{'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Brand': 'Eye Love', 'Scent': 'Eucalyptus, Coconut, Grapefruit, Rosemary', 'Material Feature': 'Organic, Natural, Vegan', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '4 x 1 x 1 inches; 4.97 Ounces', 'UPC': '850436007827'}\nThis activated charcoal soap bar comes in a product box that has a tamper-evident seal on the top and bottom part of the opening.<br /><br />The soap has a mild scent, and while I don't know how to describe the scent, the product description says the scent consists of Eucalyptus, Coconut, Grapefruit, Rosemary. I did not find the scent to be pleasant nor unpleasant. When I am done showering, the scent disappears from my body soon after.<br /><br />The soap bar does not have a smooth appearance; I can see various swirls and indentations through the surfaces of the soap. The bar is slippery to hold when wet.<br />The soap gives a generous, rich lather.<br /><br />Although charcoal is one of the ingredients, this soap did not feel harsh on my skin. I've used other soaps with ingredients (sea salt granules, for instance) that I could feel on my skin as I was using the soap and exfoliated better than this soap. But, I do like how fresh and clean my body feels after using this soap.<br /><br />I did not notice my skin being significantly better moisturized after using this bar of soap for the past 3 weeks versus how my skin felt before using the soap.<br /><br />While the box shows stains from the soap (see pic I took), it does not leave stains on the shower stall once I was done rinsing off.<br /><br />Lastly, expiration date can be found on the side of the box.

I had to provide my own adapter in order to plug this power cord into the outlet.<br /><br />Inserting a drill bit into the nail drill takes a little bit of effort, as does removing the bit from the drill. Once I have the bit properly seated in (i.e. I insert the bit into the drill, leaving 3-mm space, as shown in picture #6 at the upper left corner of the product description page), and start using the drill, the bit stays securely in place.<br /><br />I like being able to increase / decrease the speed at which the drill bits rotate, using the speed control on the power cord. Some of us have thin nails, so they use a slower speed so that the bit doesn't put too much pressure on the nail. At its highest speed, this nail drill (along with the mandrel drill bit and sanding band) can reduce the thickness of our fungus toenails of our big toes.<br /><br />The various drill bits (11 in total) provide enough variety to use on the many different fingernails and toenails of our family members.<br /><br />Lastly, the user manual has excellent diagrams to describe the parts of the nail drill and some of the drill bits, as well as a step-by-step guide on how to operate this nail drill and the drill bit.<br /><br />Overall, this nail drill and its drill bits works well for our fingernail and toenail needs\nWorks great for our toenail and fingernail needs.\nCalendula Soap With Coconut Oil Soap - Natural Body Soap | Best Body Bar For Dry & Sensitive Skin | Use As A Bath Soap & Face Pure Extracts (2.64 Ounce)\nPure Extracts\n{'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Brand': 'Pure Extracts', 'Scent': 'Calendula', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '3.23 x 2.2 x 1.34 inches; 4.16 Ounces'}\nThis soap feels smooth to the touch.<br /><br />I smell a strong floral / flowery scent. I could smell the scent even when the soap was still in the box. I could not smell much of a coconut scent. Once I am done using this soap during showering, the scent lingers for little while before disappearing.<br /><br />The soap gives a creamy, rich lather.<br /><br />My skin is typically of a dry nature, due in part to the hard water that is prevalent in our region. After using nearly all this soap in the past 3 weeks, I like that the soap helps my skin not be excessively dried out.<br /><br />On the product description page, in the \"important information\" section, there were only 2 ingredients listed: Calendula Extract & Coconut Oil (100% Natural Ingrediants).<br /><br />However, on the back of the product box, here are all the ingredients listed: sodium palmate, sodium palm, kernelate, aqua, glycerin, perfume, titanium dioxide, HEDP 60%, tinogard TT, tinopal CBS-X, extract of calendula and coconut oil.

The ridged areas of the picks help give me a secure grip.<br /><br />Before I use any of the picks, I sterilize them as follows:<br />a) I boil water, then place the picks in them for 10+ minutes.<br />b) Then, I lay them on a clean plate to cool.<br />c) Once the picks have cooled enough for me to handle, I choose a pick to take care of my teeth/gums.<br /><br />I use the dental pick with the sharp hook at the end to remove stubborn food debris stuck between my teeth that my toothpick cannot remove.<br />I use the dental pick with an end that reminds me of a chisel to pick away at the plaque/tartar.<br /><br />The dental mirror gives me a good view of the inside of my mouth, so I know what parts need to be worked on.<br />I breathed on the mirror, and it did not fog up. The light is bright.<br />note: the product description page makes no mention of what to do if the light doesn't work. There was no user guide included with this kit when I opened the package containing these picks and mirror.<br /><br />Overall, I find this oral care kit to be useful in helping me take care of my gums and teeth at home in between the times I see my dentist.\nHelps remove debris stuck between teeth, and deal with tartar/plaque\nBest Mom Ever French Milled Luxury Soap Set of 3 Bars (6.35oz)\nJolitee\n{'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'Jolitee', 'Scent': 'Lavender, Jasmine, Rose, Chocolate, Chamomile, Verbena, Lemon', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '8.6 x 2.7 x 1.6 inches; 1.35 Pounds', 'UPC': '659682147574'}\nThis 3-soap bar set has mild-to-moderate pleasing scents. I can really smell the lemon scent, while the rosewater jasmine variety is a bit more mild, and the lavender chamomile scent does not have as pronounced a scent as lemon.<br /><br />I like how long-lasting a soap bar is. Even after a couple weeks use, most of the bar is still there. And, there is very little mushy remnants of soap left on the soap dish.<br /><br />There is a good amount of lather, and I enjoy the smooth lather on my skin as I am using it.<br /><br />Best of all, I like how clean my body gets with the use of this soap.

At its highest speed, this nail drill (along with the mandrel drill bit and sanding band) can reduce the thickness of our fungus toenails of our big toes.<br /><br />The various drill bits (11 in total) provide enough variety to use on the many different fingernails and toenails of our family members.<br /><br />Lastly, the user manual has excellent diagrams to describe the parts of the nail drill and some of the drill bits, as well as a step-by-step guide on how to operate this nail drill and the drill bit.<br /><br />Overall, this nail drill and its drill bits works well for our fingernail and toenail needs\nReview Title: Works great for our toenail and fingernail needs.\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Calendula Soap With Coconut Oil Soap - Natural Body Soap | Best Body Bar For Dry & Sensitive Skin | Use As A Bath Soap & Face Pure Extracts (2.64 Ounce)\nReview Date: 2021/04/25\nStore: Pure Extracts\nAverage Rating: 3.8\nProduct Details: {'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Brand': 'Pure Extracts', 'Scent': 'Calendula', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '3.23 x 2.2 x 1.34 inches; 4.16 Ounces'}\nReview Text: This soap feels smooth to the touch.<br /><br />I smell a strong floral / flowery scent. I could smell the scent even when the soap was still in the box. I could not smell much of a coconut scent. Once I am done using this soap during showering, the scent lingers for little while before disappearing.<br /><br />The soap gives a creamy, rich lather.<br /><br />My skin is typically of a dry nature, due in part to the hard water that is prevalent in our region. After using nearly all this soap in the past 3 weeks, I like that the soap helps my skin not be excessively dried out.<br /><br />On the product description page, in the \"important information\" section, there were only 2 ingredients listed: Calendula Extract & Coconut Oil (100% Natural Ingrediants).<br /><br />However, on the back of the product box, here are all the ingredients listed: sodium palmate, sodium palm, kernelate, aqua, glycerin, perfume, titanium dioxide, HEDP 60%, tinogard TT, tinopal CBS-X, extract of calendula and coconut oil. T.F.M. 76%<br /><br />Manufactured date (Jan 2021) and used-before date (Dec 2023) is found on the back of the box, at the lower right area.<br /><br />Overall, I like that this soap cleans my skin well, and I find the scent to be pleasant.\nReview Title: Strong floral scent; good for my dry skin; cleans well\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Fog-free Dental Mirror and 4 Pieces of Stainless Steel Dental Pick Professional Oral Care Kit for Family including Dogs Oral Care\nReview Date: 2021/04/27\nStore: Sunrise glow\nAverage Rating: 3.8\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '8.15 x 2.4 x 1.3 inches; 4.23 Ounces'}\nReview Text: [[VIDEOID:cbac90e8387083ce10f04b521f9fab97]] These stainless steel dental picks are well-made. The ridged areas of the picks help give me a secure grip.<br /><br />Before I use any of the picks, I sterilize them as follows:<br />a) I boil water, then place the picks in them for 10+ minutes.<br />b) Then, I lay them on a clean plate to cool.<br />c) Once the picks have cooled enough for me to handle, I choose a pick to take care of my teeth/gums.<br /><br />I use the dental pick with the sharp hook at the end to remove stubborn food debris stuck between my teeth that my toothpick cannot remove.<br />I use the dental pick with an end that reminds me of a chisel to pick away at the plaque/tartar.<br /><br />The dental mirror gives me a good view of the inside of my mouth, so I know what parts need to be worked on.<br />I breathed on the mirror, and it did not fog up. The light is bright.<br />note: the product description page makes no mention of what to do if the light doesn't work. There was no user guide included with this kit when I opened the package containing these picks and mirror.<br /><br />Overall, I find this oral care kit to be useful in helping me take care of my gums and teeth at home in between the times I see my dentist.\nReview Title: Helps remove debris stuck between teeth, and deal with tartar/plaque\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Best Mom Ever French Milled Luxury Soap Set of 3 Bars (6.35oz)\nReview Date: 2021/06/18\nStore: Jolitee\nAverage Rating: 4.2\nProduct Details: {'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'Jolitee', 'Scent': 'Lavender, Jasmine, Rose, Chocolate, Chamomile, Verbena, Lemon', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '8.6 x 2.7 x 1.6 inches; 1.35 Pounds', 'UPC': '659682147574'}\nReview Text: This 3-soap bar set has mild-to-moderate pleasing scents. I can really smell the lemon scent, while the rosewater jasmine variety is a bit more mild, and the lavender chamomile scent does not have as pronounced a scent as lemon.<br /><br />I like how long-lasting a soap bar is. Even after a couple weeks use, most of the bar is still there. And, there is very little mushy remnants of soap left on the soap dish.<br /><br />There is a good amount of lather, and I enjoy the smooth lather on my skin as I am using it.<br /><br />Best of all, I like how clean my body gets with the use of this soap. And, my skin does not get dried out after using the soap.\nReview Title: Good lather, long lasting bar, smells wonderful\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n        Format your response exactly as follows:\n        POSITIVE SUMMARY:\n        [Your positive summary here]\n\n        NEGATIVE SUMMARY:\n        [Your negative summary here]\n\n        OVERALL SUMMARY:\n        [Your overall summary here]",
  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user has expressed satisfaction with several products in their purchase history. They particularly appreciate the effectiveness of dental floss, noting its smooth operation and durability. The nail polish remover was also highlighted for its strong performance and convenience. The activated charcoal face soap provided a rich lather and left the user feeling fresh and clean, while the nail drill and dental care kit received praise for their utility in home grooming. The soap bars from one set were appreciated for their pleasant scents, effective cleaning, and longevity.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user encountered some disappointments with several products. The tooth cleaning tool was criticized for being too flexible, making it ineffective at removing stubborn debris. The disposable hair cutting capes were described as fragile and difficult to manage, with the plastic ties breaking easily. The activated charcoal powder was messy to use, requiring extensive cleanup after each application. Additionally, the nail clipper set's instruments were noted as difficult to remove, and some family members found certain tools unfit for their needs, such as the tweezers and nose trimmer.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nOverall, the user's shopping experience reflects a mix of satisfaction and frustration. Positively, they have found effective dental products, soaps, and grooming tools that meet their needs, offering functionality and good quality. However, they have faced challenges with the usability of certain items, such as the tooth tool's flexibility, the fragility of the hair cutting capes, and the inconvenience posed by certain instruments in the manicure set. While many products performed well, a few did not meet expectations, highlighting the variability in their experiences.",
