Controlled studies have also demonstrated that wrinkle depth can also be reduced in the forehead. Our formula has 8%, the high end recommended for optimal results.<br />- NO HARMFUL INGREDIENTS - No parabens, bpa, phthlates, mineral oil, alcohol, sodium benzoate, propylene or any other toxic ingredients.

    "text": "Grammy\u00ae 18 Inch Long Straight Nature Full Head Clips In Human Hair Remy Hair Extensions Clip Extensions Human Hair Clip 7pcs ( #99J Red Wine Burgundy) ...<br /><br />This is a review for Grammy 18&#34; long straight nature full head clip ins.  The hair extensions arrived as planned and they were attached to cardboard  the length of the hair to keep safe. They were then wrapped in a plastic bag to cover hair.  Upon opening the hair I did not smell any kind of smell to the hair.  The hair is soft to the touch and was the right color that I had ordered.  As with any extensions, you receive in the mail first thing you must do is use a hot iron and get the creases out from shipping.  When combing through the hair there were no tangles or missing hair.  I did have a little bit of shedding but that is to be expected and was not enough to have a second thought about.  The hair straightened great with no problems.  The hair is sewn onto a small comb metal clip and I did not see any loose clips.<br /><br />The quantity: The hair is what I expected it to be.  When I compared the two matching pieces together I did note that one has more hair than the matching piece. (You will see in pictures that I have included in this review).  However, this was on the two smallest extensions and not any other piece so for me that is not a big deal because I usually do not use those pieces.<br /><br />The quality: This is my second hair extension I have ever owned. The first one I bought I paid quite a bit of money for and the hair was not near as soft as this one from Grammy.  The quality of this hair is what I expected it to be but with softer hair. I am very pleased with the quality.<br /><br />In my opinion, if you have somewhat fuller hair than one package should give you the fullness you are seeking. With that being said, if your hair is really thin and you are seeking a full thick head of hair look than you might need to go with 2 packages. I would but then you run into how to clip all the pieces in your head. You must have hair to clip these on for them to stay in place.<br /><br />How I manage to be able to keep the extensions in my head all day all night and even sleep in for 2 nights if I want is by starting with clean dry straighten hair.  I then part my hair every spot that I will be clipping an extension to and I spray with a strong hair spray let dry and then I take a small man's comb and tease just at the base of my hair close to my scalp,  that gives the clips something to hold them in tightly no matter what I am doing.<br /><br />I hope that this review has helped in your buying decision.  I have posted pictures that I hope will allow for you to see each piece and the clipping device.  Thank you for reading and if you have any questions or comments please feel free to post.  I have added 12 pictures and I hope this is helpful.<br /><br />DISCLOSURE: Product received to test with the option to review. No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and a vendor may request that item be returned. I reserve 4 and 5-star ratings for products I would either recommend to others or buy for myself. This is a great product that I would highly recommend.<br />[[ASIN:B00P8XLPO4 Grammy\u00ae 18 Inch Long Straight Nature Full Head Clips In Human Hair Remy Hair Extensions Clip Extensions Human Hair Clip 7pcs ( #99J Red Wine Burgundy)]]",
