It is designed very ergonomically and is very comfortable to hold during use. The tool is extremely lightweight and has a tapered design which makes it so comfortable to use. The instructions are to use it for a minute each morning and evening. It has illustrations which show you to spend 20 seconds on the right side and 20 seconds on the left side and 20 seconds on the T-zone. The tool will actually buzz gently when you should move to the next area. This is a great feature! It also comes with 3 brush heads; massage, sensitive and normal skin. I am using the sensitive for now and it is perfect for a gentle exfoliation. When I am finished with that minute, my skin just glows and feels so clean! Hopefully the heads do not need replaced quickly as I do not think they are yet available on Amazon or online. It also comes with a sleek charger that does not take up any room at all on the counter \u2013 this is important to me as I have a small bathroom.

It's in a slim, cardboard palette without a mirror, but this is a lower price point for all the shades you get.

Definitely a lot of copper and reds here, some golds and rose golds and pinks. Colors that will stand out but not all of them. These felt nice on the skin and blended well. Why the three stars?<br /><br />I tried this with and without primer, and this kit definitely needs primer to last more than a couple of hours on my skin. Also? The mattes will last several hours, but not the metallics even with primer (as well as a setting spray on top). I love the metallic colors, but they just fade on me somehow - even if I layer them on top of the matte.

  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user has enjoyed several products, highlighting their satisfaction with ergonomic designs that enhance usability, such as a lightweight and comfortable cleansing tool. Positive experiences also stem from effective ingredients that promote skin hydration and a youthful appearance. Users appreciate products that offer gentle exfoliation, pleasing scents, and immediate visible results like glowing skin. Additionally, a versatile makeup sponge was praised for its performance compared to higher-priced alternatives, while reusable makeup remover cloths were found to be soft and efficient. Overall, there is a strong trend of favoring products that deliver tangible benefits and exceptional value.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nDespite the overall positive experiences, some products fell short. There were concerns about longevity, particularly with eyeshadow palettes where metallic shades did not maintain their vibrancy throughout the day. Users expressed disappointment regarding the need for primers to enhance staying power, which undermined the appeal of an otherwise attractive color range. Additionally, there were apprehensions about the replacement availability of cleansing brush heads, which could lead to future inconvenience. Overall, a few products did not meet expectations for durability and consistency.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user's shopping experience is largely positive, with enjoyment derived from effective skincare and makeup tools that boost confidence and enhance beauty routines. However, challenges arose with certain products regarding their longevity and performance, particularly in makeup application. Despite these shortcomings, the user's consistent focus on quality and usability showcases a discerning taste for effective beauty solutions. The blend of both satisfactory and disappointing moments highlights a typical consumer journey, with overall satisfaction prevailing due to the valuable products that positively impact their skincare and makeup routine.",

The I am Fine color is reddish-brown, but it was a very nice red color on my lips. And my fingers - be careful when you apply these since they do stain. It's best to exfoliate before you use them, and to line your lips since I noticed a bit of bleeding/feathering when I used the product. Nothing that was obvious unless one was very close, but it would be prevented from lining my lips which I don't normally think to do when using a stain. Then again, the applicator is a cotton swab (so no fine control) and you get a LOT of product with it.<br /><br />It does last all day unless you eat something greasy/buttery.
