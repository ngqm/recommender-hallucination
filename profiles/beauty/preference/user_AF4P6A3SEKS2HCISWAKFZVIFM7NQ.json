I remembered what my nail techs used to use \u2013 small make-up brushes \u2013 and thankfully I had some. That seemed to work.<br /><br />The black polish is necessary to get the desired effect.

Though I wouldn\u2019t carry a bar of soap, I have used \u201ctravel\u201d size body wash as a hand soap. If it cleans the body, should clean the hands, right?<br /><br />Anyway \u2026<br /><br />The metal container I got was dented, but that is okay as I don\u2019t intend to travel where I won\u2019t have soap. So, I\u2019m using these at my bathroom sink.<br /><br />LET ME STATE THIS AS A WARNING: HANDS MUST BE DRY BEFORE GRABBING A SOAP SHEET.<br /><br />I know all caps is yelling, but trust me \u2013 it is for a VERY GOOD reason. As one reviewer said, even a drop of water can damage these.<br /><br />Basically I grab a one with dry hands, hold it in palm, turn water on, let it dissolve. Good lather, I don\u2019t really smell a \u201cscent\u201d, hands wash clean. They don\u2019t dry out, but I do use a moisturizing sanitizer, and hand lotion after.<br /><br />I wouldn\u2019t say these go years \u2013 if you\u2019re like me and using them as an alternative to other hand soaps to preserve waste, they might last about a month (8 washes per day, 30 days). If only as travel backup \u2013 they might last a few years. Again, it depends on how they\u2019re used.<br /><br />I personally find them a bit on the pricey side at almost $10 before tax. That\u2019s just me.<br /><br />I do have other soaps, and these should last me a while. I would not recommend them as a body wash. As opposed to carrying a bar of soap, try a travel container with body wash. Just my suggestion.\nReview Title: Great for Travel\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: YOUNG VISION Pearl Hard Wax Beads for Hair Removal, Wax Beans 1000 g/2.2 lb/35 oz for Home Waxing, Painless Bikini&Brazilian Waxing Beads, Thick/Coarse Hair Removal Wax Kit, Sensitive Skin Friendly\nReview Date: 2021/08/07\nStore: YOUNG VISION\nAverage Rating: 3.6\nProduct Details: {'Item Form': 'Wax', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'YOUNG VISION', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '7.99 x 6.14 x 4.88 inches; 2.72 Pounds'}\nReview Text: I think a lot of us want an easier way to remove hair. Shaving, especially for a bigger girl like me, is not that easy. It\u2019s worse when you have long legs, short arms.<br /><br />It\u2019s bad when you have certain chin hairs (thankfully not that much it isn\u2019t manageable another way).<br /><br />I tried some sugar wax kit back about 20+ years ago. That was a NIGHTMARE! It was supposedly edible. I think you microwaved the container, spread it on, let it cool, used a paper strip (supplied) to remove the hair. It didn\u2019t work and stung.<br /><br />I then moved to a hair removal cream, that partially worked.<br /><br />After that? Back to the hold stand-by \u2013> shave foam/cream and a razor. For my main body parts, that\u2019s always worked. Tough \u201cchin\u201d hairs \u2013> using a tweezer work. No, the dermaplaning tool didn\u2019t work on them.<br /><br />I got a wax warmer, so I thought all beads/beans were equal.<br /><br />These came with ZERO instructions, and the after spray bottle was busted. The warmer kit at least had some. And, my warmer kit had specially made, disposable \u201ccups\u201d.<br /><br />These beads/beans, in a smaller cup, took over 90 minute to melt. And, the warmer was on 180\u00b0(F).<br /><br />I tried a small amount on my arm. The wax was sticky, not liquidy, and it cooled almost as soon as it hit my skin.<br /><br />I let it sit there for a few minutes (over 5), and peeled the max off. It didn\u2019t hurt, sting, or cause redness \u2013 then again \u2026<br /><br />THE HAIR WAS STILL THERE<br /><br />Okay, so my hair on my arm is a little thin. But, if this removes thick hair, shouldn\u2019t it remove thinner hair?<br /><br />I found another patch, got some warm wax \u2013 tried it again. Nope. Tried legs, arms, and under my chin. Nothing. Then again, I see I'm not the only one experiencing issues with these beads/beans.<br /><br />I may have gotten a bad batch. But, I definitely wouldn\u2019t get these again.\nReview Title: Wax On, Wax Off, Hair Still There\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: FIDDY898 Gold Silver Floral Hair Comb For Bride Tiny Beaded Wedding Hair Jewelry-Silver\nReview Date: 2021/10/16\nStore: FIDDY898\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'FIDDY898', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Color': 'Gold,Silver', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '5.9 x 3.9 x 2.2 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'FDSD061101'}\nReview Text: This is, for less than $10, a lovely comb.<br /><br />Can function at a wedding or other event. However, the cons outweigh the beauty.<br /><br />Given how delicate this is, there is NO storage box or bag. So, after use \u2013 where does one put it? That is an issue for me. Even a simple velvet type bag would be a good idea.<br /><br />Second? The comb itself.<br /><br />While absolutely stunning in design \u2013 function is a bit questionable because of the construction. The combs are \u201cOPEN\u201d design \u2013 thus loose hairs can weave in, particularly those with thick and curly hair. This makes removal or readjusting a bit difficult if not a tad uncomfortable.<br /><br />This is also for thicker hair, not thin, and thus circles back to the issue I just presented.<br /><br />While pretty, it isn\u2019t something I am particularly pleased with.

That is NOT how you wear these nails to begin with \u2013 and definitely NOT with nail glue. Even being \u201cfake\u201d, the nails should at LEAST attempt to look realistic.

Even the PACKAGING states: 24<br /><br />Did they not think anyone would notice that detail?<br /><br />I\u2019ll admit, these are pretty. And, thinking it was a HALF package, I contacted Amazon for a return/replacement. I cancelled the replacement, but I am returning these. As I told the rep \u2013 they\u2019re pretty useless as they are. There is NO way I can use these. I would, at MINIMUM, only get 4 nails worth of coverage. For this price? Nope. Not at all. And, I feel sorry for those who do have to pay.<br /><br />In addition, the nearly $16 price tag (excluding sales tax) for 12 nails? Unreasonable. In my case, I\u2019d need TWO (2) sets which would run $32. For that price \u2013 I might as well just wear a mask, go to the salon, and have them do it for me. My nails would definitely last two weeks, and I wouldn\u2019t have to do them myself.<br /><br />I will not be getting these again and DO NOT recommend them.

Though I wouldn\u2019t carry a bar of soap, I have used \u201ctravel\u201d size body wash as a hand soap. If it cleans the body, should clean the hands, right?<br /><br />Anyway \u2026<br /><br />The metal container I got was dented, but that is okay as I don\u2019t intend to travel where I won\u2019t have soap. So, I\u2019m using these at my bathroom sink.<br /><br />LET ME STATE THIS AS A WARNING: HANDS MUST BE DRY BEFORE GRABBING A SOAP SHEET.<br /><br />I know all caps is yelling, but trust me \u2013 it is for a VERY GOOD reason. As one reviewer said, even a drop of water can damage these.<br /><br />Basically I grab a one with dry hands, hold it in palm, turn water on, let it dissolve. Good lather, I don\u2019t really smell a \u201cscent\u201d, hands wash clean. They don\u2019t dry out, but I do use a moisturizing sanitizer, and hand lotion after.<br /><br />I wouldn\u2019t say these go years \u2013 if you\u2019re like me and using them as an alternative to other hand soaps to preserve waste, they might last about a month (8 washes per day, 30 days). If only as travel backup \u2013 they might last a few years. Again, it depends on how they\u2019re used.<br /><br />I personally find them a bit on the pricey side at almost $10 before tax. That\u2019s just me.<br /><br />I do have other soaps, and these should last me a while. I would not recommend them as a body wash. As opposed to carrying a bar of soap, try a travel container with body wash. Just my suggestion.\nGreat for Travel\nYOUNG VISION Pearl Hard Wax Beads for Hair Removal, Wax Beans 1000 g/2.2 lb/35 oz for Home Waxing, Painless Bikini&Brazilian Waxing Beads, Thick/Coarse Hair Removal Wax Kit, Sensitive Skin Friendly\nYOUNG VISION\n{'Item Form': 'Wax', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'YOUNG VISION', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '7.99 x 6.14 x 4.88 inches; 2.72 Pounds'}\nI think a lot of us want an easier way to remove hair. Shaving, especially for a bigger girl like me, is not that easy. It\u2019s worse when you have long legs, short arms.<br /><br />It\u2019s bad when you have certain chin hairs (thankfully not that much it isn\u2019t manageable another way).<br /><br />I tried some sugar wax kit back about 20+ years ago. That was a NIGHTMARE! It was supposedly edible. I think you microwaved the container, spread it on, let it cool, used a paper strip (supplied) to remove the hair. It didn\u2019t work and stung.<br /><br />I then moved to a hair removal cream, that partially worked.<br /><br />After that? Back to the hold stand-by \u2013> shave foam/cream and a razor. For my main body parts, that\u2019s always worked. Tough \u201cchin\u201d hairs \u2013> using a tweezer work. No, the dermaplaning tool didn\u2019t work on them.<br /><br />I got a wax warmer, so I thought all beads/beans were equal.<br /><br />These came with ZERO instructions, and the after spray bottle was busted. The warmer kit at least had some. And, my warmer kit had specially made, disposable \u201ccups\u201d.<br /><br />These beads/beans, in a smaller cup, took over 90 minute to melt. And, the warmer was on 180\u00b0(F).<br /><br />I tried a small amount on my arm. The wax was sticky, not liquidy, and it cooled almost as soon as it hit my skin.<br /><br />I let it sit there for a few minutes (over 5), and peeled the max off. It didn\u2019t hurt, sting, or cause redness \u2013 then again \u2026<br /><br />THE HAIR WAS STILL THERE<br /><br />Okay, so my hair on my arm is a little thin. But, if this removes thick hair, shouldn\u2019t it remove thinner hair?<br /><br />I found another patch, got some warm wax \u2013 tried it again. Nope. Tried legs, arms, and under my chin. Nothing. Then again, I see I'm not the only one experiencing issues with these beads/beans.<br /><br />I may have gotten a bad batch. But, I definitely wouldn\u2019t get these again.\nWax On, Wax Off, Hair Still There\nFIDDY898 Gold Silver Floral Hair Comb For Bride Tiny Beaded Wedding Hair Jewelry-Silver\nFIDDY898\n{'Brand': 'FIDDY898', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Color': 'Gold,Silver', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '5.9 x 3.9 x 2.2 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'FDSD061101'}\nThis is, for less than $10, a lovely comb.<br /><br />Can function at a wedding or other event. However, the cons outweigh the beauty.<br /><br />Given how delicate this is, there is NO storage box or bag. So, after use \u2013 where does one put it? That is an issue for me. Even a simple velvet type bag would be a good idea.<br /><br />Second? The comb itself.<br /><br />While absolutely stunning in design \u2013 function is a bit questionable because of the construction. The combs are \u201cOPEN\u201d design \u2013 thus loose hairs can weave in, particularly those with thick and curly hair. This makes removal or readjusting a bit difficult if not a tad uncomfortable.<br /><br />This is also for thicker hair, not thin, and thus circles back to the issue I just presented.<br /><br />While pretty, it isn\u2019t something I am particularly pleased with. It isn\u2019t something I would get for myself again. I also wouldn\u2019t give it as a gift.\nBeautiful But Need to Be Cautious When Using\nNULASTIN Skin \u2013 Gentle Exfoliating Cleanser | Invigorating Face Scrub with Caffeine, Jojoba Oil Beads, Calendula Flower Extract & Witch Hazel \u2014 For Dry, Oily & Sensitive Skin (Vegan & Cruelty-Free)\nNULASTIN\n{'Brand': 'NULASTIN', 'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Skin Type': 'Dry,All Skin Types', 'Product Benefits': 'Exfoliating', 'Material Feature': 'Cruelty Free, Vegan', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.38 x 2.36 x 6.5 inches; 6.88 Ounces', 'UPC': '718122770717'}\nThis is an exfoliating facial cleanser that really didn't feel that great or give me that much in benefits.

That is NOT how you wear these nails to begin with \u2013 and definitely NOT with nail glue. Even being \u201cfake\u201d, the nails should at LEAST attempt to look realistic. See how the salons do them, look on Google (or your favorite search engine).<br /><br />Who thought this was a great idea? And, these HAVE to be the LARGEST sizes for the particular \u201cnails\u201d I\u2019ve seen. These really are a fancier version of the Lee and Wet N\u2019 Wild from the late 1980\u2019s/early 1990\u2019.<br /><br />What\u2019s worse? Even the PACKAGING states: 24<br /><br />Did they not think anyone would notice that detail?<br /><br />I\u2019ll admit, these are pretty. And, thinking it was a HALF package, I contacted Amazon for a return/replacement. I cancelled the replacement, but I am returning these. As I told the rep \u2013 they\u2019re pretty useless as they are. There is NO way I can use these. I would, at MINIMUM, only get 4 nails worth of coverage. For this price? Nope. Not at all. And, I feel sorry for those who do have to pay.<br /><br />In addition, the nearly $16 price tag (excluding sales tax) for 12 nails? Unreasonable. In my case, I\u2019d need TWO (2) sets which would run $32. For that price \u2013 I might as well just wear a mask, go to the salon, and have them do it for me. My nails would definitely last two weeks, and I wouldn\u2019t have to do them myself.<br /><br />I will not be getting these again and DO NOT recommend them. The seller might have a better set out there, but not this selection.\nNot Sure if This is a Joke",

Though I wouldn\u2019t carry a bar of soap, I have used \u201ctravel\u201d size body wash as a hand soap. If it cleans the body, should clean the hands, right?<br /><br />Anyway \u2026<br /><br />The metal container I got was dented, but that is okay as I don\u2019t intend to travel where I won\u2019t have soap. So, I\u2019m using these at my bathroom sink.<br /><br />LET ME STATE THIS AS A WARNING: HANDS MUST BE DRY BEFORE GRABBING A SOAP SHEET.<br /><br />I know all caps is yelling, but trust me \u2013 it is for a VERY GOOD reason. As one reviewer said, even a drop of water can damage these.<br /><br />Basically I grab a one with dry hands, hold it in palm, turn water on, let it dissolve. Good lather, I don\u2019t really smell a \u201cscent\u201d, hands wash clean. They don\u2019t dry out, but I do use a moisturizing sanitizer, and hand lotion after.<br /><br />I wouldn\u2019t say these go years \u2013 if you\u2019re like me and using them as an alternative to other hand soaps to preserve waste, they might last about a month (8 washes per day, 30 days). If only as travel backup \u2013 they might last a few years. Again, it depends on how they\u2019re used.<br /><br />I personally find them a bit on the pricey side at almost $10 before tax. That\u2019s just me.<br /><br />I do have other soaps, and these should last me a while. I would not recommend them as a body wash. As opposed to carrying a bar of soap, try a travel container with body wash. Just my suggestion.\nReview Title: Great for Travel\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: YOUNG VISION Pearl Hard Wax Beads for Hair Removal, Wax Beans 1000 g/2.2 lb/35 oz for Home Waxing, Painless Bikini&Brazilian Waxing Beads, Thick/Coarse Hair Removal Wax Kit, Sensitive Skin Friendly\nReview Date: 2021/08/07\nStore: YOUNG VISION\nAverage Rating: 3.6\nProduct Details: {'Item Form': 'Wax', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'YOUNG VISION', 'Unit Count': '1 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '7.99 x 6.14 x 4.88 inches; 2.72 Pounds'}\nReview Text: I think a lot of us want an easier way to remove hair. Shaving, especially for a bigger girl like me, is not that easy. It\u2019s worse when you have long legs, short arms.<br /><br />It\u2019s bad when you have certain chin hairs (thankfully not that much it isn\u2019t manageable another way).<br /><br />I tried some sugar wax kit back about 20+ years ago. That was a NIGHTMARE! It was supposedly edible. I think you microwaved the container, spread it on, let it cool, used a paper strip (supplied) to remove the hair. It didn\u2019t work and stung.<br /><br />I then moved to a hair removal cream, that partially worked.<br /><br />After that? Back to the hold stand-by \u2013> shave foam/cream and a razor. For my main body parts, that\u2019s always worked. Tough \u201cchin\u201d hairs \u2013> using a tweezer work. No, the dermaplaning tool didn\u2019t work on them.<br /><br />I got a wax warmer, so I thought all beads/beans were equal.<br /><br />These came with ZERO instructions, and the after spray bottle was busted. The warmer kit at least had some. And, my warmer kit had specially made, disposable \u201ccups\u201d.<br /><br />These beads/beans, in a smaller cup, took over 90 minute to melt. And, the warmer was on 180\u00b0(F).<br /><br />I tried a small amount on my arm. The wax was sticky, not liquidy, and it cooled almost as soon as it hit my skin.<br /><br />I let it sit there for a few minutes (over 5), and peeled the max off. It didn\u2019t hurt, sting, or cause redness \u2013 then again \u2026<br /><br />THE HAIR WAS STILL THERE<br /><br />Okay, so my hair on my arm is a little thin. But, if this removes thick hair, shouldn\u2019t it remove thinner hair?<br /><br />I found another patch, got some warm wax \u2013 tried it again. Nope. Tried legs, arms, and under my chin. Nothing. Then again, I see I'm not the only one experiencing issues with these beads/beans.<br /><br />I may have gotten a bad batch.

Even a simple velvet type bag would be a good idea.<br /><br />Second? The comb itself.<br /><br />While absolutely stunning in design \u2013 function is a bit questionable because of the construction. The combs are \u201cOPEN\u201d design \u2013 thus loose hairs can weave in, particularly those with thick and curly hair. This makes removal or readjusting a bit difficult if not a tad uncomfortable.<br /><br />This is also for thicker hair, not thin, and thus circles back to the issue I just presented.<br /><br />While pretty, it isn\u2019t something I am particularly pleased with.

That is NOT how you wear these nails to begin with \u2013 and definitely NOT with nail glue. Even being \u201cfake\u201d, the nails should at LEAST attempt to look realistic.

Even the PACKAGING states: 24<br /><br />Did they not think anyone would notice that detail?<br /><br />I\u2019ll admit, these are pretty. And, thinking it was a HALF package, I contacted Amazon for a return/replacement. I cancelled the replacement, but I am returning these. As I told the rep \u2013 they\u2019re pretty useless as they are. There is NO way I can use these. I would, at MINIMUM, only get 4 nails worth of coverage. For this price? Nope. Not at all. And, I feel sorry for those who do have to pay.<br /><br />In addition, the nearly $16 price tag (excluding sales tax) for 12 nails? Unreasonable. In my case, I\u2019d need TWO (2) sets which would run $32. For that price \u2013 I might as well just wear a mask, go to the salon, and have them do it for me. My nails would definitely last two weeks, and I wouldn\u2019t have to do them myself.<br /><br />I will not be getting these again and DO NOT recommend them.

Most noteworthy was a UV/LED lamp praised for its effectiveness and ease of use, highlighting the positive impact of this purchase on their nail care routine.

Additionally, a set of nail tips clips received positive feedback for their durability and comfort during use, enhancing the overall home manicure experience.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user encountered multiple disappointing experiences, especially with products that fell short of expectations. Several items, such as a hair removal wax kit and artificial nails, were criticized for poor performance and impractical design features. The wax lacked effectiveness and directions, while the nails were unsuitable due to sizing discrepancies, leading to frustration. A sugar scrub was described as excessively thick and difficult to use, further reflecting dissatisfaction, and the price point of many items was viewed as unjustifiable, with several products described as overpriced compared to their performance.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user\u2019s shopping journey includes a mix of positive and negative experiences across various beauty products. While they found some items, like a UV/LED lamp and manicure tools, to be helpful and satisfactory, many others were marked by issues related to effectiveness, functionality, and value. There is a clear trend of the user being critical towards products that do not perform as expected or do not meet industry standards, leading to a reluctance to repurchase these items.
