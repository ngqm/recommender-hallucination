The box itself was nicely packaged. For reference, I used the thinnest/most natural pair at the top for my review.<br /><br />Cons: the tube of eyeliner was either sitting so long it completely dried up, or the glue caused the eyeliner to adhere to the inside of the tube, but it was almost impossible to get ANY of the liner on my lid.<br /><br />When I finally got a line to go on, it was akin to what attempting to using a dried up Expo on whiteboard looks like- I had to scrub the pen on my eyelid in an attempt to lay down any product at all, resulting in a very pitiful looking eyeliner application.<br /><br /> I fixed the lashes to the appropriate area, and within 5 minutes they were coming off at the corners. I tried to remedy the overall result somewhat by adding my own liner, and that example is on the second photo, bottom right corner (photo with eyeshadow applied).<br /><br />The lashes themselves were the quality you\u2019d expect from a multi pack at this price. Some of the individual lashes had fallen out as I opened the package as well.<br /><br />Final thoughts: just use eyelash glue and get quality lashes.

  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user has expressed satisfaction with a variety of products, particularly emphasizing the appealing packaging and quality components included. They appreciated the excellent value for money for wigs and the vivid colors of cosmetics, notably pointing out the ease of application and the smooth, buildable texture of the blush. Positive experiences were further highlighted by the realistic appearance of a lace front wig, which also came equipped with useful accessories. Overall, the user seems to enjoy well-designed products that enhance their makeup application experience and daily styling.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nDespite enjoying several products, the user encountered issues with two items leading to disappointment. One product suffered from a malfunction, with complaints about the eyeliner drying up and ineffective adhesive, resulting in poor application. Another product's eyebrow powders were criticized for their unflattering color, being too dark or overly orange, which detracted from achieving a natural look. Additionally, concerns about the thin nature of a wig were noted, suggesting it did not meet the user's expectations for fullness or volume.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user's shopping history reflects a mix of positive and negative experiences. On the positive side, they highlighted enjoyable features such as quality, ease of use, and aesthetic appeal across various products. However, they also faced challenges with specific items, including malfunctions and unsatisfactory colors, leading to frustration. This blend indicates the user values practicality and performance but is discerning about the quality and effectiveness of their beauty purchases.",
