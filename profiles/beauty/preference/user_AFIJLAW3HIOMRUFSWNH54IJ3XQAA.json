Crest Whitestrips and Crest Whitestrips Premium holds the whitening ingredient against your teeth long enough to get at stains beneath the surface. You'll have visibly whiter teeth in just 14 days with Crest Whitestrips.\"]\nAverage Rating: 3.0\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Crest', 'Product Benefits': 'Whitening', 'Item Form': 'Strip, Gel', 'Included Components': 'Whitening Strip', 'Flavor': 'Unflavored', 'Package Dimensions': '5.4 x 5.3 x 1.5 inches; 4 Ounces', 'UPC': '037000432579', 'Manufacturer': 'Crest'}\nReview Text: After very minimal and barely noticeable success with whitening toothpastes and gels, I finally decided to give Crest Premium Whitestrips a try.  Previously, I had found the cost to be prohibitive, but the fact that $5 or $7 coupons are offered in our Sunday paper with some regularity made the price a bit easier to swallow.<br /><br />Just like the commercials say, I definitely did begin to see some improvement after about three days.  I would describe the effect as more of a lightening than a whitening per se:  the darker yellow spots on my teeth began to fade and to become less apparent.  Now, after using the product as prescribed for a week, the color of my teeth is clearly improved; I wouldn't say that my teeth are bright white, but they are definitely more of an ivory or a paler yellow color.  According to the package insert, you can immediately begin a second course of treatment for even better whitening effects, but I haven't yet decided if I want to lay out another $30 in order to do this.  Also, I should mention that the effect is not so dramatic thta anyone has noticed (UNLIKE in the commercials!).<br /><br />Now for the caveats.  First of all, I found these strips to be a bit difficult to use.  It can be hard to remove the strips from the protective backing without them becoming mangled, and it is very easy to get the gel on your fingertips (which causes a temporary whitening effect).  Also, the strips are not ideally shaped for your mouth, and I found that they covered my front eight teeth only.  Finally, while the top strip adhered fairly well, I found that the bottom strip was more tricky and tended to slide around, especially if I moved my mouth at all.  The only solution I found to this was to wear the strips while commuting to work, which luckily gave me a 30-minute period when I did not need to talk.  Otherwise, it can be difficult to find a good time to wear the strips, as the insert information advises against wearing them immediately after you brush your teeth, while sleeping, and while you are eating/drinking.<br /><br />Unlike other reviewers, I did not have a problem with the taste of the strips:  I could not detect anything while wearing them, and after taking them off, I thought that the gooey paste left behind was virtually tasteless.  I did experience some sensitivity in a lower tooth which I had capped over 20 years ago.  Although this sensation went away in time, it was uncomforable enough to make me cut the lower strip to fit around this particular tooth.<br /><br />In summary, I did see clear--although not miraculous--results from this product and I would be willing to try the strips again, especially if the price were to come down a bit.  Ultimately, I would rate Crest Whitestrips three and a half stars, as there is definitely room for improvement.\nReview Title: Yes, these really work...but keep a few things in mind\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Holiday Special - Eyes 4 You Eyelash Growth Serum available in 3ml 0.1 Fl Oz.

Without mascara, they are barely noticeable.  I have never before tried an eyelash growth serum and was frankly somewhat skeptical, yet at the same time, I was excited at the thought that this product might be beneficial.<br /><br />This serum is packaged in a tube that looks like mascara.  However, the inner wand ends in a tiny brush that is like a VERY thin paintbrush.  I would have preferred a slightly thicker applicator; the brush was SO small that it was difficult to see the serum for precise application.<br /><br />I followed the instructions for this product, applying nightly along my lash line.  I used this product daily for over a month (since late August).  Unfortunately, I am not able to discern any noticeable results.  I actually took photos, thinking that might show more of a difference, I but do not see any changes in the photos, either.  (It looks like Amazon has finally posted my photos, so you can see what you think for yourself.)<br /><br />The only small improvement I have noticed of late is that AFTER applying my mascara, my lashes seem longer than they normally would with mascara--it's almost as if they are somehow adhering to the mascara better than they would normally.  I'm not 100% sure if this is a real effect, but that possible sign combined with the fact that I didn't have any adverse reactions to this product is the reason why I gave it two stars rather than one.  Perhaps others will have better luck than I did.<br /><br />UPDATED 11/9/14:  Despite my lack of results after one month, I continued to use this product.  It has now been over two months, and I believe that I have seen SOME results.  At this point, my lashes DO appear longer--I think that's why my mascara has seemed to be working better, as my lashes are a bit longer than before.  However, my results have been nothing like the miracles in the photos posted on the product page--yes, my lashes are a bit longer, but the effect is hardly noticeable to the bare eye (I asked my husband, and he didn't notice).  Furthermore, my lashes are neither thicker nor more plentiful; this product gave me a bit of length only, not thickness or any other effect.  So, in summary, I upgraded my review from two to three stars, but I don't feel like I can go beyond that at this time.\nReview Title: No noticeable results after over a month - UPDATED 11/9/14\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Butecare Eyelash Growth Enhancer & Brow Serum for Long - Amazon Vine\nReview Date: 2018/12/24\nAverage Rating: 3.0\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '4.5 x 0.9 x 0.9 inches; 0.81 Ounces'}\nReview Text: My eyelashes are thin, sparse, and short (like my hair, haha).  I had a eyelash grower product that seemed to work for me before, so I thought I would give this one a try.  My previous one stressed to only apply once per day, before bed; this one encourages you to apply twice per day.  I started with once at bedtime but then began adding mornings too.<br /><br />This definitely seems to work for me!  Now, if you are expecting full, lush lashes, I think that's unlikely--at least that's not what happened for me.  For me, this product added length but not really any fullness.  And the length is mainly noticeable when I use mascara--my lashes actually hold the mascara and look significantly longer.  Also, it only takes a week or two to see results!  My only complaint is that this is a tiny tube, and after just a few weeks, there doesn't seem to be much product left.  Still, overall I really like this product and would recommend it!<br /><br />UPDATE 1/18/19:<br />I am still using this product, although I think I might be getting to the end.  It is still giving me longer lashes.  I attached a photo to provide an idea of how it works for me.  I am wearing mascara for this photo, but even with mascara, my lashes would NOT usually come all the way close to my brows like they are in this photo!  But you can also see that while my lashes are longer, they are still pretty thin/sparse.  Given this, I think this product would work best for those who have thicker but short lashes.\nReview Title: Really seems to work for me!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Mountain Falls Regular Nail Polish Remover for Natural Nails with Vitamin E and Panthenol, 16 Fluid Ounce\nReview Date: 2019/11/18\nStore: Mountain Falls\nProduct Description: ['This nail polish remover is formulated to help soften cuticles and add strength and resiliency for more beautiful nails.

I wound up only opening the \"A\" set, as after trying these 5 and finding only 2 to work for me, I decided to give the \"B\" set away.  From the photos, I thought that the colors would be nice and muted, but that's not really the case.  The color I am wearing in the photo is \"Almost Friday,\" which is a pretty neutral, nude-ish pink.  I also kept \"Blush for Me,\" a light, brownish peach.  The red shade, \"Red for Me,\" was very bright and didn't seem to belong to the rest of this collection.  But the other shades seemed MUCH less intense than in the product photos.  Rather than buying a set of 10 like this, I think most people would be better off choosing individual shades that work best for them.<br /><br />Two other things to note.  When I opened one of the lipsticks, the color cylinder popped out and onto my floor, so I wonder about quality.  Also, to open the tubes, you have to unscrew them rather than simply pull the top off.  This might be good for some who carry around lipsticks in a bag, but for quick everyday use, it's annoying.\nReview Title: Decently longevity and appearance, but some shades not wearable\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: BEPHOLAN Natural Eyelash Growth Serum and Brow Enhancer to Grow Thicker, Longer Lashes for Long, Luscious Lashes and Eyebrows|15ML\nReview Date: 2020/12/03\nStore: BEPHOLAN\nAverage Rating: 3.2\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '5.43 x 1.34 x 0.94 inches; 0.63 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I have been using this product for several weeks now.  I choose the option for the \"mascara brush\" style, as I thought this might be easier to use than the thin brush styles I've tried in the past.  My results with this were mixed.  First, the product is barely discernible on the brush!  It seems only completely dry; more product gets on the wand part than on the brush end.  Second, the brush is plastic and feels VERY harsh; a brush with soft bristles might have been better.<br /><br />That being said, this product has seemed to help my lashes somewhat.  The effect isn't very noticeable with bare lashes, but when I use mascara, my lashes do look thicker and longer than they would normally.  I have used this product on my eyebrows too and have seen some improvement there as well.  I wish this was a little easier to use; I would rate it about three and a half stars.\nReview Title: Somewhat helpful for improving lashes\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: INIKA Organic Deep Plum Lipstick Crayon, 0.11 OZ\nReview Date: 2021/01/02\nStore: INIKA\nAverage Rating: 3.5\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'INIKA', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Item Form': 'Crayon', 'Finish Type': 'Satin', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '5.04 x 0.51 x 0.51 inches; 0.11 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'INIKA'}\nReview Text: This matte lipcolor pencil goes on nice and smooth.

I the bottle, the smell of the lotion is horrible - I found it to have a strong, artificial scent similar to alcoholic spirits.  I decided to give it a try so that I could write an accurate review.  The \"lotion\" is quite thin, much more watery than any other moisturizer I have used.  Just to spread on my elbows requires at least 10 pumps from the tiny bottle.  The good news is that once on the skin, the distasteful fragrance does not last; I didn't really detect much scent at all after that, but there may have been a faint hint of rose in the dry-down.  The moisturization was adequate, nothing more.<br /><br />I do like the Nail & Cuticle Oil, which comes in a little roller bottle and actually DOES have a rose scent.  But this set is absolutely NOT worth the cost, especially given that the lotion is likely to be completely gone after just a few weeks of daily use.  Not recommended.<br /><br />NOTE:  At least one other reviewer (\"Jam Blaster\") mentioned the same issue with the lotion smelling bad and gave this product just 1-star as a result.<br /><br />UPDATE, 2/1/21:<br />Since I don't like the scent of this product, I decided to try it on my feet.  Despite the lotion being very thin, I actually found it to work quite well on my feet!  I put it on in the a.m., then put on socks; by the end of the day, my feet definitely felt soften and smoother.  I think the product is too expensive to purchase for this reason alone, but it does work, and so I increased my rating to 3-star.\nReview Title: Very thin lotion with an unpleasant initial fragrance\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: YOUTH LAB Daily Cleanser\nReview Date: 2021/01/20\nStore: YOUTH LAB.\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Skin Type': 'Combination', 'Brand': 'YOUTH LAB.', 'Material Feature': 'Gluten Free, Natural, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Youth', 'Product Dimensions': '2.76 x 1.97 x 7.09 inches; 8.82 Ounces', 'Item model number': '80D4B8EE-754B-401E-9178-CBF2668D0B0E'}\nReview Text: I recently started using this product in the shower.

I have used these twice now around the holidays when I've been worn out. These comma-shaped masks are easy enough to apply - there is a little spatula thing to help lift them out in order to be sanitary. They have a wet, silicone-like feel that is very similar to the feel of a contact lens, only thicker. I found that they stuck to my skin fairly well, even when I was moving around. The mask felt nice on and was a bit cooling after awhile. The area under my eyes felt refreshed after using these, although I didn't actually notice anything visibly different. These might be worth it if you are simply looking to make your eye area feel better.\nReview Title: Comfortable cooling sensation\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Besame Cosmetics | Forever Red Lipstick - 1925 | Classic Color Lipstick | Vintage Makeup | Long Lasting Lipstick | Semi Matte Lipstick for Women | Moisturizing Lipstick for Sensitive Skin\nReview Date: 2022/01/28\nStore: BESAME COSMETICS\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'BESAME COSMETICS', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Item Form': 'Powder', 'Finish Type': 'Semi Matte', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Long Lasting,Nourishing,Clean,Moisturizing,Makeup', 'Package Dimensions': '4.45 x 1.14 x 1.06 inches; 0.74 Ounces'}\nReview Text: This is a red lipstick in an attractive case. I don't wear a lot of red, as so many of the red lipsticks turn orange-y on me, but this one appeared more blue-based, so I decided to try it. It goes on smoothly and has decent staying power. It does seem to have more blue undertones than some I've tried. However, based on the picture of 3 stacked lips that appears in the item description, I was looking for a result similar to the center one (or top one if you are looking at the lower photo that appears above the reviews), especially given that my skin color is close to the skin of that model, but on me, the color looks more like it does in the bottom photo, with a slightly more orange-y hue. This is not bad if that's what you want; just be aware that your personal result might vary from what is pictured.\nReview Title: Pretty little red lipstick\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

From the photos, I thought that the colors would be nice and muted, but that's not really the case.  The color I am wearing in the photo is \"Almost Friday,\" which is a pretty neutral, nude-ish pink.  I also kept \"Blush for Me,\" a light, brownish peach.  The red shade, \"Red for Me,\" was very bright and didn't seem to belong to the rest of this collection.  But the other shades seemed MUCH less intense than in the product photos.  Rather than buying a set of 10 like this, I think most people would be better off choosing individual shades that work best for them.<br /><br />Two other things to note.  When I opened one of the lipsticks, the color cylinder popped out and onto my floor, so I wonder about quality.  Also, to open the tubes, you have to unscrew them rather than simply pull the top off.  This might be good for some who carry around lipsticks in a bag, but for quick everyday use, it's annoying.\nDecently longevity and appearance, but some shades not wearable\nBEPHOLAN Natural Eyelash Growth Serum and Brow Enhancer to Grow Thicker, Longer Lashes for Long, Luscious Lashes and Eyebrows|15ML\nBEPHOLAN\n{'Package Dimensions': '5.43 x 1.34 x 0.94 inches; 0.63 Ounces'}\nI have been using this product for several weeks now.  I choose the option for the \"mascara brush\" style, as I thought this might be easier to use than the thin brush styles I've tried in the past.  My results with this were mixed.  First, the product is barely discernible on the brush!  It seems only completely dry; more product gets on the wand part than on the brush end.  Second, the brush is plastic and feels VERY harsh; a brush with soft bristles might have been better.<br /><br />That being said, this product has seemed to help my lashes somewhat.  The effect isn't very noticeable with bare lashes, but when I use mascara, my lashes do look thicker and longer than they would normally.  I have used this product on my eyebrows too and have seen some improvement there as well.  I wish this was a little easier to use; I would rate it about three and a half stars.\nSomewhat helpful for improving lashes\nINIKA Organic Deep Plum Lipstick Crayon, 0.11 OZ\nINIKA\n{'Brand': 'INIKA', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Item Form': 'Crayon', 'Finish Type': 'Satin', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '5.04 x 0.51 x 0.51 inches; 0.11 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'INIKA'}\nThis matte lipcolor pencil goes on nice and smooth.

I the bottle, the smell of the lotion is horrible - I found it to have a strong, artificial scent similar to alcoholic spirits.  I decided to give it a try so that I could write an accurate review.  The \"lotion\" is quite thin, much more watery than any other moisturizer I have used.  Just to spread on my elbows requires at least 10 pumps from the tiny bottle.  The good news is that once on the skin, the distasteful fragrance does not last; I didn't really detect much scent at all after that, but there may have been a faint hint of rose in the dry-down.  The moisturization was adequate, nothing more.<br /><br />I do like the Nail & Cuticle Oil, which comes in a little roller bottle and actually DOES have a rose scent.  But this set is absolutely NOT worth the cost, especially given that the lotion is likely to be completely gone after just a few weeks of daily use.  Not recommended.<br /><br />NOTE:  At least one other reviewer (\"Jam Blaster\") mentioned the same issue with the lotion smelling bad and gave this product just 1-star as a result.<br /><br />UPDATE, 2/1/21:<br />Since I don't like the scent of this product, I decided to try it on my feet.  Despite the lotion being very thin, I actually found it to work quite well on my feet!  I put it on in the a.m., then put on socks; by the end of the day, my feet definitely felt soften and smoother.  I think the product is too expensive to purchase for this reason alone, but it does work, and so I increased my rating to 3-star.\nVery thin lotion with an unpleasant initial fragrance\nYOUTH LAB Daily Cleanser\nYOUTH LAB.\n{'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Skin Type': 'Combination', 'Brand': 'YOUTH LAB.', 'Material Feature': 'Gluten Free, Natural, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Youth', 'Product Dimensions': '2.76 x 1.97 x 7.09 inches; 8.82 Ounces', 'Item model number': '80D4B8EE-754B-401E-9178-CBF2668D0B0E'}\nI recently started using this product in the shower.  It has a nice gel-like consistency and lathers easily.  The fragrance is a strong cucumber scent, which I didn't like, but luckily it faded quickly.

The mask felt nice on and was a bit cooling after awhile. The area under my eyes felt refreshed after using these, although I didn't actually notice anything visibly different.

I don't wear a lot of red, as so many of the red lipsticks turn orange-y on me, but this one appeared more blue-based, so I decided to try it. It goes on smoothly and has decent staying power. It does seem to have more blue undertones than some I've tried. However, based on the picture of 3 stacked lips that appears in the item description, I was looking for a result similar to the center one (or top one if you are looking at the lower photo that appears above the reviews), especially given that my skin color is close to the skin of that model, but on me, the color looks more like it does in the bottom photo, with a slightly more orange-y hue.

Crest Whitestrips and Crest Whitestrips Premium holds the whitening ingredient against your teeth long enough to get at stains beneath the surface. You'll have visibly whiter teeth in just 14 days with Crest Whitestrips.\"]\nAverage Rating: 3.0\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Crest', 'Product Benefits': 'Whitening', 'Item Form': 'Strip, Gel', 'Included Components': 'Whitening Strip', 'Flavor': 'Unflavored', 'Package Dimensions': '5.4 x 5.3 x 1.5 inches; 4 Ounces', 'UPC': '037000432579', 'Manufacturer': 'Crest'}\nReview Text: After very minimal and barely noticeable success with whitening toothpastes and gels, I finally decided to give Crest Premium Whitestrips a try.  Previously, I had found the cost to be prohibitive, but the fact that $5 or $7 coupons are offered in our Sunday paper with some regularity made the price a bit easier to swallow.<br /><br />Just like the commercials say, I definitely did begin to see some improvement after about three days.  I would describe the effect as more of a lightening than a whitening per se:  the darker yellow spots on my teeth began to fade and to become less apparent.  Now, after using the product as prescribed for a week, the color of my teeth is clearly improved; I wouldn't say that my teeth are bright white, but they are definitely more of an ivory or a paler yellow color.  According to the package insert, you can immediately begin a second course of treatment for even better whitening effects, but I haven't yet decided if I want to lay out another $30 in order to do this.  Also, I should mention that the effect is not so dramatic thta anyone has noticed (UNLIKE in the commercials!).<br /><br />Now for the caveats.  First of all, I found these strips to be a bit difficult to use.  It can be hard to remove the strips from the protective backing without them becoming mangled, and it is very easy to get the gel on your fingertips (which causes a temporary whitening effect).  Also, the strips are not ideally shaped for your mouth, and I found that they covered my front eight teeth only.  Finally, while the top strip adhered fairly well, I found that the bottom strip was more tricky and tended to slide around, especially if I moved my mouth at all.  The only solution I found to this was to wear the strips while commuting to work, which luckily gave me a 30-minute period when I did not need to talk.  Otherwise, it can be difficult to find a good time to wear the strips, as the insert information advises against wearing them immediately after you brush your teeth, while sleeping, and while you are eating/drinking.<br /><br />Unlike other reviewers, I did not have a problem with the taste of the strips:  I could not detect anything while wearing them, and after taking them off, I thought that the gooey paste left behind was virtually tasteless.  I did experience some sensitivity in a lower tooth which I had capped over 20 years ago.  Although this sensation went away in time, it was uncomforable enough to make me cut the lower strip to fit around this particular tooth.<br /><br />In summary, I did see clear--although not miraculous--results from this product and I would be willing to try the strips again, especially if the price were to come down a bit.  Ultimately, I would rate Crest Whitestrips three and a half stars, as there is definitely room for improvement.\nReview Title: Yes, these really work...but keep a few things in mind\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Holiday Special - Eyes 4 You Eyelash Growth Serum available in 3ml 0.1 Fl Oz.

Without mascara, they are barely noticeable.  I have never before tried an eyelash growth serum and was frankly somewhat skeptical, yet at the same time, I was excited at the thought that this product might be beneficial.<br /><br />This serum is packaged in a tube that looks like mascara.  However, the inner wand ends in a tiny brush that is like a VERY thin paintbrush.  I would have preferred a slightly thicker applicator; the brush was SO small that it was difficult to see the serum for precise application.<br /><br />I followed the instructions for this product, applying nightly along my lash line.  I used this product daily for over a month (since late August).  Unfortunately, I am not able to discern any noticeable results.  I actually took photos, thinking that might show more of a difference, I but do not see any changes in the photos, either.  (It looks like Amazon has finally posted my photos, so you can see what you think for yourself.)<br /><br />The only small improvement I have noticed of late is that AFTER applying my mascara, my lashes seem longer than they normally would with mascara--it's almost as if they are somehow adhering to the mascara better than they would normally.  I'm not 100% sure if this is a real effect, but that possible sign combined with the fact that I didn't have any adverse reactions to this product is the reason why I gave it two stars rather than one.  Perhaps others will have better luck than I did.<br /><br />UPDATED 11/9/14:  Despite my lack of results after one month, I continued to use this product.  It has now been over two months, and I believe that I have seen SOME results.  At this point, my lashes DO appear longer--I think that's why my mascara has seemed to be working better, as my lashes are a bit longer than before.  However, my results have been nothing like the miracles in the photos posted on the product page--yes, my lashes are a bit longer, but the effect is hardly noticeable to the bare eye (I asked my husband, and he didn't notice).  Furthermore, my lashes are neither thicker nor more plentiful; this product gave me a bit of length only, not thickness or any other effect.  So, in summary, I upgraded my review from two to three stars, but I don't feel like I can go beyond that at this time.\nReview Title: No noticeable results after over a month - UPDATED 11/9/14\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Butecare Eyelash Growth Enhancer & Brow Serum for Long - Amazon Vine\nReview Date: 2018/12/24\nAverage Rating: 3.0\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '4.5 x 0.9 x 0.9 inches; 0.81 Ounces'}\nReview Text: My eyelashes are thin, sparse, and short (like my hair, haha).  I had a eyelash grower product that seemed to work for me before, so I thought I would give this one a try.  My previous one stressed to only apply once per day, before bed; this one encourages you to apply twice per day.  I started with once at bedtime but then began adding mornings too.<br /><br />This definitely seems to work for me!  Now, if you are expecting full, lush lashes, I think that's unlikely--at least that's not what happened for me.  For me, this product added length but not really any fullness.  And the length is mainly noticeable when I use mascara--my lashes actually hold the mascara and look significantly longer.  Also, it only takes a week or two to see results!  My only complaint is that this is a tiny tube, and after just a few weeks, there doesn't seem to be much product left.  Still, overall I really like this product and would recommend it!<br /><br />UPDATE 1/18/19:<br />I am still using this product, although I think I might be getting to the end.  It is still giving me longer lashes.  I attached a photo to provide an idea of how it works for me.  I am wearing mascara for this photo, but even with mascara, my lashes would NOT usually come all the way close to my brows like they are in this photo!  But you can also see that while my lashes are longer, they are still pretty thin/sparse.  Given this, I think this product would work best for those who have thicker but short lashes.\nReview Title: Really seems to work for me!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Mountain Falls Regular Nail Polish Remover for Natural Nails with Vitamin E and Panthenol, 16 Fluid Ounce\nReview Date: 2019/11/18\nStore: Mountain Falls\nProduct Description: ['This nail polish remover is formulated to help soften cuticles and add strength and resiliency for more beautiful nails.

Additionally, feedback on a lip color crayon highlighted its smooth application and pleasant finish.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user's experiences with several products have been met with disappointment. Although some eyelash serums promised significant effects, they offered only minimal results, with improvements often difficult to notice by others. Multiple products were criticized for their applicators, with some being hard to use or lacking adequate product. The nail polish remover was considered average and not worthy of repurchase. Others faced challenges with unpleasant product scents, especially regarding a lotion that had an off-putting initial fragrance and inadequate moisturizing properties.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user's shopping behavior reveals a mix of satisfaction and frustration with beauty products. Positive experiences included effective whitening and some successful eyelash growth serums, fostering a willingness to try similar products. However, negative experiences have led to criticisms about effectiveness, usability issues, and unpleasant scents in several items. The overall sentiment suggests cautious optimism, with a potential to explore more options, contingent on better outcomes and improvements in formulation or application methods.",

    "text": "This product comes in a glass bottle with a pump dispenser. The dispenser has a very small spout, making it difficult to dispense the product without having it run down the side of the bottle. Note that there is oil in the name - it feels like an oil and goes on like an oil, with no foaming or cleansing at all. It also has a strong scent of lavender (which I like, but others may not).<br /><br />This product works well as a remover for eye makeup. However, I don't feel that it does a good job of cleansing my face overall. Although the product rinses clean and leaves my face feeling soft, my face doesn't feel clean, and I feel the need to use an actual cleanser after. I would recommend this product as a eye makeup remover only and would suggest that \"cleanser\" be removed from the name.",
