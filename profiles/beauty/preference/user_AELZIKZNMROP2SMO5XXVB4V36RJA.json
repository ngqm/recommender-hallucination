It is quiet. I charged it several hours before using it, but it began lagging quickly.  I plugged it in and kept using it and didn't notice much difference while plugged in.  The description recommend only use 2 or 3 seconds at a time but I didn't find any reason why it would say that.  It wasn't very powerful, but I did see a considerable amount of very fine skin.  It didn't collect in the little tray that I could tell.  It claims to work wet or dry.  I will leave the wet testing to someone with less candles on their cake than I.  My feet felt better after using.<br />I believe there are better ones than this at a competitive price point.  It did work so I have to give it at least 3 \u2606\u2606\u2606.

I have other Red Carpet items that I'm quite pleased with. This kit fell a bit short on expectations. As a starter kit, it's one you'll have to add a few things to (file, USB box, nail color, etc.) so be aware of that.  The Purify cleaner has a light scent, but is a small bottle.

They are not included. It took 3 coats of the black polish (included) to get full, dark coverage.  The pots are messy to open and quite small, but colors are pretty and sparkly.  Lots of glitter effect with multiple coats.  You will need a brush as well.  The finish feels bumpy (you can feel the glitter).  Maybe multiple top coat would help but I didn't want more layers since I already had base, 3 layers of color, 2 layers of glitter and a top coat.\nReview Title: Pots are kinda messy.

The toner is so silky I wasn't even sure any was going on my skin.  I am almost 52 and have the expected lines in my face for that age.  The toner is a must for mature skin. I tried it without it and the foundation settled in my lines. With the toner it stayed suspended well.  The foundations are a bit thick and it felt like I was painting my face on, but with a bit of work it blended nicely. The kabuki brush is soft and full. No bristles came off.  I believe if the shade matches your skin well, it would be an excellent product. I did have to apply a bronzer over because it was a bit lighter than my skin.

Colors are very pretty.  Easy to apply and cure.  I love the fact it comes with black polish.  The black is sheer but that is kind of a plus with this set because it allows buildable color.  You may not want a dark black behind the glitter.  A couple of the colors are similar and unless they are side by side it's harder to tell them apart but overall I love it.

They are easy to wear and super fun.  This particular one looked good but the highlights were super blonde in the brown.  Just be aware when ordering.  The blonde was really too much to blend in my hair so sadly this one won't get much wear, but in general, the look is casual to professional with very little effort.  Pull your hair back into a ponytail or bun then slide this baby over it and suddenly the whole \"do\" changes.  Whispy texture and style.  Great for the awkward grow-out stage.\nReview Title: Easy and fun style to wear.

Pretty much all the tools you need, some better quality than others but overall quite good.  The lamp is big. It has 3 (actually 4) settings.  30, 60 and 120 buttons and when you put your hand in it auto goes to 90.  Big enough to do whole hand or toes at a time. The detachable cord fits snug in the back (not a USB, a real plug).  The cord is about 3 ft long.  Base is attached.  8 color polishes ranging nude to red and brown.  I got 2 duplicate colors.  That may have been a boo boo.  Base coat, no-wipe clear top coat and frost (matte) top coat.  Bottles are smaller than regular size but for the price it's not a deal-breaker. Gloss top coat was surprisingly shiny.  Matte has a velvety look.  Lots of embellishments; seed beads, rhinestones, chunky glitter and glitter powder (which I had no luck with) but no applicators, all in tiny pots and wheel with an opening. I found the wheel to be a bit of a pain and the rhinestones stuck to the top and transferred to the next pot when turning.  The rhinestones are super tiny and difficult to pick up even with the weeding tweezers included. No adhesive so you just have to paint top coat and place before curing. This would be an excellent purchase for a beginner (to intermediate) wanting to try several different looks.  Well worth the price.  Most everything met my expectations. I would be eager to try other products from this brand.\nReview Title: Good kit for beginner or intermediate.

None of them are.  There is a bit to learn before using successfully, so do some homework beforehand and read the manual. And it's important to know it's not for every skin type nor is it a \"permanent\" fix.  You will have to use occasionally to maintain. That being said, this is one of the better IPL I have tried.  Anything that keeps me from shaving is a plus.<br />There is a bit of \"pain\" like needle pricks but after repeated use, it gets less noticeable. There is a precision guard that also helps buffer a bit.  The cord is annoyingly clunky. Not sure why it's so bulky.  There isn't an on/off. Unplug when you're done.  It's a bit large for travel, especially if you're keeping it in the box.  No glasses, surprisingly.

Assuming I cured for the correct time, I had a couple nails that smudged off when I wiped with alcohol.  Most didn't. Top coat is exceptionally shiny.  I have other Red Carpet items that I'm quite pleased with. This kit fell a bit short on expectations. As a starter kit, it's one you'll have to add a few things to (file, USB box, nail color, etc.) so be aware of that.  The Purify cleaner has a light scent, but is a small bottle. I like the top coat.  Kit is decent but not great.\nReview Title: Not exactly a starter kit\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Biutee Starry Sky Nail Gel Firework Nail Gel With black Nail Polish Gel 8ml UV LED\nReview Date: 2020/08/27\nStore: Biutee\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Biutee', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Type': 'Gel', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '3.5274 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Liquid Volume': '0.27 Fluid Ounces', 'Package Dimensions': '4.92 x 3.31 x 1.77 inches; 4.59 Ounces'}\nReview Text: You will need base and top coat and a scooper/brush tool. They are not included. It took 3 coats of the black polish (included) to get full, dark coverage.  The pots are messy to open and quite small, but colors are pretty and sparkly.  Lots of glitter effect with multiple coats.  You will need a brush as well.  The finish feels bumpy (you can feel the glitter).  Maybe multiple top coat would help but I didn't want more layers since I already had base, 3 layers of color, 2 layers of glitter and a top coat.\nReview Title: Pots are kinda messy.

Glitter is pretty.\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: PHOERA 30ml Foundation Liquid Full Coverage 24HR Matte Oil Control Concealer (Nude & Buff Beige) with 6ml Makeup Face Primer & Kabuki Foundation Brush Flat Top\nReview Date: 2020/09/24\nStore: SIGHTLING\nAverage Rating: 4.3\nProduct Details: {'Product Dimensions': '1.18 x 0.79 x 1.18 inches; 4.97 Ounces', 'UPC': '779296966696'}\nReview Text: They are a bit too light for my skin tone but they work.  The toner is so silky I wasn't even sure any was going on my skin.  I am almost 52 and have the expected lines in my face for that age.  The toner is a must for mature skin. I tried it without it and the foundation settled in my lines. With the toner it stayed suspended well.  The foundations are a bit thick and it felt like I was painting my face on, but with a bit of work it blended nicely. The kabuki brush is soft and full. No bristles came off.  I believe if the shade matches your skin well, it would be an excellent product. I did have to apply a bronzer over because it was a bit lighter than my skin.  Full coverage, matte finish.\nReview Title: Great toner, great brush.

Colors are very pretty.  Easy to apply and cure.  I love the fact it comes with black polish.  The black is sheer but that is kind of a plus with this set because it allows buildable color.  You may not want a dark black behind the glitter.  A couple of the colors are similar and unless they are side by side it's harder to tell them apart but overall I love it. I really love the fact that I can have beautiful glitter nails without the scratchy feel.  I would order Pine products again.  They don't smell bad either.\nReview Title: Sparkly colors and buildable black\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Altaba Messy Bun Hair Piece Tousled Updo Messy Bun Hair Piece with Elastic Rubber Band Tousled Updo Extensions for Women\nReview Date: 2021/02/28\nStore: Altaba\nAverage Rating: 3.4\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '9.72 x 6.54 x 0.94 inches; 2.19 Ounces', 'UPC': '738631999942'}\nReview Text: My friend and I have tried many of these fun hair accessories. They are easy to wear and super fun.  This particular one looked good but the highlights were super blonde in the brown.  Just be aware when ordering.  The blonde was really too much to blend in my hair so sadly this one won't get much wear, but in general, the look is casual to professional with very little effort.  Pull your hair back into a ponytail or bun then slide this baby over it and suddenly the whole \"do\" changes.  Whispy texture and style.  Great for the awkward grow-out stage.\nReview Title: Easy and fun style to wear.

Pretty much all the tools you need, some better quality than others but overall quite good.  The lamp is big. It has 3 (actually 4) settings.  30, 60 and 120 buttons and when you put your hand in it auto goes to 90.  Big enough to do whole hand or toes at a time. The detachable cord fits snug in the back (not a USB, a real plug).  The cord is about 3 ft long.  Base is attached.  8 color polishes ranging nude to red and brown.  I got 2 duplicate colors.  That may have been a boo boo.  Base coat, no-wipe clear top coat and frost (matte) top coat.  Bottles are smaller than regular size but for the price it's not a deal-breaker. Gloss top coat was surprisingly shiny.  Matte has a velvety look.  Lots of embellishments; seed beads, rhinestones, chunky glitter and glitter powder (which I had no luck with) but no applicators, all in tiny pots and wheel with an opening. I found the wheel to be a bit of a pain and the rhinestones stuck to the top and transferred to the next pot when turning.  The rhinestones are super tiny and difficult to pick up even with the weeding tweezers included. No adhesive so you just have to paint top coat and place before curing. This would be an excellent purchase for a beginner (to intermediate) wanting to try several different looks.  Well worth the price.  Most everything met my expectations. I would be eager to try other products from this brand.\nReview Title: Good kit for beginner or intermediate. Pretty much everything you need.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Nail Dip Powder Liquid Set with Base Activator and Top Coat, 10ml x 3, for Dipping Powder Manicure System, No Including Bond Primer Brush Saver, No Need UV/LED Lamp to Cured\nReview Date: 2021/06/17\nStore: unibouti\nAverage Rating: 3.4\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Unibouti', 'Included Components': 'Top Coat, Dip Powder', 'Finish Type': 'Glossy', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '3.07 x 2.72 x 0.87 inches; 1.76 Ounces'}\nReview Text: If you don't already have extra brushes and the brush saver, this set is useless after one or 2 nails.<br />Something about these liquids wreaks havoc on brushes and usually after one or 2 nails your brushes are toast.

None of them are.  There is a bit to learn before using successfully, so do some homework beforehand and read the manual. And it's important to know it's not for every skin type nor is it a \"permanent\" fix.  You will have to use occasionally to maintain. That being said, this is one of the better IPL I have tried.  Anything that keeps me from shaving is a plus.<br />There is a bit of \"pain\" like needle pricks but after repeated use, it gets less noticeable. There is a precision guard that also helps buffer a bit.  The cord is annoyingly clunky. Not sure why it's so bulky.  There isn't an on/off. Unplug when you're done.  It's a bit large for travel, especially if you're keeping it in the box.  No glasses, surprisingly.  Some small improvements would definitely make this a 5 star review for me but certainly not a deal breaker.  High 4 stars for performance and ease of use.\nReview Title: SmoothSkin IPL Hair Remover seems to be working and fast, easy to use\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n        Format your response exactly as follows:\n        POSITIVE SUMMARY:\n        [Your positive summary here]\n\n        NEGATIVE SUMMARY:\n        [Your negative summary here]\n\n        OVERALL SUMMARY:\n        [Your overall summary here]",
  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user demonstrated positive experiences with several products, particularly enjoying the variety, quality, and effectiveness of items like headbands and nail products. The headbands were praised for their comfort and functionality, holding hair in place without feeling constrictive. Nail polish sets received high marks for color variety and ease of application, with users appreciating the absence of unpleasant odors and the buildable nature of the products. Additionally, the foundation kit was found to provide an excellent matte finish, and the luxury feel of certain creams was noted positively.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nOn the negative side, the user encountered issues with some products failing to meet expectations. Complaints included the inadequate performance of an electric foot file, which was seen as underpowered and ineffective, along with messy packaging for nail products. Certain kits were criticized for being incomplete, lacking essential components needed for a full manicure experience. Furthermore, the unpleasant scent and poor quality of specific liquids resulted in dissatisfaction, leading to a recommendation against the purchase of those items.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user's shopping experiences reveal a blend of positive and negative aspects. While they enjoyed high-quality, effective products in categories like headgear and nail kits, they similarly faced disappointments with certain kits that promised more than they delivered. The contrast between effective, well-crafted products and those with shortcomings emphasizes the importance of complete information and quality in beauty purchases, influencing future choices in their shopping experience.",

    "text": "This brush is sturdy.  Nice heavy feel.  Teeth really grab the undercoat.  Within just a few strokes, I had removed enough hair from my cats to form a whole other cat!  One of my girls loved it, but the one who usually enjoys being brushed didn't care for it.  Not sure what's up with that.  It wasn't hurting her, I think maybe since it grabbed so much hair, maybe she didn't like the extra little \"tug\".  There are 2 different curves to the brush and I didn't really notice a difference in the effects.  I also tried to rake the rug, which I have done with my usual brush.  This was absolutely not working with this one.  It grabbed so much it was actually lifting the carpet.  This worked on fine cat hair, so I can only imagine how well it would grab the hair and de-shed a dog.  I didn't have any use for the added light and strap.  I suppose the strap would be useful to hold a dog with a collar in place and the light would be useful for potty trips at night.",
