I wasnt expecting that but super happy as I knew I'd be using more than needed and wasting if I were just pouring straight from the bottle/s. Which leads me to my second point- I still think I used more than needed, particularly the conditioner. My hair is thin & rather short now so I don't need much as is, but because it's so dry & brittle the conditioner seemed to have a bit of difficulty actually saturating and smoothing out so I kept pumping more out and adding it. Well I ended up just clipping it back to sit for a bit like usual & let me tell you...when I took it out it was so silky smooth I was surprised it didnt fall out of the clip on it's own. The smell is a rather strong floral scent, I've noticed all my Korean hair products have a strong floral scent to them tho & personally I dont mind it.

  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:  \nThe user appreciates the value and quality of the products purchased. They express satisfaction with the bundles, highlighting great pricing and effective performance. The positive feedback consistently praises the pleasant effects on hair and skin, indicating that the products fulfill their intended benefits such as exfoliation and moisturizing. Additionally, the attractive packaging and added pumps for ease of use have been received favorably, enhancing the overall experience.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:  \nThere are issues related to product efficiency, particularly with the hair conditioner, which has been noted as requiring a larger amount for effective application due to the hair's dry and brittle condition. This has led to a perception of waste, as the user feels they might be overusing the product. The strong floral scent, common in Korean products, could also be a potential downside for those sensitive to fragrances, though the user personally does not mind it.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:  \nOverall, the user's shopping experience has been largely positive, marked by appreciation for the value and effectiveness of the products purchased. However, there are areas for improvement, particularly concerning the efficiency of the conditioner and the floral scent, which could deter some consumers. The combination of great pricing, effective results, and attractive packaging has created an enjoyable experience despite some minor drawbacks.",
