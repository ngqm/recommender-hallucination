I truly wish I started in my earlier years. And the newest & most exciting things in skin care are Korean skin care products. I had heard they were the best so I was excited to see this 2-step product & even more excited to try it. I will admit, I am a bit obsessed with face masks at the moment. I use a mask every day, especially during this pandemic while I am stuck at home & not able to go to a cosmetologist for a facial. I have aged & have dry skin with lots of fine wrinkles appearing around the corners of my eyes and a deep nasolabial fold forming. I am saddened every time Iook at my reflection in the mirror. I absolutely love this 2-step product. I opened one end of the product & applied the small masks to my eyes & around my mouth (4 to a pack) and then applied the whole face mask (step 2) over it all. I left them all on according to the directions and my face felt amazing afterwards. I was so pleased with the way my face felt that I was already looking forward to the next time I used this product.

I also like to wipe off my makeup at the end of the day before cleansing my face with a face wash. These are perfect because they are individually wrapped hence they won't dry out as some of the large packs of wipes do. Also, very convenient for folks who travel because they are small packages that fit perfectly in my travel toiletries bag. The wipes are unscented and contain vitamin E & aloe. There is no residue or tackiness on your skin after use. Each package contains 1 biodegradable bamboo wipe however the directions indicate not to flush them.

My daughter, who is an eye lash guru said they were very good quality and was quite surprised by the great price point.  I am getting better applying them and not ruining as many as I have in the past.  I think a beginner or an experienced person would very much enjoy getting these lashes.\nReview Title: Pretty and very affordable\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Anon Make Up Remover Wipes 100ct | Individually Wrapped Natural Vitamin E and Aloe Vera | Bamboo Mini Makeup Wipes | AirBnB\u2019s Choice for Convenient Single Use Face Wipes | Paraben and Alcohol Free\nReview Date: 2021/01/11\nStore: Oil Slick\nAverage Rating: 4.2\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '8.3 x 8 x 2 inches; 1.1 Pounds', 'UPC': '308136994256'}\nReview Text: Make-up wipes are very convenient while applying makeup (easy to clean up little mistakes). I also like to wipe off my makeup at the end of the day before cleansing my face with a face wash. These are perfect because they are individually wrapped hence they won't dry out as some of the large packs of wipes do. Also, very convenient for folks who travel because they are small packages that fit perfectly in my travel toiletries bag. The wipes are unscented and contain vitamin E & aloe. There is no residue or tackiness on your skin after use. Each package contains 1 biodegradable bamboo wipe however the directions indicate not to flush them. I like them and will enjoy using them with my other skin care products.\nReview Title: Perfect for your toiletries bag...\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: lootaan 500 Pieces False Nails French Acrylic Fake Nails Tips Half Cover Artificial Fake Nails With Box and False Nail Clipper for Women Girl\nReview Date: 2021/01/27\nStore: lootaan\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Material': 'Acrylic', 'Brand': 'lootaan', 'Number of Pieces': '500', 'Package Dimensions': '9 x 6 x 2 inches; 8.01 Ounces', 'UPC': '710157699223'}\nReview Text: I am a nail biter of 40+ years. I long to have beautiful nails. And I did, thanks to nail salons prior to the covid19 pandering. Once the pandemic hit I was still reluctant to go to a salon after they opened in limited capacity. I was determining to learn how to do them myself. I mistakenly ordered tips versus whole nails and because of this, these nail tips didn't work for me. That being said,  these tips are of excellent quality if you know how to make them work for you. Highly recommend if you do..\nReview Title: Nail tips are great if you know what to do with them\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Murad Hydration Intense Recovery Cream - Deeply Moisturizes Severely Dry and Stressed Skin - For Face and Eyes, 1.7 Fl Oz\nReview Date: 2021/02/23\nAverage Rating: 3.9\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Murad', 'Scent': 'Unscented', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Active Ingredients': 'Vitamin A', 'Unit Count': '1.7 Fl Oz', 'Language': 'English', 'Product Dimensions': '2.91 x 2.91 x 1.69 inches; 7.2 Ounces', 'Item model number': '15293', 'UPC': '767332152936'}\nReview Text: I became a fan of the Murad brand after receiving different Murad products in my beauty box subscriptions over the past few years. The products I received in the past were high quality and, I feel, superior to other brands that I have tried with similar claims. This intense recovery cream does not disappoint.<br /><br />The thick & luxurious cream comes in a 1.7 ounce frosted glass tub and it is easily applied to my face & neck area. It has a very slight hygienic scent that quickly dissipates after application. The product immediately absorbed & left my skin feeling soothed & hydrated and never tacky or greasy. I have very sensitive skin and the cream caused my face no adverse reactions.<br /><br />Directions indicate to apply it to clean face, neck & chest morning and night. I use a variety of skincare serums depending on the time of day & the current condition of my skin and this cream played nicely with my other skin care products and make-up.<br /><br />Murad claims, \"Now, calm comes in a cream. Murad's Intense Recovery Cream is a clinically proven, comforting cream for face & eyes that reduces visible signs of stress-induced aging and redness. Microalgae extract smooths the look of facial tension and stress lines. Deeply moisturizes even severely dry skin as it relieves visible redness & encourages recovery.\"<br /><br />Ingredients include Shea Butter & Macadamia Oil, Mirabilis Jalapa Plant Extract, Microalgae Extract.<br /><br />Included in this review are pictures of the literature on the box & tub for your review.<br /><br />I am very excited to add this Murad product to my collection of Murad skincare as I know I will enjoy using it as much as I enjoy using the other Murad skincare products I have in my arsenal.<br /><br />Having only used this now for a few days, this is a firstly impression review. I look forward to seeing a reduction in the redness on my face.<br /><br />Highly recommend \u2661\nReview Title: High quality skincare for my aged skin\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Sparkling Oxygen Mask, Skin Energizing Treatment with Bubbling Action\nReview Date: 2021/03/08\nStore: T\u00d3NICA\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'T\u00d3NICA', 'Product Benefits': 'Oxygenating', 'Scent': 'Oxygen', 'Unit Count': '1.7 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '4.61 x 1.46 x 1.42 inches; 2.89 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I received 1.7 ounces of product in a plastic pump bottle. The product has a shimmery gold appearance & has a light, very pleasing scent.<br /><br />This product claims the following:  \"this unique effervescent mask delivers the essential benefits of oxygen to energize the skin and brighten dullness, instantly... Perfect to revive and rejuvenate dull, tired skin; it also replenishes moisture to give the skin a plump, dewy appearance.\"<br /><br />I did my usual double cleanse and applied this product as directed by applying a thin layer to damp skin & left it on for 10 minutes. It sort of tickled my face as it began to bubble a little. I am not sure if my face was damp enough or if I didn't use enough product but the bubbly effect eased up & then the product dried a bit. After my time was up, I rinsed my face with warm water & I gently patted my skin dry. Usually this is when I would apply a toner but I wanted to feel my face once it was dry. I was hoping this product would replenish moisture to give my skin a plump & dewy finish. Unfortunately my skin felt tight & dry and left me feeling unimpressed because of this.<br /><br />For the price point & disappointing results, I cannot recommend this product.\nReview Title: Left my face feeling tight & dry\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: TULA Probiotic Skin Care Supersize 24-7 Moisture Hydrating Day & Night Cream | Holiday 2020, Ageless is the New Anti-Aging, Face Cream, Contains Watermelon Fruit and Blueberry Extract | 3.4 oz\nReview Date: 2021/03/19\nStore: TULA\nAverage Rating: 4.7\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'TULA', 'Scent': 'Watermelon', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '3.4 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Package Dimensions': '5.43 x 5.16 x 3.43 inches; 3.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '850014698355'}\nReview Text: I received either a full size or deluxe sample of a Tula skincare product a few years ago when I got one of my first beauty box subscriptions. After using it, I think, is when I first fell in love with all things skincare! So thanks Tula lol! I was a little shocked at the price of Tula products but years later, after trying lots & lots of other skincare brands, I feel the price point for Tula skincare is worth it.<br /><br />I was very excited to see this \"super-sized\" 3.4 oz tub and I just had to try it. As with the other Tula products I have tried, this did not disappoint. If I could have rated it higher than 5 stars, I would have. It is a thick luxurious cream that glides on your face like silk and is quickly absorbed. It didn't leave my face feeling greasy or tacky,  just soft, hydrated & moisturized. Today is a non-makeup day for me & I am just going to enjoy the way my face feels after using this awesome cream.<br /><br />I will be purchasing this product when it's out, although you only need a little, so I'm assuming this tub will last a long time. I highly recommend this Tula product!\nReview Title: 5+ \ud83c\udf1f - love this luxurious cream\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n        Format your response exactly as follows:\n        POSITIVE SUMMARY:\n        [Your positive summary here]\n\n        NEGATIVE SUMMARY:\n        [Your negative summary here]\n\n        OVERALL SUMMARY:\n        [Your overall summary here]",
  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user exhibits a strong appreciation for several skincare products, particularly those originating from Korean beauty. They express delight in the effectiveness and feel of face masks, noting significant hydration and a soothing experience without irritation. Products like high-quality creams provide a luxurious feel, rapidly absorbing without leaving greasiness. Additionally, affordable false eyelashes and packaging convenience further enhance their positive experiences, indicating satisfaction with both quality and practicality in their skincare and beauty routines.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user has encountered several negative experiences, especially with certain serums and masks. They reported strong, unpleasant scents and stickiness in one serum, which impacted their willingness to use it. A disappointing experience with a bubbling mask left their skin feeling tight and dry, not delivering the promised hydration. Additionally, confusion over product types\u2014like nail tips instead of full nails\u2014led to dissatisfaction, highlighting areas where they felt products didn\u2019t meet their expectations.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user enjoys a mix of positive and negative interactions with skincare and beauty products. On the positive side, they appreciate effective hydration, luxurious textures, and practical packaging. However, they have faced notable disappointments, especially related to scent, texture, and misordered products. This blend of satisfaction and frustration showcases a passionate engagement with beauty products, where successful items lead to enthusiastic repurchase intentions, while unsatisfactory experiences serve as valuable lessons in product selection.",

    "text": "I received 1 oz. of the brand's Orchid Gel\u00e8e Serum. It came beautifully packaged in a tall slender box (which I didn't want to throw away). The component is a peachy colored but clear plastic slender bottle with a plastic shiny gold cap & bottom. The serum has pretty petals floating around in it. The description says, \"delicate vegan petals dissolve on contact,\" however the few pumps that I used had no petals come out with the clear Gel\u00e8e serum.<br /><br />The floral scent was very strong & while it did dissipate a bit after being rubbed on my test spot, it did linger, hence the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. I'm just not a fan of strong fragrances in facial skin care.<br /><br />The serum rubbed in sheer & was quickly absorbed. I used it first on the back of my very dry hands and didn't see much of a difference when compared to my other hand.<br /><br />Despite the beauty of the component, I don't think I will be using it on my face because I just couldn't get past the lingering scent. I will, however, use it on other parts of my body not so near my nose.<br /><br />Unfortunately I would not purchase this in the future but if you like stronger, floral scents, you might love this.",
