What guy wouldn't want to try something out that could lead to a manlier, chiseled looking jawline with just a few minutes of effort a day. I thought the people in the ad looked ridiculous, and however ridiculous they looked, I feel even more ridiculous using this thing. One big benefit is that if I ever get into an argument with my wife, I can break through even her angriest moments by popping this thing into my mouth for a little exercise in front of her. She can't help but laugh! Seriously, this thing has helped me reduce conflict in my marriage, which is probably worth an extra star, but...<br /><br />It's not very comfortable to use. I don't have issues with TMJ, but repeatedly opening and closing my mouth around these purported 40lbs of resistance leads to some pretty unpleasant soreness after about a minute or two. It hasn't gotten better with repeated use. In any case, I keep trying because it doesn't seem to be doing any damage. In the end, I haven't really noticed much in the way of increased chiseling after a month of use, but I guess I'll keep trying.

The wooden handle is ergonomic, and the longer bristles coupled with boars bristles make fast work of unruly hair. Both my toddler and I have wavy, relatively thick hair, and we're able to get it under control with this brush. It's priced right (under $10 when I got it), and the quality really seems higher than expected for that price range. Just be aware, when they say small, they mean small. My wife's standard sized hair brush is considerably larger. If you need something bigger, this may not be the best option, but if you have fairly short hair and are okay with a smaller brush, this one is great.<br /><br />***I write reviews as a hobby because I love trying out electronics, clothing, household products, kitchen devices, and more.

I've been using a straight razor for some time, but these cartridge type razors are definitely easier to use and less likely to produce accidental cuts. I was excited to try this, and in general, it's been pretty good, but not amazing. The razor itself is quite heavy and looks very cool. The cartridge fits easily and is easy to change if necessary. There's also the heavy base piece to stand the razor up. The shaving cream is not that great. It comes out of the can with impressive body, but once you start applying it to your face, it deflates and just doesn't provide awesome coverage. The razor is smooth on the skin, but because of its asymmetrical design, it's less comfortable in the left hand. I'm right handed, but I still switch between hands when I'm shaving different sides of my face. It would have been better if they made it symmetrical.

Her initial impression was that it might be something that she wouldn't want to continue using because it's extremely oily. She was worried it would leave an oily residue on her skin after using it. However, despite going on very oily, it leaves no nasty residue and washes away quickly and easily, taking makeup off with it.

Her initial impression was that it might be something that she wouldn't want to continue using because it's extremely oily. She was worried it would leave an oily residue on her skin after using it. However, despite going on very oily, it leaves no nasty residue and washes away quickly and easily, taking makeup off with it. She says her skin feels pleasant and cleansed after using this, and it's far less harsh than many chemical makeup removers.\nReview Title: Highly effective\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n        Format your response exactly as follows:\n        POSITIVE SUMMARY:\n        [Your positive summary here]\n\n        NEGATIVE SUMMARY:\n        [Your negative summary here]\n\n        OVERALL SUMMARY:\n        [Your overall summary here]",
  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user has expressed satisfaction with various products, particularly highlighting their effectiveness in addressing skin dryness and hydration. They noted rapid results from moisturizers, which were described as pleasant in texture and aroma. The face wash left the skin feeling soft and was recognized for its gentle formula. A hairbrush has also received positive feedback for its ergonomic design and quality, especially for managing thick and wavy hair. Additionally, organic castor oil has been praised for its moisturizing properties, leaving hair and skin appearing healthy. A makeup remover distinguished itself through its effective cleansing without any greasy residue, significantly enhancing the user\u2019s skincare routine.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nSome products didn't meet the user\u2019s expectations, particularly the jaw exerciser, which they found uncomfortable and ineffective after prolonged use. They described this product as ridiculous to use and noted persistent soreness, leading to doubts about its effectiveness. The shaving kit, while visually appealing, proved to be less effective than anticipated, specifically regarding the shaving cream that fell short in delivering adequate coverage and comfort. Overall, these experiences were marked by awkwardness or discomfort that tarnished the product appeal.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user's shopping experiences reveal a blend of positive and negative interactions. On one hand, various skincare and grooming products notably improved skin texture and hydration, earning high ratings for their effectiveness and pleasant usage. On the other hand, experiences with certain fitness and grooming items revealed discomfort and dissatisfaction, particularly with items that failed to deliver on their promises or were deemed impractical. This mix of effective products along with some disappointing experiences suggests a discerning approach to selecting grooming essentials with a preference for results-driven options.",

    "text": "These patches are made of silicone and are meant to block sun rays. They're fairly large for my wife's face (she's the one who got them), and they don't stay on quite as well as she'd like for outdoor activities such as running. In fact, she's used them in the winter months, when the weather where we live is mild to cold. In the summer when it gets hot, they're even less likely to stay in place. So, these may work for some people, but they didn't turn out for us to be quite as waterproof/sweatproof as the product description implies.",
