You can slide it down when you\u2019re using the brush so you don\u2019t have to take it off. There are also covers for applicators for lip gloss. They have a little suction cup on the bottom so you can keep it attached to the container so you don\u2019t lose it. This keeps your lip gloss sanitary because you\u2019re not constantly sticking your finger in the pot.",
