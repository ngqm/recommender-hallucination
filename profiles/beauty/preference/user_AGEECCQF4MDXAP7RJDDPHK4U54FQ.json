  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:  \nThe user has had several positive experiences with various products. Notably, they found a face mask to be effective for sensitive skin, reporting visible improvements in skin condition and recommending it to others. A hand sanitizer was praised for its convenience and non-drying formula, especially for families with kids, suggesting it's a reliable choice. Furthermore, a wax product was highly rated for its ease of use, as it melted well and effectively managed unwanted hair without causing sensitivities. Overall, the user enjoyed practical and effective products that catered to unique skin care needs.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:  \nThe user has expressed dissatisfaction with certain products, primarily due to ineffectiveness. They described a hair care kit as having left their hair dry, despite acknowledging its popularity among others. Additionally, a face mask was met with indifference, where the user found the results unsatisfactory and the aftermath uncomfortable. This indicates a struggle to find suitable products that align with their specific needs and preferences, highlighting the challenge of product matching in their shopping experiences.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:  \nThe user's purchase history reflects a mixed bag of experiences. They highlighted several effective products that catered to specific skin and family needs, particularly appreciating the convenience and results of certain face and hair care items. Conversely, they've also encountered products that did not live up to expectations, leading to disappointment with their performance. This suggests a learning curve, as the user seeks out better-suited items while navigating varying results in their beauty and personal care journeys.",
