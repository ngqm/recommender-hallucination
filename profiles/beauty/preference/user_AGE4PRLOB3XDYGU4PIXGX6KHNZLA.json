  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user has had several positive experiences with their purchases, particularly appreciating the effectiveness and quality of certain products. They have expressed satisfaction with the prompt delivery times and have noted great pricing on items that enhance their productivity, such as tools for eyelash application. The user also values usability, as seen in their enjoyment of items that boost efficiency and ease in beauty routines. One product consistently received praise for its effectiveness in enhancing the appearance of curls, signifying a strong preference for products that deliver on promises of quality and performance.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nHowever, there are notable negative experiences reflected in their reviews. The user pointed out issues with certain products, such as glue drying out rapidly, rendering it less effective. They also expressed disappointment over specific features like a lack of a secure locking mechanism on a storage item, indicating a desire for sturdiness and security. Furthermore, they felt that one of the purchased items did not justify its price, leading to a perception of poor value for money. Overall, these negative experiences highlight concerns regarding product reliability and value.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nOverall, the user's shopping behavior reveals a blend of satisfaction and dissatisfaction. Positive interactions stem from the high usability and effectiveness of beauty and cosmetic products, alongside appreciation for timely deliveries and competitive pricing. Conversely, frustrations arise from concerns about the reliability of certain items and their features, as well as perceived value for cost. This duality underscores the complexity of the user's shopping experiences, suggesting they value both effectiveness and quality alongside price.",
