It's been a hard adjustment.  I know no cream or non surgical option will give me results like surgery would.  The cooper's ligaments once stretched will not suddenly retract from a serum.<br />This serum is light and easy to apply.  It does not irritate my sensitive skin and leaves it moisturized.  I also use a hyaluronic serum.<br />That being said I have noticed a small improvement.  They look a little fuller, not a measurable difference but to my eye they look a little less sad.  This in theory increases estrogen activity locally to increase the fullness of the breast tissue.  This will not replace a surgical breast lift but for minor changes it works for me.\nReview Title: Subtle changes\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Kidskin- Foaming Body Wash with Tea Tree Oil- Helps Combat Body and Foot Odor and Stubborn Body Acne and Skin Issues - Cruelty Free, Gluten Free, Paraben Free, Sulfate Free, Unscented, and Vegan- Made in USA\nReview Date: 2021/06/01\nStore: Kidskin\nProduct Description: ['Kidskin Foaming Body Wash with Tea Tree Oil is designed exclusively for teens, tweens, pre teens, and boys and girls to work as an effective, yet gentle body wash.
