I did use more than the recommended amount, which I found to be a bit on the low side since the size of the mist is so small the amount of product that you get out on a single spray is minimum. After I applied, I watched in the mirror as it dried, and the effects were amazing. My shine do go away and I could literally see my pore getting smaller. I could see myself using this alone on a hot summer day without makeup because the finish it gave was just that great. My makeup also went on very easy and smooth and felt as if it was gliding across my face and not going into every wrinkle and groove.

  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user has experienced several positive interactions, particularly with products offering great value and effectiveness. They appreciated the softness and natural appearance of the wigs and found them to be a good deal for the price. The primer's fine mist and impressive oil control were highlighted, making it a new staple in the user's makeup collection. Additionally, the user expressed satisfaction with the comfort and wearability of the lashes, indicating they were well-suited for everyday use.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nOn the flip side, the user encountered negative aspects related to certain products. One wig received average ratings, with the user noting that it did not meet expectations regarding density. In skincare, the eye patches did not deliver noticeable results, leading to disappointment. They also mentioned the primer's spray quantity as being insufficient, requiring more product to achieve desired results, indicating a potential flaw in the product design.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nOverall, the user has a mixed shopping experience. While they enjoyed positive aspects such as good value, comfort, and effective makeup solutions, certain products left them underwhelmed due to performance issues or product design flaws. The positive reviews indicate preference for value-driven and effective products, whereas the negatives suggest a need for improvements in effectiveness and usability across some purchases.",
