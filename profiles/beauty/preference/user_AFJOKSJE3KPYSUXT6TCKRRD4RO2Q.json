The eyeliner came off so much easier than I thought it would....with a little warm water. It balls off into tiny chunks and doesn't run or scuff or leave marks behind.<br /><br />These work better than I thought they might and I will be using them again.\nReview Title: Stay in place\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Heyedrate Activated Charcoal Soap Bar and Face Wash | Organic, Vegan, Natural Soap made with Dead Sea Mud and Our Essential Oil Blend (1 Pack (5 Ounces))\nReview Date: 2021/03/17\nStore: Eye Love\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Brand': 'Eye Love', 'Scent': 'Eucalyptus, Coconut, Grapefruit, Rosemary', 'Material Feature': 'Organic, Natural, Vegan', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Product Dimensions': '4 x 1 x 1 inches; 4.97 Ounces', 'UPC': '850436007827'}\nReview Text: My son loves charcoal soaps. So, we gave this one a try.<br /><br />Pros: - smooth<br />  - very pleasant, herbal smell<br />  -  Dead Sea mud nice additive<br />  - has a nice, homemade cut<br /><br />Oddity (but not really a con): - seems to be almost moist although it isn't<br /><br />This soap has such a pleasant odor in comparison to the usual charcoal soaps my son uses. It also doesn't leave as sticky of a black residue in the shower. It is smooth and soapy, and is very nice on the skin...which I'm assuming has something to do with the Dead Sea mud. The bar isn't factory cut but has a nice, homemade appearance. My son really likes this one quite a bit.\nReview Title: Pretty good soap\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Black To Grey Ombre Synthetic Wigs Mixed Color Natural Wave Wigs for Women Natural Hairline Lace Long Wig for Daily Use Heat Resistant Hair Replacement Wigs (Ombre grey)\nReview Date: 2021/10/01\nStore: Refined hair\nAverage Rating: 2.9\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '10.04 x 5.94 x 2.09 inches; 9.91 Ounces'}\nReview Text: We picked this one up for a Halloween costume. It comes packaged in a plastic box, in plastic bags, in a hairnet to make sure it doesn't knot. The hair has an okay quality for its purpose, sits well on the head, and does look like we'd expected. What threw us was that the box claims it's 100% Brazilian hair (what's that?) but it also claims it's made in China. Maybe more knowledge-able wig-wearers will understand that. The hair has a synthetic feel to it and doesn't style quite as well as it could. But, as said, for our purposes it works very well.\nReview Title: Looks nice and sits well\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n        Format your response exactly as follows:\n        POSITIVE SUMMARY:\n        [Your positive summary here]\n\n        NEGATIVE SUMMARY:\n        [Your negative summary here]\n\n        OVERALL SUMMARY:\n        [Your overall summary here]",

Complaints included the thinness of certain masks, leading to a frustrating application experience. Additionally, there were observations regarding texture or effectiveness, such as creams causing a tightening sensation that was unexpected or wigs that felt synthetic and did not meet styling expectations. Queries relating to product descriptions also arose, suggesting potential confusion over material quality.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user's shopping behavior suggests a blend of positive and negative experiences. While they enjoyed effective and fragrant products that contributed to their skincare and self-care routines, challenges with fit and texture occasionally detracted from enjoyment.

The container is solid, keeps the soap slices in place (and not in my purse), and is no problem to open and close as needed. The scents between the various colors are noticeable, and each person in the family has their favorite. There are 50 sheets in each container, which slide right out (just don't get it wet!). They dissolve easily in the hand with a bit of rubbing and water, and do leave the hands feeling clean.<br />My husband especially enjoys them, since he's always on the road. These take up little space, while giving him a chance to clean his hands whenever necessary. I keep it in my purse for those terrible moments when soap isn't available, which doesn't happen very often, but these also hold well.<br />So, I'm liking them.",
