When I first opened the jar I saw that it was a clay based masque and I thought DRYING. However, this is NOT THE CASE AT ALL! The masque is carefully formulated to be both cleansing and exfoliating, but also moisturizing. I felt slight warming and tingling while the masque was on, but it was not irritating at all. The masque contains very small beads made of jojoba that soften on your skin while you have the masque on. When you wash the masque off with warm water, rub the beads in for extra moisture.

  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:  \nThe user has had several positive experiences, particularly with products that are effective and pleasantly fragrant. They appreciated the noticeable reduction in puffiness and darkness from the eye gel, along with its appealing scent and texture. The foaming cleanser was lauded for its moisturizing properties despite its effective cleansing action. Users enjoyed the richness of the eye concentrate while also finding it lightweight. The clay-based masque provided a unique combination of cleansing, exfoliating, and moisturizing qualities, leading to visibly improved skin. Additionally, the divine scent and suitability for dry, curly hair of the conditioner were prominently appreciated.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:  \nThe user encountered mixed results with specific products, notably the eye concentrate and the conditioner, both receiving average ratings. Despite initial positive impressions, the eye concentrate did not achieve a high level of satisfaction, reflecting a possible inconsistency in effectiveness. Similarly, while the conditioner was praised for its smell, it did not impress across the board, suggesting that it may not meet all expectations for those with very dry or curly hair.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:  \nThe overall shopping behavior reflects a strong preference for products that are organic and effective, with a clear appreciation for pleasant scents and functionality. While the majority of products received high ratings, some fell short of expectations, particularly in terms of consistency in effectiveness. The user values both performance and sensory experiences, leading to general satisfaction but also room for improvement in select items.",
