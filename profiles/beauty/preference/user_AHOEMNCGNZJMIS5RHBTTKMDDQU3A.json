This hinoki smells like evergreen, dry cedar, with a lemon-like undertone; the scent has a calming effect and lasts throughout your soak.

The lowest setting however are perfect for sensitive teeth. Unit charges really fast and can be plugged into a laptop or phone charger for travel. I also like the fact that the charger is a little more present than some others, so you can find it more easier. I had one with just a cable and the cable got tossed.

The wand is great for separation of each lash which helps evenly apply the formula to each lash. The formula goes on kind of clumpy as shown by other reviewers and flakes with wear. I had to wipe the fallout twice which would be terrible if I were wearing full coverage foundation. It does, however, remove easy with facial wipes.\nReview Title: Volumizing at a Cost\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Veta \u2013 Lash and Eyebrow Serum \u2013 2-in-1 Lash & Brow Pen \u2013 Produces Longer, Healthier, Denser Lashes and Thicker Brows \u2013 Eyelash Serum \u2013 Boosts Skin Collagen \u2013 Drug-Free Formula - 1 fl oz.\nReview Date: 2020/03/23\nStore: Veta\nAverage Rating: 3.4\nProduct Details: {'Color': 'Silver, Black', 'Brand': 'Veta', 'Item Form': 'lotion', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Package Information': 'Tube', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '5.2 x 1.61 x 1.57 inches; 1.13 Ounces', 'UPC': '861121002645'}\nReview Text: I thought this might be a gimmick, but it honestly showed results.

  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user has shown a preference for products that deliver pleasant sensory experiences, particularly appreciating earthy and calming scents found in bath items. They have consistently praised effective personal care tools, with notable satisfaction regarding strong cleaning performance and speedy charging capabilities. The user values multipurpose products, finding success with serums that promote healthy hair growth, leading to noticeable results. There\u2019s also enthusiasm for moisturizing products that offer various uses while providing good value.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nSeveral experiences highlight disappointing aspects of the user's product journey. They noted issues with certain mascaras that resulted in clumping, flaking, and smudging, detracting from overall satisfaction. Additionally, skincare products fell short of expectations, particularly one that failed to deliver visible results, leaving the user with persistent skin concerns. They expressed frustration about the high cost of a facial bar that was not moisturizing and sold in an unappealing small size.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user's shopping experience is marked by a mix of positive and negative interactions. They appreciate products that enhance sensory enjoyment and meet functional needs effectively, especially in bath and personal care categories. However, there are recurring concerns about product performance, especially in makeup and skincare, where claims did not match reality. Value for money is a recurring theme; while some products delivered well, others were criticized for lack of effectiveness and high costs relative to their benefits.",
