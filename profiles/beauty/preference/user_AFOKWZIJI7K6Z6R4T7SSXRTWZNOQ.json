  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user reported several positive experiences, particularly enjoying the quality and aesthetics of specific items. The electric warmer was appreciated for its modern appearance and effective heating capabilities. The nail art charms received high praise for their unexpected quality, being described as nicer than anticipated and made of real metal, which added to their appeal. Additionally, the user found the skincare gift set appealing due to its full-size products and overall presentation. The Halloween costume set exceeded expectations regarding quality and functionality, with components that were well-constructed and practical.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user had notable negative experiences with multiple products. The eyebrow kit was criticized for the lack of powder and ineffectiveness of the stencils, leading to dissatisfaction. Similarly, the cleansing oil was found to have an unpleasant smell and left a greasy residue, detracting from its usability. The wig purchased exhibited numerous fit and styling issues, leaving the user frustrated due to its inability to sit properly or look natural. Overall, there were consistent complaints regarding certain items failing to meet expectations or requirements.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user's shopping experience reveals a mixed bag of satisfaction. Positive sentiments were noted for the aesthetics and quality of certain items, especially in beauty and costume purchases. However, significant dissatisfaction was expressed regarding specific products that failed to perform as expected or had practical limitations. This indicates a need for careful selection to ensure product effectiveness, particularly in beauty and personal care items, juxtaposed with successful purchases in decorative and functional categories.",
