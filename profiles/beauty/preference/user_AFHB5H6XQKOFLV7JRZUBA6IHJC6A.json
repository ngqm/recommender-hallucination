I went with the 1b natural black because the 4 was described as light brown. Light brown is usually a 5. I suggest you go with the number instead of relying on the description. This is still a good product and will match my hair when I first color it... it is always a bit darker. Unfortunately, I was not blessed with thick luscious hair so my buns are super thin (see pictures). This scrunchie is made of synthetic hair and easy to use. I only need to use one but it came with three buns. This is an added bonus because over time synthetic hair will become frizzy and tangled.

I do not hook them to my mask, I just let them rest on my face under my mask. They don\u2019t help save my makeup but that is not what I use them for. I am a teacher and have a hybrid class (covid times). This means I am teaching in person and my remote students log on at certain times for lessons. So I wear this contraption for 30 minutes at a time. I teach pre k and my mask does not allow children to accurately hear me. I cannot take my mask of because I also have students in person. This bracket allows my young scholars to hear the important sounds during phonics and phonemic learning. It was difficult for my remote students to diffreintiate between sounds when segmenting words such as she, he, etc.\nReview Title: Met my needs\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Green Tea Stick Mask ,Purifying Green Tea Clay Mask,Cleansing Mask for Face Oil Control,Green Solid Mask,Deep Clean Pores for All Skin Types Men Women\nReview Date: 2021/07/10\nStore: sefudun\nAverage Rating: 3.3\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'sefudun', 'Item Form': 'Clay, Stick', 'Product Benefits': 'Cleansing', 'Scent': 'Green Tea', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Package Dimensions': '3.07 x 1.57 x 1.54 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I seen so many ads for this green mask I had to try it.

  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user has expressed satisfaction with several products, particularly appreciating the noticeable difference in quality when using a higher-end nail kit, leading to longer-lasting results. The user enjoyed using a professional hair scissors kit, noting its sturdy weight and precision in cuts, alongside useful accessories. Detangling hair products contributed positively to their hair care routine, highlighting a reduction in breakage and improved shine. The synthetic hair scrunchies provided added volume for hairstyling, enhancing the user's experience. Moreover, the functionality of the 3D mask bracket was recognized for aiding communication in a teaching setting, demonstrating its utility.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nConversely, the user encountered some disappointments, particularly with products that did not meet expectations. One skin oil caused breakouts, indicating it may not be suitable for combination skin types, while a mask was criticized for being ineffective and difficult to remove. Quality issues arose with a headband that began to fall apart quickly, leading to dissatisfaction. Additionally, a hair accessory did not hold up as intended during use, which detracted from its overall effectiveness. These experiences reflect inconsistencies in quality and performance across various purchases.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user's shopping experiences showcase a mixed bag of results. On the positive side, they found high-quality products that delivered on promises, particularly in hair care and nail kits, enhancing their grooming routines. However, negative experiences with ineffective skincare and inferior quality items highlighted gaps in product performance, leading to frustration. The varied satisfaction levels demonstrate the importance of product reliability, as well as the need for thorough research prior to purchases, balancing the joy of good finds with the disappointment of faulty items.",

Clip in extensions do not stay in my hair and they just fill heavy and uncomfortable. My hair is medium length below my shoulders. I got the dark brown halo to add volume not length. It is so easy to wear and blend. It\u2019s light weight. The hair is very nice, make sure you take care of it. Using it for awhile it hasn\u2019t gotten damaged or tangled. I\u2019m especially surprised by how easy halos are to wear.",
