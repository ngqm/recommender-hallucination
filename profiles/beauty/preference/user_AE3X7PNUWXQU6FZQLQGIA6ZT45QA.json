The dental mirror is incredibly handy for that use. I also find the dental picks are better for me as hobby tools. I've never felt the need to scrap my own teeth to risk damage to surrounding tissues. They do a good job in tiny crevices and have a textured handle which is easy to hold.

I found it difficult to get a decent lather from the sheets, even when using 2 or 3 at a time. This makes them less than ideal for bathing. However, I did get them to do a great job for cleaning just my hands. I would suggest them for cleaning hands while on the go. The scent is very light when added to water. A tin is included, which is a bit more durable than the paper envelopes. The tin slides open, matchbox style. I would recommend using the tin as it will withstand being transported in a pocket, purse or bag better than the paper envelopes. If you anticipate being exposed to rain, I would suggest to place the tin and/or envelopes into a plastic bag. Using water and friction is superior to using hand sanitizer, and with the soap sheets you will be able to maintain much cleaner hands while out and about.<br /><br />If you are looking for a portable soap for bathing, I would still suggest to use bar soap wrapped in wax paper inside a plastic bag. If you are in situations where you need to wash hands without soap provided, these are ideal for that need. I would recommend the soap sheets as they are easy to transport and cost effective for hand washing.

This was packaged well and arrived in great condition. What I really like is that this set of tools and inclusions comes in a multi-level box that is transparent. It is easy to see what inclusions are inside, which is very easy to use while working on a project. Pipettes are really great to remove bubbles and also to apply very small amounts of resin into detailed areas. The silicone mat is essential to protect a working surface and the tweezers are very useful to add small items into a poured resin piece. There are also extra 30ml mixing cups, tiny spoons and wooden sticks.<br /><br />These inclusions are great to use with other materials besides resin like nail art, decoupage glues, acrylic paint and polymer clay. This makes the set versatile for working with different mediums and for different projects. There are full round hole-less beads and also half beads. I really like the tiny seashells, my set also includes a tiny starfish. I am putting these into a resin painting with some sand I saved from a recent beach vacation. The only thing included with this set that is not useful to me are the finger cots, as I prefer to wear gloves when working with resin. The only negative aspect is very small, but some glitter was loose. I did not find this to be bothersome, but did want to mention that. There is a lot of supplies in this kit and I consider it to be a really great value for all that is included.

These are great to use as it's a nice and even texture. The colors are great for me to use under different stamps, stencils and with stencils for nail art. They also look great as plain colors under a glossy or matte topcoat. I find that it dries easily under my 36 watt lamp. I find this set to be a good value.

This was packaged well and arrived in great condition. What I really like is that this set of tools and inclusions comes in a multi-level box that is transparent. It is easy to see what inclusions are inside, which is very easy to use while working on a project. Pipettes are really great to remove bubbles and also to apply very small amounts of resin into detailed areas. The silicone mat is essential to protect a working surface and the tweezers are very useful to add small items into a poured resin piece. There are also extra 30ml mixing cups, tiny spoons and wooden sticks.<br /><br />These inclusions are great to use with other materials besides resin like nail art, decoupage glues, acrylic paint and polymer clay. This makes the set versatile for working with different mediums and for different projects. There are full round hole-less beads and also half beads. I really like the tiny seashells, my set also includes a tiny starfish. I am putting these into a resin painting with some sand I saved from a recent beach vacation. The only thing included with this set that is not useful to me are the finger cots, as I prefer to wear gloves when working with resin. The only negative aspect is very small, but some glitter was loose. I did not find this to be bothersome, but did want to mention that. There is a lot of supplies in this kit and I consider it to be a really great value for all that is included.

  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user has had several positive experiences, particularly with nail art supplies. They appreciate the value offered by the sets, noting the variety and quality of the items included. The easy application and unique designs of the nail decals were a highlight, as was the multifunctionality of the nail art tools and the versatility of the resin decoration kit. The satisfaction with the usability and outcome of their nail creations shows a clear trend in favor of these aesthetic products. Other notable favorites include the portable hand soap sheets and the effectiveness of the dental care kit, which served multiple purposes, indicating a liking for practical and creative solutions.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nIn contrast, the user has expressed dissatisfaction with the eyelash lift kit, primarily due to the harshness of the perm solution. This negative experience highlights concerns about product safety and effectiveness, distinguishing it from their otherwise favorable views on other beauty products. Additionally, there were issues with achieving lather from the hand soap sheets, which diminished their overall effectiveness for bathing despite being useful for hand washing. Minor inconveniences, like loose glitter in the resin kit, also suggested some quality control issues that could detract from an otherwise acceptable experience.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nOverall, the user's shopping experiences reveal a strong preference for beauty and craft products that provide value, creativity, and versatility. Positive feedback emphasizes satisfaction with nail art supplies, dental tools, and innovative hygiene products. However, there were notable negative experiences with the eyelash lift kit and challenges with certain soap products, indicating room for improvement in product formulation and utility. Despite some drawbacks, the majority of interactions demonstrate an enthusiasm for engaging in personal care and artistic hobbies, reflecting a predominantly positive sentiment.",

    "text": "I am very pleased with my experience using the Feminine Cleansing Wash. This is very easy to use in the shower as it has a hand pump. The scent is light and pleasant, yet doesn't leave a lingering perfumed odor. I have found that 'regular' soap does me no favors for cleaning my groin area as it's much to harsh for my lady bits. This is a great product to use for those of us that are mindful of our personal hygiene and want to be ready for any situation that comes up between showers. I find this to be a good value for the quality. I certainly will be making this wash a regular order in the future. I hope my experience is helpful as you kindly click the button below.",
