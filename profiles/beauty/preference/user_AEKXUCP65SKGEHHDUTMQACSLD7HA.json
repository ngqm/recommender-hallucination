  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user experienced several positive interactions with their purchases, particularly valuing products that effectively met their needs. Highlights include satisfaction with the compact and effective nail lamp that exceeded initial expectations, as well as appreciation for the sturdy and versatile nail forms that provided good value. Additionally, the barrier cream showed promise, contributing positively to their overall grooming routine. The user's feedback indicated a strong preference for items that delivered quality and practicality, enhancing their DIY nail experience.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nDespite the positive aspects, the user encountered numerous disappointments with particular products. They reported issues with unusable molds and inadequate performance, particularly regarding the barrier cream that failed to deliver any results. Other items, such as the nail files and dust collector, received critiques for their lack of quality and effectiveness, leaving the user dissatisfied. Consistent complaints highlighted products that underperformed or did not meet expectations, impacting their overall shopping experience negatively.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user's shopping experience reflected a mix of satisfaction and frustration. Positive feedback centered around effective, compact products that offered good value for DIY nail care. However, the disappointment was notable regarding several items that did not perform as expected, with quality issues recurring across different categories. This duality suggests that while the user found reliable products that enhanced their beauty routine, they also faced significant challenges with certain purchases that diminished their overall satisfaction.",
