I used nail polish remover in between nails to make it a little easier. Once the gel was finally applied, I was impressed, but the nails only lasted two days before falling off during daily activities like washing my hair and doing the dishes. And that was after I put dip powder on top of the polygel for color.

It was great for making small box braids. I sealed the ends with boiling water which worked just fine. It took 2 rounds of dipping my hair in the water to seal them though. The hair is separated into bundles and separated with twist ties. I like the twist ties better than bundles that are separated with hair ties. The twist ties were easier to get off without tangling the hair. I used olive oil, edge control, and hair gel infused with castor oil to braid my hair. All of the products worked well with the hair.

  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user has expressed high satisfaction with several products, particularly appreciating their effectiveness and ease of use. They enjoyed the gentle yet efficient formula of a cleansing pad, which effortlessly removes makeup without irritating the skin. In addition, the user found particular hairstyles easy to manage and style, receiving compliments on their appearance with various hair extensions. They also noted the lightweight nature of certain styles, enhancing comfort and minimizing maintenance. The overall positive experiences highlight effective and user-friendly beauty products that align well with their preferences.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user has encountered frustrations with some products in their shopping history. Specific challenges included difficulties in applying a nail gel due to its stickiness and lack of longevity, as the nails did not endure typical daily activities. Concerns arose from the packaging quality of a hair extension, along with an awkward fit of a wig that showcased a noticeable part that affected its overall appearance. Furthermore, several products proved to be unsuitable for beginners, particularly magnetic eyelashes that were difficult to apply, causing discomfort during use. \n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user's shopping history reflects a mixed experience across various beauty products. Positive aspects included effective makeup removal and fulfilling hair extension needs, along with compliments received on certain styles. However, challenges arose with products that underperformed, such as less durable nail gels and wigs with unappealing hairlines. Moreover, difficulties in application for beginners, especially with magnetic eyelashes, highlighted areas where products fell short. Overall, the user values effective beauty solutions but has faced significant struggles with product usability and durability.",

The picture shows the matte topcoat which I am not sure you can really see well on such bright colors. I am excited about having the topcoat, but for darker colors where the matte would be better contrasted. The gel is not the longest lasting that I've had and I've noticed the matte top coat specifically burns a little on my nails when under UV light. The color will last about a week, though I have had a couple of fingers peel off before that.",
