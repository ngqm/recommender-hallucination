With the utmost respect for our eco system, La Deessa sustainably combines Natural, Organic, Plant Based and Wild Crafted Botanicals with clinically proven & independently peer reviewed superstar natural and organic age-defying ingredients with highly effective delivery systems to create results-driven anti aging skin care products. KEY INGREDIENT HIGHLIGHTS: ALOE VERA increases your body\u2019s production of collagen and is packed with essential vitamins including A, B1, B2, B6, B12, C & E. Aloe penetrates skin four-times (4x) more rapidly than water and accelerates skin cell reproduction by as much as eight-times (8x)! VITAMIN C supports every aspect of collagen production from stem cell activity to improving the structural integrity, resilience and stability of the skin. Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate is an extremely stable and gentle Vitamin C derivative and a precursor to Vitamin C; it waits to convert into Ascorbic Acid until it is fully absorbed, at which time the sodium molecules separate, converting it into pure Vitamin C deep within your skin...this prevents irritation and amplifies antioxidant benefits, making Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate a superior form of Vitamin C in cosmetic formulations. HYALURONIC ACID has the unique ability to hold more than 1000 times its weight in water, allowing the skin to retain more water. Amazingly, hyaluronic acid adjusts its moisture absorption to your skin\u2019s need for moisture making it ideal for all skin types. Hyaluronic acid also protects the epidermis by scavenging reactive oxygen species generated by ultra violet light. Our formulations contain high percentages of Hyaluronic Acid. MSM- METHYL SULPHONYL MTHANE (ORGANIC SULFUR) Dubbed the \u201cBeauty Mineral\u201d Organic sulfur is referred to as the \u201cBeauty Mineral\u201d because it promotes oxygen transport across cell membranes (intracellular) facilitating cellular regeneration\u2026resulting in skin that is more beautiful.']\nAverage Rating: 3.5\nProduct Details: {'Skin Type': 'All', 'Scent': 'Fragrance Free', 'Brand': 'La Deessa', 'Item Form': 'liquid', 'Material Feature': 'Organic, Gluten Free, Natural, Vegan', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '4 x 2 x 2 inches; 3 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'LD-VITAC20', 'UPC': '040232150944', 'Manufacturer': 'La Deessa'}\nReview Text: I have very dry and sensitive skin and read so many good things about Vitamin C Serum.

Hydrate, Moisturize, Increase Collagen, Reduce Fine Lines, Hyper pigmentation & Acne.\nReview Date: 2014/07/09\nStore: La Deessa\nProduct Description: ['La Deessa products are the answer to compromised skin structure & integrity. With the utmost respect for our eco system, La Deessa sustainably combines Natural, Organic, Plant Based and Wild Crafted Botanicals with clinically proven & independently peer reviewed superstar natural and organic age-defying ingredients with highly effective delivery systems to create results-driven anti aging skin care products. KEY INGREDIENT HIGHLIGHTS: ALOE VERA increases your body\u2019s production of collagen and is packed with essential vitamins including A, B1, B2, B6, B12, C & E. Aloe penetrates skin four-times (4x) more rapidly than water and accelerates skin cell reproduction by as much as eight-times (8x)! VITAMIN C supports every aspect of collagen production from stem cell activity to improving the structural integrity, resilience and stability of the skin. Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate is an extremely stable and gentle Vitamin C derivative and a precursor to Vitamin C; it waits to convert into Ascorbic Acid until it is fully absorbed, at which time the sodium molecules separate, converting it into pure Vitamin C deep within your skin...this prevents irritation and amplifies antioxidant benefits, making Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate a superior form of Vitamin C in cosmetic formulations. HYALURONIC ACID has the unique ability to hold more than 1000 times its weight in water, allowing the skin to retain more water. Amazingly, hyaluronic acid adjusts its moisture absorption to your skin\u2019s need for moisture making it ideal for all skin types. Hyaluronic acid also protects the epidermis by scavenging reactive oxygen species generated by ultra violet light. Our formulations contain high percentages of Hyaluronic Acid. MSM- METHYL SULPHONYL MTHANE (ORGANIC SULFUR) Dubbed the \u201cBeauty Mineral\u201d Organic sulfur is referred to as the \u201cBeauty Mineral\u201d because it promotes oxygen transport across cell membranes (intracellular) facilitating cellular regeneration\u2026resulting in skin that is more beautiful.']\nAverage Rating: 3.5\nProduct Details: {'Skin Type': 'All', 'Scent': 'Fragrance Free', 'Brand': 'La Deessa', 'Item Form': 'liquid', 'Material Feature': 'Organic, Gluten Free, Natural, Vegan', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '4 x 2 x 2 inches; 3 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'LD-VITAC20', 'UPC': '040232150944', 'Manufacturer': 'La Deessa'}\nReview Text: I have very dry and sensitive skin and read so many good things about Vitamin C Serum.

I started using this stretch mark cream on my thigh area - where I really need help and I need this cream to work. After continuously using it for almost two weeks, I started seeing significant changes which leads me to believe that with regular use, this product will truly work wonders on stretch marks! Using this product and losing the stretch marks has given me more confidence! Summer is fast approaching and I won't be as self conscious when trying out new swimsuit styles.

In other words, just about every complaint surrounding aging skin can be traced at least in part to sun exposure, making daily sunscreen protection with an SPF 30 sunscreen a must. But not all sunscreens are created equal. \\xa0OZNaturals Age Defying Solar Shield SPF 30 Broad Spectrum Sunscreen with Zinc Oxide provides broad spectrum protection from the sun\u2019s harmful UVA/UVB rays, while moisturizing skin. As a zinc sunscreen, it utilizes the highly stable and reflective properties of Zinc Oxide, along with the natural UV diluting qualities of Octyl Methoxycinnamate. This natural sunscreen offers sheer, broad-spectrum UV coverage in a moisturizing formulation.']\nAverage Rating: 3.7\nProduct Details: {'Scent': 'Unscented', 'Product Benefits': 'Anti-Aging', 'Sun Protection': '30 SPF', 'Item Weight': '0.12 Pounds', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '2.5 x 3.5 x 1.5 inches; 1.92 Ounces', 'Item model number': '2Y-BD27-UJFL', 'UPC': '638317780645', 'Manufacturer': 'OZ Naturals, LLC'}\nReview Text: It is very hard to find an Anti Aging Sunscreen that works for my sensitive and perpetually dry skin - the struggle is real! Needless to say, I didn't really know what to expect when I got this sunscreen in the mail. However, I have used quite a few of OZ Natural's products and have never been disappointed with/by any of them! This sunscreen works very well with my extremely sensitive skin! I never got rashes, bumps, hives. redness and/or swelling, when I used this product. Also, I kid you not when I say that it works beautifully under makeup! Some of the sunscreen products that I have used in the past, altered the color and consistency of any foundation I use. Not this one from OZ Naturals!

I have no explanation, nor will I attempt to explain how the design and dynamics of this nifty tool works. One thing I can say is that it detangles my waist length hair like nothing else!

I experienced a lot less instances of hair fall, because this detangling brush separates the knots and tangled bits of my hair more efficiently.

  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user has expressed a strong satisfaction with various skincare products, particularly those featuring Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid. They appreciate the effectiveness in hydration, reduction of fine lines, and improvement in skin texture. Products that cater to specific skin needs, such as sensitivity and dryness, have been positively received. The user experiences noticeable results, such as a brightened complexion and diminished puffiness around the eyes. Additionally, they enjoy the aesthetic appeal and application ease of beauty accessories, as well as the performance of hair care tools that manage tangles effectively.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nSome products from the user's purchase history reflect mediocre experiences, indicated by average to low ratings. Certain items did not meet high expectations regarding efficacy, particularly those related to anti-aging and skin firming. There were concerns about performance inconsistencies, with some users expressing dissatisfaction with specific outcomes, such as not achieving the expected reduction of stretch marks or dryness. Moreover, while a few products worked well, they did not garner the same level of enthusiasm as others, leading to mixed perceptions overall.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user's shopping behavior reveals an inclination towards products that emphasize natural ingredients and targeted skincare benefits. While they enjoyed several items resulting in positive skin improvements and hydration, frustrations arose with others that didn\u2019t meet expectations. A pattern shows that effective results boost brand loyalty, with the user frequently advocating for successful products. However, occasional disappointments, particularly with less effective treatments, highlight the importance of efficacy in their purchasing decisions. Overall, there's a balance of positive and negative experiences shaping their skincare journey and product preferences.",
