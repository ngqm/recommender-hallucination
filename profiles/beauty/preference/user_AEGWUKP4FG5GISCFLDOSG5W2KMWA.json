It dries quickly.  Since this is water-based nail polish meant for little girls, it wears off quickly.  And you can peel it off very easily.

The set of 6 smaller bottles also comes with a glittery toe separator and kitty-shaped emory board.  The set of 4 larger bottles also comes with 50 nail stickers.<br /><br />These are the colors that you get:<br />Gold glitter (a small and a large bottle)<br />Baby blue (small and large bottle)<br />Baby pink (small and large bottle)<br />Violet (small and large bottle)<br /><br />Additional small bottles:<br />A slightly brighter baby pink<br />A deeper pink<br /><br />I took a photo to show you that the polish is the correct consistency and I applied it to my nails easily.  It dries quickly.  Since this is water-based nail polish meant for little girls, it wears off quickly.  And you can peel it off very easily. That way, you don\u2019t need harsh nail polish remover to take it off.<br /><br />This is not really suitable as a single 10 piece gift set since the bottles come in two totally separate packages of 4+6, and since ALL of the 4 larger bottles duplicate with the same color that is included in the set of 6 smaller bottles.  It is better as two separate (but similar) gifts.<br /><br />I write honest reviews to help others make informed purchases becasue I read reviews myself and appreciate how helpful they can be.  I hope that my review helped you!\nReview Title: Not a set of 10\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n        Format your response exactly as follows:\n        POSITIVE SUMMARY:\n        [Your positive summary here]\n\n        NEGATIVE SUMMARY:\n        [Your negative summary here]\n\n        OVERALL SUMMARY:\n        [Your overall summary here]",
  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user has consistently enjoyed high-quality products in their purchases. They appreciated the effectiveness of nail care and beauty items, noting that some removers do not dry out nails and are free from harsh chemicals. The eucalyptus essential oil stood out for its pureness and aromatic quality, enhancing their experience during cold relief. Affordable makeup tools have also been well-received, providing value with satisfactory performance. The hair clips were praised for their versatility and comfort, making them suitable for different hair types. Additionally, the gifting experience was noted positively, with a thoughtful presentation of self-care items that are both appealing and functional.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nSome purchases did not meet the user\u2019s expectations. The price of nail polish remover was viewed as too high compared to competitors, leading to a less favorable impression despite its effective formulation. Similarly, the packaged nail kit was criticized for misrepresentation as a single set, as it contained duplicates across two separate collections, which detracted from the intended experience. Concerns were also raised about the quality of certain makeup brushes, showing that some products had minor defects that impacted overall satisfaction. Additionally, the price of the gift set was seen as somewhat steep for what was included.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user\u2019s shopping experience reflects a mix of satisfaction and disappointment. They found several items effective and of good quality, particularly in terms of nail care, essential oils, and practical beauty tools. However, pricing and product presentation issues occasionally affected their overall impression. Duplication in gift sets and the high cost of certain products highlighted inconsistencies in value. The user appreciates thoughtful and functional gifts but looks for clarity and reasonable pricing to ensure they feel confident in their purchases.",

    "text": "There are three main things that are special about this hand sanitizer:<br /><br />(1) they ALL smell WONDERFUL.<br />(2) they pack a LOT of sprays into these tiny bottles so they are especially great for travel. They supposedly hold 500 sprays.<br />(3) if you love Disney, these are cute as can be!<br /><br />But there are two things I don\u2019t like so much:<br />(1) the cost. If you really get 500 sprays out of each bottle, maybe that\u2019s not a bad value on a per use basis\u2014 but about $50 for 4 of these is more money than a lot of people have to spend on hand sanitizer.<br />(2) I can\u2019t see any way to refill them. Most purse size hand sanitizers can be refilled\u2014even though you wouldn\u2019t get the same great smelling original product.<br /><br />Overall, these are certainly wonderful products and I LOVE them!  But for me they are mainly special occasion hand sanitizers.<br /><br />I write honest reviews to help others make informed purchases because I read reviews myself and appreciate how helpful they can be. I hope that my review helped you!",
