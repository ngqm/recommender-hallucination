I suggest when you place it in water to soak it unfolded and flat if possible because I had just added water to the pouch and let it soak folded in that and it was difficult to unfold. The eye holes and mouth holes were a bit too small for me so I will likely cut the holes bigger before soaking next time. Overall it did hydrate my skin some but not to the point where I wouldn't need to use moisturizer as I still had some dry patches. I did not experience any redness from this and for the rest of the day my skin has felt tighter.

It was cold and relaxing.<br /><br />Cons: The instructions on how to use are in Chinese. It's is a little difficult to position as the mask itself feels very much like slimy loose skin. My face turned red - but I do have very sensitive skin.<br /><br />Overall I was happy with the tighter looking skin. You will definitely look like something out of a horror movie when you wear this face mask so don't wear it around small children (see picture).\nReview Title: Works\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Mens Sea Facial Detox Facial Mask Sheet for Oily Skin- New Skincare - Blackhead, Pore Cleansing, Peel-off (Age under 35)\nReview Date: 2020/01/22\nStore: SeptCity\nAverage Rating: 3.9\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'SeptCity', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Product Benefits': 'Detoxifying', 'Skin Type': 'Oily', 'Unit Count': '6.00 Count', 'Product Dimensions': '7.09 x 5.51 x 0.79 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '733424600616'}\nReview Text: I was skeptical when I first opened the pouch for this mask and found a dry sheet that seemingly was just a paper towel with cut outs but when I followed the directions and soaked it in water for a minute it became thick and almost skin like. I suggest when you place it in water to soak it unfolded and flat if possible because I had just added water to the pouch and let it soak folded in that and it was difficult to unfold. The eye holes and mouth holes were a bit too small for me so I will likely cut the holes bigger before soaking next time. Overall it did hydrate my skin some but not to the point where I wouldn't need to use moisturizer as I still had some dry patches. I did not experience any redness from this and for the rest of the day my skin has felt tighter. I prefer the sheer masks that come pre mositened mostly because it saves me a step but it does do what it says it will do.\nReview Title: Hydrates ok\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: MainBasics Headband with Buttons for Face Masks (Gray)\nReview Date: 2020/06/14\nStore: MainBasics\nAverage Rating: 3.7\nProduct Details: {'Number of Items': '1', 'Brand': 'MainBasics', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '9.5 x 3.5 x 0.3 inches; 0.81 Ounces', 'UPC': '790887351233'}\nReview Text: It is a soft material headband and it is comfortable to wear. You do need to make sure the headband is flat against your head or your mask elastic will keep popping off the buttons though. It does give your ears a break if you have to wear a mask all day. I wish the buttons were more firmly sewn in place though.\nReview Title: Works\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: SUIBOBO skincare 100% quartz jade roller and Essential Oil bottle eye roller-real jade crystal gem stone marble cuarzo ice cold anti aging anti puff facial face roller eye roller massager\nReview Date: 2020/06/18\nStore: SUIBOBO\nAverage Rating: 4.8\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '7.13 x 3.66 x 1.46 inches; 7.16 Ounces', 'UPC': '619470980790', 'Manufacturer': 'HENNSERY CRAFT LIMITED'}\nReview Text: Easy to use and comes packaged nicely - very giftable.

I have used gold under eye masks before and this one wasn't as good. I like to put them in the refrigerator for a nice cooling effect when I wake up in morning and usually the cool feeling lasts 10 mins but with these after a minute it wasn't cool anymore. My eyes didnt look any brighter underneath after wearing for 20 mins. They do feel more moisturized so I gave 3 stars because of that.\nReview Title: They are ok\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: [Abib] Creme coating mask Tone-up solution 17g (5pcs)\nReview Date: 2020/07/27\nStore: Abib\nAverage Rating: 3.9\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Abib', 'Scent': 'Unscented', 'Number of Items': '5', 'Package Dimensions': '8.7 x 6.2 x 0.8 inches; 8.01 Ounces'}\nReview Text: This mask looks pretty terrifying when on but it does a fantastic job of soothing the skin. My skin is very pale and gets sections of redness easily and when I woke up this morning I had no red sections and my skin was really hydrated. It did leave my skin a bit oily looking but I used an oil paper to pull that out and my skin looked great after that.\nReview Title: Very soothing\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Reusable Cotton Swab Portable Silicone Swab Washable Cotton Swabs for Ear Cleaning Beauty Treatment Makeup Cotton Swab\nReview Date: 2020/09/24\nStore: JAOYU\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Product Dimensions': '3.2 x 3.2 x 0.39 inches', 'UPC': '739232135913'}\nReview Text: I love these silicone \"cotton swabs\"!!

I do like the scent but I can't think of anything to compare it to. The oil came wrapped in bubble wrap and in a zip lock style small bag but it wasn't sealed so that is really my only complaint.

  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user has appreciated several products, noting effective hydration and skin benefits. They experienced firmer skin after using facial masks, and the relaxing feel of jade rollers received high praise. The lip balm provided optimal sun protection without causing dryness, and the headband offered comfort during extended wear. The hair clip was highlighted for its quality and cute design, while the lipstick\u2019s natural matte finish and impressive staying power were well-received. Users generally enjoyed the soothing effects of various face masks, with notable satisfaction regarding their hydrating properties.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user encountered multiple drawbacks, particularly with the application and effectiveness of some products. Issues arose with mask instructions being in an unfamiliar language, and some products were reported to leave skin feeling oily or did not show immediate visible results. The under-eye patches did not cool as expected, and there were concerns about the fit of certain masks being uncomfortable. The hair bun maker was too large for the intended user, leading to dissatisfaction, and the user expressed frustration with not noticing immediate benefits from a topical filler product.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user\u2019s experience encompasses a blend of satisfaction and disappointment. Many skincare items were effective for hydration and skin rejuvenation, leading to positive feelings about skin appearance and comfort during use. However, challenges with product instructions, fit, and efficacy were common, indicating areas for improvement. While the user found some products underwhelming in performance, those that worked well enhanced their overall skincare routine. This balance reflects a consumer journey rich with exploration in skincare and beauty, showcasing both successes and areas needing refinement.",
