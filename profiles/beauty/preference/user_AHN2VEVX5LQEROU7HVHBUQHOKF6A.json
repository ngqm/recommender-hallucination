  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:  \nThe user has consistently enjoyed products that enhance creativity and self-expression. They appreciated the easy usability and versatility of certain items, finding them effective for their intended purposes. Positive experiences include effective skin hydration from a primer, lasting beauty from temporary tattoos, and successful results using an eyelash perm kit. Many products stood out for their aesthetic appeal and functionality, leading to high satisfaction ratings.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:  \nSome experiences were marked by challenges and frustrations. The user noted that certain hair care products could be damaging, particularly for those with thin or fragile hair, which limited their usability. Concerns about excess oiliness when using the primer indicated that it may not suit all skin types. Additionally, the temporary tattoos' short duration (lasting only two days) was seen as a drawback.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:  \nThe user's shopping behavior reflects a balance of positive and negative experiences. They show a clear affinity for beauty and self-care products that deliver on creativity and effectiveness. However, they also encountered products that posed usability issues or did not meet expectations, particularly regarding hair care and skin compatibility. Overall, their purchase history demonstrates a journey of exploration in personal grooming, with an inclination toward items that offer both fun and functional benefits.",
