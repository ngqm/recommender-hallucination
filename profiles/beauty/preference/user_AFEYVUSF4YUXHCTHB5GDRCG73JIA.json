When I got the opportunity to review this product at a reduced price, I was pretty excited.<br />It comes with several tools. There are many different sizes to choose from, based on the size of the whitehead you are removing. The lancet is sharp enough to work without being dangerously sharp.<br />Besides being useful just for blackhead, whitehead or small cysts, these are also pretty useful with splinters and ingrown hairs. Comes with sterilization instructions and a very nice zippered pouch.\nReview Title: Great for face and body\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Straight 13x4 Lace Front Wigs Burgundy Lace Front Wigs Long Bob Synthetic Ombre Wine Red Wig Pre-plucked with Baby Hair Free Part Heat Resistant Synthetic Lace Wigs for Women 20 Inch\nReview Date: 2020/02/14\nStore: NOBLE\nAverage Rating: 3.8\nProduct Details: {'Material': 'Human Hair', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Style': 'Modern', 'Special Feature': 'Heat Resistant', 'Brand': 'NOBLE', 'Package Dimensions': '13.74 x 7.87 x 2.2 inches; 12.63 Ounces'}\nReview Text: First off, I couldn't get this wig on fully. I adjusted it as much as I could and still it didn't lay right. Apparently, I have a huge head.<br /><br />Besides that, I really was impressed with the quality. It came with the wig cap, a nice box, and false lashes. The quality is pretty darn impressive for the size. It looks and feels like real hair. Its really cute. I am pretty disappointed tjat my huge noggin keeps me from wearing it.<br /><br />Absolutely recommend for normal heads \ud83d\ude09\nReview Title: Nice wig, amazing quality for price\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Natwag Makeup Remover Pads,18 Pack 3.74 Inch Reusable Microfiber Cleansing Pad with Laundry Bag Suitable for All Skin Types,3 Color Facial Cleansing Pad Set.\nReview Date: 2020/07/28\nStore: Natwag\nAverage Rating: 4.6\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Natwag', 'Skin Type': 'All Skin,Dry', 'Material Feature': 'Reusable', 'Unit Count': '18.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '18', 'Package Dimensions': '4.4 x 4.37 x 2.59 inches; 3.84 Ounces', 'UPC': '745103569701'}\nReview Text: I was pretty hesitant on these. I mean, my microfiber cleaning cloths are kinda rough and definitely not something I want to put on my skin. However, these are soft like a dream cloud.<br /><br />They do come with a laundry bag but I washed by hand.<br /><br />I washed one side of my face with a washcloth and the other with these. Then I swiped micellar water over each side. The microfiber side had a tiny bit of makeup residue. The washcloth side had waaaay more. I was pretty stunned.<br />I now only use these for makeup removal.

They glue themselves shut..the brush turns to concrete. ..and so on. I thought I would give these a go. I only dislike the base coat a bit, it doesn't seem as sticky as some others I have used. It's decent,  don't get me wrong, just mho. The activator is great, dries rock hard and the top coat settles smooth and shiny. They, so far, haven't glued themselves shut or turned to rock. We'll see how well they hold up.\nReview Title: Decent top coat and strong activator\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: PHOERA 30ml Foundation Liquid Full Coverage 24HR Matte Oil Control Concealer (Nude #102) with Face Primer & Air Cushion CC Cream BB Cream Mushroom Head Foundation & Petal-Shaped Cosmetics Brush\nReview Date: 2021/09/02\nStore: SIGHTLING\nAverage Rating: 4.2\nProduct Details: {'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Finish Type': 'Matte', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Redness, Dark Spots, Wrinkles, Uneven Skin Tone', 'Package Information': 'Bottle', 'Package Dimensions': '6.22 x 3.5 x 3.19 inches; 8.64 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I am not a fan of the primer. It did not do good with my skin. The coverage was flawless, high-medium building up to full. it started settling into fine lines in an hour and by hour three, huge pores, wrinkles where i have none and flaking. wearing up under a mask was terrible even with setting spray, the transfer was unreal. i also tried varying primers, applicators (beauty blender, brush, the included brush which was not good for me) and it's not for long wear on me.<br />i was pretty impressed with the cc cream. the mushroom head applicator is really a beauty blender with a handle but feels pretty nice. the foundation is so pretty when it stamps onto the applicator. coverage was high medium, didn't cover all my redness but tbh nothing does when my face is flaring. and it wore pretty well until i realized i was orange. like an actual orange. so i tried different primers, all with the same result. major oxidation.<br />for coverage for an event or photos, the liquid foundation is really pretty for a few hours. i am disappointed that these didn't agree with my skin, because they are really good products.\nReview Title: The coverage is really good but not for dry skin\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Tammy Taylor Beauty Gripper | Patent-Pending Makeup Sponge Blender Holder, Gripper & Drying Stand All in One | Perfect Travel Size | Made in USA\nReview Date: 2021/09/06\nStore: Tammy Taylor\nAverage Rating: 3.4\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Tammy Taylor', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '1.5 x 1.5 x 3.5 inches', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Travel,Blender', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '1.5 x 1.5 x 3.5 inches; 0.63 Ounces', 'Item model number': '1original', 'UPC': '764227646839'}\nReview Text: I thought these would be so cool and make my sponges be more like a mushroom head applicator. Well...i've tried it with my beauty blender, my elf blending sponges, and a generic beauty blender to no avail. the angle is just not good. I feel like i whack myself in the face pretty regularly and i've not been able to use them, tbh. it's a shame because i thought it would be good. however, maybe i'm just not getting this. I end up hitting my face with the plastic or dropping the sponge. as always, your mileage may vary.\nReview Title: I really either can't get the hang of this or it's just not for me\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n        Format your response exactly as follows:\n        POSITIVE SUMMARY:\n        [Your positive summary here]\n\n        NEGATIVE SUMMARY:\n        [Your negative summary here]\n\n        OVERALL SUMMARY:\n        [Your overall summary here]",
  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user has expressed satisfaction with several products that demonstrate strong performance and desirable features. Specifically, a nail stamping plate organizer was praised for its quality construction, durability, and user-friendly design. It held items securely through various mishaps, indicating reliability. The reusable makeup remover pads received high commendation for their softness and effectiveness in removing makeup, surpassing traditional methods. Additionally, a wig showed impressive quality, with the user noting its realistic appearance and pleasant texture, although fitting issues were a concern. Overall, the user finds certain products to enhance their nail and beauty routines positively.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nConversely, there were notable disappointments with certain purchases. A peel-able nail lacquer caused significant damage to the user's nails, leading to frustration, while another product featured issues with residue and frustration regarding usability. A makeup foundation did not perform well on the user's skin type, leading to oxidation and discomfort over wear despite initial good coverage. Furthermore, a makeup sponge holder did not meet the user's expectations, leading to a sense of ineffectiveness and disappointment. These experiences highlight inconsistencies in product quality and performance.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user's shopping experiences reflect a mixture of satisfaction and disappointment across various products. Positive experiences predominantly stem from well-made items that enhance beauty routines, particularly in nail care and makeup removal. However, several products resulted in negative outcomes due to poor fit, usability issues, or inadequate performance, particularly concerning skin compatibility. This fluctuation in experiences suggests the user values both quality and effectiveness, seeking out reliable products while encountering challenges with others that fall short of expectations.",
