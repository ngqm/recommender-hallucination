It's very nice and stays on you for awhile. So, you pump out the 'gel' which I would call soap except for the fact that it doesn't lather much. Instructions say to pump in your hand then apply to face. I tried that, but my face felt too dry, so I moistened it a little bit and then applied the gel. I rinsed it off well and patted my skin dry. Within seconds I felt my skin drying up. If you have really dry skin, you know what I mean - that taut feeling you try to avoid. I had to get some cream and moisturize right away. I'm guessing there must be something like alcohol in this makeup remover. If you have oily skin or perhaps you're trying to remove a heavy foundation - this may be a good choice for you. But since I wear light makeup and have very dry skin, I can't use this. I'll try it again in the summer when my skin produces more oil as the scent is really nice and makes it worth a second try.\nReview Title: Not for dry skin\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Sia Botanics Vitamin C + Lemon Peel Brightening Cleanser Concentrate (4 oz)\nReview Date: 2021/04/24\nStore: Sia Botanics\nAverage Rating: 4.3\nProduct Details: {'Item Form': 'Serum', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Brand': 'Sia Botanics', 'Scent': 'Lemon', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '4.13 x 1.93 x 1.93 inches; 4 Ounces', 'UPC': '713757593908'}\nReview Text: I just washed my face with this Sia C + Lemon Peel wash.

  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user has had several positive experiences with their purchases, notably appreciating the aesthetic and functionality of various accessories and beauty products. Items like temporary body decorations and stylish hair clips were highlighted for their visual appeal and usability. Users experienced satisfaction with the performance of makeup sponges and hair cutting shears, emphasizing their effectiveness in application and cutting. A gentle scent and effective cleansing properties were also praised in skincare products, adding to their attractiveness. The overall sentiment reflects a strong enjoyment of products that enhance one\u2019s look and provide practical solutions.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nDespite overall positive interactions, the user encountered some drawbacks with certain purchases. Specific products were found unsuitable for dry skin, leading to discomfort immediately after use. There were also concerns regarding the usability and effectiveness of delicate body decorations, indicating potential issues with adherence. A lack of satisfaction was noted with certain tools that didn\u2019t meet all the user\u2019s needs, as they preferred alternatives that would better serve their purposes. These experiences highlight the need for caution regarding skin compatibility and personal preferences.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user\u2019s shopping history reveals a balance of positive and negative experiences. They expressed delight in various beauty accessories that offered aesthetic appeal and functionality, as well as satisfactory performance from hair cutting tools and sponges. However, issues arose with skin compatibility in certain cleansing products, alongside challenges related to delicate items not meeting expectations. These mixed experiences outline the importance of considering both personal skin type and intended product use when making beauty purchases, ultimately leading to a more satisfactory shopping experience.",
