But when I went to put it together it didn\u2019t go... no matter how hard I tried! That was upsetting. I had to get my dremel out to sand it down so it fit better and it\u2019s still not all the way on. With that said, the brush is super nice and scratchy on the back. And the foot brush/pumice stone is really nice too!

  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user has had several positive experiences with various products. They appreciated the efficient functionality and ease of use of tools that were well-designed and travel-friendly. Items such as polish holders and decorative bowls were particularly liked for their practicality and aesthetic appeal, with high ratings reflecting satisfaction. Users enjoyed the overall quality and effectiveness of the grooming and manicure products, expressing excitement and happiness about their choices.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nDespite some positive experiences, the user encountered several frustrations. Specific products failed to meet expectations, such as the hairdressing head, which did not hold a curl despite claims. Assembly issues with the back brush were noted, requiring additional effort to fit properly. Additionally, the nail dust collector received harsh criticism for its weak suction, proving ineffective for its intended use. These negative experiences contributed to lower ratings for certain items.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user's shopping experiences include a mix of satisfaction and disappointment. Positive highlights demonstrate appreciation for effective and aesthetically pleasing tools that enhance grooming routines. However, several products fell short of expectations, particularly in performance and assembly, leading to frustrations and lower ratings. Overall, while the user values quality items, inconsistent experiences suggest a need for improved product reliability and fulfillment of advertised capabilities.",
