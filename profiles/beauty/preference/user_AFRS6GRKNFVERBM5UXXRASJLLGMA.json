  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user has had consistently positive experiences with beauty products, particularly appreciating the effectiveness and affordability of skincare items. The vitamin serum produced noticeably smoother and clearer skin, earning a strong recommendation for its value. The eyeshadow palette was praised for its variety and pigmentation, despite some minor application tips needed for optimal use. Additionally, lip products, such as the ombre tints and jelly lip balms, were celebrated for their stunning colors and unique packaging, with several products leaving a long-lasting impression. The overall aesthetic appeal and practicality of packaging have also enhanced the user\u2019s satisfaction.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nSome negative experiences were noted, particularly concerning specific product qualities. The eyeshadow palette, while loved for its color range, had issues with fallout from vibrant shimmers. The user also found certain lip products less long-lasting than desired, and one item leaked during transit. Additionally, while some scents were acceptable, the user mentioned that certain mask fragrances were reminiscent of children's medicine, which might not suit all preferences. Such details indicate a need for improvement in scent quality and product durability.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user\u2019s overall shopping experience exhibits a blend of satisfaction with product effectiveness and aesthetic appeal, alongside a few areas needing adjustment. While the skincare and makeup products delivered on most fronts, with commendable performance and beautiful designs, minor drawbacks included scent preferences and application challenges. Overall, the user\u2019s enthusiasm for both established and budget-friendly brands highlights a positive inclination towards future purchases, affirming a strong connection with beauty products that balance quality and value.",
