It is Korean law to print exp date or manufacture date on skin care products and makeup products.(Makeup products have 3 years instead of 2.5 years.)<br />Product I receive is April 2021 exp date, that is only 10 month away and that means this was manufactured on Dec 2018, that sound pretty old as it is June 2020 right now....<br />Yes it is not expired but I have been using many korean skin care brands and almost always I get the products that have at least 2 years or longer exp date.<br />This is not something you use every day like toner and I only have 10 month to use and there's no way that I can use whole bottle by April.<br />I think it's good product but hopefully you'd get longer exp date product than mine so you wouldn't waste your money!\nReview Title: Wish I received longer exp date....\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: WeChip 666\nReview Date: 2020/07/20\nStore: WeChip\nAverage Rating: 3.8\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '7.91 x 3.23 x 2.32 inches; 10.23 Ounces', 'UPC': '726972070413'}\nReview Text: This is my new beauty gadget!!!<br />This is amazing!<br />I knew how great and work the ultrasonic cleaner is because my husband got me a ultrasonic jewelry cleaner years ago and I\u2019ve been loving it ever since.<br />It really amazes you to see how it can clean your jewelries without any soap and I even use for my glasses.<br />So when I start to seeing skin scrubber on SNS, I had no doubt that it would work.<br />And it really did!!!

  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user has expressed enthusiasm for several products in their purchase history, highlighting their love for beauty gadgets and effective skincare solutions. They appreciate items that are aesthetically pleasing, such as those made of ceramic, and effective in improving scents and ambiance. Positive experiences include the effectiveness of various skincare products, particularly those that hydrate and calm the skin without irritation. The user values packaging that enhances hygiene, such as individual packets for serums, and consistently recommends products that perform well and meet their skincare needs, particularly in relation to anti-aging and moisturizing properties.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nDespite mainly positive feedback, the user has encountered concerns regarding the expiration dates of some products. Items received with significantly shorter shelf lives were particularly disappointing, leading to frustrations about product freshness. There were also negative experiences with specific masks that were considered too thick and difficult to use, resulting in wasted product and dissatisfaction. This disappointment reflected a lack of alignment between expectations and actual product performance, particularly with cosmetics that did not absorb well and left excessive residue.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user demonstrates a clear preference for high-quality beauty and skincare products that provide effective results and a pleasant sensory experience. Their enthusiasm for functional beauty gadgets and effective skincare is evident, but their experience has been marred by issues related to product expiration and specific formulation disappointments. Overall, while the user enjoys many aspects of their purchases, including aesthetics and performance, there remain concerns that could affect their future buying decisions, specifically regarding product freshness and formulation adequacy.",
