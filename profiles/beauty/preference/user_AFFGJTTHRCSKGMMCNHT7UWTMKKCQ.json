Very vibrant. You get a ton of wefts for the price. I usually keep a single braid in my hair as a memorial, I loved the option of adding color. My daughter has thick blonde hair and this looked great on hers too, to spice up a day of wear. The only downside I had with this hair is how easily it tangled at the bottom as I braided it. It came with little colorful add ins and a hook.\nReview Title: So pretty but tangled easy.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: BELLA MODA Sponges Blender Puff for Powder, Liquid and Cream Makeup 4PCS Purple Beauty Blending Sponge Foundations Powders Wet and Dry Used\nReview Date: 2020/12/20\nStore: BELLA MODA\nAverage Rating: 3.5\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'BELLA MODA', 'Color': 'Purple', 'Material': 'Sponge', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Face Makeup', 'Package Dimensions': '5.8 x 2.9 x 2.9 inches; 2.4 Ounces', 'UPC': '823544676230'}\nReview Text: Purple is my favorite color and these were so pretty. I definitely preferred to use them wet. Dry was a little rough. I liked having a multitude of these to switch between cream liquid colors. Was also nice to have the option to put a couple aside to wash and still having a couple left. I love the little container. Was nicely packaged.
