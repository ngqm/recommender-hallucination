Since I got these I\u2019ve ordered 2 more cases of this brand. They make making fans seriously SO MUCH easier!! I\u2019ve used so many different brands and they either don\u2019t fan well or bend or lose shape. These are absolutely perfect. They don\u2019t lose shape from the tweezers at all or crimp like some cheap brands do! I absolutely love these so much and highly highly recommended trying these even if you are new to volume lashing like me. This order was for the 13mm and I ordered the like 16-22 I think and the 8-13 I think or something like that so that I have every size this brand has I wanted to stock up before everyone else sees how good they are and stocks up too lol.\nLicensed Cosmetologist review!",
