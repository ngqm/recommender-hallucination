  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:  \nThe user's experience highlights a strong satisfaction with several products, particularly in their functionality and performance. They appreciated the brushes, noting their effectiveness and appealing appearance. The drill bits received high praise for their fantastic quality, contributing positively to the manicure process. Other items, including a comprehensive nail drill set, were deemed well worth the investment, reinforcing the value found in these purchases. The user also enjoyed the reusable forms, mentioning improvement in their application skills over time, reflecting a learning curve that ended positively.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:  \nSome negative experiences emerged alongside the positive feedback. One set of brushes was found to be of poor durability, breaking shortly after initial use, signifying a potential quality issue. Additionally, the wooden handles of certain brushes were susceptible to damage from common nail products, detracting from their overall usability. Moreover, one product had mixed reviews due to the requirement of precise application techniques, which could create challenges for less experienced users.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:  \nThe user's purchase history reveals a blend of positive and negative experiences. On the positive side, many products were celebrated for their effectiveness, value, and overall performance, indicating a satisfactory shopping journey. However, issues of durability and usability for certain items suggest room for improvement, particularly concerning the materials used and ease of application. Overall, while the user enjoyed several successful purchases, certain products did not meet their expectations, emphasizing the need for careful consideration in future selections.",
