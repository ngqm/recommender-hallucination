Once the eyeliner dries, use the application tool to put the lashes on.<br /><br />It does feel a bit strange at first (if false lashes are new to you), and it may tickle around your eyes when you blink.

During the time of the pandemic, this is a must! It contains 70% alcohol, which is great to kill those nasty germs \ud83e\udda0! It smells similar to rubbing alcohol, however it\u2019s not too strong. I love this hand sanitizer as it doesn\u2019t dry out my hands like others.

My wife has wavy hair, as well as my daughter, and myself. My son has long, curly, coarse hair. This set works on all of our hair types! The largest hollowed our brush is great for blow drying. The smaller comb/brush is designed to remove tangles from curly hair, and it works well when using with detangling spray. There is a small attachment included, which hooks onto the back of the brush to keep the bristles together. You also get a wide tooth comb and a parting comb. Everything included in the set is lightweight and easy to hold. It\u2019s a great set at an amazing price!\nReview Title: The perfect set for your hair!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Shakira Perfumes - Dance for Women - Long Lasting - Femenine, Charming and Modern Perfume - Fruity Floral Notes - Ideal for Day Wear - 1.7 Fl Oz\nReview Date: 2020/07/30\nStore: Shakira\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Shakira', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Item Volume': '50 Milliliters', 'Scent': 'Dance', 'Special Feature': 'Long Lasting', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Language': 'English', 'Product Dimensions': '2.64 x 2.05 x 5.63 inches; 1.76 Ounces', 'Item model number': '8411061823033'}\nReview Text: My wife really likes this perfume by Shakira!

The box looks like a gift box, so these would make a great gift for someone special! \u2764\ufe0f<br /><br />The bath bombs are scented with essential oils and are very moisturizing. Each bath bomb is wrapped in tissue paper and labeled. The packaging is just amazing!<br /><br />The scents are strong, so these may not work for you if you are sensitive to strong scents.

They really do work! But, with these practice makes perfect.<br /><br />They come with 2 tubes of magnetic eyeliner (black), and 10 sets of eyelashes along with the application tool. When you apply the magnetic eyeliner, you have to be precise. The eyeliner is black, and will look very dark if you do too thick of a line. I would do thinner lines if possible, with about 2 layers so that the eyeliner is not overwhelming. Once the eyeliner dries, use the application tool to put the lashes on.<br /><br />It does feel a bit strange at first (if false lashes are new to you), and it may tickle around your eyes when you blink. But yes, these really work! With more practice my wife will get better at this.<br /><br />The only thing is that the magnetic eyeliner does not come off easily. You will need a good eye makeup remover to get this off as it\u2019s waterproof!\nReview Title: Practice makes perfect\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: 26 Inches Long Hair\nReview Date: 2021/04/13\nStore: SENSAIRUITE\nAverage Rating: 3.8\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'SENSAIRUITE', 'Material': 'Synthetic', 'Extension Length': '26 Inches', 'Hair Type': 'Straight', 'Package Dimensions': '11.18 x 6.97 x 6.38 inches; 1.9 Pounds'}\nReview Text: This mannequin head is great for the price. It includes the clamp, and the hair is very thick. The hair is not real human hair, it\u2019s synthetic... so it doesn\u2019t curl very good like real human hair.<br /><br />It is great for trying out new hair styles though, even for practicing hair cutting.
