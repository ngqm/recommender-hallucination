I usually buy it from the salons or from trusted sellers on Ebay for a much more reasonable price.  Having said that, I really like this shampoo.  It smells amazing, the lather is plentiful and silky, and I can genuinely say that my hair does feel a bit thicker.  While I don't think this shampoo has caused new hair growth, I do feel as if it's strengthened each individual strand to give my hair a slightly fuller look.

We ordered this to compliment my daughter's Mad Hatter Halloween costume and honestly, it looked like a hot mess when it arrived.  The bangs were going everywhere, the curls were tangled, there was no part...it was awful.<br /><br />My daughter, who is 12, has long, VERY thick blonde hair.  When the wig arrived, we tried it on with her hair down to make sure it fit.  It did.  Fast forward to Halloween...I braided her hair and pulled it into a knot at the back of her head.  Lo and behold, the wig wouldn't fit...it just kept sliding off her head.  That was my mistake...I should have tested it with a bun when it arrived.  Having said that, my daughter is incredibly petite...her doctor predicts she won't surpass 5' when she's full grown  Obviously, her head isn't that large.  My point?  If you're an adult or are purchasing this for a teen or big child, it likely won't fit.  I finally had to put her hair in a low bun at the nape of her neck to make it work.<br /><br />Unfortunately, because her natural hair was so low, we couldn't do the up-do we had planned because her bun showed if we did.  We ended up leaving it down, brushing it out, putting bobby pins in strategic places to help it frame her face and to contain it, and then I hair sprayed it in place.  Styling was especially difficult because the wig is sparse.  It's a lot of work to hide the netting underneath.  The netting is a yellow-beige color and stands out like bright white against the purple and teal.  We finally got it looking decent though, and she actually got many compliments on it throughout the evening, hence the higher star rating despite all the complaints.<br /><br />Once the wig was brushed and styled, the waves looked beautiful.  Just don't buy this expecting it to look great out of the box.  It won't.  It takes work.\nReview Title: Takes a lot of work to look good...\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Josie Maran Vibrancy Argan Oil Foundation Fluid - Smooth, Supple, Baby-Skin Finish That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alive With Color (30ml/1.0oz, Mystical)\nReview Date: 2018/01/04\nStore: Josie Maran\nAverage Rating: 4.3\nProduct Details: {'Item Form': 'Oil', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Package Information': 'Bottle', 'Brand': 'Josie Maran', 'Coverage': 'Medium, Full', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.5 x 0.9 x 0.9 inches; 4 Ounces', 'UPC': '755332585854'}\nReview Text: Let me start by saying, I did NOT order this from Amazon.  I ordered it from Sephora.  The reviews here regarding whether this product was a fake or not made me a little leery.  So, I'm reviewing the real Josie Maran Vibrancy foundation and not the Amazon version, real or not.<br /><br />As usual, I ordered the lightest shade, RG5.  It's a nearly perfect match.  It's described as being for fair skin with neutral undertones.  I typically prefer foundations with pink undertones, but this actually worked really well for me.<br /><br />The consistency is on the thin, runny side, which isn't surprising since oil is an ingredient.  Having said that, this foundation sits on the skin so beautifully.  It looks like real skin.  It's definitely not a matte foundation, so if that's your preference, this is not the foundation for you.  This foundation gives you more luminous, dewy-looking skin.  I don't typically care for dewy foundations, but again, I was surprised to like this one.  It just made my skin look healthy and plump.  It didn't look at all heavy, which is great because it didn't settle into my fine lines.  I did notice it took a while to set.  Again, not surprising considering the oil content, but you'll want to make sure you set it with powder before trying to blend blush/contour/bronzer, etc.  Otherwise, you'll likely look pretty streaky.<br /><br />Many reviewers here have mentioned a smell.  I didn't notice that at all, which is another reason I think the product people are buying here might not be legit.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because my t-zone gets oily fairly quickly while wearing it.<br /><br />I'd recommend this for more mature skin and dry skin types.  If you're oily, you can definitely still wear it, you just might have to blot a bit more than usual.<br /><br />Overall, though, a great foundation.  Just make sure it's what you're looking for.  It's a very specific look.\nReview Title: A beautiful, natural, dewy finish..\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: EBOOT 6 Pieces Stretch Elastic Yoga Headbands for Teens and Adults\nReview Date: 2018/01/07\nStore: EBOOT\nAverage Rating: 4.2\nProduct Details: {'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material': 'Cotton,Spandex', 'Fabric Type': 'Elastic', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Item Weight': '0.16 Pounds', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '7.87 x 2.76 x 0.12 inches; 2.56 Ounces', 'Item model number': '6 Pieces Stretch Elastic Yoga Cotton He', 'UPC': '713072664185'}\nReview Text: I'm wearing one of these right now as I take down Christmas decorations.

Again, not surprising considering the oil content, but you'll want to make sure you set it with powder before trying to blend blush/contour/bronzer, etc.  Otherwise, you'll likely look pretty streaky.<br /><br />Many reviewers here have mentioned a smell.  I didn't notice that at all, which is another reason I think the product people are buying here might not be legit.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because my t-zone gets oily fairly quickly while wearing it.<br /><br />I'd recommend this for more mature skin and dry skin types.  If you're oily, you can definitely still wear it, you just might have to blot a bit more than usual.<br /><br />Overall, though, a great foundation.  Just make sure it's what you're looking for.  It's a very specific look.\nReview Title: A beautiful, natural, dewy finish..\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: EBOOT 6 Pieces Stretch Elastic Yoga Headbands for Teens and Adults\nReview Date: 2018/01/07\nStore: EBOOT\nAverage Rating: 4.2\nProduct Details: {'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Material': 'Cotton,Spandex', 'Fabric Type': 'Elastic', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Item Weight': '0.16 Pounds', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '7.87 x 2.76 x 0.12 inches; 2.56 Ounces', 'Item model number': '6 Pieces Stretch Elastic Yoga Cotton He', 'UPC': '713072664185'}\nReview Text: I'm wearing one of these right now as I take down Christmas decorations.  They're really soft and stretchy, but tight enough to stay in place and hold your hair where you want it to be.  I like the muted, earthy colors and think these are well worth the money.\nReview Title: No complaints so far!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n        Format your response exactly as follows:\n        POSITIVE SUMMARY:\n        [Your positive summary here]\n\n        NEGATIVE SUMMARY:\n        [Your negative summary here]\n\n        OVERALL SUMMARY:\n        [Your overall summary here]",
  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user has had a generally positive experience with multiple products, especially appreciating the pleasant scents and effective results. The shampoo was noted for its amazing fragrance, silky lather, and a noticeable increase in hair thickness. The facial cleansing oil was praised for its gentle makeup removal, effective performance, and compatibility with sensitive skin. The stretchy yoga headbands were also well-received, highlighted for their softness, functionality, and appealing colors. Additionally, a foundation was commended for its natural, dewy finish that enhanced skin appearance without settling into fine lines.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nDespite several positives, the user encountered frustrations with product packaging, particularly with the shampoo bottles that were frequently faulty and prone to leaking. The eyeliner disappointed due to insufficient pigmentation, requiring multiple layers for a desired effect. The wig presented significant issues upon arrival, appearing tangled and poorly styled, which detracted from the overall experience. Difficulties in fitting the wig over thick hair led to challenges in achieving the intended look, and the netting's appearance was problematic during styling.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user's shopping behavior reveals a mix of satisfaction and disappointment with various beauty products. Positive aspects included appealing scents, effective performance, and comfortable accessories. However, recurring issues with product packaging and inadequate product performance countered some positive experiences. The user remains discerning in evaluating product authenticity, indicating a cautious approach to purchasing beauty items, especially from certain online stores. Despite some concerns, the user continues to find value in several products and is willing to share constructive feedback based on their experiences.",
