It is buildable, so you can make it look natural or blinding. The contour/bronzer is probably my least favorite part of the palette but I still like it. It was a little difficult to blend, it blends out best with a big, fluffy brush. The shade is somewhere between a contour and bronzer, it\u2019s a little too warm for my skin to be used as a contour so I blend it out more like a bronzer.

  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user's experiences highlight a strong appreciation for beauty products that enhance skin appearance and provide longevity. Several items, such as a mattifying spray and bronzer, received high ratings for their effectiveness in creating a flawless finish and maintaining a healthy glow. Users particularly liked the blendability and natural look achieved with these products. The stunning packaging of a hydrating serum was also noted positively, along with the moisturizing benefits it provided for dry skin. Overall, there is a clear trend of satisfaction with products that cater to skin needs while offering aesthetic appeal.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nDespite many positive experiences, the user encountered some dissatisfaction, particularly with the foundation powder. There were concerns about the product\u2019s high price relative to its performance, leading to feelings of it being underwhelming. Additionally, issues with color matching arose, revealing a preference for products with more neutral undertones. The bronzer's contour aspect was noted as difficult to blend, indicating varying performance across different components in palettes. Ultimately, a few products fell short of expectations, suggesting a critical view on value and usability.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user's purchase history reflects a blend of positive and negative experiences in their beauty product selections. On the positive side, products that enhanced skin glow, longevity, and overall aesthetics were highly appreciated. However, concerns arose over cost and effectiveness, particularly with foundation powders and certain palette components. While the user enjoys products that meet skin needs and offer beauty, there remains a demand for better value and performance consistency. This combination of satisfaction and critique offers a nuanced view of the user's beauty shopping behavior.",
