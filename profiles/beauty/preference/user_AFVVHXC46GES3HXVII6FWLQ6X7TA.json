  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user has expressed high satisfaction with several products, particularly appreciating lightweight and non-greasy items. They highlighted effective moisturizing properties in grooming and skincare, finding certain beauty products to be impressive in performance. The scent of products has also been positively noted without being overpowering. The user values products that deliver good results, as shown with the successful performance of the lotion and travel bottles, which they found practical for their purposes.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nConversely, the user encountered multiple disappointments, primarily with products that underperformed or caused discomfort. They specifically mentioned dissatisfaction with the nail buffer, feeling it was damaging rather than helpful. Additionally, certain skincare products did not meet expectations, with issues involving dryness or inefficacy in their claimed benefits. Some items were described as too mild or ineffective for their intended purpose, leading to frustration.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user's shopping behavior reveals a blend of positive and negative experiences. On the positive side, they found several effective and pleasant products, noting great moisturizing qualities and practical designs. However, they also faced challenges with items that did not perform as expected, leading to frustrations about their usability and results. This mix highlights the importance of seeking quality and performance in products while emphasizing the need for clear communication of effectiveness.",
