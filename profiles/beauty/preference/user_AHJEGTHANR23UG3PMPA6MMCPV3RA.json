  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user expressed satisfaction with the quality of the hair purchased, highlighting its softness and appearance compared to alternatives. They appreciated having obtained a greater quantity for a lower price, reinforcing a sense of value. The hair remained in good condition even after beach exposure, which indicates resilience and durability. The convenience of purchasing online rather than dealing with local stores was also recognized, resulting in a favorable experience that encouraged repeat purchases.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nThe review indicates a frustration with the inability to find the desired hair product at local retail stores, particularly noting a lack of availability at specific locations. This inconvenience may have led to delays or additional efforts in sourcing the product. However, no specific negative experiences with the purchased product itself were mentioned, which suggests that the overall purchasing process was more positive despite the initial challenges.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user's experience was predominantly positive, characterized by high-quality product satisfaction, effective online purchasing, and good value for money. Despite some challenges related to product availability in local stores, their decision to buy online paid off as highlighted by the product's performance and appearance. This suggests a shift toward online shopping for convenience, reinforcing the likelihood of future purchases. Overall, while there were minor frustrations, they did not overshadow the overall positive experience with the product.",
