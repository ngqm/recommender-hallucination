  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user has expressed high satisfaction with several products enhancing personal care experiences. They particularly enjoyed a nail curing lamp, appreciating its efficiency and salon-like results. The rose quartz face massager was praised for its refreshing effect, making skincare routines enjoyable and seemingly effective. The body oil was also highlighted for its effectiveness on dry skin when applied post-shower, with a pleasant light scent. Additionally, a lip scrub received top marks for its excellent exfoliating properties, leaving lips soft and hydrated, especially in winter.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nSome products received mixed reviews based on dissatisfaction. A hair accessory set was criticized for the repetitive design of the clips, which were perceived as unsuitable for use on children yet potentially usable with dolls. There was a concern about the lash and eyebrow serum not achieving its intended results due to the user\u2019s heavy mascara application, along with a sense of confusion about proper product use. The lip scrub also experienced a lower rating, suggesting it may not meet all expectations for effectiveness.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user's shopping experiences indicate a blend of both positive and negative interactions. While several products significantly enhanced their beauty routines, yielding positive outcomes and satisfaction, others fell short of expectations. The standout items provided effective solutions for skin care and beauty, fostering loyalty to those brands. However, concerns regarding product functionality and design highlight room for improvement in specific categories. Overall, the user shows a willingness to explore new products, reflecting a trend of seeking effective solutions amidst occasional disappointments.",

It looks great and the hair is really excellent quality.<br /><br />If you are using them as glue in extensions you will definitely need at LEAST 4 sets of these to get a decent amount of hair throughout your head.
