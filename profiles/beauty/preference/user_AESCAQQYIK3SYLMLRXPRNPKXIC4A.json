According to the product descriptions, this special blend of eye cream is formulated with minerals from the Dead Sea, Olive Oil, and plant extracts. This new improved eye cream not only smooths the delicate tissue around the eyes and protects the skin from dryness, it also helps maintain the skin's elasticity and youthful appearance. I was intrigued but skeptical of the claims. Regardless, I have decided to give it a try and I am glad that I did. The first thing that caught my eyes was this beautiful and elegant glass container carefully and securely packaged inside of a professionally designed box with a thoughtful scooper. From the way it presents itself, it tells me that this company is dedicated to their products and I feel assured I am making the right decision. Nevertheless, one dab is enough for both eyes, so I am very happy with the size of this 1.7 ounces jar because it will last for quite a while and it also makes this product valuable and affordable. It also has a light scent which goes away immediately after it dries. The smells is pleasant in my opinion.<br /><br />This eye cream is deliciously creamy and luxurious, but it absorbs completely and leaves no trace of oily or sticky residue. The skin under my eyes feels silky soft and my makeup goes on perfectly. It spreads on smoothly and immediately softens my skin. The effect is very different from my other regular eye creams. It has actually left me impressed after only one week. I have noticed my dark circles have gotten lighter, they have not disappeared entirely, yet they are much lighter and the skin around my eyes does not seem as tired as it was a few weeks ago. My skin under the eyes appears smoother and hydrated. I also feel like my whole eye area has tightened up a bit and I look much more awake now. The difference is subtle, but I am hoping it will improve the results with longer term of usage. My eyes are not as puffy and that is a much more noticeable difference. This cream comes in a gorgeous jar making it look much more expensive than what it actually is, yet it works much better than many other expensive brands I have purchased in the past. I am very pleased with the results and will highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good eye cream to help with puffiness and dark circles.<br /><br />Disclosure: I purchased this eye cream at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.\nReview Title: My under eye skin appears smoother and hydrated than ever\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Hair Straightener Brush - Professional Electric Iron Comb - Simply Straight Hairstyling - Best Ceramic Straightening brush, Detangling Curls, Instant Magic Results, Free Bonus - Carenoble (Pink)\nReview Date: 2016/04/11\nStore: Carenoble\nProduct Description: ['An Innovative Brush that Upgrades Your Life!', 'WOMEN, we are BUSY, always in HURRY, its all up to us, around us, about us.

I straighten my hair just about every day and I have long, thick and naturally wavy hair. I am always on the hunt for easier and quicker way to do my hair. Ultimately, I am hoping to save some time off my busy morning routine because every minute counts. This brush heats up quickly and it is safer than flat irons simply because there is a lower chance of burning myself. However, I find this tool a little too heavy for me to handle and it is quite impossible for me not to touch those three buttons on the side of the device switching the temperature up and down while working on my hair. It leaves my hair fluffy and does not do a great job straightening the roots because there is only so close I can get to my head. I have to section my hair piece by piece just like I do with a flat iron and it does not get all the frizz out as well as a flat iron. It turns out that I spend more time than my regular straightener trying to get the job done. Sadly, this brush works fine but not as well as my flat iron and not like I have imagined.<br /><br />I admit that this device is not only well made and very sturdy, it is also of high quality and attention to details. I really want to love this product, but I don't think it lives up to the claim that it straightens my hair fully. I will say that it does straighten to certain degree and does a decent job of taming some frizz, but nowhere near in comparison to what I would get from a straightening iron. On top of that, it does not do a good job at straightening my bangs. In fact, it is too large to reach the roots. Every time I stroke my hair to straighten I hit the button and it turns it off. It will take some serious practices to get used to. Regardless, this is a good product for second day straight hair where I just need a touch up or if my hair is already partially straight. I think this straightener would be great for someone who does not have very thick hair like I do. My hair certainly looks less wavy and perhaps slightly less frizzy, but this tool does not straighten hair for the silky effect that I hope it will achieve. Since everyone has different texture of hair, I strongly believe this will work great for those who have thinner, tamer hair or simply using this brush as a touch-up tool.<br /><br />Please see the attached before (left) and after (right) photos<br /><br />Disclosure: I purchased this hair straightener brush at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.\nReview Title: Not suitable for thick and wavy hair\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Skederm Vitamin C X30 Power Serum. Hyaluronic Acid with Aquaxyl. 1 fl. oz.\nReview Date: 2016/04/12\nAverage Rating: 3.2\nProduct Details: {'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Unit Count': '1.0 Fl Oz', 'Package Dimensions': '4 x 2 x 2 inches; 0.8 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I am not a stranger to Vitamin C skincare products, but this power serum by Skederm is very different from all the Vitamin C serums that I have tried before. I always have ongoing problems of uneven skin tone and under eye dark circles. This special blend of serum is formulated to target signs of aging including dark spots, skin dehydration and dull skin tones. Unfortunately, it is exactly what I need at this point of my life. It may not be fast and effective against deep wrinkles though, but nothing really is other than cosmetic surgeries. The serum is quickly absorbed into the skin and does not feel greasy or gel-like silicone texture that a lot of serums have. It does have a pleasant light scent which quickly dissipates after applied and the consistency of the serum is somewhat creamy. It spreads very easily and one pump is enough to cover my face so the bottle should last quite awhile. When I apply this serum after cleansing and toning, I immediately feel as if my skin has been infused with moisture. It soaks right in and makes my skin feel more hydrated. It feels smooth and luxurious when I spread it over my face and neck. I have not experienced any irritation or negative reaction to this serum. Nevertheless, it is gentle enough to apply even under my eyes without any burning or itching sensation which has happened with a lot of beauty products I tried over the years.<br /><br />I really adore the elegant packaging, it comes in a beautiful airtight pump style bottle which protects the ingredients and keeps them fresh. It's sanitary and dispenses just the right amount for each application. I instantly love the way it makes my face feel soft and supple on first use and the results over the past week alone have continued to smooth my skin significantly. My face looks and feels more smooth, firm, and has this radiant glow that makes me look so much energetic. It has also helped balance my overall complexion. Even though I have exclusively been using this serum for about a week. I do not expect it to work miracles, but if it can hold moisture to the surface of my skin to give it the appearance of being smoother, then it is doing exactly what I need it to do. I do notice after using it that my skin feels tighter. I have not noticed any change in my fine lines yet, but the texture of my skin is starting to look better already. I am pleased with what I have seen so far and I am fully aware that I should give it at least a month to see results just like with any skincare product on the market. I will continue using this serum to document what my results are over time.<br /><br />Disclosure: I purchased this serum at a discount for my honest opinion.\nReview Title: Smoother and firmer appearance\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: IRIS Nature+Science 20% Vitamin C Anti Aging Serum for Skin\nReview Date: 2016/04/13\nStore: IRIS\nAverage Rating: 3.5\nProduct Details: {'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'IRIS: Nature+Science', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Provides Vitamins', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Fl Oz', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.8 x 1.8 x 1.7 inches; 5.6 Ounces', 'UPC': '758576257044'}\nReview Text: I have recently recognized the importance of taking care of my skin, especially my face since I am not getting any younger. I have heard about the benefits of Vitamin C skincare products and decided to jump onboard giving it a try. Vitamin C can stimulate and boost collagen which improves skin tone and texture. In fact, Vitamin C is a well known powerful anti-aging formulation which is proven to reduce appearance of wrinkles and fine lines while helping boost collagen, fade sun or age spots and improve skin firming, brightening, and tone for a smoother and more revitalized youthful complexion. Because of the sensitivity of my skin, I sought out a natural product without the added chemicals which could trigger a skin reaction. Based on the product description, this serum seemed perfect. I respect at all the ingredients easily accessible on the side of the bottle. I also like the professional design of bottle which I can control the perfect amount of serum with the dropper and the amber glass container also preserves the product from oxidation. The serum does feel a little sticky at first, but it quickly absorbs and sits well under my sunscreen and foundation. There is a fresh light scent to it and it disappears fairly quickly once applied.<br /><br />I have been using it every morning and I have already seen a difference in my skin. I really like the serum soaks right into the skin and it does not feel heavy when I put a moisturizer over the top. This serum has been great at keeping my face hydrated and making my moisturizer work better. I am surprised that I have not experienced any kind of allergic reaction while using this product for the first time due to the fact that I do have quite sensitive skin. By using this product, I have got a better skin texture, radiant and softer skin with improved elasticity. Several fine lines and sun spots on my face have even seemed a little less noticeable. This facial serum helps plump up the fine lines on my face and gives it a nice glow as well. It feels light on my skin and is non-irritating which leaves my skin soft and supple. I do not have perfect skin or even great skin for that matter, but I could tell my skin was feeling softer and looking more dewy. My skin does plump up and my makeup looks flawless which I love and it does not peel on me when applying moisturizer. I honestly feel this is a top quality serum and I am glad I have added this to my daily skin care routine.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a complimentary bottle for my honest and unbiased review.\nReview Title: Silky and smooth skin with a healthy glow\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Sheer Cover Advanced Nourishing Moisturizer\nReview Date: 2016/05/25\nAverage Rating: 5.0\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '5.5 x 1.5 x 1.4 inches; 3.2 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I was excited to try this moisturizer since I was looking for the perfect makeup primer equipped with some level of UV protection for my busy morning routine. Although this is my first encounter with this brand, I must say this is a great face cream under makeup and I am glad that I found exactly what I have been looking for. The first thing I like about this product is that it is fast absorbing without any annoying residues. My makeup goes on smoothly and evenly. I also like and respect at all ingredients and directions easily accessible on the side of the container. I really enjoy the tube design container which I can easily squeeze the exact amount of the cream I want and I find it extremely convenient and portable which can be slipped into my purse wherever I go.<br /><br />It feels smooth and luxurious when I spread it over my face and neck. I have not experienced any irritation or negative reaction to this cream. Nevertheless, it is gentle enough to apply even under my eyes without any burning or itching sensation which has happened with a lot of beauty products I tried over the years. It also has no scent that I can detect which makes this moisturizer perfect for my skin type and my skin soaks right into this product rather quickly. I instantly love the way it makes my face feel soft and supple on first use and the results over the past week alone have continued to smooth my skin significantly. It sits well under my sunscreen or foundation. My makeup does not shift or move after I put it on.<br /><br />This moisturizer is pretty amazing that it provides moisture without causing any breakouts. This is by far the best daytime moisturizer that I have ever used not only it provides the basic UV protection and a nice matte finish under my foundation, and it also enhances my makeup giving me a flawless and radiant appearance. This product is such a great find that I will always keep one in my purse or carry-on bag. Highly recommend!<br /><br />Disclosure: I purchased this moisturizer at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.\nReview Title: Perfect makeup primer with basic UV protection\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Professional Anti-Wrinkle Vitamin C Hyaluronic Acid Serum For Facial And Decollete Smooth Out Wrinkles With Vitamin C + E Tighten Plump Rejuvenate Brighten Skin 1.7 Fl Oz\nReview Date: 2016/07/04\nAverage Rating: 4.0\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '6.34 x 1.5 x 1.46 inches; 4.09 Ounces'}\nReview Text: This is such a great anti-aging serum that provides moisturizing and tightening effect to my face in the short time since I have followed the instructions and included the serum in my twice a day skincare routine. Hyaluronic Acid helps the skin hold in more moisture; Vitamin C helps brighten and even skin tone. Together, they work magic and indeed are the best ingredients to fight signs of aging. This product leaves the skin feeling silky soft and really helps with diminishing the appearance of fine lines. The serum has worked well with my other facial products and  there is no conflicts in over application of ingredients or mixture of fragrances. My skin does not look quite as tired as before and it has continued to look better.<br /><br />I love the pump dispenser because it is more sterile than taking it out of a jar or regular container. Aside from the convenience of its portability, after reading all of the benefits, I have been adding it to my daily routine and using it prior to my regular moisturizer. The great thing is that because it is so hydrating that I seem to use less of my regular moisturizer. The texture of this product is a clean feeling and lightweight gel. It goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly, and does not leave a greasy feel. The serum has no scent or artificial chemical fragrance which I prefer and a little of the product goes a long way. It takes two small squirts onto my finger to get a thin layer covering my face. Once it dries, it leaves my skin feeling absolutely refreshing. It is quite moisturizing as well, so it locks in all the water in my skin and gives it a supple feel all night long.<br /><br />The serum takes a minute to dry and then I apply my makeup. My foundation goes on very smoothly over it and it seems like I have been applying much less makeup lately. It helps keep my makeup looking smooth and moist longer. I find it work better as a makeup prime than many premium brand makeup primers I have tried. My facial lines around my nose has even seemed less pronounced under my makeup. In just two weeks I have been using the serum, I have noticed that my skin tone has become more luminous and healthier looking. I have not seen any fading of sun spots that I have, but I am hopeful with long term use that they will eventually lighten up. Based on what my experience has been so far, I am confident that with consistency and patience, I will see more progress down the road. This is a wonderful wrinkle smoothing serum and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Disclosure: I purchased the serum at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.\nReview Title: Tightening and moisturizing serum\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Dark Spot Corrector - Sun Spot Remover, 1 fl oz\nReview Date: 2016/07/12\nAverage Rating: 3.5\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '4.5 x 4.1 x 1.2 inches; 3.2 Ounces'}\nReview Text: Searching for a safe and effective skin brightener is always my top priority because I have a never ending battle with skin discoloration and dark sunspots. I love the fact that this serum is gentle and does not contain the harsh chemicals that most skin lighteners do because I prefer using products that have natural and botanical ingredients as much as possible. This product comes in a dark amber dropper bottle which protects the product from sunlight exposure. It also contains Glycolic and Kojic Acids as the key ingredients which I believe will lead to clear and brighter looking skin. This serum keeps my skin smooth, shining and flake-free. It is not greasy and does not form a film. I have somewhat sensitive skin which is pone to irritation and redness, but this serum is very gentle without causing any breakouts or negative side effects. I believe it has been gradually improving my dull looking appearance by making the spots a bit lighter.<br /><br />I use the product as directed after cleansing, toning my face and allowing some time to dry before topping with my regular moisturizer. This light weight clear serum not only applies smoothly and evenly, but it also has a fresh light scent that will dissipate after it dries. It has a liquid gel like texture which leaves my skin soft and smooth, not to mention it is also fast absorbing without any uncomfortable feeling and leaves my face quite moisturized. I have even started using it to lighten the sun spots on my hands and the results are impressive. Although I have not been using it for long, my skin tone has started to look more even and I have also noticed that some of my blemishes have cleared up along the way. My darker spots still exist, but they look much better and I can see some significant improvements of my lighter ones.<br /><br />I am sure everyone's skin is different, but I have experienced zero sensitivity or dryness. I love how much clearer my skin looks throughout the day and my skin feels more balanced. My overall appearance is much brighter and smoother. The brown spots on my hands are slowly fading in under two weeks and I can say that I am really happy about it. In fact, everybody's skin type is different and the effects may not be the same or visible for everyone. I have used it twice a day for quite some time now and the brightening effect seems to be progressing. There is no miraculous or overnight whitening as such, but with gradual fading of sun spots, my face does appear clearer and even toned. This product does what it promises and lightens my dark spots. This is a great and reasonably priced dark spot corrector serum that I will definitely buy again and I feel quite confident to explore other products from the same line to further improve my skin conditions.<br /><br />Disclosure: I purchased this dark spot corrector at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.\nReview Title: Great product and great results\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------",

In fact, Vitamin C is a well known powerful anti-aging formulation which is proven to reduce appearance of wrinkles and fine lines while helping boost collagen, fade sun or age spots and improve skin firming, brightening, and tone for a smoother and more revitalized youthful complexion. Because of the sensitivity of my skin, I sought out a natural product without the added chemicals which could trigger a skin reaction. Based on the product description, this serum seemed perfect. I respect at all the ingredients easily accessible on the side of the bottle. I also like the professional design of bottle which I can control the perfect amount of serum with the dropper and the amber glass container also preserves the product from oxidation. The serum does feel a little sticky at first, but it quickly absorbs and sits well under my sunscreen and foundation. There is a fresh light scent to it and it disappears fairly quickly once applied.<br /><br />I have been using it every morning and I have already seen a difference in my skin. I really like the serum soaks right into the skin and it does not feel heavy when I put a moisturizer over the top. This serum has been great at keeping my face hydrated and making my moisturizer work better. I am surprised that I have not experienced any kind of allergic reaction while using this product for the first time due to the fact that I do have quite sensitive skin. By using this product, I have got a better skin texture, radiant and softer skin with improved elasticity. Several fine lines and sun spots on my face have even seemed a little less noticeable. This facial serum helps plump up the fine lines on my face and gives it a nice glow as well. It feels light on my skin and is non-irritating which leaves my skin soft and supple. I do not have perfect skin or even great skin for that matter, but I could tell my skin was feeling softer and looking more dewy. My skin does plump up and my makeup looks flawless which I love and it does not peel on me when applying moisturizer. I honestly feel this is a top quality serum and I am glad I have added this to my daily skin care routine.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a complimentary bottle for my honest and unbiased review.\nSilky and smooth skin with a healthy glow\nSheer Cover Advanced Nourishing Moisturizer\n{'Package Dimensions': '5.5 x 1.5 x 1.4 inches; 3.2 Ounces'}\nI was excited to try this moisturizer since I was looking for the perfect makeup primer equipped with some level of UV protection for my busy morning routine. Although this is my first encounter with this brand, I must say this is a great face cream under makeup and I am glad that I found exactly what I have been looking for. The first thing I like about this product is that it is fast absorbing without any annoying residues. My makeup goes on smoothly and evenly. I also like and respect at all ingredients and directions easily accessible on the side of the container. I really enjoy the tube design container which I can easily squeeze the exact amount of the cream I want and I find it extremely convenient and portable which can be slipped into my purse wherever I go.<br /><br />It feels smooth and luxurious when I spread it over my face and neck. I have not experienced any irritation or negative reaction to this cream. Nevertheless, it is gentle enough to apply even under my eyes without any burning or itching sensation which has happened with a lot of beauty products I tried over the years. It also has no scent that I can detect which makes this moisturizer perfect for my skin type and my skin soaks right into this product rather quickly. I instantly love the way it makes my face feel soft and supple on first use and the results over the past week alone have continued to smooth my skin significantly. It sits well under my sunscreen or foundation. My makeup does not shift or move after I put it on.<br /><br />This moisturizer is pretty amazing that it provides moisture without causing any breakouts. This is by far the best daytime moisturizer that I have ever used not only it provides the basic UV protection and a nice matte finish under my foundation, and it also enhances my makeup giving me a flawless and radiant appearance. This product is such a great find that I will always keep one in my purse or carry-on bag. Highly recommend!<br /><br />Disclosure: I purchased this moisturizer at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.\nPerfect makeup primer with basic UV protection\nProfessional Anti-Wrinkle Vitamin C Hyaluronic Acid Serum For Facial And Decollete Smooth Out Wrinkles With Vitamin C + E Tighten Plump Rejuvenate Brighten Skin 1.7 Fl Oz\n{'Package Dimensions': '6.34 x 1.5 x 1.46 inches; 4.09 Ounces'}\nThis is such a great anti-aging serum that provides moisturizing and tightening effect to my face in the short time since I have followed the instructions and included the serum in my twice a day skincare routine. Hyaluronic Acid helps the skin hold in more moisture; Vitamin C helps brighten and even skin tone. Together, they work magic and indeed are the best ingredients to fight signs of aging. This product leaves the skin feeling silky soft and really helps with diminishing the appearance of fine lines. The serum has worked well with my other facial products and  there is no conflicts in over application of ingredients or mixture of fragrances. My skin does not look quite as tired as before and it has continued to look better.<br /><br />I love the pump dispenser because it is more sterile than taking it out of a jar or regular container. Aside from the convenience of its portability, after reading all of the benefits, I have been adding it to my daily routine and using it prior to my regular moisturizer. The great thing is that because it is so hydrating that I seem to use less of my regular moisturizer. The texture of this product is a clean feeling and lightweight gel. It goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly, and does not leave a greasy feel. The serum has no scent or artificial chemical fragrance which I prefer and a little of the product goes a long way. It takes two small squirts onto my finger to get a thin layer covering my face. Once it dries, it leaves my skin feeling absolutely refreshing. It is quite moisturizing as well, so it locks in all the water in my skin and gives it a supple feel all night long.<br /><br />The serum takes a minute to dry and then I apply my makeup. My foundation goes on very smoothly over it and it seems like I have been applying much less makeup lately. It helps keep my makeup looking smooth and moist longer. I find it work better as a makeup prime than many premium brand makeup primers I have tried. My facial lines around my nose has even seemed less pronounced under my makeup. In just two weeks I have been using the serum, I have noticed that my skin tone has become more luminous and healthier looking. I have not seen any fading of sun spots that I have, but I am hopeful with long term use that they will eventually lighten up. Based on what my experience has been so far, I am confident that with consistency and patience, I will see more progress down the road. This is a wonderful wrinkle smoothing serum and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Disclosure: I purchased the serum at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.\nTightening and moisturizing serum\nDark Spot Corrector - Sun Spot Remover, 1 fl oz\n{'Package Dimensions': '4.5 x 4.1 x 1.2 inches; 3.2 Ounces'}\nSearching for a safe and effective skin brightener is always my top priority because I have a never ending battle with skin discoloration and dark sunspots. I love the fact that this serum is gentle and does not contain the harsh chemicals that most skin lighteners do because I prefer using products that have natural and botanical ingredients as much as possible. This product comes in a dark amber dropper bottle which protects the product from sunlight exposure. It also contains Glycolic and Kojic Acids as the key ingredients which I believe will lead to clear and brighter looking skin. This serum keeps my skin smooth, shining and flake-free. It is not greasy and does not form a film.

My darker spots still exist, but they look much better and I can see some significant improvements of my lighter ones.<br /><br />I am sure everyone's skin is different, but I have experienced zero sensitivity or dryness.

According to the product descriptions, this special blend of eye cream is formulated with minerals from the Dead Sea, Olive Oil, and plant extracts. This new improved eye cream not only smooths the delicate tissue around the eyes and protects the skin from dryness, it also helps maintain the skin's elasticity and youthful appearance. I was intrigued but skeptical of the claims. Regardless, I have decided to give it a try and I am glad that I did. The first thing that caught my eyes was this beautiful and elegant glass container carefully and securely packaged inside of a professionally designed box with a thoughtful scooper. From the way it presents itself, it tells me that this company is dedicated to their products and I feel assured I am making the right decision. Nevertheless, one dab is enough for both eyes, so I am very happy with the size of this 1.7 ounces jar because it will last for quite a while and it also makes this product valuable and affordable. It also has a light scent which goes away immediately after it dries. The smells is pleasant in my opinion.<br /><br />This eye cream is deliciously creamy and luxurious, but it absorbs completely and leaves no trace of oily or sticky residue. The skin under my eyes feels silky soft and my makeup goes on perfectly. It spreads on smoothly and immediately softens my skin. The effect is very different from my other regular eye creams. It has actually left me impressed after only one week. I have noticed my dark circles have gotten lighter, they have not disappeared entirely, yet they are much lighter and the skin around my eyes does not seem as tired as it was a few weeks ago. My skin under the eyes appears smoother and hydrated. I also feel like my whole eye area has tightened up a bit and I look much more awake now. The difference is subtle, but I am hoping it will improve the results with longer term of usage. My eyes are not as puffy and that is a much more noticeable difference. This cream comes in a gorgeous jar making it look much more expensive than what it actually is, yet it works much better than many other expensive brands I have purchased in the past. I am very pleased with the results and will highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good eye cream to help with puffiness and dark circles.<br /><br />Disclosure: I purchased this eye cream at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.\nReview Title: My under eye skin appears smoother and hydrated than ever\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Hair Straightener Brush - Professional Electric Iron Comb - Simply Straight Hairstyling - Best Ceramic Straightening brush, Detangling Curls, Instant Magic Results, Free Bonus - Carenoble (Pink)\nReview Date: 2016/04/11\nStore: Carenoble\nProduct Description: ['An Innovative Brush that Upgrades Your Life!', 'WOMEN, we are BUSY, always in HURRY, its all up to us, around us, about us.

I straighten my hair just about every day and I have long, thick and naturally wavy hair. I am always on the hunt for easier and quicker way to do my hair. Ultimately, I am hoping to save some time off my busy morning routine because every minute counts. This brush heats up quickly and it is safer than flat irons simply because there is a lower chance of burning myself. However, I find this tool a little too heavy for me to handle and it is quite impossible for me not to touch those three buttons on the side of the device switching the temperature up and down while working on my hair. It leaves my hair fluffy and does not do a great job straightening the roots because there is only so close I can get to my head. I have to section my hair piece by piece just like I do with a flat iron and it does not get all the frizz out as well as a flat iron. It turns out that I spend more time than my regular straightener trying to get the job done. Sadly, this brush works fine but not as well as my flat iron and not like I have imagined.<br /><br />I admit that this device is not only well made and very sturdy, it is also of high quality and attention to details. I really want to love this product, but I don't think it lives up to the claim that it straightens my hair fully. I will say that it does straighten to certain degree and does a decent job of taming some frizz, but nowhere near in comparison to what I would get from a straightening iron. On top of that, it does not do a good job at straightening my bangs. In fact, it is too large to reach the roots. Every time I stroke my hair to straighten I hit the button and it turns it off. It will take some serious practices to get used to. Regardless, this is a good product for second day straight hair where I just need a touch up or if my hair is already partially straight. I think this straightener would be great for someone who does not have very thick hair like I do. My hair certainly looks less wavy and perhaps slightly less frizzy, but this tool does not straighten hair for the silky effect that I hope it will achieve. Since everyone has different texture of hair, I strongly believe this will work great for those who have thinner, tamer hair or simply using this brush as a touch-up tool.<br /><br />Please see the attached before (left) and after (right) photos<br /><br />Disclosure: I purchased this hair straightener brush at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.\nReview Title: Not suitable for thick and wavy hair\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Skederm Vitamin C X30 Power Serum.

I always have ongoing problems of uneven skin tone and under eye dark circles. This special blend of serum is formulated to target signs of aging including dark spots, skin dehydration and dull skin tones. Unfortunately, it is exactly what I need at this point of my life. It may not be fast and effective against deep wrinkles though, but nothing really is other than cosmetic surgeries. The serum is quickly absorbed into the skin and does not feel greasy or gel-like silicone texture that a lot of serums have. It does have a pleasant light scent which quickly dissipates after applied and the consistency of the serum is somewhat creamy. It spreads very easily and one pump is enough to cover my face so the bottle should last quite awhile. When I apply this serum after cleansing and toning, I immediately feel as if my skin has been infused with moisture. It soaks right in and makes my skin feel more hydrated. It feels smooth and luxurious when I spread it over my face and neck. I have not experienced any irritation or negative reaction to this serum. Nevertheless, it is gentle enough to apply even under my eyes without any burning or itching sensation which has happened with a lot of beauty products I tried over the years.<br /><br />I really adore the elegant packaging, it comes in a beautiful airtight pump style bottle which protects the ingredients and keeps them fresh. It's sanitary and dispenses just the right amount for each application. I instantly love the way it makes my face feel soft and supple on first use and the results over the past week alone have continued to smooth my skin significantly. My face looks and feels more smooth, firm, and has this radiant glow that makes me look so much energetic. It has also helped balance my overall complexion. Even though I have exclusively been using this serum for about a week. I do not expect it to work miracles, but if it can hold moisture to the surface of my skin to give it the appearance of being smoother, then it is doing exactly what I need it to do. I do notice after using it that my skin feels tighter. I have not noticed any change in my fine lines yet, but the texture of my skin is starting to look better already. I am pleased with what I have seen so far and I am fully aware that I should give it at least a month to see results just like with any skincare product on the market. I will continue using this serum to document what my results are over time.<br /><br />Disclosure: I purchased this serum at a discount for my honest opinion.\nReview Title: Smoother and firmer appearance\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: IRIS Nature+Science 20% Vitamin C Anti Aging Serum for Skin\nReview Date: 2016/04/13\nStore: IRIS\nAverage Rating: 3.5\nProduct Details: {'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'IRIS: Nature+Science', 'Recommended Uses For Product': 'Provides Vitamins', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Fl Oz', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Package Dimensions': '4.8 x 1.8 x 1.7 inches; 5.6 Ounces', 'UPC': '758576257044'}\nReview Text: I have recently recognized the importance of taking care of my skin, especially my face since I am not getting any younger.

  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user has had several positive experiences with skincare products that offer effective results. They appreciate luxurious textures that absorb well without leaving a greasy residue, and have noted improvements in skin hydration, appearance, and texture. The elegant packaging and thoughtful design of products enhance the overall experience. Specifically, the eye cream delivered visible benefits for dark circles and puffiness, while serums provided hydration and a smoother complexion. The quick-absorbing moisturizer doubled as an excellent makeup primer, consistently delivering a flawless finish. Overall, the user feels confident in their skincare choices, often praising the effectiveness of the products and expressing satisfaction in finding valuable solutions to their skincare needs.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nOn the flip side, the user has encountered challenges with certain products. The hair straightener brush, although innovative, proved cumbersome and ineffective for their thick and wavy hair, leading to disappointment as it did not meet expectations for performance. Similarly, while some serums provided hydration, the user expressed frustration with perceived lack of significant results in reducing dark spots or improving aging signs, indicating the need for more time to see results. Additionally, the user raised concerns about usability features on some devices, such as buttons unintentionally being pressed during operation, leading to a less than satisfactory experience.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nIn conclusion, the user\u2019s shopping behavior reflects a strong inclination towards skincare efficacy, innovative designs, and luxurious experiences. While they overwhelmingly enjoyed finding products that meet their skincare goals, particularly for hydration and smoothing effects, they faced setbacks with tools that did not perform as well, specifically with thicker hair types. This blend of satisfaction in skincare efficacy accompanied by mixed results in hair tools shapes their overall purchasing narrative, indicating a balance of hope and realism in product expectations.",

    "text": "It is hard to find a moisturizer with skin healthy ingredients and suitable for my skin type. I enjoy this product immensely because it leaves me skin moisturized without the heavy residue most intense moisturizers do. After two straight weeks of using this moisturizer, I have concluded that it works every bit as well, or better than the name brands I have been paying more money for at the department store. This moisturizer leaves my skin comfortable, soft, and matte all day long. The scent is delightful in my opinion and I find myself terribly addicted to the wonderful aroma. Even though it feels light on the skin, it helps my makeup glide on smoothly with absolute moisture. It feels like it disappears as soon as it is rubbed in, and yet it keeps my skin perfectly balanced and moisturized all day without the shiny greasy looking. I especially need something to help my sensitive skin stay hydrated and soft. This moisturizer seems to have just the right formula for that purpose without causing any breakouts.<br /><br />This facial moisturizer is rich and creamy. I really appreciate that this product is not greasy or sticky. When using this moisturizer, I can actually feel it sink into my skin pretty fast. It instantly makes my face feel very smooth and it soaks in rather quickly without leaving any uncomfortable residues. I have been using this cream twice a day and always making sure to cover my eyelids as well. It is so gentle for my sensitive skin that my skin does not itch or turn red. It is not greasy, but the coverage is thick enough to sufficiently provide moisture for night time. I do not like oily or sticky moisturizers, but I do prefer certain degree of a good moisturizing coverage. This is a very good face cream compared to many other brands of moisturizers that I have used not to mention the fact that it is made by skin healthy ingredients and botanical extracts.<br /><br />I have only been using it for two weeks and I have noticed that my skin is starting to feel smoother and firmer. However, there has not been much difference in my fine lines yet, but I strongly believe it will further benefit my skin with consistent use. The tone of my skin also seems to be improving and I could not be more happier. This is a good facial moisturizer that I find perfect for my skin type during the day since it has helped my makeup look natural and smoother. I will definitely recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin looking for a good face cream to provide adequate moisture and combat signs of aging.<br /><br />Disclosure: I purchased this facial moisturizer at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.",
