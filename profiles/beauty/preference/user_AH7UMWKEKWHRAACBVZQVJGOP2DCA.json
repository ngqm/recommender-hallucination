After you shampoo your beard you basically strip it of oils and dirt. That is good but you have to replace the oils if you don't want the dreaded beard itch and dandruff. This stuff does a great job at replacing the striped oils. It keeps my beard happy and that helps keep me happy. I also enjoy the sent of this balm. It is a mild sent of citrus orange in my opinion. I have used others with less sent and some that are much stronger. This sent seems to leave about an hour after applying.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Natural ingredients<br />Good conditioning<br />Easy to use tin.<br />Easy to apply consistency<br /><br />Cons:<br />If I use it multiple times in day I started to get zits in certain areas.<br /><br />All in all.

I have long hair and because of the consistency it takes a lot more conditioner than I was hoping. It did not fade my color which is a plus!! And I have to brag about how much I love the heat spray. It doesn't leave my hair looking greasy or a weird sticky texture after straightening my hair. I will be buying the heat spray again!! Overall great product just be aware of the scent.

  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:  \nThe user's purchase history reflects a strong appreciation for products that enhance grooming and personal care routines. Notable experiences include satisfaction with conditioning properties of beard products, particularly their ability to maintain beard health and minimize irritation. Users enjoyed pleasant scents that were not overpowering, highlighting a preference for balanced aromas. The heat protectant spray received commendation for effective styling without greasiness, and the spiral hair ties were praised for their usability and comfort. The easy-to-use nature of various products, including waxing kits and facial masks, indicates a positive trend towards convenience in self-care routines.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:  \nWhile the user enjoyed many aspects of their purchases, there were some notable frustrations. Concerns included strong scents that became overwhelming, particularly with hair care products. The thin consistency of conditioners required more product than anticipated, representing inefficiency. Some products, despite their initial effectiveness, led to adverse skin reactions, such as breakouts. Additionally, the user noted variable quality in scrunchies, with some showing signs of wear before use. These negative experiences point to a need for better formulation and quality control in certain items.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:  \nThe user's shopping behavior demonstrates a commendable focus on grooming and personal care, with several products delivering positive results in conditioning and usability. Scent preferences were generally well met, although some items had overpowering fragrances that detracted from the experience. While the overall satisfaction was high, issues like product consistency and quality control were apparent in certain purchases. The blend of effective products alongside a few disappointments reflects a mixed but predominantly positive experience in their self-care journey.",
