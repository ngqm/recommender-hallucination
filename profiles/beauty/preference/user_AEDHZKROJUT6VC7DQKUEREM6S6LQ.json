  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user's positive experiences highlight satisfaction with several beauty products. They appreciated the natural color and lack of glitter in a cheek product, deeming it exactly what they wanted. The foundation received praise for its effective coverage, buildable nature, and all-day wear without causing dryness. Moreover, the silicone chest pads exceeded initial skepticism, providing a comfortable fit and successfully preventing chest wrinkles overnight. Excellent customer service associated with one of the products further enhanced the user's experience.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user encountered negative experiences primarily due to adverse reactions and product effectiveness. A facial moisturizer unfortunately caused a reaction on sensitive skin, leading to a return. Additionally, an eyeliner product did not meet expectations, requiring touch-ups throughout the day to maintain its appearance. Another foundation offered limited color options and an unsatisfactory texture, leading to disappointment and a lower rating. \n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nOverall, the user's shopping experiences reflect a mixed bag of positive and negative outcomes. They found high satisfaction in a cheek product, foundations, and innovative wrinkle prevention pads, suggesting effective results and enjoyment. However, frustrations arose from reactions to certain skincare products and performance issues with makeup items, resulting in less favorable evaluations. The user remains inclined to rely on proven brands for sensitive skin, highlighting a cautionary approach in future purchases.",

At first, upon receipt, I thought they'd be too small and I started to return. Then, I thought I'd try one out to see if it fits.  The fit was right so I took them home.  When I got home, I got out the glue and tried one out.  Right away I noticed the paint job on the lightest color (nude) is horrible!  There are streaks in the nail that look unnatural.  I tried one on anyway and it would not stay on.  It stuck for a moment and then with the slightest nudge, it came off.  AND it left a shiny opalescent plastic patina on the glue that was stuck to my nail!  The back of the fake nail literally came off onto my own nail!  Junk.  I threw them all in the trash.  Don't waste your time - buy Kiss nails - they are the best quality I've found for the price.  They stay on for up to 2 weeks for me.",
