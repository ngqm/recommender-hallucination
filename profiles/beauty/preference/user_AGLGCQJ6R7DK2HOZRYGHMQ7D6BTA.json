While I find it takes a little for the oils to fully settle onto the skin once they do, I don't find it to be greasy or heavy.<br />I put this under my SPF in the morning like a serum, and it doesn't pill or bunch up or affect my sunscreen or makeup application after.<br />At night it's just the right amount of moisture to keep my skin happy and balanced. I have not had any break outs. There is no noticeable scent, neither on opening, applying or after wearing.<br />If you are new to solid face creams, serums, etc. give this a little time to find the right balance of how much, how long.<br />The price for the amount is a great value, and I really like the brands ecologically sound stance.

They last an okay amount of time, but will fade quickly if you don\u2019t use a primer.<br />Simple cardboard container, very similar to colourpop and bh, but doesn\u2019t have a mirror. Still it\u2019s sturdy and all the pans arrived unbroken!<br />The shades are arranged nicely, it really has a visual appeal, and makes choosing an eye look easier.<br />It\u2019s realky not bad, and while my tastes typically run towards the more luxury and pigmented, this is a good entry for a beginner or lighter makeup user.<br />I will be looking into other palettes by this brand.\nReview Title: High 3 stars\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: TOUCH IN SOL Flawless Skin Top Coat 1.18 fl.oz.

But, they far exceeded my needs and expectations!<br />They are about the size of three dimes stacked, and are embossed with little flowers on top, which is really just a pretty presentation.<br />They expand easily with moisture, I mixed up my own serum solution with essential oil, and it was easy to soak and unfold. I worried I would have to be super delicate so as not to tear the paper, but these are more of a fabric than tissue.<br />In fact, I opened one up to test it's durability. I used some warm water, added some dish soap and went to town scrubbing my basin. No tears, no ripping, no holes. (In fact it cleaned up really well). I used some extra pulling pressure on the cut parts, mouth, eyes chin, and as expected had tears and stretching happen, but that was with abnormal applied pressure.<br />They didn't smell, they didn't feel weird, and they fit great. For the relaxing usage of a home facial these little compact masks are perfect.

The hair clips had mixed reviews, with concerns about comfort due to slipping. The user also pointed out a few quality issues, like a damaged roller among the hair curlers.
