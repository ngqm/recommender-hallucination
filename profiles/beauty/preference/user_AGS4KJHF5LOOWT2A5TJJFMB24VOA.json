The masks are folded in such a way that they're compressed to the size of 2 nickels stacked on top of each other. To use you simply pour lotion or facial cream onto it and then slowly and carefully unfurl it on your face. The first time around you'll likely waste a few masks as the paper is very thin and if you're not careful they tear quite easily.

Mind you 'firm' is not a 'strong' hold but it does manage to lock in short'ish hair properly in place with all the benefits of a wax styled product (ie - does not stiffen the strands).

  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:  \nThe user has experienced significant satisfaction with a variety of beauty and grooming products. High ratings were noted for items like facial masks, toners, and grooming sets, with users appreciating factors such as affordability, effectiveness, and pleasant scents. The cleansing products provided refreshing results, with descriptions highlighting enjoyable sensory experiences and effective cleaning. Additionally, tools like the manicure set were praised for their comprehensive nature, including a variety of implements. The nursing headband offered a thoughtful design that enhances comfort, particularly during extended use of face masks.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:  \nSome negative experiences were emphasized, particularly around product inconsistencies and undesirable textures. A cleansing oil was reported to have an unexpectedly pleasant washing experience, yet one face cream left the user questioning product quality due to its runny consistency and unpleasant scent. Similarly, a toner received a lower rating, suggesting it might not meet the expectations regarding its effectiveness or user experience. The runny texture and questionable fragrance of one moisturizer highlighted a disconnect between product description and user satisfaction.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:  \nOverall, the user's shopping behavior reflects a mix of positive experiences predominantly characterized by satisfaction with effectiveness, variety, and thoughtful design of grooming and beauty products. However, there are notable concerns regarding product quality, including texture and scent, which detract from the otherwise pleasant experiences. This balance of positive feedback combined with specific criticisms illustrates a nuanced purchasing journey, indicating the user's discerning taste and high expectations for quality.",
