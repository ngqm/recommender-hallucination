Especially for the price point!  There were very similar items for twice as much, but I'm so glad I chose to purchase this one for our bathroom.  My husband is starting to get more gray in his beard than not, and has been having trouble seeing it all while shaving.  I got this for him (and for myself, but don't tell him) and he has been thrilled with it.  The three lighting choices are gorgeous and very useful, as is the 10x magnification side of the swivel mirror head.  I'm thinking of getting one for my mom and sister, as well.

I've been a devoted user of Korean skin care products.  For a while, I have preferred, out of several brands and types of sheet mask, the Benton Bee and Snail sheet mask.  Fantastic product!!!!  Firms, smooths, soothes.  It's great.  However, that's not why I purchased this set.  I have combo skin that leans towards oily in the heat.  Super oily T-zone.  After doing a ton of research, I decided to give the Benton Aloe Gel moisturizer a try.  I'd also heard great things about this foam cleanser.  I'm really enjoying the cleanser so far.  I wet my hands and face, use only a pea sized amount, rub my hands together to create the foam (not a soapy lather, but a thick and creamy foam), and work over my face.  I do this after oil cleansing.  This does a great job of picking up any oil residue and dirt, while leaving my face soft and refreshed.  Never tight and dry, which is the sign of an awful cleanser.  The gel moisturizer is okay.  Just okay.  I don't get as oily as I did with lotion moisturizers, which is great.  However, I don't have that supple, smooth feel that I'm used to and prefer.  I've actually noticed flaking around my nose, which is something I never dealt with after moisturizing.  A pea sized amount covers my entire face, it leaves a slightly tacky finish until absorbed ( I always let each of my products absorb for around 90 seconds before applying the next step), and is completely colorless.  Will I repurchase?  No, but I do suggest that you give this a try if your research and needs point you this direction.  Everyone's skin care needs can vary on several levels.  There are universal musts for good skin health, like cleansing daily, moisturizing, and using a good sunscreen.  There a a ton a variations of those products, though.

Firstly, it comes with numerous accessories- a fluffy brush for removing dust from the nail and work area, a set of to separaters for painting, a nail board, and the drill bits themselves.  The entire set is nicely packaged and comes nestled in a velvety foam materials.  The bits are held in their own clear container within the box.  The set comes with a detachable adapter that plugs into the end of the drill and then into the wall outlet.  The drill itself is small enough to handle pretty easily, although I can see where it would be difficult for someone with smaller hands than myself (I have large hands.)  Inserting and removing the bits can be a challenge.  The mechanism isn't well made so I have to fight with it.  The power cord is much too short and I had to use an extension cord to give myself some wiggle room away from the wall outlet.  Some of the bits' textures do a better job than the others, while some don't do anything at all.  The over all look and feel of the set isn't worth the price, in my opinion.  It works a bit too awkwardly to be something I'd use that often.\nReview Title: I'm not sure this is worth the price asked...\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: The Beachwaver Co. Dual Voltage, S1, White\nReview Date: 2019/08/14\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Product Benefits': 'This ceramic, rotating curling iron provides easy, quality waves in minutes!', 'Shape': 'Barrel', 'Brand': 'The Beachwaver Co.', 'Hair Type': 'All', 'Material': 'Ceramic', 'Product Dimensions': '15.75 x 1.75 x 2 inches; 14.4 Ounces', 'Item model number': '1', 'UPC': '817741020613', 'Manufacturer': 'AmazonUs/SB10T', 'Country of Origin': 'China'}\nReview Text: I'm someone with extremely thick and stick straight hair.  My hair loses curl within an hour of me fixing it.  I've tried other rotating curling irons and haven't had much success with them, so I didn't have very high expectations for this beach waver.  I have been pleasantly surprised.  Once I got the hang of it, I found it to be pretty easy to use.  It features buttons that allow you to chooses which direction you would like to curl each section of hair, and a Home button that after each use, and after the previous section of hair is no longer attached, allows the barrel to return to a neutral starting point.  I ran into an issue the first few times I used it, which was accidentally hitting the home button while my hair was still around the barrel.  This caused the hair to get very tight and the barrel to press up against the scalp.  This is very easy to do and I definitely think a design change should take place to correct this issue.  The barrel is long enough for my medium-long hair and I can see it needing to be used more than once up and down the length of long hair.  The curling iron gets up to 410 degrees max, which works pretty well on my thick hair.  I've tried fixing my hair in different ways after using it, to see which method holds the curls longer.  I still have an issue with my hair losing the curls a bit to quickly but it's remedied by using styling products before and after curling it.  To be honest, I think this beach waver is very overpriced.  Maybe the results would be better for someone with thinner hair but I don't think I'd pay more than $50 for this curling iron.  Nice results, but the design flaws make this a product I won't reach for that often.\nReview Title: Cool once you get the hang of it....but the price...\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Ultrasonic Skin Scrubber aka Facial Spatula by YOOVE | Face & Body Exfoliator Scrub, Comedone Extractor & Blackhead Remover | 2019 Premium Beauty Tool\nReview Date: 2019/09/08\nStore: Yoove\nAverage Rating: 3.9\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '8.2 x 3.8 x 1.9 inches; 8.78 Ounces', 'Batteries': '1 Lithium Ion batteries required.

It looks sleek and pretty but does it actually work?  My answer to that question is a resounding YES.  You wouldn't think a little buzzing device could make your skincare products do their best job but boy, oh, boy does it ever.  The three settings are for Cleansing (also used for extractions), Moisturizing, and Lifting.  Each setting causes the device to vibrate at different speeds and achieve different goals.  Using it is fairly easy.  Hold the button until you hear it turn on and then give the button a quick press to choose between functions.  There are lights above each mode and they will light up when you are on said mode.  The included instructions are very easy to follow and explain how to use it in a simple way.  It's all about keeping very light pressure, while holding the side bars, which add the effective charge to the device, allowing the ionization process to take place.  I have seen a difference in my skin already and I have only used it in each mode 3-4 times.  It could be easy to overdo it after seeing the results you do, but the instructions specifically advice you on how often each function should be used so the skin isn't having reverse effects from what you want it to.  I think the price for this item is fantastic!  I have a reduction in blackheads, my skin seems to glow after use, and my products are sinking into my skin better and faster.

It's cute and the colors are blended together nicely, with small streak of lavender mixed into the blue.  The \"scalp\" looks great and is a nice nude color.  It mimics a Caucasian scalp really well, which is great for a pale gal like me.  The cut is sweet and it's styled well.  The bangs need trimming up but that shouldn't be a problem.  The tresses feel like all synthetic wigs do.  They are wavy but still have that plastic feel to them.  The big issue for me is the size of the wig cap itself.  I have black hair and the wig \"scalp\" is so short that several inches of the top of my natural hair shows through it.  It does come with a hair cap but oddly, it's black and not nude, which would be the smarter choice.  I have a nude hair cap that I'll be trying with it, but I'm not expecting much difference.  The wig is just too small in general.\nReview Title: Cute but the cap is too small...\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: C.O.

So many times, the lights aren't bright enough to do you much good, there's only a single regular mirror, and/or the size is just too small to give you a proper look.  Not so with this compact.  You get two mirrors for the price of one, a regular mirror and one with a higher magnification for those times when you need a closer inspection.  The light has a lovely, and very helpful, color temperature that's pretty close to daylight, just a bit warmer, and is featured around both mirrors.  It's operated by a switch on the bottom, so you aren't wasting your batteries.  It runs off of two coin batteries.  The mirror is larger than most.  I have larger than average hands for a woman, and this compact is bigger than my palm.  It's a great size for quick once overs and more detailed makeup application.  I even prefer using it over my bathroom mirror for doing my eyebrows.\nReview Title: Great size, nice and bright!\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: SAMYANG ABOUTME Red Recipe Super Cleansing Balm 3.04 oz.

Some of the bits' textures do a better job than the others, while some don't do anything at all.  The over all look and feel of the set isn't worth the price, in my opinion.

My hair loses curl within an hour of me fixing it.  I've tried other rotating curling irons and haven't had much success with them, so I didn't have very high expectations for this beach waver.  I have been pleasantly surprised.  Once I got the hang of it, I found it to be pretty easy to use.  It features buttons that allow you to chooses which direction you would like to curl each section of hair, and a Home button that after each use, and after the previous section of hair is no longer attached, allows the barrel to return to a neutral starting point.  I ran into an issue the first few times I used it, which was accidentally hitting the home button while my hair was still around the barrel.  This caused the hair to get very tight and the barrel to press up against the scalp.  This is very easy to do and I definitely think a design change should take place to correct this issue.  The barrel is long enough for my medium-long hair and I can see it needing to be used more than once up and down the length of long hair.  The curling iron gets up to 410 degrees max, which works pretty well on my thick hair.  I've tried fixing my hair in different ways after using it, to see which method holds the curls longer.  I still have an issue with my hair losing the curls a bit to quickly but it's remedied by using styling products before and after curling it.  To be honest, I think this beach waver is very overpriced.  Maybe the results would be better for someone with thinner hair but I don't think I'd pay more than $50 for this curling iron.  Nice results, but the design flaws make this a product I won't reach for that often.\nCool once you get the hang of it....but the price...\nUltrasonic Skin Scrubber aka Facial Spatula by YOOVE | Face & Body Exfoliator Scrub, Comedone Extractor & Blackhead Remover | 2019 Premium Beauty Tool\nYoove\n{'Package Dimensions': '8.2 x 3.8 x 1.9 inches; 8.78 Ounces', 'Batteries': '1 Lithium Ion batteries required.

My answer to that question is a resounding YES.  You wouldn't think a little buzzing device could make your skincare products do their best job but boy, oh, boy does it ever.  The three settings are for Cleansing (also used for extractions), Moisturizing, and Lifting.  Each setting causes the device to vibrate at different speeds and achieve different goals.  Using it is fairly easy.  Hold the button until you hear it turn on and then give the button a quick press to choose between functions.  There are lights above each mode and they will light up when you are on said mode.  The included instructions are very easy to follow and explain how to use it in a simple way.  It's all about keeping very light pressure, while holding the side bars, which add the effective charge to the device, allowing the ionization process to take place.  I have seen a difference in my skin already and I have only used it in each mode 3-4 times.  It could be easy to overdo it after seeing the results you do, but the instructions specifically advice you on how often each function should be used so the skin isn't having reverse effects from what you want it to.

It's cute and the colors are blended together nicely, with small streak of lavender mixed into the blue.  The \"scalp\" looks great and is a nice nude color.  It mimics a Caucasian scalp really well, which is great for a pale gal like me.  The cut is sweet and it's styled well.  The bangs need trimming up but that shouldn't be a problem.  The tresses feel like all synthetic wigs do.  They are wavy but still have that plastic feel to them.  The big issue for me is the size of the wig cap itself.  I have black hair and the wig \"scalp\" is so short that several inches of the top of my natural hair shows through it.  It does come with a hair cap but oddly, it's black and not nude, which would be the smarter choice.  I have a nude hair cap that I'll be trying with it, but I'm not expecting much difference.

It's operated by a switch on the bottom, so you aren't wasting your batteries.  It runs off of two coin batteries.  The mirror is larger than most.

Especially for the price point!  There were very similar items for twice as much, but I'm so glad I chose to purchase this one for our bathroom.  My husband is starting to get more gray in his beard than not, and has been having trouble seeing it all while shaving.  I got this for him (and for myself, but don't tell him) and he has been thrilled with it.  The three lighting choices are gorgeous and very useful, as is the 10x magnification side of the swivel mirror head.  I'm thinking of getting one for my mom and sister, as well.

I've been a devoted user of Korean skin care products.  For a while, I have preferred, out of several brands and types of sheet mask, the Benton Bee and Snail sheet mask.  Fantastic product!!!!  Firms, smooths, soothes.  It's great.  However, that's not why I purchased this set.  I have combo skin that leans towards oily in the heat.  Super oily T-zone.  After doing a ton of research, I decided to give the Benton Aloe Gel moisturizer a try.  I'd also heard great things about this foam cleanser.  I'm really enjoying the cleanser so far.  I wet my hands and face, use only a pea sized amount, rub my hands together to create the foam (not a soapy lather, but a thick and creamy foam), and work over my face.  I do this after oil cleansing.  This does a great job of picking up any oil residue and dirt, while leaving my face soft and refreshed.  Never tight and dry, which is the sign of an awful cleanser.  The gel moisturizer is okay.  Just okay.  I don't get as oily as I did with lotion moisturizers, which is great.  However, I don't have that supple, smooth feel that I'm used to and prefer.  I've actually noticed flaking around my nose, which is something I never dealt with after moisturizing.  A pea sized amount covers my entire face, it leaves a slightly tacky finish until absorbed ( I always let each of my products absorb for around 90 seconds before applying the next step), and is completely colorless.  Will I repurchase?  No, but I do suggest that you give this a try if your research and needs point you this direction.  Everyone's skin care needs can vary on several levels.  There are universal musts for good skin health, like cleansing daily, moisturizing, and using a good sunscreen.  There a a ton a variations of those products, though.  Finding the right routine and products can be a trial and error process.  The main thing is to stick to it.  The results are worth it!\nReview Title: Worth a try!\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: [Leaders Labotica] Argan Oil Deep Cleansing Tissue 50Ct 1 Pk (Makeup Remover Cleansing Towelettes & Wipes)\nReview Date: 2018/12/05\nStore: Leaders Insolution\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Leaders Insolution', 'Unit Count': '50.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Item Form': 'Wipes', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '4.25 x 8.5 x 1.5 inches; 13.44 Ounces'}\nReview Text: These are good for those late nights when you\u2019re too exhausted to do your whole routine, although I HIGHLY recommend doing a quick double cleansing regardless.

The entire set is nicely packaged and comes nestled in a velvety foam materials.  The bits are held in their own clear container within the box.  The set comes with a detachable adapter that plugs into the end of the drill and then into the wall outlet.  The drill itself is small enough to handle pretty easily, although I can see where it would be difficult for someone with smaller hands than myself (I have large hands.)

The user also expressed positive sentiments towards cotton rounds for their softness and ability to preserve product, alongside glowing feedback for a skin scrubber that delivered effective results, enhancing their skincare routine. \n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nConversely, the user's experience was marred by several disappointing products. A cleansing balm was notably criticized for irritating the skin and causing breakouts, with an overwhelming scent that detracted from its usability.

Overall, there were clear frustrations regarding product effectiveness and comfort.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user's purchasing journey reflects a blend of positive and negative experiences. They enjoyed the quality and practicality of several beauty tools, particularly makeup mirrors and skincare devices, indicating a strong preference for functionality. However, negative encounters with irritating cleansers, ineffective makeup removers, and poorly designed accessories reveal challenges with certain products. This suggests the user is discerning in their choices, seeking effective solutions while remaining wary of products that fail to meet standards.",

    "text": "The concept behind this set of masks is pretty cool, and the names are cute.  The masks themselves, however, aren't anything to write home about.  They smell fresh in a more herbal kind of way, and the textures are a mix between creamy and gel-like.  The big issue I have is the container design.  The bowls come with a good sized amount because a little goes a long way, but there's no way to seal them back up for later use.  I had to put them in ziplock bags.",
