Or whatever.  So the point is that I was writing this review and I had used the words \"sun-kissed\" twice (I took one out).  Then I looked at the product description and I was like....well, crap.  That's what they literally said it would look like.  So here's the details:<br /><br />It is a highly pigmented powder that blends out beautifully and is easily buildable.  Not an in-your-face blinding shimmer, more of a sun-kissed shimmer that looks natural on the skin.  The color 02 bronzed euphoria looks like you\u2019ve gotten a light tan with a little bit of pink undertone.  (I\u2019m fair skin, strawberry blonde, blue eyes for reference.)  Kind of like what would happen if you actually WENT into the sun.  Without SPF.  Which, of course, you shouldn\u2019t do.  Like, ever.  I also handed it off to my 18 year old daughter and her opinion was the same as mine.....right down to the slightly pinkish undertone.

One side is rounded dimples, the other side is raised brush-type projections.  Bought it for my husband\u2019s shower because it looked fairly indestructible and he seems to be able to destroy pretty much any type of back scrubber.  This thing is thick, has some heft to it, and has sturdy grips at either end.  My husband was definitely more impressed with this one than some of the others I\u2019ve handed to him for use in the shower.<br /><br />So, after his first shower with it I asked him how it went.  He looks at me and says \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m using it the right way, but it works pretty good.\u201d  And that was his idea of providing feedback on how it worked.  Of course, that\u2019s not enough\u2026.especially when it starts with I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m using it right.  Turns out (after tons of questioning, Good Lord it\u2019s like bath scrubbers had suddenly become highly confidential state secrets) that it didn\u2019t work all that well as a back scrubber for him.  He didn\u2019t like that you have to lather up your back with a loofah or washcloth first and then use the back scrubber.  He tried to put soap on the scrubber and use it to wash his back but the soap just ran down between the scrubbers and he couldn\u2019t build a lather up.  So he tossed it on the shower floor and was going to tell me that it didn\u2019t work.  But then he decided to see if it would work to remove the callused skin on his feet.  Apparently it did.  He started by just leaving it on the floor of the shower and rubbing his feet back and forth on it, and that worked well.  But then he grabbed the handles and put some tension on it with his foot and moved it by using the handles.  Apparently this worked VERY well.  So well that he had brought up the brush he usually uses in the shower for his feet and threw it in the garbage.  (He said it needed replacing anyway.)  He wants to keep this one in the shower to keep using it on his feet & is completely excited that he doesn\u2019t have to bend over and contort himself while scrubbing his feet anymore.  He still needs me to find a back scrubber though\u2026\u2026.\nReview Title: It works really well, just not for what I had bought it for\u2026.\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: 2oz / 60ml Glass Spray Bottles for DIY Refill, Essential Oils, Pillow Mists,Fine Mist Spray -3Packs Amber Color\nReview Date: 2020/10/22\nStore: EagleKing\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'EagleKing', 'Material': 'Glass', 'Capacity': '2 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '3', 'Special Feature': 'Mist Spray', 'Package Dimensions': '6.3 x 6.1 x 1.7 inches; 8.78 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I ordered these to hold the essential oils mix I use for sachets.

To start, it has a creamy texture and a light, fresh scent.  It\u2019s super hydrating and has a great slip to it so it just glides over the skin.  It sinks into the skin beautifully, and fairly quickly, and leaves a dewy finish to your skin.  No weird residue or film left on the skin, and it works well with all of my sunscreens and foundations.  It provides you a nice, plump hydrated base to work with and that dewy finish holds up really well.  It works really well as a daily moisturizer for me during the colder/dryer months of fall and winter.  It will probably be a little too heavy to work during the day in the warmer months, but I can see myself using it as a nighttime moisturizer then with no problem.  Super versatile and definitely one I would recommend for daily use.\nReview Title: Excellent daily moisturizer, plays well with ALL my other products!!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Magnetic Eyeliner and Eyelashes Kit Self Adhesive Eyeliner Pen - 3D Natural Look Eyelash Without Magnet - Reusable Eye Lash with Waterproof Liner, Black, Applicator(5 Sets Lashes + 1 Pen Liners)\nReview Date: 2020/12/09\nStore: Lampelc\nAverage Rating: 4.0\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Lampelc', 'Material': 'Mink Fur', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Item Form': 'Individual', 'Mounting Type': 'Eyelash Glue', 'Package Dimensions': '6.14 x 5.59 x 0.59 inches; 11.29 Ounces'}\nReview Text: We've got a bit of experience in this house with magnetic eyeliner and lashes.  We've tried super expensive ($75/pair), super cheap (Wish is NOT the place to go for lashes) and everything in between.  My daughter has TTM and has no natural eyelashes, so magnetics are the ONLY type of lashes that work for here.<br /><br />She liked the look of the lashes in this set.  They weren't all over-the-top, super glam.  There were quite a few pairs that she thought she could use for daily wear and even liked the look of \"glam\" pairs that were included for when she really wants to go all out.  So it was HUGELY disappointing that there were NO MAGNETS on ANY of the pairs of lashes.  She did try the eyeliner with lashes she already had, but wasn't very impressed with it either.  It didn't seem to completely dry down and had a slightly tacky feel even after waiting about 10 minutes.  I thought maybe they had mixed up the order and sent her regular lashes & lash glue, but it wasn't tacky ENOUGH to hold a lash in place.  Overall, it was a fail for her.  Which is disappointing because she quite liked the style of the lashes offered in this set.\nReview Title: There were no magnets on the lashes!!\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Aledy Hair Scalp Massager, Shampoo Brush with Soft Silicone Head Massager (Blue)\nReview Date: 2020/12/12\nStore: Aledy\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '4.8 x 3.6 x 2.4 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Aledy'}\nReview Text: I'm 49 (at least for a few more weeks), and along with the many joys of aging comes thinning hair.  So you buy products to help with that, serums and shampoos, but they need to be penetrate at the scalp level to really be effective.  I also have gel nails and there's a problem with hair getting caught on them, especially when they're getting close to needing a fill.  So I was looking for something that would help with both of those things, but could do it gently so I wouldn't end up causing more problems than I was solving.  It works great with the shampoo and the serum to really work those products into the scalp and to hopefully stimulate blood flow at the same time.  After using it for that and seeing how well it worked, I started using it for pretty much everything hair related in the shower because it completely solved the problem with the snagging and pulling due to my nails.  Anyone who has any type of fake nails understands the issue.  This just WORKS.

I have some areas in my face that have some sun damage, some broken capillaries, and some enlarged pores.  The only thing that I've found that covers these completely is concealer for the first two, only two primers do the job on the pores that I've found.  I figured this might give me some additional coverage due to the nude tint so maybe I could skip the concealer and just go with foundation for coverage.  I was also hoping it would be another primer that would blur/fill the pores and not just \"disappear\" after foundation gets applied.<br /><br />I was actually impressed by the tone correction I got from this.  It's not a concealer (obviously), so I wasn't expecting full coverage.  I was just looking for a muting of the redness & the sun spots so I could maybe skip the concealer.  It did exactly that.  It provided a veil of nude tint that made my areas of sun damage and sun spots (yeah, they're freckles) almost disappear.  The redness was muted somewhat.  Enough that I when I skipped the concealer I was pretty happy with the result I got from just this product under my foundation.  That being said, it doesn't play well with every foundation.  I noticed that it doesn't seem to work as well with my dewy/hydrating foundations.  That may just be a \"me thing\", but I thought I'd throw it out there for consideration.<br /><br />So, this leads to the pore filling/smoothing.  It does smooth out some areas with pores and it does continue to do that after the foundations is applied.....in some areas.  Which seem to be in the areas that don't move a lot.  So on my face, I have enlarged pores on the side of my nose in the nostril area and down toward my mouth, on my chin, and on my forehead in the center.  Now, everyone's face moves but we don't all emote with our faces in the same areas.  I tend to have a very expressive mouth and I arch one eyebrow a lot.  I don't furrow or wrinkle my forehead much.  The primer didn't hold up on my chin or around the nostrils and down toward my mouth.  The center of the forehead held up perfectly.<br />So, while I like this primer for the tone correction, I need something that smooths my pores in all areas of my face.  If you're just looking for a good primer to even out your skin tone or provide some base color correction I would absolutely recommend this one.  The pore thing....I think that's going to be something that depends on the person.  This definitely has a place in my makeup routine.  I can use it in the areas where I need the tone correction and use something else for my problem pore areas.  It's perfect for my light makeup days and I'm going to try it with just some light powder on my next \"no makeup\" makeup day.\nReview Title: It definitely helps correct skin tone differences & does smooth pores in SOME areas.\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: COSMOCOS FromNature Perfect Cover BB Cream - Light Beighe/Natural Beige SPF 50+ / PA+++ Sun Protection, Natural Skin Tone, High Coverage Korean Cosmetic K Beauty - 50g (1.76 fl oz) (Light Beige)\nReview Date: 2021/01/09\nStore: COSMOCOS\nAverage Rating: 3.5\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'COSMOCOS', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '1.72 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Use for': 'Skin', 'Product Dimensions': '6 x 1.5 x 1 inches; 2.82 Ounces', 'UPC': '364597179540'}\nReview Text: So, I'm recently 50 (I'm wondering how long I'll keep adding recently to my age??) and during 2020 I fell in love with Korean skin care and Korean BB Creams.  This one gets high marks, and it's a bit different than the others I've tried.<br /><br />I ordered the lightest shade since I'm VERY fair and it worked perfectly.  That's one of the things I love about BB Creams in general, they provide coverage but they also seem to work with your skin tone rather than masking it.  This applied beautifully with a brush and my fingers (my preferred method).  I'm assuming it would work with a damp sponge, as well.  On me that tends to look cakey for some reason, so I don't generally go that route.  It worked well over multiple moisturizers and both of my favorite sunscreens.  I use a primer occasionally and had no problems with application when I did.  It goes on smoothly and blends out easily.  It's a very light formula and feels like I'm not even wearing makeup.  It doesn't have a high amount of coverage.  I would call it a buildable medium, as far as that goes.  Now, here's where it differs from the other Korean BB Creams I've tried.....it dries down to a very satin, skin like finish.  Most others end up with either a dewy or slightly luminous finish, which is fine.  This is the first one I've found that doesn't.  It's definitely not a matte finish, though.<br /><br />It wears really well.  I can get a full 10 hours of wear out of it, whether I set it or not.  That's another thing about the way this drys down, if you tend toward dry skin (I do) then you can get away with not powdering this one if that's your preference.  When I do use powder I go in pretty lightly, and usually just in the areas where my pores might be having a particularly \"showy\" day with a blurring powder.  The bonus that seems to come with most Korean beauty facial products is the SPF.  This is a PA+++/SPF 50+.  Now that doesn't mean I skip my normal sunscreen, cause you're never gonna convince me that what you get in foundation or BB Cream is adequate protection.....but I will never say no to MORE protection.  EVER.<br /><br />This is a beautiful BB Cream that works really well on aging skin, so I imagine it would be a dream on younger skin,  perfect or textured alike.  One other thing I noticed is that at the end of the day I still hardly noticed I was wearing makeup.  And when I washed it off my skin felt and looked pretty good.  It wasn't dried out and didn't have that worn out look that I've gotten used to seeing after a full day in makeup.  Definitely a keeper!!\nReview Title: I've found the BEST BB CREAMS from Korean beauty brands & this is no exception!!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: MOSTORY Glitter Crystal Liquid Eyeshadow Set - 4 Pack Pigmented Liquid Eye shadows Matte Shimmer Metallic Quick Dry Crease Resistant Long Lasting Flake-Proof Blendable Non-Greasy Eye Makeup (4 Pack)\nReview Date: 2021/01/24\nStore: MOSTORY\nAverage Rating: 4.3\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'MOSTORY', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Finish Type': 'Matte', 'Special Feature': 'Long last, Crease proof, Blendable', 'Product Benefits': 'Long Lasting', 'Package Dimensions': '4.84 x 4.49 x 0.87 inches; 5.11 Ounces'}\nReview Text: This is a 4 pack liquid metallic eyeshadow.  Icy silver, gold, a plummy/mauve, and a very deep midnight blue.  This shine factor on these packs quite a punch.....I don't think it comes across in the pictures very well, but they definitely are a metallic shadow.  They all are very opaque, but they can be sheered down a bit if you work with them right after you put them on the eye.  They do dry down fairly quickly so it's not something you can take your time to blend out.  I had the best luck applying them with my finger and blending them that way.  I didn't experience any creasing when I wore them and they don't transfer to other areas once they're dried down.  I've worn them for up to 8 hours and they didn't fade or start to slough off the eye.  They're pretty impressive for a liquid shadow.....for a liquid metallic shadow they're DAMNED IMPRESSIVE.\nReview Title: Gorgeous metallic shimmer that wears really WELL!!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Premium black caviar facial mask sheet for anti-aging and anti-wrinkle, AG Mask, 6 Sheets, Hydrating and Brightening, Made in Korea.\nReview Date: 2021/01/25\nStore: OxygenCeuticals\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'OxygenCeuticals', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Moisturizing Skin,Anti-aging', 'Scent': 'Black', 'Material Type Free': 'Alcohol Free', 'Package Dimensions': '9.09 x 6.85 x 1.77 inches; 8.15 Ounces'}\nReview Text: These masks have become a favorite this fall and winter when my skin needs an extra dose of hydration.  I've just turned 50 and it's a constant battle to keep my skin hydrated just due to the aging process.  When you add in cold, dry air outside and hot, dry air inside it just makes it so much more difficult.  I've been adding masks to my skincare routine this winter and they've made a huge difference.  I try to do at LEAST one a week, but as it gets colder I've been using them every few days.  I'll use them at night after I've cleansed and used my prescription skincare and then I'll follow up with my nightly routine.  I love all of the plant extracts loaded into this one along with the niacinamide and hyaluronic acid.  One thing to keep in mind though is that if you're using this (or anything with hyaluronic acid, really) and you're in a dry climate you need to make sure you provide additional moisture for the HA to bind to.  It's why I use this one at night since I keep a humidifier running on my bedside table that pumps that moisture into the air.  In addition to the hydration it also does a great job of noticeably minimizing the appearance of some of larger pores on my face which of course makes my skin look firmer and smoother.\nReview Title: Loaded with hydration & plant extracts that my skin NEEDS during the winter months!!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: EASYDEW Fill Up Volume Spot 0.67 fl oz -Anti-Aging Filler Spot Good for Topical Wrinkle Care with Hyaluronic Acid I Moisturizer with Instant Filling Effect and Skin Renewal | For Topical Area\nReview Date: 2021/01/28\nStore: EASYDEW\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'EASYDEW', 'Scent': 'Aloe Vera', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Active Ingredients': 'Hyaluronic acid', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Product Dimensions': '1.46 x 0.91 x 5.71 inches; 1.41 Ounces'}\nReview Text: Generally, I love EasyDew products and they always seem to deliver what they promise.  That said, this product was a serious letdown and a bit gimmicky, in my opinion.  The delivery system of the product was completely unnecessary and did absolutely nothing to help with product placement.  The use of growth factor along with the claims to provide filling of lines and wrinkles instantly was where my disappointment came in.  Mostly because it did NOT do what it claimed.  The product is a clear gel that absorbs into the skin and does provide some hydration.  However, I think that's mostly down to the use of the hyaluronic acid it contains, which becomes a problem for me to use in my daytime skincare because I live in an absurdly DRY climate in the winter months and hyaluronic acid without access to moisture in the air or in the form of other products means it's going to suck the moisture from the surrounding tissues.....which means you end up with a VERY dry, wrinkly looking area anywhere you put this.  As for the EGF it contains, there are some studies that show it does help with repeated use OVER TIME, but it does not magically erase lines and wrinkles, and certainly not in the formulation offered here.  I feel like it's a case of a very good company, with very good skincare products that sadly made a mistake in caving into the \"quick fix\" trend so many other companies have.  This was a definite miss for me.\nReview Title: This was kind of a \"gimmicky\" fail for me.\nRating: 2.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: LUXAZA 6 PCS Purple Eyeshadow Stick,Light Shimmer Cream Eyeshadow Crayon,Pro Smoky Waterproof & Long Lasting Eyeshadow Stick Set\nReview Date: 2021/04/11\nStore: LUXAZA\nAverage Rating: 3.5\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'LUXAZA', 'Item Form': 'Crayon,Cream Eyeshadow', 'Finish Type': 'Metallic', 'Special Feature': 'Waterproof, Long lasting', 'Product Benefits': 'Long Lasting', 'Package Dimensions': '5.83 x 5 x 0.87 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I think we all have days where we're looking for something quick and easy when it comes to makeup.  Anything to get us out the door looking somewhat put together with the least amount of time involved is the goal.  If you're looking for a quick eyeshadow look that takes next to no time these are one answer.  Cream eyeshadow on one end and a brush on the other.  The brush is surprisingly usable, but since I've got older eyes (which means older skin that needs to be babied) I just use one of mine.  They go on pretty smooth and creamy.  Not a ton of pigment on the first pass, but it's very buildable.  The swatches on my arm are 2 passes of each color.  They also blend out really well.  I put a couple passes on my lower lid and blend it up into my crease and I'm good to go.  There is a bit of shimmer in this one, but it's not overwhelming.  Just a bit of sparkle that looks good even on aging eyes.  They make it through the whole day, but I did notice some creasing and breakdown after about 6-8 hours.  Not a lot, just enough to be noticeable.

So much so that I started using it with my other serums in my nightly skincare routine.  I've noticed increased hydration (or more accurately an increase in the retention of hydration) in my skin.  There's also been an increase in the firmness of the skin, which I can't say is down to this product alone.  I'm sure it's because I'm using it in conjunction with the microneedling and plasma treatments, but it's definitely adding to the overall outcome that I'm loving.  The research available on EGF is plentiful and something that makes sense to me as far as an anti-aging ingredient.

Bought it for my husband\u2019s shower because it looked fairly indestructible and he seems to be able to destroy pretty much any type of back scrubber.  This thing is thick, has some heft to it, and has sturdy grips at either end.  My husband was definitely more impressed with this one than some of the others I\u2019ve handed to him for use in the shower.<br /><br />So, after his first shower with it I asked him how it went.  He looks at me and says \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m using it the right way, but it works pretty good.\u201d  And that was his idea of providing feedback on how it worked.  Of course, that\u2019s not enough\u2026.especially when it starts with I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m using it right.  Turns out (after tons of questioning, Good Lord it\u2019s like bath scrubbers had suddenly become highly confidential state secrets) that it didn\u2019t work all that well as a back scrubber for him.  He didn\u2019t like that you have to lather up your back with a loofah or washcloth first and then use the back scrubber.  He tried to put soap on the scrubber and use it to wash his back but the soap just ran down between the scrubbers and he couldn\u2019t build a lather up.  So he tossed it on the shower floor and was going to tell me that it didn\u2019t work.  But then he decided to see if it would work to remove the callused skin on his feet.  Apparently it did.  He started by just leaving it on the floor of the shower and rubbing his feet back and forth on it, and that worked well.  But then he grabbed the handles and put some tension on it with his foot and moved it by using the handles.  Apparently this worked VERY well.  So well that he had brought up the brush he usually uses in the shower for his feet and threw it in the garbage.  (He said it needed replacing anyway.)  He wants to keep this one in the shower to keep using it on his feet & is completely excited that he doesn\u2019t have to bend over and contort himself while scrubbing his feet anymore.  He still needs me to find a back scrubber though\u2026\u2026.\nIt works really well, just not for what I had bought it for\u2026.\n2oz / 60ml Glass Spray Bottles for DIY Refill, Essential Oils, Pillow Mists,Fine Mist Spray -3Packs Amber Color\nEagleKing\n{'Brand': 'EagleKing', 'Material': 'Glass', 'Capacity': '2 Ounces', 'Number of Items': '3', 'Special Feature': 'Mist Spray', 'Package Dimensions': '6.3 x 6.1 x 1.7 inches; 8.78 Ounces'}\nI ordered these to hold the essential oils mix I use for sachets.  The mist from the sprayer is perfect to refresh the bags and to evenly distribute the scented oils over materials used in the mix.<br /><br />Since the COVID thing hit, and everyone in our house is dealing with prolonged mask use irritation and \u201cmaskne\u201d, I\u2019ve filled up a few more with a 100% green tea toner that can be sprayed on the face during the day.  It helps cut down on the inflammation from irritation and since it\u2019s also an anti-bacterial it has helped control the acne, as well.  These are great to throw in your purse or keep in the car.  The glass is heavy & durable and the spray attachment screws down tight so they DON\u2019T LEAK and the mist created is a nice, fine mist with zero \u201cspitting\u201d or errant streams.\nSolid, heavy glass with an excellent mist & great for mask relief!!\nEasydew Daily Double Hydra Cream 2.02 fl oz - Moisturizing Cream with EGF & Serine of NMFHydrating, Soothing, Anti-Aging EGF, Serine - N.M.F(Natural Moisturizing Factors) for Oily, Sensitive, Acne-Prone, Dry Skin Types\nEASYDEW\n{'Brand': 'EASYDEW', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '5.2911 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Type': 'Acne Prone,Oily,Sensitive,All Skin Types', 'Package Dimensions': '5.98 x 1.69 x 1.46 inches; 3 Ounces'}\nEasydew has a winner in this one.  To start, it has a creamy texture and a light, fresh scent.  It\u2019s super hydrating and has a great slip to it so it just glides over the skin.  It sinks into the skin beautifully, and fairly quickly, and leaves a dewy finish to your skin.  No weird residue or film left on the skin, and it works well with all of my sunscreens and foundations.  It provides you a nice, plump hydrated base to work with and that dewy finish holds up really well.  It works really well as a daily moisturizer for me during the colder/dryer months of fall and winter.  It will probably be a little too heavy to work during the day in the warmer months, but I can see myself using it as a nighttime moisturizer then with no problem.  Super versatile and definitely one I would recommend for daily use.\nExcellent daily moisturizer, plays well with ALL my other products!!\nMagnetic Eyeliner and Eyelashes Kit Self Adhesive Eyeliner Pen - 3D Natural Look Eyelash Without Magnet - Reusable Eye Lash with Waterproof Liner, Black, Applicator(5 Sets Lashes + 1 Pen Liners)\nLampelc\n{'Brand': 'Lampelc', 'Material': 'Mink Fur', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Item Form': 'Individual', 'Mounting Type': 'Eyelash Glue', 'Package Dimensions': '6.14 x 5.59 x 0.59 inches; 11.29 Ounces'}\nWe've got a bit of experience in this house with magnetic eyeliner and lashes.  We've tried super expensive ($75/pair), super cheap (Wish is NOT the place to go for lashes) and everything in between.  My daughter has TTM and has no natural eyelashes, so magnetics are the ONLY type of lashes that work for here.<br /><br />She liked the look of the lashes in this set.  They weren't all over-the-top, super glam.  There were quite a few pairs that she thought she could use for daily wear and even liked the look of \"glam\" pairs that were included for when she really wants to go all out.  So it was HUGELY disappointing that there were NO MAGNETS on ANY of the pairs of lashes.  She did try the eyeliner with lashes she already had, but wasn't very impressed with it either.  It didn't seem to completely dry down and had a slightly tacky feel even after waiting about 10 minutes.  I thought maybe they had mixed up the order and sent her regular lashes & lash glue, but it wasn't tacky ENOUGH to hold a lash in place.  Overall, it was a fail for her.  Which is disappointing because she quite liked the style of the lashes offered in this set.\nThere were no magnets on the lashes!!\nAledy Hair Scalp Massager, Shampoo Brush with Soft Silicone Head Massager (Blue)\nAledy\n{'Package Dimensions': '4.8 x 3.6 x 2.4 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Aledy'}\nI'm 49 (at least for a few more weeks), and along with the many joys of aging comes thinning hair.  So you buy products to help with that, serums and shampoos, but they need to be penetrate at the scalp level to really be effective.  I also have gel nails and there's a problem with hair getting caught on them, especially when they're getting close to needing a fill.  So I was looking for something that would help with both of those things, but could do it gently so I wouldn't end up causing more problems than I was solving.  It works great with the shampoo and the serum to really work those products into the scalp and to hopefully stimulate blood flow at the same time.  After using it for that and seeing how well it worked, I started using it for pretty much everything hair related in the shower because it completely solved the problem with the snagging and pulling due to my nails.  Anyone who has any type of fake nails understands the issue.  This just WORKS.  Problem SOLVED.\nFixes the problem of hair snagging and catching on your nails.\nRadiant Professional Tone Corrector Primer\u2013Face Primer Color Corrector For All Skin Types - Dermatologically Tested Gluten & Fragrance Free Pore Concealer Cream Before Makeup For Women-1.01oz (NUDE)\nRADIANT PROFESSIONAL MAKE UP / HELLENICA\n{'Brand': 'RADIANT PROFESSIONAL MAKE UP / HELLENICA', 'Skin Type': 'All', 'Package Information': 'Tube', 'Finish Type': 'Matte', 'Specialty': 'Fragrance Free', 'Package Dimensions': '5 x 1.5 x 1 inches; 0.35 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'RADIANT PROFESSIONAL MAKE UP / HELLENICA'}\nI got this in Nude.  I have some areas in my face that have some sun damage, some broken capillaries, and some enlarged pores.  The only thing that I've found that covers these completely is concealer for the first two, only two primers do the job on the pores that I've found.  I figured this might give me some additional coverage due to the nude tint so maybe I could skip the concealer and just go with foundation for coverage.  I was also hoping it would be another primer that would blur/fill the pores and not just \"disappear\" after foundation gets applied.<br /><br />I was actually impressed by the tone correction I got from this.  It's not a concealer (obviously), so I wasn't expecting full coverage.  I was just looking for a muting of the redness & the sun spots so I could maybe skip the concealer.  It did exactly that.  It provided a veil of nude tint that made my areas of sun damage and sun spots (yeah, they're freckles) almost disappear.  The redness was muted somewhat.  Enough that I when I skipped the concealer I was pretty happy with the result I got from just this product under my foundation.  That being said, it doesn't play well with every foundation.  I noticed that it doesn't seem to work as well with my dewy/hydrating foundations.  That may just be a \"me thing\", but I thought I'd throw it out there for consideration.<br /><br />So, this leads to the pore filling/smoothing.  It does smooth out some areas with pores and it does continue to do that after the foundations is applied.....in some areas.  Which seem to be in the areas that don't move a lot.  So on my face, I have enlarged pores on the side of my nose in the nostril area and down toward my mouth, on my chin, and on my forehead in the center.  Now, everyone's face moves but we don't all emote with our faces in the same areas.  I tend to have a very expressive mouth and I arch one eyebrow a lot.  I don't furrow or wrinkle my forehead much.  The primer didn't hold up on my chin or around the nostrils and down toward my mouth.  The center of the forehead held up perfectly.<br />So, while I like this primer for the tone correction, I need something that smooths my pores in all areas of my face.  If you're just looking for a good primer to even out your skin tone or provide some base color correction I would absolutely recommend this one.  The pore thing....I think that's going to be something that depends on the person.  This definitely has a place in my makeup routine.  I can use it in the areas where I need the tone correction and use something else for my problem pore areas.  It's perfect for my light makeup days and I'm going to try it with just some light powder on my next \"no makeup\" makeup day.\nIt definitely helps correct skin tone differences & does smooth pores in SOME areas.\nCOSMOCOS FromNature Perfect Cover BB Cream - Light Beighe/Natural Beige SPF 50+ / PA+++ Sun Protection, Natural Skin Tone, High Coverage Korean Cosmetic K Beauty - 50g (1.76 fl oz) (Light Beige)\nCOSMOCOS\n{'Brand': 'COSMOCOS', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '1.72 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Use for': 'Skin', 'Product Dimensions': '6 x 1.5 x 1 inches; 2.82 Ounces', 'UPC': '364597179540'}\nSo, I'm recently 50 (I'm wondering how long I'll keep adding recently to my age??) and during 2020 I fell in love with Korean skin care and Korean BB Creams.  This one gets high marks, and it's a bit different than the others I've tried.<br /><br />I ordered the lightest shade since I'm VERY fair and it worked perfectly.  That's one of the things I love about BB Creams in general, they provide coverage but they also seem to work with your skin tone rather than masking it.  This applied beautifully with a brush and my fingers (my preferred method).  I'm assuming it would work with a damp sponge, as well.  On me that tends to look cakey for some reason, so I don't generally go that route.  It worked well over multiple moisturizers and both of my favorite sunscreens.  I use a primer occasionally and had no problems with application when I did.  It goes on smoothly and blends out easily.  It's a very light formula and feels like I'm not even wearing makeup.  It doesn't have a high amount of coverage.  I would call it a buildable medium, as far as that goes.  Now, here's where it differs from the other Korean BB Creams I've tried.....it dries down to a very satin, skin like finish.  Most others end up with either a dewy or slightly luminous finish, which is fine.  This is the first one I've found that doesn't.  It's definitely not a matte finish, though.<br /><br />It wears really well.  I can get a full 10 hours of wear out of it, whether I set it or not.  That's another thing about the way this drys down, if you tend toward dry skin (I do) then you can get away with not powdering this one if that's your preference.  When I do use powder I go in pretty lightly, and usually just in the areas where my pores might be having a particularly \"showy\" day with a blurring powder.  The bonus that seems to come with most Korean beauty facial products is the SPF.  This is a PA+++/SPF 50+.  Now that doesn't mean I skip my normal sunscreen, cause you're never gonna convince me that what you get in foundation or BB Cream is adequate protection.....but I will never say no to MORE protection.  EVER.<br /><br />This is a beautiful BB Cream that works really well on aging skin, so I imagine it would be a dream on younger skin,  perfect or textured alike.  One other thing I noticed is that at the end of the day I still hardly noticed I was wearing makeup.  And when I washed it off my skin felt and looked pretty good.  It wasn't dried out and didn't have that worn out look that I've gotten used to seeing after a full day in makeup.  Definitely a keeper!!\nI've found the BEST BB CREAMS from Korean beauty brands & this is no exception!!\nMOSTORY Glitter Crystal Liquid Eyeshadow Set - 4 Pack Pigmented Liquid Eye shadows Matte Shimmer Metallic Quick Dry Crease Resistant Long Lasting Flake-Proof Blendable Non-Greasy Eye Makeup (4 Pack)\nMOSTORY\n{'Brand': 'MOSTORY', 'Item Form': 'Liquid', 'Finish Type': 'Matte', 'Special Feature': 'Long last, Crease proof, Blendable', 'Product Benefits': 'Long Lasting', 'Package Dimensions': '4.84 x 4.49 x 0.87 inches; 5.11 Ounces'}\nThis is a 4 pack liquid metallic eyeshadow.  Icy silver, gold, a plummy/mauve, and a very deep midnight blue.  This shine factor on these packs quite a punch.....I don't think it comes across in the pictures very well, but they definitely are a metallic shadow.  They all are very opaque, but they can be sheered down a bit if you work with them right after you put them on the eye.  They do dry down fairly quickly so it's not something you can take your time to blend out.  I had the best luck applying them with my finger and blending them that way.  I didn't experience any creasing when I wore them and they don't transfer to other areas once they're dried down.  I've worn them for up to 8 hours and they didn't fade or start to slough off the eye.  They're pretty impressive for a liquid shadow.....for a liquid metallic shadow they're DAMNED IMPRESSIVE.\nGorgeous metallic shimmer that wears really WELL!!\nPremium black caviar facial mask sheet for anti-aging and anti-wrinkle, AG Mask, 6 Sheets, Hydrating and Brightening, Made in Korea.\nOxygenCeuticals\n{'Brand': 'OxygenCeuticals', 'Item Form': 'Sheet', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Moisturizing Skin,Anti-aging', 'Scent': 'Black', 'Material Type Free': 'Alcohol Free', 'Package Dimensions': '9.09 x 6.85 x 1.77 inches; 8.15 Ounces'}\nThese masks have become a favorite this fall and winter when my skin needs an extra dose of hydration.  I've just turned 50 and it's a constant battle to keep my skin hydrated just due to the aging process.  When you add in cold, dry air outside and hot, dry air inside it just makes it so much more difficult.  I've been adding masks to my skincare routine this winter and they've made a huge difference.  I try to do at LEAST one a week, but as it gets colder I've been using them every few days.  I'll use them at night after I've cleansed and used my prescription skincare and then I'll follow up with my nightly routine.  I love all of the plant extracts loaded into this one along with the niacinamide and hyaluronic acid.  One thing to keep in mind though is that if you're using this (or anything with hyaluronic acid, really) and you're in a dry climate you need to make sure you provide additional moisture for the HA to bind to.  It's why I use this one at night since I keep a humidifier running on my bedside table that pumps that moisture into the air.  In addition to the hydration it also does a great job of noticeably minimizing the appearance of some of larger pores on my face which of course makes my skin look firmer and smoother.\nLoaded with hydration & plant extracts that my skin NEEDS during the winter months!!\nEASYDEW Fill Up Volume Spot 0.67 fl oz -Anti-Aging Filler Spot Good for Topical Wrinkle Care with Hyaluronic Acid I Moisturizer with Instant Filling Effect and Skin Renewal | For Topical Area\nEASYDEW\n{'Brand': 'EASYDEW', 'Scent': 'Aloe Vera', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Active Ingredients': 'Hyaluronic acid', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Product Dimensions': '1.46 x 0.91 x 5.71 inches; 1.41 Ounces'}\nGenerally, I love EasyDew products and they always seem to deliver what they promise.  That said, this product was a serious letdown and a bit gimmicky, in my opinion.  The delivery system of the product was completely unnecessary and did absolutely nothing to help with product placement.  The use of growth factor along with the claims to provide filling of lines and wrinkles instantly was where my disappointment came in.  Mostly because it did NOT do what it claimed.  The product is a clear gel that absorbs into the skin and does provide some hydration.  However, I think that's mostly down to the use of the hyaluronic acid it contains, which becomes a problem for me to use in my daytime skincare because I live in an absurdly DRY climate in the winter months and hyaluronic acid without access to moisture in the air or in the form of other products means it's going to suck the moisture from the surrounding tissues.....which means you end up with a VERY dry, wrinkly looking area anywhere you put this.  As for the EGF it contains, there are some studies that show it does help with repeated use OVER TIME, but it does not magically erase lines and wrinkles, and certainly not in the formulation offered here.  I feel like it's a case of a very good company, with very good skincare products that sadly made a mistake in caving into the \"quick fix\" trend so many other companies have.  This was a definite miss for me.\nThis was kind of a \"gimmicky\" fail for me.\nLUXAZA 6 PCS Purple Eyeshadow Stick,Light Shimmer Cream Eyeshadow Crayon,Pro Smoky Waterproof & Long Lasting Eyeshadow Stick Set\nLUXAZA\n{'Brand': 'LUXAZA', 'Item Form': 'Crayon,Cream Eyeshadow', 'Finish Type': 'Metallic', 'Special Feature': 'Waterproof, Long lasting', 'Product Benefits': 'Long Lasting', 'Package Dimensions': '5.83 x 5 x 0.87 inches; 3.21 Ounces'}\nI think we all have days where we're looking for something quick and easy when it comes to makeup.  Anything to get us out the door looking somewhat put together with the least amount of time involved is the goal.  If you're looking for a quick eyeshadow look that takes next to no time these are one answer.  Cream eyeshadow on one end and a brush on the other.  The brush is surprisingly usable, but since I've got older eyes (which means older skin that needs to be babied) I just use one of mine.  They go on pretty smooth and creamy.  Not a ton of pigment on the first pass, but it's very buildable.  The swatches on my arm are 2 passes of each color.  They also blend out really well.  I put a couple passes on my lower lid and blend it up into my crease and I'm good to go.  There is a bit of shimmer in this one, but it's not overwhelming.  Just a bit of sparkle that looks good even on aging eyes.  They make it through the whole day, but I did notice some creasing and breakdown after about 6-8 hours.  Not a lot, just enough to be noticeable.  Overall these were pretty impressive and I think they'd also be great for someone who was just getting into makeup too.\nQuick, easy, blendable & at drugstore prices....gotta love it!!\nSAISZE Jaw Exerciser, Facial Fat Burner Double Chin Reducer Eliminator for Jawline Shaper, Neck Muscle Training Helps Face Slimming for Men Women (Blue)\nSAISZE\n{'Package Dimensions': '7.68 x 4.69 x 1.77 inches; 2.4 Ounces'}\nI picked up a few of these (one for everyone) as stocking stuffers because they seemed to be everywhere on social media advertising right before Christmas.....and they were something different.  I had no idea that they would be such a hit.  I also had no idea how helpful they would be for things other than getting rid of a double chin.  I had one person who decided to quit smoking and one who tried to stop biting her nails.  They both used their Jaw Exerciser to help with their oral habit.  I'm not sure how effective it is with getting rid of a double chin, but it does seem to tighten up the jawline if you're using it every day.\nThis was the stocking stuffer that EVERYONE loved!!\nEASYDEW DW-EGF Double Synergy Moist Ampoule1.01 fl oz -K Beauty Award-Winning Anti Aging Ampoule with EGF to Plump, Moisturize Skin I For Sensitive Skin, Gift for Mom, Wife, Her\nEASYDEW\n{'Skin Type': 'Sensitive', 'Product Benefits': 'Hydrating,Anti-aging', 'Scent': 'Aloe', 'Brand': 'EASYDEW', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Package Dimensions': '4.29 x 1.54 x 1.46 inches; 3.53 Ounces'}\nI've got 50 year old skin and I've treated it pretty horribly for the first 48 years, so I've got plenty of issues I'm dealing with.  Initially I wanted to use this when I microneedle (machine, not roller) and as part of my aftercare for plasma fibroblasting.  And I loved the results.  So much so that I started using it with my other serums in my nightly skincare routine.  I've noticed increased hydration (or more accurately an increase in the retention of hydration) in my skin.  There's also been an increase in the firmness of the skin, which I can't say is down to this product alone.  I'm sure it's because I'm using it in conjunction with the microneedling and plasma treatments, but it's definitely adding to the overall outcome that I'm loving.  The research available on EGF is plentiful and something that makes sense to me as far as an anti-aging ingredient.  So much of the info surrounding ingredients is mostly hype and very little science or actual research.  EGF is one that is backed by research and EasyDew provides a GREAT formulation!!\nLove it when I microneedle and plasma, and now I use it daily!!",

That's what they literally said it would look like.  So here's the details:<br /><br />It is a highly pigmented powder that blends out beautifully and is easily buildable.  Not an in-your-face blinding shimmer, more of a sun-kissed shimmer that looks natural on the skin.  The color 02 bronzed euphoria looks like you\u2019ve gotten a light tan with a little bit of pink undertone.  (I\u2019m fair skin, strawberry blonde, blue eyes for reference.)  Kind of like what would happen if you actually WENT into the sun.  Without SPF.  Which, of course, you shouldn\u2019t do.  Like, ever.  I also handed it off to my 18 year old daughter and her opinion was the same as mine.....right down to the slightly pinkish undertone.

The glass is heavy & durable and the spray attachment screws down tight so they DON\u2019T LEAK and the mist created is a nice, fine mist with zero \u201cspitting\u201d or errant streams.\nReview Title: Solid, heavy glass with an excellent mist & great for mask relief!!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Easydew Daily Double Hydra Cream 2.02 fl oz - Moisturizing Cream with EGF & Serine of NMFHydrating, Soothing, Anti-Aging EGF, Serine - N.M.F(Natural Moisturizing Factors) for Oily, Sensitive, Acne-Prone, Dry Skin Types\nReview Date: 2020/11/16\nStore: EASYDEW\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'EASYDEW', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '5.2911 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Skin Type': 'Acne Prone,Oily,Sensitive,All Skin Types', 'Package Dimensions': '5.98 x 1.69 x 1.46 inches; 3 Ounces'}\nReview Text: Easydew has a winner in this one.  To start, it has a creamy texture and a light, fresh scent.  It\u2019s super hydrating and has a great slip to it so it just glides over the skin.  It sinks into the skin beautifully, and fairly quickly, and leaves a dewy finish to your skin.  No weird residue or film left on the skin, and it works well with all of my sunscreens and foundations.  It provides you a nice, plump hydrated base to work with and that dewy finish holds up really well.  It works really well as a daily moisturizer for me during the colder/dryer months of fall and winter.  It will probably be a little too heavy to work during the day in the warmer months, but I can see myself using it as a nighttime moisturizer then with no problem.  Super versatile and definitely one I would recommend for daily use.\nReview Title: Excellent daily moisturizer, plays well with ALL my other products!!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Magnetic Eyeliner and Eyelashes Kit Self Adhesive Eyeliner Pen - 3D Natural Look Eyelash Without Magnet - Reusable Eye Lash with Waterproof Liner, Black, Applicator(5 Sets Lashes + 1 Pen Liners)\nReview Date: 2020/12/09\nStore: Lampelc\nAverage Rating: 4.0\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Lampelc', 'Material': 'Mink Fur', 'Material Feature': 'Natural', 'Item Form': 'Individual', 'Mounting Type': 'Eyelash Glue', 'Package Dimensions': '6.14 x 5.59 x 0.59 inches; 11.29 Ounces'}\nReview Text: We've got a bit of experience in this house with magnetic eyeliner and lashes.  We've tried super expensive ($75/pair), super cheap (Wish is NOT the place to go for lashes) and everything in between.  My daughter has TTM and has no natural eyelashes, so magnetics are the ONLY type of lashes that work for here.<br /><br />She liked the look of the lashes in this set.  They weren't all over-the-top, super glam.  There were quite a few pairs that she thought she could use for daily wear and even liked the look of \"glam\" pairs that were included for when she really wants to go all out.  So it was HUGELY disappointing that there were NO MAGNETS on ANY of the pairs of lashes.  She did try the eyeliner with lashes she already had, but wasn't very impressed with it either.  It didn't seem to completely dry down and had a slightly tacky feel even after waiting about 10 minutes.  I thought maybe they had mixed up the order and sent her regular lashes & lash glue, but it wasn't tacky ENOUGH to hold a lash in place.  Overall, it was a fail for her.  Which is disappointing because she quite liked the style of the lashes offered in this set.\nReview Title: There were no magnets on the lashes!!\nRating: 1.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Aledy Hair Scalp Massager, Shampoo Brush with Soft Silicone Head Massager (Blue)\nReview Date: 2020/12/12\nStore: Aledy\nAverage Rating: 4.4\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '4.8 x 3.6 x 2.4 inches; 5.61 Ounces', 'Manufacturer': 'Aledy'}\nReview Text: I'm 49 (at least for a few more weeks), and along with the many joys of aging comes thinning hair.  So you buy products to help with that, serums and shampoos, but they need to be penetrate at the scalp level to really be effective.  I also have gel nails and there's a problem with hair getting caught on them, especially when they're getting close to needing a fill.  So I was looking for something that would help with both of those things, but could do it gently so I wouldn't end up causing more problems than I was solving.  It works great with the shampoo and the serum to really work those products into the scalp and to hopefully stimulate blood flow at the same time.  After using it for that and seeing how well it worked, I started using it for pretty much everything hair related in the shower because it completely solved the problem with the snagging and pulling due to my nails.  Anyone who has any type of fake nails understands the issue.  This just WORKS.

I have some areas in my face that have some sun damage, some broken capillaries, and some enlarged pores.  The only thing that I've found that covers these completely is concealer for the first two, only two primers do the job on the pores that I've found.  I figured this might give me some additional coverage due to the nude tint so maybe I could skip the concealer and just go with foundation for coverage.  I was also hoping it would be another primer that would blur/fill the pores and not just \"disappear\" after foundation gets applied.<br /><br />I was actually impressed by the tone correction I got from this.  It's not a concealer (obviously), so I wasn't expecting full coverage.  I was just looking for a muting of the redness & the sun spots so I could maybe skip the concealer.  It did exactly that.  It provided a veil of nude tint that made my areas of sun damage and sun spots (yeah, they're freckles) almost disappear.  The redness was muted somewhat.  Enough that I when I skipped the concealer I was pretty happy with the result I got from just this product under my foundation.  That being said, it doesn't play well with every foundation.  I noticed that it doesn't seem to work as well with my dewy/hydrating foundations.  That may just be a \"me thing\", but I thought I'd throw it out there for consideration.<br /><br />So, this leads to the pore filling/smoothing.  It does smooth out some areas with pores and it does continue to do that after the foundations is applied.....in some areas.  Which seem to be in the areas that don't move a lot.  So on my face, I have enlarged pores on the side of my nose in the nostril area and down toward my mouth, on my chin, and on my forehead in the center.  Now, everyone's face moves but we don't all emote with our faces in the same areas.  I tend to have a very expressive mouth and I arch one eyebrow a lot.  I don't furrow or wrinkle my forehead much.  The primer didn't hold up on my chin or around the nostrils and down toward my mouth.  The center of the forehead held up perfectly.<br />So, while I like this primer for the tone correction, I need something that smooths my pores in all areas of my face.  If you're just looking for a good primer to even out your skin tone or provide some base color correction I would absolutely recommend this one.  The pore thing....I think that's going to be something that depends on the person.  This definitely has a place in my makeup routine.  I can use it in the areas where I need the tone correction and use something else for my problem pore areas.  It's perfect for my light makeup days and I'm going to try it with just some light powder on my next \"no makeup\" makeup day.\nReview Title: It definitely helps correct skin tone differences & does smooth pores in SOME areas.\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: COSMOCOS FromNature Perfect Cover BB Cream - Light Beighe/Natural Beige SPF 50+ / PA+++ Sun Protection, Natural Skin Tone, High Coverage Korean Cosmetic K Beauty - 50g (1.76 fl oz) (Light Beige)\nReview Date: 2021/01/09\nStore: COSMOCOS\nAverage Rating: 3.5\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'COSMOCOS', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '1.72 Fl Oz', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Use for': 'Skin', 'Product Dimensions': '6 x 1.5 x 1 inches; 2.82 Ounces', 'UPC': '364597179540'}\nReview Text: So, I'm recently 50 (I'm wondering how long I'll keep adding recently to my age??) and during 2020 I fell in love with Korean skin care and Korean BB Creams.  This one gets high marks, and it's a bit different than the others I've tried.<br /><br />I ordered the lightest shade since I'm VERY fair and it worked perfectly.  That's one of the things I love about BB Creams in general, they provide coverage but they also seem to work with your skin tone rather than masking it.  This applied beautifully with a brush and my fingers (my preferred method).  I'm assuming it would work with a damp sponge, as well.  On me that tends to look cakey for some reason, so I don't generally go that route.  It worked well over multiple moisturizers and both of my favorite sunscreens.  I use a primer occasionally and had no problems with application when I did.  It goes on smoothly and blends out easily.  It's a very light formula and feels like I'm not even wearing makeup.  It doesn't have a high amount of coverage.  I would call it a buildable medium, as far as that goes.  Now, here's where it differs from the other Korean BB Creams I've tried.....it dries down to a very satin, skin like finish.  Most others end up with either a dewy or slightly luminous finish, which is fine.  This is the first one I've found that doesn't.  It's definitely not a matte finish, though.<br /><br />It wears really well.  I can get a full 10 hours of wear out of it, whether I set it or not.  That's another thing about the way this drys down, if you tend toward dry skin (I do) then you can get away with not powdering this one if that's your preference.  When I do use powder I go in pretty lightly, and usually just in the areas where my pores might be having a particularly \"showy\" day with a blurring powder.  The bonus that seems to come with most Korean beauty facial products is the SPF.  This is a PA+++/SPF 50+.  Now that doesn't mean I skip my normal sunscreen, cause you're never gonna convince me that what you get in foundation or BB Cream is adequate protection.....but I will never say no to MORE protection.  EVER.<br /><br />This is a beautiful BB Cream that works really well on aging skin, so I imagine it would be a dream on younger skin,  perfect or textured alike.  One other thing I noticed is that at the end of the day I still hardly noticed I was wearing makeup.  And when I washed it off my skin felt and looked pretty good.  It wasn't dried out and didn't have that worn out look that I've gotten used to seeing after a full day in makeup.

Icy silver, gold, a plummy/mauve, and a very deep midnight blue.  This shine factor on these packs quite a punch.....I don't think it comes across in the pictures very well, but they definitely are a metallic shadow.  They all are very opaque, but they can be sheered down a bit if you work with them right after you put them on the eye.  They do dry down fairly quickly so it's not something you can take your time to blend out.  I had the best luck applying them with my finger and blending them that way.  I didn't experience any creasing when I wore them and they don't transfer to other areas once they're dried down.  I've worn them for up to 8 hours and they didn't fade or start to slough off the eye.

I've just turned 50 and it's a constant battle to keep my skin hydrated just due to the aging process.  When you add in cold, dry air outside and hot, dry air inside it just makes it so much more difficult.  I've been adding masks to my skincare routine this winter and they've made a huge difference.  I try to do at LEAST one a week, but as it gets colder I've been using them every few days.  I'll use them at night after I've cleansed and used my prescription skincare and then I'll follow up with my nightly routine.  I love all of the plant extracts loaded into this one along with the niacinamide and hyaluronic acid.  One thing to keep in mind though is that if you're using this (or anything with hyaluronic acid, really) and you're in a dry climate you need to make sure you provide additional moisture for the HA to bind to.  It's why I use this one at night since I keep a humidifier running on my bedside table that pumps that moisture into the air.  In addition to the hydration it also does a great job of noticeably minimizing the appearance of some of larger pores on my face which of course makes my skin look firmer and smoother.\nReview Title: Loaded with hydration & plant extracts that my skin NEEDS during the winter months!!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: EASYDEW Fill Up Volume Spot 0.67 fl oz -Anti-Aging Filler Spot Good for Topical Wrinkle Care with Hyaluronic Acid I Moisturizer with Instant Filling Effect and Skin Renewal | For Topical Area\nReview Date: 2021/01/28\nStore: EASYDEW\nAverage Rating: 4.1\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'EASYDEW', 'Scent': 'Aloe Vera', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Active Ingredients': 'Hyaluronic acid', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Product Dimensions': '1.46 x 0.91 x 5.71 inches; 1.41 Ounces'}\nReview Text: Generally, I love EasyDew products and they always seem to deliver what they promise.  That said, this product was a serious letdown and a bit gimmicky, in my opinion.  The delivery system of the product was completely unnecessary and did absolutely nothing to help with product placement.  The use of growth factor along with the claims to provide filling of lines and wrinkles instantly was where my disappointment came in.  Mostly because it did NOT do what it claimed.  The product is a clear gel that absorbs into the skin and does provide some hydration.  However, I think that's mostly down to the use of the hyaluronic acid it contains, which becomes a problem for me to use in my daytime skincare because I live in an absurdly DRY climate in the winter months and hyaluronic acid without access to moisture in the air or in the form of other products means it's going to suck the moisture from the surrounding tissues.....which means you end up with a VERY dry, wrinkly looking area anywhere you put this.  As for the EGF it contains, there are some studies that show it does help with repeated use OVER TIME, but it does not magically erase lines and wrinkles, and certainly not in the formulation offered here.  I feel like it's a case of a very good company, with very good skincare products that sadly made a mistake in caving into the \"quick fix\" trend so many other companies have.

Anything to get us out the door looking somewhat put together with the least amount of time involved is the goal.  If you're looking for a quick eyeshadow look that takes next to no time these are one answer.  Cream eyeshadow on one end and a brush on the other.  The brush is surprisingly usable, but since I've got older eyes (which means older skin that needs to be babied) I just use one of mine.  They go on pretty smooth and creamy.  Not a ton of pigment on the first pass, but it's very buildable.  The swatches on my arm are 2 passes of each color.  They also blend out really well.  I put a couple passes on my lower lid and blend it up into my crease and I'm good to go.  There is a bit of shimmer in this one, but it's not overwhelming.  Just a bit of sparkle that looks good even on aging eyes.  They make it through the whole day, but I did notice some creasing and breakdown after about 6-8 hours.  Not a lot, just enough to be noticeable.

Initially I wanted to use this when I microneedle (machine, not roller) and as part of my aftercare for plasma fibroblasting.  And I loved the results.  So much so that I started using it with my other serums in my nightly skincare routine.  I've noticed increased hydration (or more accurately an increase in the retention of hydration) in my skin.  There's also been an increase in the firmness of the skin, which I can't say is down to this product alone.  I'm sure it's because I'm using it in conjunction with the microneedling and plasma treatments, but it's definitely adding to the overall outcome that I'm loving.  The research available on EGF is plentiful and something that makes sense to me as far as an anti-aging ingredient.  So much of the info surrounding ingredients is mostly hype and very little science or actual research.

Notable highlights include bronzers that create a natural sun-kissed glow, effective skincare solutions like moisturizers and ampoules that enhance hydration and skin tone, and innovative shower tools that excelled beyond their intended use. Many products praised their ease of use and impressive results, such as effective facial masks and lightweight BB creams that adapt well to sensitive skin. Users appreciated quality craftsmanship, like durable glass spray bottles and hands-free beauty tools that catered to their needs.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nSome products fell short of expectations, often due to misleading claims or performance issues. For instance, an eyeliner and eyelash kit failed to meet the user's needs as it lacked magnetic lash features, leading to disappointment. The anti-aging filler was viewed as gimmicky and ineffective, particularly in dry climates where it did not perform well. Additionally, experiences with certain creams showed inconsistency in results depending on their compatibility with other products. The overall quality control and functionality of some items did not align with user hopes and needs.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user's purchase history reflects a mixed bag of positive and negative experiences. Many products successfully offered convenience, effectiveness, and favorable results, particularly in skincare and beauty applications that enhance overall aesthetics. However, misalignments between product performance and user expectations\u2014especially with specific beauty tools and treatments\u2014indicated challenges. Generally, while the user enjoys discovering quality items, some products did not deliver the promised results, showcasing a need for careful evaluation prior to future purchases.",
