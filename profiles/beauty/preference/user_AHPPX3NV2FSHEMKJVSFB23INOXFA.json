Straight out of the pack, it looks really nice. It had great parting space . Once I started combing through it, I realized that the hair on the lace part is shorter than the rest of the hair. Because of that, it makes the hair look very damaged. It has a ton of short hairs. You cannot straighten those to look smooth. Even with a wax stick, it didn\u2019t help them.\nReview Title: Not the best\nRating: 3.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: 13x4 Body Wave HD Lace Front Wigs Human Hair Wigs for Black Women Pre Plucked with Baby Hair 180% Density Natural Hairline Body Wave Transparent Lace Frontal Wigs Natural Color (18 Inch, natural color)\nReview Date: 2022/07/13\nStore: GRACE PLUS\nAverage Rating: 3.6\nProduct Details: {'Material': 'Human', 'Hair Type': 'Wavy', 'Special Feature': 'Tangle Free', 'Brand': 'GRACE PLUS', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Package Dimensions': '10.31 x 8.15 x 3.43 inches; 9.91 Ounces'}\nReview Text: Sheds way too much.

  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user has expressed satisfaction with several products, particularly in terms of quality and effectiveness. Positive experiences highlight the softness and accuracy of descriptions, indicating products that meet expectations. Reviews noted the good fit and attractive appearance of wigs, as well as the pleasant interaction with false eyelashes that deliver desired effects. The cleansing oil also received praise for its ability to effectively remove makeup without causing breakouts, showcasing a trend towards appreciating well-constructed and functional beauty products.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nConversely, the user encountered significant disappointment with multiple purchases. Key issues included poor quality, such as wigs that were not as described, shedding excessively, or not pre-plucked as promised. Some products were criticized for misleading color representation, leading to dissatisfaction. Specific complaints about the construction of wigs, including uneven lengths and large knots, indicate a trend toward frustration with inadequate quality control. Overall, these experiences reflect a growing concern regarding the reliability of product claims.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user's shopping experience yielded a mix of satisfaction and dissatisfaction. Positive interactions centered around products that performed well and matched their descriptions, leading to repeat purchases in some categories. However, substantial negative experiences\u2014particularly regarding wig quality and misrepresentation\u2014highlight the need for improvements in product accuracy and quality assurance. The balance of these experiences suggests that while the user finds value in some products, inconsistent quality and fulfillment of claims remain significant concerns that could impact future purchasing decisions.",
