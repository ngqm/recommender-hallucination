It comes out of the bottle looking like a white colored moisturizer.  When applied to the face, it immediately begins to blend with the color of the skin right before your eyes.  It has somewhat of a weird smell if you put your nose up to the bottle.  I didn't notice it once I applied or throughout the day.  This makeup does not come off onto your clothes like regular foundation.  It comes off the same way it went on.  When applying it, it goes on more like moisturizer then makeup.  Its got SPF in it so it takes an extra swipe or two to get it to completely blend in but when it does its so lightweight, you don't even notice its there. It just leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth.  Oh and you don't get that later in the day shiney look with this makeup.

The first time I used it, I could immediately see the difference.  It says you must apply it and wait expressionless for the 2 minutes after but I didn't even have to wait two minutes to see that there was a noticeable difference.<br />Its easy to use, you just clip the plastic tip off and apply.  There isn't a noticeable scent and the texture is soft and goes on smoothly but seems to soak in more abruptly then other eye creams.  When I say abruptly, I mean it kind of almost begins to feel chalky or glue-ish when it begins to soak in.

The texture reminds me of a light moisturizer which is different.  I also like that I can build it up for more coverage so on days when I don't need as much, I don't use as much and vise versa!  it is a nice change of pace.  It doesnt have a smell that I noticed at all or much of a color to it so it won't stain anything if you have an accident.  It did seem to 'hold' my makeup on well throughout the day into the early evening.

Much to both of our surprises, it immediately began showing noticeable results on the first application.  When I say immediate, I mean right after we applied it our skin was much softer.  It wasn't that noticeable on the areas that were already healthy and soft.  The areas with cracked or excessively dry skin were immediately transformed into soft and moisturized skin.  It feels kind of tingly and minty going on also.<br />As far as the smell goes, its not noticeable unless you are trying to smell it which I probably wouldn't because what I can smell of it, I didn't really hate it but I definitely wasn't into it either.  It's a strange rusted orange color but does not leave stains on anything because it soaks into fabric/clothes just as regular lotion does.  The texture is a nice, thick one but considering, it soaks into the skin fairly fast.  Actually quicker then most other thick creams used for this purpose.\nReview Title: Immediate Results...\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Body Wax Strips, Hair Removal Waxing Strips for Face Legs Underarms Brazilian Bikini Women with 40 Count Cold Wax Strips and 5 Post Wipes\nReview Date: 2020/02/06\nStore: CARETHYS\nAverage Rating: 3.2\nProduct Details: {'Item Form': 'Strip', 'Brand': 'CARETHYS', 'Number of Items': '50', 'Unit Count': '80 Count', 'Use for': 'Legs, Face', 'Package Dimensions': '7.6 x 5.9 x 0.8 inches; 4.8 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I purchased these body wax strips and began using them only a few days after letting my hair grow out.  I didn't think it would be long enough because I could barely see it with a lighted mirror but it was.  It took a lot less time then I assumed it would and it didn't hurt much at all.  The results were better then I had imagined.  My skin was left soft and smooth.  It took me 30 minutes my first time using them on my face and decollate area.  They are very easy to cut into smaller pieces with a regular kitchen scissors but make sure to clean it off with soap and water afterwards.<br />Things to remember when using...really get the wax warm before applying (I used a space heater set on low instead of warming the wax in my hands for 30 seconds prior to using).  It will help the wax grip to the hair better so you will get better results.  When pulling the paper off of skin, always pull up and not out against the way the hair is growing.

The clear containers also is a great feature too!\nReview Title: Makeup concealer\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: W-Airfit Primer Face Makeup Base Pink Isolation Cream Invisible Pore,Cover Acne Marks,Smooth Skin,Oil Control Moisturizing Essence Concealer Foundation (1 pack)\nReview Date: 2019/12/23\nStore: Lofu\nAverage Rating: 3.6\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Lofu', 'Product Benefits': 'Oil Control', 'Coverage': 'Lightweight,Medium', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Skin Type': 'Dry Skin,Oily', 'Package Dimensions': '5.16 x 1.38 x 0.94 inches; 1.66 Ounces', 'UPC': '791352429549'}\nReview Text: I was surprised by how lightweight this primer is.  The texture reminds me of a light moisturizer which is different.  I also like that I can build it up for more coverage so on days when I don't need as much, I don't use as much and vise versa!  it is a nice change of pace.  It doesnt have a smell that I noticed at all or much of a color to it so it won't stain anything if you have an accident.  It did seem to 'hold' my makeup on well throughout the day into the early evening.  Although I am used to primers that have more of a pore minimizing effect to them, this is still a good value for the money.\nReview Title: Lightweight Primer\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Moisturising Cream, Body and Face Moisturizer for Dry Skin, Acne Cream, 2PC\nReview Date: 2019/12/29\nStore: Cherioll\nAverage Rating: 4.2\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'Cherioll', 'Item Form': 'Cream', 'Unit Count': '1.1 Ounce', 'Number of Items': '2', 'Use for': 'Whole Body, Face', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '5 x 1.65 x 1 inches; 1.41 Ounces', 'UPC': '041388002378 746827880882', 'Manufacturer': 'Cherioll'}\nReview Text: The wintertime is so drying & my dad hands tend to get such bad dry skin that it cracks, exposing painful lesions all over.<br />We both started using it the first day it arrived.  Much to both of our surprises, it immediately began showing noticeable results on the first application.  When I say immediate, I mean right after we applied it our skin was much softer.  It wasn't that noticeable on the areas that were already healthy and soft.  The areas with cracked or excessively dry skin were immediately transformed into soft and moisturized skin.  It feels kind of tingly and minty going on also.<br />As far as the smell goes, its not noticeable unless you are trying to smell it which I probably wouldn't because what I can smell of it, I didn't really hate it but I definitely wasn't into it either.  It's a strange rusted orange color but does not leave stains on anything because it soaks into fabric/clothes just as regular lotion does.  The texture is a nice, thick one but considering, it soaks into the skin fairly fast.  Actually quicker then most other thick creams used for this purpose.\nReview Title: Immediate Results...\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Body Wax Strips, Hair Removal Waxing Strips for Face Legs Underarms Brazilian Bikini Women with 40 Count Cold Wax Strips and 5 Post Wipes\nReview Date: 2020/02/06\nStore: CARETHYS\nAverage Rating: 3.2\nProduct Details: {'Item Form': 'Strip', 'Brand': 'CARETHYS', 'Number of Items': '50', 'Unit Count': '80 Count', 'Use for': 'Legs, Face', 'Package Dimensions': '7.6 x 5.9 x 0.8 inches; 4.8 Ounces'}\nReview Text: I purchased these body wax strips and began using them only a few days after letting my hair grow out.  I didn't think it would be long enough because I could barely see it with a lighted mirror but it was.  It took a lot less time then I assumed it would and it didn't hurt much at all.  The results were better then I had imagined.  My skin was left soft and smooth.  It took me 30 minutes my first time using them on my face and decollate area.  They are very easy to cut into smaller pieces with a regular kitchen scissors but make sure to clean it off with soap and water afterwards.<br />Things to remember when using...really get the wax warm before applying (I used a space heater set on low instead of warming the wax in my hands for 30 seconds prior to using).  It will help the wax grip to the hair better so you will get better results.  When pulling the paper off of skin, always pull up and not out against the way the hair is growing.  Use one hand to hold the skin taught before pulling up on the paper.  This will also help you get more effective results.\nReview Title: Fast & Effective...\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: goPure ACTIVES Retinol Serum for Face - Anti Aging Serum, Face Serum, Eye Serum with Clinically Proven Bakuchiol Oil - Pore Minimizer Facial Serum and Dark Spot Remover for Face - 1oz\nReview Date: 2020/07/08\nStore: goPure\nAverage Rating: 4.2\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '4.1 x 1.5 x 1.4 inches; 1 Ounces', 'UPC': '709618228485'}\nReview Text: I have been pleasantly surprised by this product.

The heads can be switched out with the twist of the top then you just pop the other one on with another twist.  So it is easy enough to use plus it is wireless!  We didn't need to recharge it for almost 30 days exactly!  So it definitely holds a good charge and it doesn't take long to fully charge.

They are so unique and definitely get noticed every single time you take them out and use them!  My friends always have to touch them and hold them because just looking at them isn't enough.  They want one for themselves with each new tube design they see.  I am beginning to realize these would be a great idea for a DIY home based business.  They are so unique and they actually are a good quality product.  I am not sure how many times the lip brush can be used over and over again but I am looking into replacing them and it doesn't look like it will be a problem.\nReview Title: Super Cute!!!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n        Format your response exactly as follows:\n        POSITIVE SUMMARY:\n        [Your positive summary here]\n\n        NEGATIVE SUMMARY:\n        [Your negative summary here]\n\n        OVERALL SUMMARY:\n        [Your overall summary here]",

Now that they are made with bamboo, they are so much softer and have better glidability on the skin.  They also seem to wash better than the older versions.  There is nothing worse than having brand new cotton rounds that look all dingy and gross from makeup removing.  These also come with a convenient bag that they can be washed in.
