  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user has expressed satisfaction with their fragrance purchase, highlighting a preference for specific scents, which contributed to a positive overall experience. The high rating for the fragrance indicates a strong appreciation for the product's appeal and quality. The user also found the coffret set to be sought after and well received, reflecting a trend of enjoyable scent combinations.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user experienced dissatisfaction with the bath pillow, primarily due to its inability to withstand use in a wet environment. Complaints included discoloration and mildew development, which detracted from the product\u2019s effectiveness and usability. There was an expectation for better material performance, leading to lower satisfaction ratings.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user's shopping experience showcases a clear fondness for specific fragrances, which resulted in positive feedback and high ratings for those products. Conversely, an issue arose with a bath pillow that prompted notable criticism, mainly focused on its durability and maintenance challenges. This contrast highlights a diverse experience where certain products led to joy and others to disappointment, indicating a mix of satisfaction and frustration within the user's purchase history.",
