Being honest - when I first started working with gel I wasn't sure if I liked it or not, so a kit like this would have been super helpful.<br /><br />The gels themselves have nice self leveling.  The colors are nicely pigmented two coaters.  They are fairly tacky, so make sure you put on a top coat (which I always recommend) or be prepared to wipe down with alcohol.  They do take a bit longer to set, but they do set nicely.<br /><br />The sequins are a nice touch, and the top coat and base coats are very close quality to others I have (similar to Beetles).  The top coat isn't quite a no wipe, but it shines up beautifully with a little bit of alcohol.<br /><br />The tools are perfect, and the polygel colors are beautiful.  They set nicely, and file perfectly.  The duoforms are in lots of good sizes, so I don't have any issues finding the perfect sizes (my hands are weird, each finger has different size which is annoying to need 10 different sizes, but hey.<br /><br />I don't quite understand why there's the nail foils since there's no glue for the foils.  The top coat isn't quite tacky enough for foils.  The striping tape is a very nice touch.<br /><br />The light works fairly well.  The onyl problem is its a one button, so its only 45 seconds or 60 seconds.  I have a lot of other lights, so while I was happy to try this one out, and it'll be great for travel, I like my bigger lights for other  daily use.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great little kit for trying out gels and polygels.  I would advise that you pick up more files and a bigger light in the future with more settings and timers, but overall, this is great for getting started.  The travel case fits everything nicely, and makes it convenient to take on vacation.

I am TERRIBLE at it.  I struggle with a curling iron, and never seem to get uniform curls.

Now I take a shower before I go to bed, apply the curlers with the easy to use wand, and go to bed.  By the morning I can pull these out of my hair easily, and find that I have beautiful tight curls that I can set with hair spray or brush lightly before applying spray.  If I do not apply spray they last for about 2 hours, but if I apply a good light weight hairspray they last the entire workday.  I also do not have any issues with any kinks or lines in the curls, even at the top, which is a HUGE plus.<br /><br />Overall these units apply easily to my damp hair using the attached wand, and curl the hair nicely.\nReview Title: Hello curls!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Glitter Poly Nail Gel Extensions Builder Gel UV/LED Soak Off Acrylic Fashion Gel Polish Set for Nails Beginner DIY Nail Art at Home 8 colors-15g (Pink series)\nReview Date: 2020/10/23\nStore: MIZHSE\nAverage Rating: 4.2\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'MIZHSE', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '478.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '9', 'Package Dimensions': '9.76 x 4.88 x 1.42 inches; 12.8 Ounces'}\nReview Text: This polygel set is surprisingly delightful.  When it comes to the gels alone: they have a very nice smooth texture that is easy to manipulate and use.  They fill the dual forms nicely, but also are able to move and smooth well enough to use the nail extension wraps instead.  The have enough give in them to allow for some self leveling, and dry easily in about 60-90 seconds a side (I always dry under LED on the top then flip the finger and get the underside of the extension just to make sure it solidifies perfectly).  Once dry, they are able to very nicely file down and smooth in place, which is great considering some are truly jam backed with various sized glitters.  They need a good wipe down with alcohol after cooking though, having a fair amount of tacky surface, but that's fine with me.<br /><br />The cremes are fairly solid in color, and opaque.  I love the various pinks, and the white is a nice solid color that isn't too harsh making it perfect for a nice soft french tip.  The #03 pink is a great neutral and classic pink color, which is great for either a base color for extensions or for turning into a french tip with the white.<br /><br />As for the glitters, they are nice and shiny.  My only complaint is I wish the matrixes had a touch more color added to them.  The various colors of glitters make it clear what the effect/color  should be, I just think they would pack a bit more punch if there was a bit more dye in the matrix.<br /><br />Overall, this is a nice set.  Keep in mind, all the bottles are small except for the #3 pink.  But its a nice little starter kit, and the glitter is a nice addition.  I'll definitely keep these in mind going forwards!\nReview Title: Easy to use, gorgeous colors\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: 5pcs Nail Art Liner Brushes, Lystaii Dual-ended Painting Nail Design Brush Pen Include Liner Brushes and Dotting Pen Nail Art Point Drill Drawing Brush Double Ended Dotting Tools Set 5,7,9,11,14mm\nReview Date: 2020/10/25\nStore: Lystaii\nAverage Rating: 4.0\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '9.41 x 3.86 x 0.75 inches; 1.41 Ounces'}\nReview Text: These brushes are absolutely ideal for getting started in nail art.

By the morning I can pull these out of my hair easily, and find that I have beautiful tight curls that I can set with hair spray or brush lightly before applying spray.  If I do not apply spray they last for about 2 hours, but if I apply a good light weight hairspray they last the entire workday.  I also do not have any issues with any kinks or lines in the curls, even at the top, which is a HUGE plus.<br /><br />Overall these units apply easily to my damp hair using the attached wand, and curl the hair nicely.\nReview Title: Hello curls!\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Glitter Poly Nail Gel Extensions Builder Gel UV/LED Soak Off Acrylic Fashion Gel Polish Set for Nails Beginner DIY Nail Art at Home 8 colors-15g (Pink series)\nReview Date: 2020/10/23\nStore: MIZHSE\nAverage Rating: 4.2\nProduct Details: {'Brand': 'MIZHSE', 'Item Form': 'Gel', 'Finish Type': 'Shimmery', 'Material Feature': 'Non-Toxic, Cruelty Free', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Unit Count': '478.00 Count', 'Number of Items': '9', 'Package Dimensions': '9.76 x 4.88 x 1.42 inches; 12.8 Ounces'}\nReview Text: This polygel set is surprisingly delightful.  When it comes to the gels alone: they have a very nice smooth texture that is easy to manipulate and use.  They fill the dual forms nicely, but also are able to move and smooth well enough to use the nail extension wraps instead.  The have enough give in them to allow for some self leveling, and dry easily in about 60-90 seconds a side (I always dry under LED on the top then flip the finger and get the underside of the extension just to make sure it solidifies perfectly).  Once dry, they are able to very nicely file down and smooth in place, which is great considering some are truly jam backed with various sized glitters.  They need a good wipe down with alcohol after cooking though, having a fair amount of tacky surface, but that's fine with me.<br /><br />The cremes are fairly solid in color, and opaque.  I love the various pinks, and the white is a nice solid color that isn't too harsh making it perfect for a nice soft french tip.  The #03 pink is a great neutral and classic pink color, which is great for either a base color for extensions or for turning into a french tip with the white.<br /><br />As for the glitters, they are nice and shiny.  My only complaint is I wish the matrixes had a touch more color added to them.  The various colors of glitters make it clear what the effect/color  should be, I just think they would pack a bit more punch if there was a bit more dye in the matrix.<br /><br />Overall, this is a nice set.  Keep in mind, all the bottles are small except for the #3 pink.  But its a nice little starter kit, and the glitter is a nice addition.  I'll definitely keep these in mind going forwards!\nReview Title: Easy to use, gorgeous colors\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: 5pcs Nail Art Liner Brushes, Lystaii Dual-ended Painting Nail Design Brush Pen Include Liner Brushes and Dotting Pen Nail Art Point Drill Drawing Brush Double Ended Dotting Tools Set 5,7,9,11,14mm\nReview Date: 2020/10/25\nStore: Lystaii\nAverage Rating: 4.0\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '9.41 x 3.86 x 0.75 inches; 1.41 Ounces'}\nReview Text: These brushes are absolutely ideal for getting started in nail art. Beyond a doubt, these are great additions to any nail art collection.<br /><br />The various dotter sizes make dotticures a great option for anyone, and these hold up beautifully.<br /><br />The bristle heads are thin, great quality and good the bristles well. I love the small detail brush which is my new go to for reverse stamping nail art which I do a LOT.<br /><br />The edges do discolor a bit if you use acetone on the actual handle. I would suggest using non acetone cleaner on brushes (always!). These brushes have nice plastic to surround the bristles, which I would suggest keeping to make sure they always dry in the right shape.<br /><br />Overall, I love these brushes. They are comparable to my more expensive brushes, and have a great variety for striping, detailing, etc. there\u2019s also a nice variety of dotting tools.\nReview Title: Great options, and nice quality\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n        Format your response exactly as follows:\n        POSITIVE SUMMARY:\n        [Your positive summary here]\n\n        NEGATIVE SUMMARY:\n        [Your negative summary here]\n\n        OVERALL SUMMARY:\n        [Your overall summary here]",

With a little solution, it softens up and becomes the perfect shape to apply my acrylic to the nail or make little acrylic designs to put onto the nail (such as petals).<br /><br />It has a good handle and weight to it, and the bristles are firmly in place (i.e. I haven't found any bristles coming loose).  Overall its a great acrylic brush, that dries nicely and stays in form.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend!",
