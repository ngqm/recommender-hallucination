It is single layered so you won't get too warm wearing it. The part that goes behind the back of your head is narrower than the part that goes above your forehead. I wished the forehead part was narrower. I found the button placement fine for my mask (but it would be easy to adjust to your liking with some basic sewing skills). I like that the headband is snug but not uncomfortable. It does slide up a little in the back after a while. Something anti slip on the back would be nice to help keep the headband in place. It may be too tight if you have a larger head. The only thing I don't really like is the large logo. If it couldn't be eliminated it should be smaller or the color of the font be darker so it's not as obvious. Personally, I like the black because it blends into my hair for an inconspicuous look.\nReview Title: Nice headband material and your ears will thank you.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: BJ\u00d6RN HALL Button Knotted Nurse Headbands for Women with Buttons | Ear Saver Headband with buttons | Headband with Buttons for Face Mask for Nurses & Doctors | Elastic Hair Band with Buttons | Protect Your Ears with this Headband | Floral Blue\nReview Date: 2020/08/24\nStore: Bj\u00f6rn Hall\nAverage Rating: 4.0\nProduct Details: {'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Brand': 'Bj\u00f6rn Hall', 'Size': 'One Size', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '4.29 x 3.11 x 1.61 inches; 1.34 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'KAL-500'}\nReview Text: This is a cute twisted knot headband.

I like the design of this roller, it's compact and rolls pretty smoothly for the most part. I did wash the stone and it absorbs water quickly yet the stone didn't feel wet. I did leave it to dry overnight before replacing it back into the holder. I appreciate having an extra stone so when one is washed and waiting to dry, I have another one I can pop into the holder and use right away. This came packaged in a satin drawstring pouch.

These reusable Q-tips have different ends for different tasks. The tips feel secure on the stick. I tried pulling them off and I couldn't so that's a good safety feature. Due to the material, I can't use these with acetone nail polish remover and that's what I like to use Q-tips for. Also these are not absorbent so that's another downfall. Unfortunately I won't be relying solely on these LastSwab. Disposable Q-tips are still more versatile but at least I can decrease the usage of them in combination with the LastSwab. I wished these swabs came in a carrying case. The product description mentioned a plastic case. I did see ones with a case but that's a different product.

I appreciate having an extra stone so when one is washed and waiting to dry, I have another one I can pop into the holder and use right away. This came packaged in a satin drawstring pouch. This is an interesting concept, will definitely get some stares if I just whipped this out at my desk at work and rubbed it all over my oily spots.\nReusable instant facial oil absorber\nReusable Qtips 2x - Cotton Swabs for Ears Wax Removal and Pointed Q tips for Makeup Removal in Green LastSwab\u00ae\nLastSwab\n{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '4.33 x 0.47 x 1.77 inches; 0.53 Ounces'}\nI like idea of using less single use items. These reusable Q-tips have different ends for different tasks. The tips feel secure on the stick. I tried pulling them off and I couldn't so that's a good safety feature. Due to the material, I can't use these with acetone nail polish remover and that's what I like to use Q-tips for. Also these are not absorbent so that's another downfall. Unfortunately I won't be relying solely on these LastSwab. Disposable Q-tips are still more versatile but at least I can decrease the usage of them in combination with the LastSwab. I wished these swabs came in a carrying case. The product description mentioned a plastic case. I did see ones with a case but that's a different product. I wasn't expecting to receive a case with this set anyway based on the seller's photos.\nReusable but it can't do everything a disposable Q-tip can do",

It is single layered so you won't get too warm wearing it. The part that goes behind the back of your head is narrower than the part that goes above your forehead. I wished the forehead part was narrower. I found the button placement fine for my mask (but it would be easy to adjust to your liking with some basic sewing skills). I like that the headband is snug but not uncomfortable. It does slide up a little in the back after a while. Something anti slip on the back would be nice to help keep the headband in place. It may be too tight if you have a larger head. The only thing I don't really like is the large logo. If it couldn't be eliminated it should be smaller or the color of the font be darker so it's not as obvious. Personally, I like the black because it blends into my hair for an inconspicuous look.\nReview Title: Nice headband material and your ears will thank you.\nRating: 4.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: BJ\u00d6RN HALL Button Knotted Nurse Headbands for Women with Buttons | Ear Saver Headband with buttons | Headband with Buttons for Face Mask for Nurses & Doctors | Elastic Hair Band with Buttons | Protect Your Ears with this Headband | Floral Blue\nReview Date: 2020/08/24\nStore: Bj\u00f6rn Hall\nAverage Rating: 4.0\nProduct Details: {'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Number of Items': '1', 'Brand': 'Bj\u00f6rn Hall', 'Size': 'One Size', 'Unit Count': '1.00 Count', 'Package Dimensions': '4.29 x 3.11 x 1.61 inches; 1.34 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'KAL-500'}\nReview Text: This is a cute twisted knot headband.

The massaging feature is nice and relaxing. There is a AA battery already installed (I didn't know that until I just happened to turn it on and it started vibrating). I wish the on/off was actually printed or engraved onto the handle. It's just a little gold sticker that could easily fall off if wet or from regular use. To remove/replace the battery you have to turn it to the \"on\" position and keep turning until the cap comes off. I wish the large roller actually rolled easily. The stone is smooth so it does glide over my skin nicely and with the vibration on, I can't even tell that the stone isn't actually rolling. The smaller stone attachment is nice to use around the eye area and that stone is also smooth.

They are soft and flexible. I am using them for hand sanitizer but you could use it for anything (like shampoo, body wash, hand soap, etc). So far there has not been any leaks but I wished there was an additional silicone anti-leak flap where the product comes out (like on certain ketchup or honey bottles) so the more liquidy contents doesn't flow right out when you open the cap. I usually turn the bottle cap side up for a few seconds so the contents are away from the cap before I open and then I turn it upside down to squeeze out. I like the retractable clip (it's essentially an identification badge clip or a keychain). Included are small carabiner clips which will allow you to hook the bottle to the retractable clip. It does look a little bulky with that setup but it works. At least you can use all 3 pieces separately if needed and it wasn't made for just one purpose.

My set came with everything that's pictured in the description. The whole case is silicone but I wish it had a normal hinge so that it can stay open but it's just a thin piece of silicone. Yes, there is a kick stand that you can pull out to keep the mirror/lid open at an angle. I don't plan on using this like a makeup compact so that doesn't really bother me. The variety of tips that come with this set is nice and you get extra tips. It does take a little bit of effort to pull the tip off (which is a good thing). I'm not sure what the tweezers are for, maybe it's to pull the tips off the stick but I found it was just easier to pull it off with my fingers. The brush that comes in this set seems a bit large for cleaning parts that are tiny. A smaller brush with shorter and more rigid bristles would've been better. They are easy<br />enough to clean with soap and water. Just be sure to dry everything completely before putting it back in the case.

I thought I had a defective one since nothing was coming out. The plunger on the syringe doesn't press down all the way as one would expect, it goes down less than using a click pen. There's no way to open the thing up to get the gel out either. I almost gave up but I kept clicking and finally the gel was coming out. I applied it to a pimple 3 nights in a row but unfortunately nothing happened. I'm not sure if I didn't have the right type of pimple since it never came to a head and it's more cystic. I'll try again on a different type of pimple. The gel is best used at bedtime because it leaves a slightly sticky feeling on the pimple (instructions say to apply it directly to the pimple and not to spread it). Each night that I used it, I had to continuously press the plunger only for a tiny amount of gel to come out.

  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user has generally enjoyed their purchases, particularly highlighting the comfort and style of headbands, which effectively alleviate discomfort from wearing face masks. The quality and relaxing features of facial massagers were also appreciated, with specific mention of their soothing and cooling effects on the skin. The versatility of travel bottles and the eco-friendliness of reusable silicone products resonated positively, as did the decorative and functional aspects of items like the glass dish and the cute aesthetic of the packaging. Overall, the user expressed satisfaction with product materials, offering a blend of functionality and style.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nConversely, there were several aspects that the user found disappointing. Issues with product functionality included difficulty with a plunger mechanism and inadequate sizing for some headbands, leading to concerns over comfort and fit. There were complaints about certain items being too bulky or shedding hair, along with the lack of effective sealing mechanisms on travel bottles, which caused usability concerns. Additionally, the performance of reusable cotton swabs fell short of user expectations, with limitations in versatility and utility compared to traditional disposable options.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user's overall shopping experience combines both positive and negative elements. While they appreciated the comfort, aesthetics, and quality of various products, there were notable shortcomings in functionality and design that resulted in frustration. The positive feedback underscores a preference for products that enhance comfort and offer unique designs, yet the negative experiences reveal an openness to improvement in product usability and efficiency. This mixed experience suggests a thoughtful approach to future purchases, balancing desirable features with practical performance.",

These are glass bottles but instead of the annoying dropper cap, these serums are a gel-like consistency that is pumped out instead. No dripping serums wasted. It does have a bland scent which I'm not too crazy about but that's just from smelling it from the bottle. I can't smell it when it's on my face which is good. The serums all absorb quickly into my skin and they don't feel greasy. I haven't experienced any adverse skin reaction. After application I can see my skin glowing, when I first used it my skin became a little pink but it went away quickly. It was probably just my skin adjusting to the retinol and it doesn't happen anymore since I've been using it for a few nights now. I'm pretty happy with this set and it's reasonably priced if you're just starting to venture into the anti-aging skin care regimen.",
