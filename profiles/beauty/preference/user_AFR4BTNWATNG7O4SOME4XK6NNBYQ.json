First of all these soap sets were on my Wish-list for sometime. They arrived today and just like they are pictured...The big bar is truly huge..! Reminds me of a container of butter that you find in the super market. The scents are very nice and they arrived un broken or switched out due to a shortage in shipping. The larger bar I will use sometime next year and the smaller one will go in my soap bowl,that I plan on using this weekend.\nReview Title: Finally sitting on the dock of the Bay..\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Commonwealth Argan Oil Moisturizing Bath Bar 12 Oz Boxed by CST\nReview Date: 2015/12/29\nStore: Commonwealth Soap & Toiletries\nAverage Rating: 4.5\nProduct Details: {'Item Form': 'Bar', 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Brand': 'Commonwealth Soap & Toiletries', 'Age Range (Description)': 'Adult', 'Number of Items': '1'}\nReview Text: I bought this bar of soap as a gift for my hair stylist and I have used Common Wealth bar soaps in the past. They normally keep them at hotels like Marriot,Hilton or other 3 star lodge's. I purchased  a Cotton,Pineapple from Amazon and the Sugar scented one's from their company website...The bars are really big and they last for more than a month or more. They make a wonderful gift and certain scent's have a special box that encases the soaps..\nReview Title: A gift...in deed\nRating: 5.0\n--------------------------------------------------\n=== Purchase Information ===\nProduct Title: Castelbel Porto Tropical Garden Luxury Bath Bar 10.5 Oz Gift Wrapped\nReview Date: 2016/01/06\nStore: Castelbel Porto\nAverage Rating: 5.0\nProduct Details: {'Package Dimensions': '5.5 x 3.6 x 1.8 inches; 7.2 Ounces', 'UPC': '737488213553'}\nReview Text: I bought this bar as a Christmas gift for a relative..I have used this brand in the past. The packaging is rather fancy but the scents are so delicious . They remind me of cocktails they serve in the Hawaiian islands..The bars are a full size 10.5 oz and you can share these with a male spouse. Most male's tend to avoid scented soaps especially if they linger? To bad I didn't buy this one for myself but my cousin should enjoy this soap. Maybe she will return the favor and buy me the same brand?

  "raw_response": "POSITIVE SUMMARY:\nThe user's shopping experience reflects a consistent appreciation for high-quality bath products. They particularly enjoy rich, luxurious scents and effective moisturizing properties across various soap bars. The fragrance of jasmine and rose, in particular, stands out as a favorite, emphasizing the user\u2019s preference for floral aromas. Products from certain brands are noted for their creamy lather and long-lasting quality, contributing to a sense of indulgence. Positive recollections are often tied to personal occasions, such as birthdays, enhancing the sentimental value of their purchases. Reviews indicate a strong inclination towards gifting, highlighting the appealing packaging and thoughtful presentation of these items.\n\nNEGATIVE SUMMARY:\nDespite generally positive feedback, the user has expressed some concerns regarding specific products. One such issue is a noticeable residue left on hair when using a particular moisturizing oil, leading to cautious usage recommendations. Additionally, there are hints of dissatisfaction with some scents, perceived to be overly strong or chemically enhanced. There is a clear trend of searching for products with a balanced fragrance profile, as excessive potency can detract from the overall experience. Lastly, certain products were critiqued for not living up to expectations, suggesting the user approaches new brands with a discerning perspective.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY:\nThe user's purchasing behavior showcases a strong preference for quality bath products, particularly those with pleasing floral scents and moisturizing benefits. Positive experiences highlight the luxury of brands that meet these criteria and the enjoyment of gifting these items. However, some negative aspects, such as concerns about residue and fragrance strength, reveal a critical side to their evaluations. This balanced perspective illustrates a shopper who values both performance and sensory experiences, continually seeking products that fulfill their personal and gifting needs while remaining vigilant against disappointing purchases.",

      "This substantial 8.7-ounce bath bar contains only the finest ingredients - pure vegetable palm oil, glycerin, and rich, moisturizing shea butter. Handmade in Sussex, England, these bars are triple-milled to produce a completely uniform, long-lasting soap. Imbued with carefully chosen Michel Design Works fragrances, every bath will be a luxurious one. Michel Design Works was created by Bruce & Deborah Michel in the early 1980s. The first product was an elaborate \u201cmemory book\u201d called Our Country Diary. Still a favorite today, it is filled with vintage artwork, quirky quotes, notable dates and plenty of room to record all the events of the year. Our Country Diary will become a beautiful record of your family life. When they first created their signature elephant logo, it signified a remembrance of all things special. Although Michel Design Works has greatly expanded into bath & body, home fragrance and decor, when Bruce & Deborah remember and celebrate all of their wonderful customers and the company\u2019s history, it is even more fitting today! Whether you are a new or a long-time friend, we welcome you to enjoy the art, lather up with our English soaps, set an elegant table with napkins, candles, plates, and serveware, and end your day with wonderfully fragrant n bubble bath."
